5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing <b>labour</b> <b>legislation</b> – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E

However, MEPs overwhelmingly voted according to national rather than party lines. Two additional explanations emphasise national characteristics: <b>labour</b> market <b>legislation</b> (national schemes to protect employees against dismissals) and corporate governance issues. <b>Labour</b> market <b>legislation</b> can explain the UK and German MEP votes but not the Swedish and French MEPs votes.

The Federal President was elected for a four year tearm {{in a full}} session of both houses, while Chancellor was elected by the Nationalrat. As no political party ever gained parliamentary majority, Austria was governed by coalitions of conservative Christian Social Party and right-wing Greater German People's Party or Landbund which were more conservative that the first government of Social Democrat Karl Renner of 1919-20, that had established a number of progressive socioeconomic and <b>labour</b> <b>legislations.</b>|$|R

50|$|More recently, a few {{scholars}} have completed a comparative study between states of India with different labour regulations. They compared states of India who have amended <b>labour</b> <b>legislations</b> to grant more flexibility to employers, to those states in India {{that have made}} their labour laws even more rigid and complicated to comply with. These studies find that states with flexible labour laws have grown significantly faster. Flexible labour states {{have been able to}} take advantage of the export opportunities, and the per capita household income has risen much faster in states with flexible labour laws. States with rigid labour laws have led local entrepreneurs to prefer casual workers or contract workers with finite employment time period; in essence, more rigid and inflexible labour law states see increased informal employment.|$|R

2500|$|Although usually {{considered}} as {{an event that}} predates the Angolan War of Independence, some authors consider the Baixa de Cassanje revolt (also known as the [...] "Maria's War") as the initial event of that Conflict. It was however a labour conflict, not related with the claiming for the independence of Angola. The Baixa do Cassanje was a rich agricultural region of the Malanje District, bordering the ex-Belgian Congo, with approximately {{the size of the}} Mainland Portugal, which was the origin of most of the cotton production of Angola. The region's cotton fields were {{in the hands of the}} Cotonang - General Company of the Cottons of Angola, a company mostly held by Belgian capital and which employed many natives. Despite its contribution for the development of the region, Cotonang had been accused several times of disrespecting the <b>labour</b> <b>legislation</b> regarding working conditions of its employees, causing it to become under the investigation of the Portuguese authorities, but with no relevant actions against it being yet taken.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{principal}} terms that accompanies the employment relationship is that the employer will provide a [...] "safe system of work". As the industrial revolution developed, accidents from a hazardous working environment were a front line target for <b>labour</b> <b>legislation,</b> {{as a series of}} Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery, not to mention restrictions on child labour and limits to the working day. These Acts typically targeted particular kinds of workplaces, such as mines, or textile mills, before the more generalised approach took hold now seen in the Factories Act 1961. That applies to any workplace where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because isolated employees lack the technical skill, time, training to litigate, such regulation's primary line of enforcement was through inspectors or agencies before matters went to court. Today the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, is the main law. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities, whose inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Spelling out the general duties found in HSWA 1974, are a set of health and safety regulations, which must also stay in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.|$|E

40|$|The {{only way}} Malawi can ensure {{adequate}} social security coverage to her citizens is {{to extend the}} scope and coverage of social security benefits provided by the <b>labour</b> <b>legislations</b> to all workers as they are more reliable and less burdensome on the poor state.

This will reduce the burden on the state of providing social security to all her citizens as most will be covered by social insurance. It is against this background that this study analyses the Malawian pieces of legislation on social security with the aim of identifying the gaps that are affecting social security coverage to Malawian workers. In doing so, these legislations will be examined against the relevant international conventions specifically the ILO C 102 and the SADC Code.
