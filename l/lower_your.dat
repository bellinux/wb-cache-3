500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best power running backs in NFL history, and was highly regarded by his peers. [...] "Every time you hit him you <b>lower</b> <b>your</b> own IQ," [...] said Redskins linebacker Pete Wysocki. Cornerback Lester Hayes of the Raiders said [...] "Earl Campbell was put on this earth to play football." [...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson. But when you finished a game against Earl, you had to sit in a tub with Epsom salts." [...] Bum Phillips, when asked if Campbell was in a class by himself, quipped, [...] "I dunno. But if he ain't, it don't take long to call the roll." ...|$|E
500|$|After its release, [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday {{and the music}} editor of Televisa Espectáculos were in agreement that the song keeps a musical style similar to her previous album, Mujer Divina, with Agustin Lara's influence being evident. Andrew Casillas of Club Fonograma stated that the song sounds [...] "rich", but resembles Chilean singer-songwriter Camila Moreno, and that even if it [...] "doesn’t sound like a bold step outward for Natalia, there’s certainly no need to <b>lower</b> <b>your</b> expectations". Lissette Corsa, of MTV Iggy, declared that the [...] "staccato strumming" [...] of the track [...] "evokes the huapango rhythm of Veracruz, Mexico, Lafourcade’s hometown". Lafourcade performed the track at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015, where it won Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Alternative Song.|$|E
500|$|The {{games have}} also added {{multiplayer}} modes. [...] Cooperative modes allow two players to play lead and either bass or rhythm guitar {{on the same}} song, working together towards the same score. [...] A competitive Face-Off mode allows two players to play against each other at different difficulty levels, each attempting to earn the best score on a song. Each player plays different portions of the song. There is also a Pro Face-Off mode, where two players battle at the same difficulty level. Unlike standard Face-off, each player attempts to play all of the notes in a song, while still trying to earn the highest score. In Guitar Hero World Tour this was advanced on, as players could play a Pro Face-Off game against each other on any difficulty level, the <b>lower</b> <b>your</b> difficulty, the more points were awarded so a player on a low difficulty could potentially beat a player on a more challenging difficulty. Guitar Hero III introduced Boss Battles, in which two players face off against each other, attempt to collect [...] "distractions" [...] to throw at their opponent, trying to make them fail. [...] With Guitar Hero World Tour, up to four players can play cooperatively on lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals, while a total of eight players can compete in a Battle of the Bands. [...] The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions of the games support multiplayer modes over their respective network services.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its September 1990 US release, Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B-", {{describing}} it as [...] "mildly charming and mostly too broad" [...] and accusing it of overplaying [...] "Dexter's dorkiness {{in the same way}} it overplays the big sex scene, the romantic montage, the breakup scene…" [...] Caryn James of The New York Times wrote [...] "even when its bright theatrical satire gives way to men dressed as nuns dancing in wimples and red sequined shorts, this modest comedy is always wickedly endearing, thanks to the off-kilter characters played by Mr. Goldblum and Emma Thompson as the unlikely woman of his dreams." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "sweet, whimsical and surprisingly intelligent comedy" [...] whose [...] "last third ...turns into a hilarious sendup of the modern musical" [...] that [...] "must be the funniest deliberately bad play in a movie since Mel Brooks' [...] "Springtime for Hitler" [...] in The Producers." [...] The Deseret News called it a [...] "most uneven romantic comedy," [...] saying [...] "If you're a Monty Python fan, <b>lower</b> <b>your</b> expectations a notch.
