40|$|This Essay {{will focus}} on how Canada and the United States have both succeeded and failed in {{adopting}} cooperative approaches to managing ocean fishery resources. A critical factor that has influenced these efforts is the introduction of an international legal construct dictating that States have exclusive sovereign rights respecting all <b>marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> within 200 nautical miles of their shores. Cooperative approaches to managing transboundary <b>marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> between Canada and the United States are necessary for two reasons. First, {{in the case of}} <b>marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources,</b> the resource pays scant attention to human-constructed national boundaries. Put another way, <b>marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> challenge the entire idea of territory and boundaries. Therefore, for proper management of these transboundary resources that benefits both States, cooperation is necessary. Second, unlike respecting land, on salt water, as a result of each State having 200 -nautical-mile zones, Canada and the United States have areas where both States claim exclusive national authority. These are areas where there are disputed maritime boundaries, and they exist between Canada and the United States on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts. Both for proper resource management purposes and for pragmatic 2 ̆ 2 lets-not-fight 2 ̆ 2 purposes, bilateral cooperation is required...|$|R
40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> in the Antarctic {{are managed}} in {{accordance}} {{with a variety of}} cooperative frameworks that have developed in response to specific challenges and political concerns. This paper assesses the compliance and enforcement challenges associated with these frameworks. It presents an overview of the fragmented governance frameworks under which <b>marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> in the Antarctic region are managed and then it identifes compliance and enforcement challenges to the sustainable management of <b>marine</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> in the Antarctic. The extent to which state practice has responded to compliance and enforcement challenges identified is analysed as follows: Are the responses of relevant States consistent with international law? Do the responses create additional legal uncertainties or institutional challenges? Have the responses been criticised as lacking practical effectiveness? It finds that although substantial progress has been made to address compliance and enforcement challenges, there is still a need to clarify the relationships between existing legal institutions, principles and frameworks, in order to consolidate the progress that has been made...|$|R
