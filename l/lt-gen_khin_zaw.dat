40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a geological and mineralogical study of ore metal zonation and distribution at Rosebery Mine. This research programme was carried out to understand the geometry of ore lenses in relationship to the metal zonation {{in order to determine the}} location and trend of possible hydrothermal vents. These vent positions may be used as a guide for exploration of new base and precious metal targets on the E. Z. mining leases. Ore mineral zonation was investigated on different mine level plans and selected E-W cross-sections. Ore metal assay data (Zn, Cu, Ag, Au and Fe) were plotted by "Prime" computer and contoured diagrams for each metal on each selected cross-section were established. The method and approach used in this research programme is presented in the previous interim report (<b>Khin</b> <b>Zaw</b> et al., 1987). In the last section of the report, a continuing study on geological and mineralogical zonation at the south-end of the Rosebery mine is briefly presented and the mineralogy of gold in the Devonian replacement assemblages is reported...|$|R

40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{the leading}} cause of total hip replacement, {{accounting}} for more than 80 % of all total hip replacements. Emerging evidence suggests that osteoarthritis has a chronic inflammatory component to its pathogenesis similar to age-related macular degeneration. We evaluated the association between age-related macular degeneration and total hip replacement as proxy for severe osteoarthritis or fractured neck of femur in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. 20, 744 participants had complete data on both age-related macular degeneration assessed from colour fundus photographs taken during 2003 - 2007 and total hip replacement. Total hip replacements due to hip osteoarthritis and fractured neck of femur during 2001 - 2011 were identified by linking the cohort records to the Australian Orthopedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between age-related macular degeneration and risk of total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis and fracture separately, adjusted for confounders. There were 791 cases of total hip replacement for osteoarthritis and 102 cases of total hip replacement due to fractured neck of femur. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and grouped country of birth, intermediate age-related macular degeneration was directly associated with total hip replacement for osteoarthritis (odds ratio 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 49). Late age-related macular degeneration was directly associated with total hip replacement due to fractured neck of femur (odds ratio 5. 21, 95 % CI 2. 25 - 12. 02). The association between intermediate age-related macular degeneration and an increased 10 -year incidence of total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis suggests the possibility of similar inflammatory processes underlying both chronic diseases. The association of late age-related macular degeneration with an increased 10 -year incidence of total hip replacement due to fractured neck of femur may be due to an increased prevalence of fractures in those with poor central vision associated with the late complications of age-related macular degeneration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION RESTATEMENT OF AIMS To {{investigate}} the geological and geochemical controls on Proterozoic gold-copper mineralisation in iron oxide dominated hydrothermal systems. Major emphasis {{is to be}} placed on the gold-copper deposits at Tennant Creek (NT) and in the Selwyn basin (Queensland). BACKGROUND This research program commenced in 1984 as a joint University of Tasmania-CSIRO project with concentration on the application of lead isotopes and trace element geochemistry to exploration in the Tennant Creek region. In 1986 the project was expanded to include studies on other Proterozoic gold-copper-iron oxide deposits at Starra and Trough Tank, and a field workshop was held in July 1987 in Tennant Creek to review progress and plan Stage II of the research program. Twelve mining and exploration companies plus the Northern Territory Geological Survey are sponsoring Stage II which has now been running for twelve months. This second workshop manual is a progress report on our research carried out in 1988. PROGRESS IN 1988 Members of the Ore Deposit Research Team have achieved the following progress in the past twelve months: * Garry Davidson has reviewed the importance of Proterozoic gold-copper deposits in the context of gold metallogeny in Australia. * Mark Rattenbury has undertaken a study of the regional structure and stratigraphic relationships of the Tennant Creek gold field with particular emphasis on the southeastern section (Nobles Nob to TC 8) and the northwestern section (Greatwestern-White Devil-Warrego). * Richard Wedekind has completed his PhD research on the Warrego deposit and is currently writing-up. A joint study on the structure of Warrego by Richard Wedekind, Mark Rattenbury and Ron Berry is included in this report. * <b>Khin</b> <b>Zaw</b> has extended his study of fluid inclusions in the ironstone lodes and revealed a complex history of fluid evolution. This work has implications for both ore genesis and mineral exploration in the district. * Ross Large and Richard Wedekind have continued their oxygen-hydrogen isotopic studies of hydrothermal chlorite in the Tennant Creek lodes and developed a working hypothesis for the evolution of mineralised and barren systems. * Garry Davidson has continued his PhD research on the Starra and Trough Tank deposits (Qld) and reports on the results of carbon/oxygen isotope studies, and tourmaline geochemistry which have relevance to the development of exploration models in the district...|$|R

He or she must have enough working experience. It is absolutely impossible that a sergeant could memorise the penal code, pass the judge exam and become a judge. They should be in leading positions in their own fields. I rose through the ranks to become a credited lawyer and had to start my profession as a legal practice. Some of my peers are now colonels. But {{it would be impossible}} for me to take their positions. So military personnel also should not do so. — Maung Maung Naing, a lawyer On September 9, Pyinmanar lawyers started the Yellow Ribbon Campaign in front of the Court of Dekkhina Thiri District, Naypyidaw Council. Yellow Ribbon Campaign Myanmar Team urges the lawyers, judges, law students and other people who dislike the involvement of military officers in every field to wear Yellow Ribbons. Yellow Ribbon Movements were also performed in front of the courts in Pyay, Pyinmanar and Mawlamyaing on September 10. On September 11, in Yangon the lawyers launched the campaign at the office of lawyer U Aung Soe (the office of Myanmar Media Lawyers' Network) in 37th Road U Aye Myint, a lawyer from Pyay who was just released from the prison, protested to release the arrested 10-10-10 boycout students and to drive out the military officers who were transferred to Supreme Court.U <b>Khin</b> Mg <b>Zaw,</b> the president of Pyinmanar Lawyers' Association, said,"We protest against the entry of people from military in all ministries of Burma including Health and Judiciary. We will continue until all the ribbon movements unite and spread to the whole country."Lawyers want to become a rainbow ribbon campaign with every department coming out their own color.Yellow Ribbon Campaign will be performed by connecting with lawyers' associations all over the country, and Pyinmanar Lawyers' association, Myanmar Independent Lawyers' Association, Upper Myanmar Lawyers' network, Lower Myanmar Lawyers' Network, and Naypidaw Justice Aid Association are planning to make the campaign countrywide.Petitions against these appointments are collected and to be sent to the Office of the Union Attorney General. Pamphlets of Yellow Ribbon Campaign state that they were trying to stop militarization of Judiciary which they found as strengthening of the military with purpose to prepare for the periods beyond 2015. The Asian Human Rights Commission on Thursday issued a statement, calling {{for an end to the}} practice of appointing military officers as judges by changing the country's constitution to state that only those with legal qualifications and professional experience can become judges of the Supreme Court and other courts. The AHRC also urged international human rights organisations to take an active part in supporting the yellow ribbon movement.|$|R
