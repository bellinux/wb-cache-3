40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topics <b>of</b> visual <b>light</b> and <b>light</b> <b>of</b> {{knowledge}} by Plato, and it attempts to interpret Plato's conception <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. In the first part, the main texts written by Plato on these topics are summarized. In the following part of the thesis, the author proposes her own interpretation <b>of</b> Plato's <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge based on the analogy <b>of</b> visual <b>light</b> and <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge in Plato's Republic. The author then formulates a conjecture concerning the meaning Plato's <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, and applies it to backtrack connections <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge to the visual light. In the thesis, various meanings <b>of</b> Plato's <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge are demonstrated. They are summarized {{at the end of}} the second part of the thesis. Plato's metafors <b>of</b> <b>light</b> have been <b>of</b> great importance through the history of European intellectual tradition. Therefore, the author discusses meanings of these metaphors in pre-platonic works in the introduction, and outlines the impact <b>of</b> Plato's <b>light</b> <b>of</b> knowledge on the subsequent development of religious and philosophical thinking...|$|R

5|$|Velázquez further emphasises the Infanta by his {{positioning}} and <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> her maids of honour, whom he sets opposing one another: to {{left and}} right, before {{and behind the}} Infanta. The maid to the left faces the light, her brightly lit profile and sleeve creating a diagonal. Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|E
5|$|Artificial <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> {{any sort}} was largely absent during the {{industrial}} {{development of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> the Olympic Flame was {{followed}} by the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover themselves because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several doves perched themselves at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the College Walk festivities {{is one of}} Columbia's older holiday traditions, the <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony {{is accompanied by a}} reading of A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's address was radio broadcast through the Voice of America in thirty-four languages.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace.

Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse.

In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{planners}} {{designed the}} system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design of stations {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity.

Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E
