40|$|Abstract Background The {{scope of}} optometry differs worldwide. In Norway the vast {{majority}} of optometrists perform ophthalmoscopy as part of their routine examinations. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the frequency of suspected retinopathies in patients seen for routine optometric examination and to determine how optometrists deal with these patients. Methods 212 optometrists participated in a questionnaire survey and a practice registration during November 2004 – May 2005. In the practice registration, details for 20 consecutive patient encounters were recorded. Data were analysed by chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression. Results All optometrist stated that ocular history taking was an integrated part of their routine examination, while general health and diabetes history were routinely addressed by 59 % and 42 % of the optometrists, respectively. During the practice registration 4, 052 patient encounters were recorded. Ophthalmoscopy was performed in 88 % of the patients, of which 2 % were dilated fundus examinations. Retinopathy was suspected in 106 patients, of whom 31 did not report a previous history of ocular or systemic disease. Old age (75 +), hypertension and diabetes strongly predicted retinopathy with odds ratio (95 % CI) of 6. 4 (4. 2 to 9. 9), 3. 8 (2. 4 to 6. 0) and 2. 5 (1. 4 to 4. 7), respectively. Diabetic retinopathy was seen in 10 % of diabetic patients and suspected in 0. 2 % of patients with no established history of diabetes. Retinopathy was not confirmed in 9 out 18 patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy; seven of these had undergone laser treatment. Out of the 106 patients with findings of retinopathy, 28 were referred to an ophthalmologist or a general practitioner (GP), written reports were sent to a GP in 16 cases, ten patients were urged to contact their GP for further follow up, while 52 were considered in need of routine optometric follow up only. Conclusion Optometric practice provides a <b>low</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>setting</b> for detecting cases of ocular disease and retinal manifestations of systemic disease in the population. At present diagnosis of retinopathy in Norwegian optometric practice is unreliable. There are potentials for improving the optometrists' routine examination, their patient management patterns and collaboration routines with medical doctors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs), where injecting {{drug users}} (IDUs) can use pre-obtained drugs in a {{hygienic}} and professionally supervised <b>low</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>setting,</b> aim to engage high risk IDUs, reduce public drug use, injecting-related morbidity and mortality, and improve access to drug treatment. This thesis evaluates the service demand, accessibility, utilisation, and coverage of Australias first DCR, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), {{located in an}} area {{with a history of}} illegal shooting gallery operation. MSIC impact on injecting practices and injecting related health, and referral to drug treatment were also examined. Methods included cross-sectional IDU surveys, key informant interviews, staff focus groups, analysis of client registration and surveillance data and routinely collected data on needles and syringes - including multiple indirect prevalence estimation, and prospective follow-up of MSIC referrals. Shooting gallery users expressed demand for and willingness to use the MSIC. Injecting episodes previously occurring in shooting galleries appear to have been transferred to the MSIC, although shooting galleries continued to operate at a reduced level. The MSIC service model was accessible, with few refusals of entry, high levels of client satisfaction and limited non-use for reasons relating to the model. MSIC engaged high risk IDUs - regular injectors, sex workers, and those injecting in public places and shooting galleries - who {{were also more likely to}} be frequent attendees. MSIC clients were more likely than other IDUs to inject in public places and shooting galleries, be HCV seropositive, have riskier injecting practices and more severe injecting related health problems. MSIC achieved good coverage of the local IDU population (70. 7 %, range 59. 1 %- 86. 7 %) and modest coverage of their estimated total injecting episodes during its operating hours (8. 8 %, range 7. 3 %- 10. 8 %). MSIC use was associated with improvements in injecting practices and health. Frequent MSIC use was also associated with higher rates of referral to drug treatment than less frequent use. Drug treatment referral uptake was positively associated with a recent history of daily injection and sex work and negatively associated with a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment and/or self harm. This research was confounded by substantial changes in heroin availability during the study period but provides new evidence on DCR coverage, impact on injecting practices and health, and referral to drug treatment. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In this work, poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanocomposites {{containing}} functionalized {{graphene sheets}} (FGS) were prepared {{by means of}} high-energy ball milling. The crystalline structure, oxygen barrier, mechanical and electrical properties, and biodegradability of the developed nanocomposites were analyzed and correlated {{with the amount of}} FGS incorporated and with their morphology, which was reported in a previous study. Addition of FGS into the PHBV matrix did not affect the crystal morphology of the material but led to somewhat enhanced crystallinity. The good dispersion and distribution of the nanofiller within the polymeric matrix, revealed {{in the first part of}} this study, was thought to be crucial for the mechanical reinforcing effect of FGS and also resulted in enhanced gas barrier properties at high relative humidity. Additionally, the conducting behavior of the nanocomposites, as interpreted by the percolation theory, displayed a very <b>low</b> percolation <b>threshold</b> <b>set</b> at ∼ 0. 3 vol % of FGS, while the materials exhibited an overall significantly enhanced conductivity.

40|$|Canny is {{a classic}} {{algorithm}} of edge detection which has been widely applied in various fields of image processing for years. However, the algorithm has some defects.
