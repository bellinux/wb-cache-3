50|$|One of {{the main}} {{incentives}} for them {{to move to the}} industrial north of Bohemia from Slovakia was better access to better housing. They were therefore attempting to improve their standard of living, yet the apartments the migrants acquired were the lowest quality - mainly the oldest and most dilapidated apartments in the historic centre of old Most. However, the Romany themselves were mostly satisfied with these flats and considered them suitable, as the location offered more opportunities than they were used to in terms of public utilities and transport, parks, shops, and other amenities. They also had a very low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent,</b> a maximum of CSK150.

50|$|Economies where {{too much}} profit is being {{extracted}} are over-paying {{the owners of}} capital {{at the expense of}} other contributors to a productive economy or industry. Economies and Industries that provide insufficient returns to the owners of capital should find that capital is moved to alternate investments where the return is greater. Profit Efficient economies and industries are paying the minimum profit to owners of capital required to maintain the optimal level and distribution of capital investment. This concept has importance when discussing the relative outcome efficiency of industries such as the US Health Care System which has high customer costs, high government subsidy and yet has relatively poor health outcomes. This industry is said to be profit inefficient as compared to European health care models which have less customer and government inputs and yet better outcomes. The difference appears to be that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> paid to capital investors in the US system is a greater proportion of the overall productive value of the industry. Similar observations are made about the US Financial System's impact on the US economy as a whole. The increasingly profit inefficient US economy is the primary reason for its rapid decline as an economic superpower.|$|E
50|$|Council tenants' {{housing benefit}} is awarded as a rebate; {{reducing}} the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> payable by the tenant. Private tenants' benefit is normally {{paid to the}} claimant, who {{has the right to}} decide to whom payments are made, and in some cases to the landlord.Local authorities reclaim the housing benefit that they have paid from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by means of submitting heavily audited subsidy claims. Three subsidy claims must be completed each year, an initial estimate, a mid year estimate and a final claim. The final claim must be submitted to the DWP by 30 April. The final audited claim must be submitted by 30 November. The Department for Work and Pensions pays local councils an administration grant based on the numbers of new claims and overall case-load; as well as various other cost factor adjustments {{to take into account the}} relative staff and accommodation costs. The level of Administration Grant awarded is announced annually by the Department for Work and Pensions. Some elements of the subsidy claim are subject to penalty, to encourage local authorities to control that element of expenditure. This includes high rents for care and support homes and the raising of overpayments. Overpayments of benefit are not fully funded in order to ensure that the local authority takes recovery action where appropriate.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model of rent-seeking is tested by applying {{it to the}} case of pesticide policy. Two coalitions of interest groups are seen as competing to influence legislators in their decisions to regulate pesticides. The coalitions determine the optimal level of rent-seeking activities by balancing the expected benefits of rent-seeking with the costs of rent-seeking at the margin. Rent-seeking activities are found to be functions {{of the size of the}} coalition and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> set by the regulator. Legislators determine the optimal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> by equating expected benefits and costs at the margin. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> set by a legislator is a function of the rent-seeking activities of the coalitions, share of rent-seeking activities captured by the legislator, and income of the legislator;Probit estimation is used to analyze legislators 2 ̆ 7 votes on two bills to amend pesticide legislation (a proxy for rent).

The anchovy fisheries in Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam are used as a study case with time series data collected from 220 fishing households in 2005, 2008 and 2011.
