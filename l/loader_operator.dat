30|$|This study {{included}} the scanner operators and the log-bucking processors but excluded the <b>loader</b> <b>operators.</b> The Logmeister {{system is in}} operation five days per week with two shifts per day. The first shift for the scanner operator is a fixed length of 9.5 hours and runs from 4.00 am to 1.30 pm. Minor maintenance and refuelling can be done between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm by operators from the first shift. The second shift is open-ended. It runs from 2.00 pm until the time when all the stems produced from the forest estate that day have been scanned. This is often around 10.00 pm but can extend to 3.00 am the following day. A single scanner operator is scheduled for each shift, but scanner operators sometimes swap roles with other machine operators or manual workers. One, sometimes two, processors are scheduled to cut the stems into logs per shift. Shift lengths for the processors vary from 8 to 12 hours. One 30 -minute rest- and meal-break per shift is taken by both scanner and processor operators. Competition exists among workers {{between the first and}} second shifts about who can produce the most wood volume per shift. Although not company policy, there was a tendency during this study for the <b>loader</b> <b>operators</b> from both shifts to feed bigger stems into the system at the beginning of the shift to quickly build up volume, and the smaller stems were left over towards the end of the shift.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} of {{eighteen}} wheel <b>loader</b> <b>operators,</b> test-driving a machine in three different traction force settings, we examine if a workload index derived from psychophysiological measurements of heart rate, finger temperature, skin conductance, respiration rate and end-tidal CO 2 -concentration in exhaled air can be easily used to assess operator workload in sufficient detail {{to use it as}} a complement to traditional subjective evaluations in machine testing, either of real machines or in a human-in-the-loop simulator. In a longer perspective, such measurements are expected to play a role in a workload-adaptive operator assistance system. However, the findings do not give support for this vision. Instead they indicate that other types of measurements than what have been used in our study should be employed if ease of use for practitioners such as test engineers is in focus, but also that other factors than just machine operability must be considered to have a great influence on the operator workload...|$|R
40|$|Forestry {{employees}} {{are the most}} valuable asset to forest operations. An analysis was completed to determine employee training status, how safe employees feel within their roles and identify major reasons of dissatisfaction. Through the development of job descriptions and person specifications, {{it was possible to}} identify the job requirements along with the personal attributes and qualifications required by employers, to ensure employees were capable of undertaking their role. There is an identifiable gap within the level of formal education among employees. Over half (55 %) of the employees have lower qualifications than those required to have undertaken further forestry on-job training. A majority of employees’, particularly those in machine operator roles feel safe in their forestry operational roles. A small proportion of employees in breaker out, thin to waste and pruning roles feel unsafe. All employees surveyed except <b>loader</b> <b>operators,</b> felt only moderately safe in their role. The difficult environment associated with forestry was determined to be the major reason for dissatisfaction (52 %) among employees, along pay and length of day. Paradoxically, the environment was also a major reason for satisfaction among those surveyed. By identifying the major reasons of dissatisfaction among forestry employees it is possible to improve job satisfaction and employee retention. Training forestry employees needs to be from a more practical aspect. This will lead {{to increase the number of}} employees that are trained for the roles they are undertaking, by ensuring they are equipped with adequate knowledge, and have the skill to work safely and to a high quality standard...|$|R

40|$|Forest harvest {{residues}} {{are often}} available at roadside landings as {{a byproduct of}} the log manufacturing process. This residue is usually available for renewable energy production if desired, however {{there is a significant}} amount of residues that do not reach the landing during the harvesting process and could potentially increase the supply of forest biomass from each harvest unit. The proportion of recoverable residues depends on their collection costs, which are a function of the distance from roadside landing, terrain conditions, and collection method. In this study, a forest residue collection model using forwarders and excavator-base loaders was developed to estimate the potential cost of biomass extraction from the forest to roadside landings. At the operational level, the model calculates the potential forwarder paths to estimate the cost depending on slope, machine arrangement and distance. For the analyzed harvest unit, the use of the excavator-base loader working alone is the most cost effective system for distances of less than 50 m and two forwarders and one excavator-base loader is the most cost effective system for distances beyond 50 m. The optimal solution collection costs ranged from USD 7. 2 to 27. 5 per oven-dry tonne for a range of distance between 15 and 350 m. The use of one operator to trade positions as forwarder operator and excavator-base <b>loader</b> <b>operator</b> resulted in lower productivity and higher cost compared to the use of a separate operator for each machine...|$|E
40|$|VIRTUAL PROTOTYPING {{has been}} {{generally}} adopted in product development {{in order to}} minimise the traditional reliance on testing of physical prototypes. It thus constitutes a major step towards solving the conflict of actual increasing development cost and time due to increasing customer demands on one side, {{and the need to}} decrease development cost and time due to increasing competition on the other. Particularly challenging for the off-road equipment industry is that its products, working machines, are complex in architecture. Tightly coupled, non-linear sub-systems of different technical domains make prediction and optimisation of the complete system’s dynamic behaviour difficult. Furthermore, in working machines the human operator is essential for the performance of the total system. Properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability are all not only dependent on inherent machine properties and working place conditions, but also on how the operator uses the machine. This is an aspect that is traditionally neglected in dynamic simulations, because the modelling needs to be extended beyond the technical system. The research presented in this thesis focuses on wheel loaders, which are representative for working machines. The technical system and the influence of the human operator is analysed, and so-called short loading cycles are described in depth. Two approaches to rule-based simulation models of a wheel <b>loader</b> <b>operator</b> are presented and used in simulations. Both operator models control the machine model by means of engine throttle, lift and tilt lever, steering wheel, and brake only – just as a human operator does. Also, only signals that a human operator can sense are used in the models. It is demonstrated that both operator models are able to adapt to basic variations in workplace setup and machine capability. Thus, a “human element” can be introduced into dynamic simulation of working machines, giving more relevant answers with respect to operator-influenced complete-machine properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability already in the concept phase of the product development process.

40|$|In This Chapter [Drilling, blasting, and crushers Diesel {{particulate}} Enclosed cabs Ventilation with jet fans Stopping construction methods Propeller fans as main fans] This chapter {{explains how}} to control dust in large-entry stone mines, including both silica dust and diesel particulate. Most stone mines are limestone mines, but a substantial minority are marble, sandstone, and granite mines. These mines differ from most others in that entry widths are 30 ft or more and entry heights are 25 ft or more. Such mines, developed with room-and-pillar methods, have large open areas that can make ventilation and dust control more difficult. Because {{of the difficulty of}} ventilating stone mines, improved ventilation is a major focal point of this chapter. However, the chapter also covers the control of dust from drills, blasting, and crushers. Another part of the chapter covers enclosed cabs, an effective dust control technique for some workers. BACKGROUND The major dust compliance problem in stone mines is caused by silica (quartz) in the rock. Mines in high-silica rock, 8 % or more, {{are far more likely to}} have a dust problem than those where there is less silica. Geographically, the limestone in the Northeastern and South Central United States has higher silica than the rest of the country. Chekan and Colinet [2002] have analyzed Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) dust sampling results [MSHA 2001] from the stone industry. They have concluded that, on average across the United States, the workers exposed to the highest dust concentrations are rotary drill <b>operators,</b> front-end <b>loader</b> <b>operators,</b> truck drivers, and crusher operators. However, there are many regional differences. Also, occupations that work outside of cabs, such as blasters, roof bolters, and laborers, can be exposed to high dust levels...|$|R

40|$|In September 2006, {{an adult}} truck driver {{employed}} by a trucking company sustained fatal injuries after being buried by mulch in his trailer {{at a town}} solid waste site. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim’s tractor trailer was being loaded with mulch. The trailer was equipped with a walking floor unloading system. After the town <b>loader</b> <b>operator</b> deposited one bucket of approximately five cubic yards of mulch into the trailer, he noticed that the trailer door was open and the victim was not in the cab. The operator became concerned and called for help. One town staff member called 911. In the meantime, town workers started digging into the compost pile in the trailer. The temperature of the mulch was approximately 135 degrees Fahrenheit. The police arrived at the site followed by paramedics within minutes after the 911 call was placed. The unconscious victim was uncovered 15 minutes later. The victim was transported to a hospital and subsequently {{died as a result of}} the injuries. After the incident, a piece of blue tarp was found in the mulch. It is believed that the victim may have entered the trailer through the trailer door to cover the front section of the walking floor with the tarp to reduce manual sweeping. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (NY FACE) investigators concluded that to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, owners of solid waste facilities should: • develop and enforce a standard safe loading/unloading procedure for both facility personnel and visiting drivers; and • provide frequent training for all facility personnel on the standard safe loading/unloading procedure. In addition, trucking companies should: • develop standard safe trailer cleaning procedures and require all drivers to strictly follow the procedures; and • provide frequent employee training to ensure that the truck drivers understand and follow site specific safety procedures while picking up or delivering cargos at solid waste facilities...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that can}} {{influence}} the effectiveness of any risk management strategy, {{in the case of}} whole-body vibration exposure many problems are faced with the quantification of risk, measurement of risk and subsequent risk reduction. The quantification of vibration effects is equally as complex as the quantification of vibration itself. Exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) causes a distribution of motions and forces within the human body and to complicate matters the transmission of vibration to the body is also dependent on body posture. To-date there has been little attempt to accurately reflect many of the typical postures and vibration environments experienced by operators of earth moving machines in a laboratory setting. The overall aim of the thesis was to determine the variability between humans, machines and task environments in order to provide knowledge to inform improvements in methods of risk management for whole-body vibration exposure. The field measurement phase of the research focused on characterising features of whole-body vibration exposure among operators of earthmoving machines throughout a range of industry sectors. Some of the biggest industries; coal mining, quarries, and construction were targeted to obtain data on the types of machines for which very little was previously available. Research was carried out under real operating conditions to investigate the nature of occupational exposure to whole-body vibration and to determine the causes of variability between measurements. The laboratory phase of the research simulated the conditions of the 'real working environment' observed in the field study in order to examine how twisted non-neutral postures could influence the biomechanical, performance and workload responses of humans. The machines with the greatest vibration emission were generally those that spent most of their time tracking. The worst machine for vibration exposure was a challenger 85 D tracked tractor towing a 'hex' attachment. Operators of this machine would exceed the EU Physical Agents Exposure Limit Value in about 2. 5 hours. The next most severe earth moving machines were bulldozers and tracked loaders and with long working hours typically observed in industry some of these machines would also exceed the ELV in a working day. The influence of variability between work cycles was found to be a particular problem for the bulldozer and excavator machines, variation between work cycles exceeded the 25 % variance limit criteria. If these machines were targeted for a WBV health risk assessment then the measurement durations will need to take account of this variation in the extrapolation to an 8 -hour exposure. The operators of these tracked machines were also found to adopt non-neutral twisted postures during reversing manoeuvres. The twisted posture adopted by the bulldozer and tracked <b>loader</b> <b>operators</b> was recreated in the laboratory. Findings demonstrated that operators are likely to be putting their necks in a vulnerable position in the twisted posture due to the large increase in rotational movement at the head during exposure to vibration. Decrements in reaction time performance and increases in workload were also found while individuals were sat in a twisted posture and exposed to vibration.

Six experienced operators participated in the experiments carried out on two different sizes of backhoe <b>loaders.</b> Each <b>operator</b> had to complete three different tasks without any kind of instructions. Subsequently they got a short education on eco-driving and vibration avoidance and carried out the tasks once more. Time duration, whole-body vibration exposure and fuel consumption was registered before and after education. The result of the short education was an average reduction in the whole-body vibration exposure of 22. 5 %. And for all completed tasks expect one a considerably fuel saving was obtained too - up to 38 %. This experiment demonstrates that education of the operator will improve the occupational health and save fuel. The results also indicate that these improvements can be obtained without reduction in productivity as the instructions become a habit for the operators. Thus it is profitable for the employer to educate the employees operating construction machinery. Relevance to industry: The findings of this work is highly relevant to the construction industry.

5000|$|Girls und Panzer-themed mods for {{the game}} were {{announced}} at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show; these game mods were distributed as free downloads for players in the South-East Asian server, mainly targeting the Japanese-speaking community. Initially, there were six voice packs released, featuring the voices of all {{five members of the}} Anglerfish team, as well as a special voice pack for Nonna, the vice captain of Pravda's sensha-dō team; each of the five crew members of the Anglerfish team voices the five different crew positions in World of Tanks: Commander, Gunner, <b>Loader,</b> Radio <b>Operator,</b> and Driver. The voice packs replaces the standard crew voices with the Girls und Panzer character voices, when tank commands such as [...] "Target acquired!" [...] or [...] "Reloading!" [...] sound in the game. The voice packs, however, are only available in Japanese. Afterwards, a garage mod was released, where players could change the regular game garage to the sensha-dō garage square in Ōarai Girls High's Academy Ship. Another mod that was released allowed players to change the skins of a few select tanks in the game to the paint jobs of the tanks in the Girls und Panzer anime. Tanks include the Panzer IV H of Ōarai Girls High, the Churchill VII of St. Gloriana Girls Academy and the Jagdtiger of Kuromorimine Girls High. The last mod that was made available changed the look of destroyed tanks for certain vehicles; instead of a smoking wreck of metal that is shown when a tank is destroyed, the tank is shown in a moderate condition, with a white flag on top, similar to when tanks are knocked out in Girls und Panzer, to indicate that the tank is destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Most modern high {{performance}} storage systems store data in large repositories of removable media volumes. Management of the removable volumes is {{performed by a}} software module known as a Physical Volume Library (PVL). To meet performance and scalability requirements, a PVL {{may be asked to}} mount multiple removable media volumes for use by a single client for parallel data transfer. Mounting sets of volumes creates an environment in which it impossible for multiple client requests to deadlock while attempting to gain access to storage resources. Scenarios leading to deadlock in a PVL include multiple client requests that contend for the same cartridge(s), and client requests that vie for a limited set of drive resources. These deadlock scenarios are further complicated by the potential for out-of-order volumes to be mounted (for example, by Automatic Cartridge <b>Loaders</b> or human <b>operators).</b> This paper begins by introducing those PVL requirements Which create the possibility of deadlock. Next we examine traditional approaches to deadlock resolution and how they might be applied in a PVL. This leads to a design for a PVL which addresses deadlock scenarios.

We end with a case study of an actual implementation of the PVL design in the High Performance Storage System (HPSS) ...|$|R

40|$|As the International Space Station (ISS) {{has moved}} into a {{utilization}} phase, operations have shifted to become more ground-based with fewer mission control personnel monitoring and commanding multiple ISS systems. This shift to fewer people monitoring more systems has prompted use of semi-autonomous console tools in the ISS Mission Control Center (MCC) to help flight controllers command and monitor the ISS. These console tools perform routine operational procedures while keeping the human operator "in the loop" to monitor and intervene when off-nominal events arise. Two such tools, the Pre-positioned Load (PPL) <b>Loader</b> and Automatic <b>Operators</b> Recorder Manager (AutoORM), are used by the ISS Communications RF Onboard Networks Utilization Specialist (CRONUS) flight control position. CRONUS is responsible for simultaneously commanding and monitoring the ISS Command & Data Handling (C&DH) and Communications and Tracking (C&T) systems. PPL Loader is used to uplink small pieces of frequently changed software data tables, called PPLs, to ISS computers to support different ISS operations. In order to uplink a PPL, a data load command must be built that contains multiple user-input fields. Next, a multiple step commanding and verification procedure must be performed to enable an onboard computer for software uplink, uplink the PPL, verify the PPL has incorporated correctly, and disable the computer for software uplink. PPL Loader provides different levels of automation in both building and uplinking these commands. In its manual mode, PPL Loader automatically builds the PPL data load commands but allows the flight controller to verify and save the commands for future uplink. In its auto mode, PPL Loader automatically builds the PPL data load commands for flight controller verification, but automatically performs the PPL uplink procedure by sending commands and performing verification checks while notifying CRONUS of procedure step completion. If an off-nominal condition occurs during procedure execution, PPL Loader notifies CRONUS through popup messages, allowing CRONUS to examine the situation and choose an option of how PPL loader should proceed with the procedure. The use of PPL Loader to perform frequent, routine PPL uplinks offloads CRONUS to better monitor two ISS systems. It also reduces procedure performance time and decreases risk of command errors. AutoORM identifies ISS communication outage periods and builds commands to lock, playback, and unlock ISS Operations Recorder files. Operation Recorder files are circular buffer files of continually recorded ISS telemetry data. Sections of these files can be locked from further writing, be played back to capture telemetry data that occurred during an ISS loss of signal (LOS) period, and then be unlocked for future recording use. Downlinked Operation Recorder files are used by mission support teams for data analysis, especially if failures occur during LOS. The commands to lock, playback, and unlock Operations Recorder files are encompassed in three different operational procedures and contain multiple user-input fields. AutoORM provides different levels of automation for building and uplinking the commands to lock, playback, and unlock Operations Recorder files. In its automatic mode, AutoORM automatically detects ISS LOS periods, then generates and uplinks the commands to lock, playback, and unlock Operations Recorder files when MCC regains signal with ISS. AutoORM also features semi-autonomous and manual modes which integrate CRONUS more into the command verification and uplink process. AutoORMs ability to automatically detect ISS LOS periods and build the necessary commands to preserve, playback, and release recorded telemetry data greatly offloads CRONUS to perform more high-level cognitive tasks, such as mission planning and anomaly troubleshooting. Additionally, since Operations Recorder commands contain numerical time input fields which are tedious for a human to manually build, AutoORM's ability to automatically build commands reduces operational command errors. PPL Loader and AutoORM demonstrate principles of semi-autonomous operational tools that will benefit future space mission operations. Both tools employ different levels of automation to perform simple and routine procedures, thereby offloading human operators to perform higher-level cognitive tasks. Because both tools provide procedure execution status and highlight off-nominal indications, the flight controller is able to intervene during procedure execution if needed. Semi-autonomous tools and systems that can perform routine procedures, yet keep human operators informed of execution, will be essential in future long-duration missions where the onboard crew will be solely responsible for spacecraft monitoring and control...|$|R
