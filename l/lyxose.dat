This research focused on: three crucial steps {{in the production of}} value added intermediates in the biorefinery process: Hydrolysis of biomass waste producing sugars. Dehydration of sugar monomers producing furfural. Aldol condensation of furfural with acetone. The first step was concerned with the viability of the dilute acid hydrolysis of potato peel wastes to produce sugars. Acid concentrations and temperature were investigated to find optimum conditions. High phosphoric acid concentrations with low temperatures gave -the optimum yield of 55. 2 g sugars/lOOg of dry mass using 10 % w/w phosphoric acid and a temperature of 408 K. The second step investigated the use of xylose for value added chemical production by catalytic dehydration to furfural, an aldehyde. To date, little was known about.

A salinity-sensitive perennial grass species, creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), was irrigated daily with 200 mM NaCl for 28 d, which were foliar sprayed with water or ALA (0. 5 mg L- 1) weekly during the experiment in growth chamber. Foliar application of ALA was effective in mitigating physiological damage resulting from salinity stress, as manifested by increased turf quality, shoot growth rate, leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate. Foliar application of ALA also alleviated membrane damages, as shown by lower membrane electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation, which was associated with increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes.

Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The (xylose+arabinose) /(galactose+rhamnose+mannose) ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and <b>lyxose</b> contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae.

The cactus pads (Opuntia ficus indica) {{used in the study}} were collected from a neighbouring field to the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Water pollution is increasing and lack of cheap and adaptable point-of-use technologies, have recently exacerbated water shortage problem. Globally, the existing water resources may not sustain the demand for domestic and industrial use, if the available amounts cannot be harvested, treated and recycled properly. Based on this concern, the quest for efficient wastewater treatment technologies, is of a particular interest to reserchers. Critical examination of the isolated polysaccharides revealed that cactus extracts were generally composed of unique <b>lyxose</b> sugars (both in furanose and pyranose forms) along with other hemicellulose sugar residues. Basically, the polysaccharides obtained from cactus were classified as hemicellulose and pectin sugars. Based on these constituents, a hybrid approach was used to study the applicability of cactus extracts in water treatment and filtration. First, direct use of the polysaccharide extracts was assessed.

Total organic carbon (TOC) content was 1. 21 &plusmn; 0. 45 % in the upper reach, down to 1. 00 &plusmn; 0. 22 % in Lingdingyang Bay and to 0. 80 &plusmn; 0. 10 % on the inner shelf and 0. 58 &plusmn; 0. 06 % on the outer shelf. &delta; 13 C values ranged from − 25. 1 &permil; to − 21. 3 &permil; in Lingdingyang Bay and the South China Sea shelf, with a trend of enrichment seawards. The spatial trend in C/N ratios mirrored that of &delta; 13 C, with a substantial decrease in C/N ratio offshore. Total carbohydrate yields ranged from 22. 1 to 26. 7 mg (100 mg OC) − 1 , and typically followed TOC concentrations in the estuarine and shelf sediments. Total neutral sugars, as detected by the nine major monosaccharides (<b>lyxose,</b> rhamnose, ribose, arabinose, fucose, xylose, galactose, mannose, and glucose), were between 4. 0 and 18. 6 mg (100 mg OC) − 1 in the same sediments, suggesting that significant amounts of carbohydrates were not neutral aldoses. Using a two end-member mixing model based on &delta; 13 C values and C/N ratios, we estimated that the terrestrial organic carbon contribution to the surface sediment TOC was ca. 78 &plusmn; 11 % for Lingdingyang Bay, 34 &plusmn; 4 % for the inner shelf, and 5. 5 &plusmn; 1 % for the outer shelf. The molecular composition of the carbohydrate in the surface sediments also suggested that the inner estuary was rich in terrestrially derived carbohydrates but that their contribution decreased offshore. A relatively high abundance of deoxyhexoses in the estuary and shelf indicated a considerable bacterial source of these carbohydrates, implying that sediment organic matter had undergone extensive degradation and/or transformation during transport. Sediment budget based on calculated regional accumulation rates showed that only ~ 50 % of the influxes of terrestrial organic carbon were accumulated in the estuary. This relatively low accumulation efficiency of terrestrial organic matter as compared to the total suspended solids (accumulation efficiency ~ 73 %) suggested significant degradation of the terrestrial organic carbon within the estuarine system after its discharge from the river. This study demonstrated that the combination of the bulk organic matter properties together with the isotopic composition and molecular-level carbohydrate compositions can be an efficient way to track down the source and fate of organic matter in highly dynamic estuarine and coastal systems. The predominance of terrestrially originated organic matter in the sediment and its generally low accumulation efficiency within the estuary is not surprising, and yet it may have important implications in light of the heavy anthropogenic discharges into the Pearl River Estuary during the past thirty years...|$|E

Grimmett, M., & Richards, E. (1965). Separation of imidazoles by thin-layer chromatography. Journal Of Chromatography, 18 (3), 605 - 608. The chromatography of imidazoles {{has been studied}} and a method developed for their quantitative estimation. The following facts {{have been brought to}} light:- (i) Formaldehyde does not form imidazoles at room temperature in ammoniacal solution. (ii) From the complex mixture resulting from the interaction of glyoxal with aqueous ammonia imidazole and 2, 2 '-bis-imidazole have been isolated and identified, while 2 -formylimidazole has been tentatively identified. (iii) Glycolaldehyde reacts with aqueous ammonia to form imidazole and 2 -hydroxymethylimidazole. (iv) DL-Glyceraldehyde reacts with aqueous ammonia to form a complex mixture of neutral and basic compounds. Dihydroxyacetone, glucose, fructose, mannose, arabinose, <b>lyxose</b> and xylose have been tentatively identified by paper chromatography while ribose was suspected in low concentration. 2 -Hydroxymethyl- 4 (5) -methylimidazole, 4 (5) -methylimidazole, 4 (5) -(2 -hydroxyethyl) imidazole and 4 (5) -hydroxymethylimidazole have been isolated and characterised, and their orders and rates of formation studied. (v) Pyruvaldehyde reacts exothermically with concentrated ammonia solution to form four imidazolic compounds. Three of these have been isolated and characterised as 2 -acetyl- 4 (5) -methylimidazole, 2, 4 (5) -dimethylimidazole and 4 (5) -methylimidazole. The latter two compounds were formed in approximately equimolecular proportions. These results fail to confirm Bernhauer's finding that pyruvaldehyde cannot act as a source of formaldehyde in imidazole formation. (vi) Hydroxypyruvaldehyde browns rapidly in aqueous ammonia forming 2 -hydroxymethyl- 4 (5) -methylimidazole, 4 (5) -methylimidazole and 4 (5) -hydroxymethylimidazole. The yields of the latter two compounds {{have been found to be}} higher than from a similar mixture of dihydroxyacetone with ammonia. (vii) Both diacetyl and acetoin react with ammonia to form 2, 4, 5 -trimethylimidazole. (viii) 4 (5) -(2 -Hydroxyethyl) imidazole has been tentatively identified from the mixture resulting from the interaction of 1, 4 -dihydroxybutan- 2 -one with aqueous ammonia. (ix) Arabinose reacts with aqueous ammonia to form a complex mixture of imidazoles from which 4 (5) -methylimidazole has been isolated and identified. (x) A chromatographic study has been carried out to determine the orders of formation of imidazoles resulting from the interactions of a number of carbohydrates and their degradation products with aqueous ammonia. Arising from this study have come the following main results:- (a) It appears that, contrary to the findings of Komoto, a number of imidazoles with low Rf values (probably polyhydroxyalkyl-substituted) are formed more rapidly than 4 (5) -methylimidazole from hexose sugars with ammonia. (b) Differently linked reducing disaccharides give markedly different patterns of imidazoles under ammoniacal conditions. (xi) As a result of (b) above, a micro-method has been developed for determination of the position of the glycosidic link in reducing hexose disaccharides and homogeneously-linked oligosaccharides...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was the {{synthesis}} a range of carbocycles from carbohydrates using SmI 2 as the key reagent. Carbocycles derived from functionalised cyclopentanes form important substructures in many natural compounds, {{many of which are}} biologically active. This therefore provides a route to many highly desirable biologically active analogues. The project was initiated with the selective preparation of a variety of substituted g- butyrolactone dimers. To the end of preparing the dimers, we foresaw that g-ketoesters would be ideal substrates: pinacolisation to the corresponding bis-Sm-alkoxide, followed by intramolecular cyclisation onto esters, was anticipated to afford the corresponding g- butyrolactone dimers. The requisite g-ketoester starting materials were readily available via the Stetter reaction of a variety of aryl aldehydes with some a,b-unsaturated esters. A range of g-butyrolactone dimers was prepared. In keeping with the pinacol type reaction, the second section of work investigated focussed on the pinacol coupling of a variety of 1, 4 -diketone analogues with SmI 2. The primary substrate on which the study began was 2, 3, 5 -tris-O-phenylmethyl-D-arabinose. A variety of functionalities was introduced at the anomeric position and pinacol coupling attempted. It was interesting to see the crucial role that the radical acceptor played in the success of the transformation. These functionalities include an O- methyl oxime, nitrile, butyl group and the thiophene. The O-methyl oxime proved to be a poor radical acceptor and after several attempts no success was attained. This therefore initiated a new study to find an improved radical acceptor. Both the butyl and thiophene groups successfully gave the desired cyclobutanol analogues. In addition to the pinacol reactions attempted with 2, 3, 5 -tris-O-phenylmethyl-Darabinose analogues, pinacol coupling reactions were attempted with deoxy-analogues of D-ribose. Once again a variety of substitutions at the anomeric position were looked at. These include the phenyl, butyl and furan groups. Both the phenyl and butyl containing deoxy-analogues were successfully converted into cyclobutanol products. The first work described in this thesis focussed upon the pinacol cyclisation of chiral 1, 4 - diketone derivatives. The second section of work relied on a keto-olefin cyclisation reaction to afford the cyclobutane product. The first part of this aspect of the work looked at the construction of functionalised cyclobutanols from carbohydrate precursors via 4 -exo-trig cyclisations. The work was initiated with a D-arabinose derived substrate, a sugar having trans stereochemistry at positions 2 and 3. The work was then extended to sugars having cis stereochemistry at position 2 and 3. 2, 3 : 5, 6 -Di-O-isopropylidene-Dmannofuranose successfully gave three of the desired monomers. Due to the large protective groups at positions 5 and 6, dimer formation was not possible. Ultimately, success was obtained using D- <b>lyxose</b> as a starting substrate. After transforming the starting sugar to a substrate suitable to attempt a 4 -exo-trig cyclisation on, four cyclobutane monomer products, along with a single dimer product, were obtained. The latter set of reactions was based on a defined reaction sequence revolving around a Wittig reaction and in situ oxidation sequence to set up the desired precursor for the SmI 2 -mediated cyclisation. It was desirous to probe the possibility of employing a different approach to setting up the direct precursor to the cyclisation reaction, one that did not rely on the Wittig-oxidation sequence. This new approach delineates a new methodology towards the formation of cyclobutanes, involving the SmI 2 -mediated cyclisation between an aldehyde and an activated alkene. In addition to the new route to cyclobutanes, a novel approach making use of an elimination reaction to form the desired enal is described. The synthesis of the desired analogue proved to be quite problematic but with very interesting conclusions being derived from varying various func tionalities on the precursor carbohydrate. The desired substrate containing an aldehyde and an a,b- unsaturated nitrile was finally synthesised and the well developed samarium diiodide methodology tested. The desired cyclobutanol analogue was obtained, along with a mixture of dimeric products. Prof. D. B. G. William...|$|E
