5000|$|This game {{utilizes}} {{what are}} known as [...] "Dark Illusions"—specialty traps which are contained within the room of any given castle, and require a special sequence of triggers in order to be used. Furthermore, at certain points in the storyline, side stories can be explored which present some alternate scenarios from the main plotline, providing more backstory on the game's events. Included in the game's menu is a Survival Mode, which pits Allura against waves of invaders with only nine traps at her disposal—three ceiling, three wall, and three floor. Creating new traps necessitates the spending of [...] "Warl", like Ark and Dreak before it, and is done similarly to Kagero {{through the use of a}} <b>logical</b> <b>tree.</b> Secret traps and settings can be purchased with Warl by finishing the game and unlocking the three endings, collecting preset amounts of Ark, or by killing all encountered invaders.

The Akban project organizes visual materials in a semantic web. This is achieved by installing a Semantic wiki and starting to apply interrelations between the techniques of same and different martial arts. The videos and articles are tagged with categories and the categories hierarchically nestle inside meta categories using a <b>logical</b> <b>tree.</b> The semantic functions allow the Akban-wiki skilled user to give each article and video attributes and describe the relations between them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Group {{communications}} {{have been}} studied in the wired Internet {{for many years and}} remain a very hot research topic, especially on extending the existing achievements into mobile and wireless network environment. This paper identifies some interesting problems in mobile group communications regarding dynamic group membership due to member joining and leaving, dynamic locations due to node mobility, and dynamic networks due to node/link failures. These problems are solved by proposing a ring-based hierarchy of proxies with bi-directional tokens. The proposed hierarchy is a combination of logical rings and <b>logical</b> <b>trees,</b> which takes advantage of the simplicity of logical rings and the scalability of <b>logical</b> <b>trees.</b> More importantly, such a combination makes the proposed protocol based on this hierarchy more reliable than the existing tree-based protocols. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies of the proposed protocol show that: (1) It scales very well when the size of a group becomes large; (2) It is strongly resilient to failures that occur in the network. It is particularly suitable for those service providers and network operators which have deployed their machines in a hierarchical setting, where each machine can be locally configured to know the information about its sibling and parent machines...|$|R

We propose exploiting tree-based error recovery, well-established concept for reliable multicast in fixed networks, where a hierarchical <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> of a source and receivers is constructed over which the responsibility of error recovery is distributed. We introduce a new entity named ARMM (Agent for Reliable Mobile Multicast) located at each cell of wireless/mobile networks. Each ARMM participates in a <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> as a parent of mobile hosts in the corresponding cell. It is responsible for retransmission and requesting for retransmission on behalf of the mobile hosts. With aid of ARMM, the proposed scheme features (1) adaptive reconstruction of logical trees due to host mobility, (2) retransmission to mobile hosts via optimal routes, (3) abstracting a group of mobile hosts into a single ARMM (and thus reducing <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> maintenance overhead), (4) efficient use of wireless bandwidth for retransmission, and (5) low processing burden on mobile hosts themselves.

But there are many limitations like energy constraints, communication limitations and sensor node failures. Out of these the primary challenge is energy limitation and prolonging the network lifetime especially for sensors deployed in environments like battlefield surveillance, weather monitoring, disaster management that are not easily accessible. To overcome these limitations, several solutions have been proposed. In this proposed work, enhanced <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> based routing protocol is proposed to enhance the lifetime of the sensor networks. By simulation results the proposed ELTRP (Enhanced <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> based routing protocol) effectively reduces and balances the energy consumption among the nodes and thus significantly extends the network lifetime.

40|$|Packet losses tend {{to occur}} during short error bursts {{separated}} by {{long periods of}} relatively error-free transmission. There is also a significant spatial correlation in loss among the receiver nodes in a multicast session. To recover packet transmission errors at the transport layer, tree-based protocols construct a <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> for error recovery before data transmission is started. The current tree construction scheme does not scale well because it overloads the sender node. We propose a scalable recovery tree construction scheme considering these properties. Unlike the existing tree construction schemes, our scheme distributes some tasks normally handled by the sender node to specific nodes acting as repair node distributors. It also allows receiver nodes to adaptively re-select their repair node when they experience unacceptable error recovery delay. Simulation results show that our scheme constructs the <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> with reduced message and time overhead.

40|$|In recent years, Internet {{computing}} {{and wireless}} communications are converging. The converged networks are usually called mobile Internet. We propose a novel group communication model called the RingNet model or the RingNet hierarchy for group communications in mobile Internet. This hierarchy {{is a combination}} of logical rings and <b>logical</b> <b>trees,</b> which takes advantages of the simplicity of logical rings and the scalability of <b>logical</b> <b>trees.</b> More importantly, this combination makes this hierarchy highly resilient to failures compared to other hierarchies such as a tree-based hierarchy. Based on this hierarchy, we propose a novel group communication protocol in mobile Internet. The proposed protocol consists of three algorithms: membership propagation, topology maintenance, and multicast dissemination. The proposed protocol is local-information-based in the sense that each network entity in the hierarchy independently propagates membership information along the hierarchy, and that each network entity only needs to maintain local information about its neighbors for topology maintenance, and also that each network entity independently disseminates multicast messages to some of its neighbors. Simulation studies show that the proposed protocol based on the RingNet hierarchy scales very well when the size of the network becomes large, and that it is highly resilient to failures when the node failure probability becomes large.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{topology}} discovery in unicast <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> networks using endto-end measurements. Without any cooperation from the internal routers, topology estimation can be formulated as hierarchical clustering of the leaf nodes based on pair-wise correlations as similarity metrics. We investigate three types of similarity metrics: queueing delay measured by sandwich probes, delay variance measured by packet pairs, and loss rate measured also by packet pairs. Unlike previous work which first assumes the network topology is a binary tree and then tries to generalize to a non-binary tree, we provide a framework which directly deals with general <b>logical</b> <b>tree</b> topologies. Based on our proposed finite mixture model for the set of similarity measurements we develop a penalized hierarchical topology likelihood that leads to a natural clustering of the leaf nodes level by level. A hierarchical algorithm to estimate the topology is developed in a similar manner by finding the best partitions of the leaf nodes. Our simulations show that the algorithm is more robust than binary-tree based methods. The three types of similarity metrics are also evaluated under various network load conditions using ns- 2. ...|$|E
