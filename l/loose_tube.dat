50|$|The {{cable is}} a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> design that determines {{the amount and}} {{relative}} location along the transmission path of each type of fibre. Multiple fibre types {{are used in the}} cable: dispersion shifted and non-dispersion shifted.|$|E
50|$|Its showy hanging flowers have sepals {{which are}} reflexed, or folded {{backwards}} {{along the length}} of the flower. The sepals are fuchsia or purple. The petals are white and extend forward to form a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> from which the stamens emerge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> is {{the debut}} album by English jazz <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes.</b> It was {{released}} in 1985 as an LP on <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> Limited. The recording has never been reissued on CD.|$|R
50|$|The {{legacy of}} <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> {{continues}} strongly both through its former members, {{who continue to}} be leading lights of the UK music scene, and also its inspirational effect on younger musicians. F-IRE Collective founder Barak Schmool, {{who worked as a}} roadie for <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes,</b> cites <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> as a formative influence.|$|R
50|$|During {{this same}} period, {{all of the}} members of First House played {{permanently}} or occasionally with British jazz ensemble, <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes.</b> Django Bates, Ken Stubbs and Martin France all performed on the last 3 albums that <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> released - 'Dancing On Frith Street' (2010), 'Säd Afrika' (2012) and 'Arriving' (2015).|$|R
50|$|On {{graduating from}} Sussex University, England, in 1982 BA Music, Eacott's {{career as a}} {{musician}} started with anarchic jazzers Loose Tubes (trumpet,composer), post-industrial metal bashers Test Dept (trumpet, arranger,composer), Roman Holliday, acid jazz group Vibraphonic, and as a trumpeter with a diverse array of artists including Damon Albarn, Goldie, Stereo MCs, The The, Georgie Fame, Terry Edwards and the Scapegoats. He performed with <b>Loose</b> <b>Tube</b> (30 Years Anniversary concerts),and regularly plays with Sarah-Jane Morris, the hKippers, his own Cranky Trio and other bands.|$|E
50|$|The strain margin {{requirements}} tend to favour cable designs using multiple loose tubes. Tight-buffer cable designs {{do not provide}} sufficient strain margin and the optical fibre transmission performance is compromised under strong winds, heavy ice accretions and at high temperatures. In cables based on a single <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> design, the optical fibres have too much freedom of movement along the cable axis. Consequently, mechanical {{energy in the form}} of wind-induced vibration of the host conductor causes the optical fibres to move gradually ‘downhill’ and allowing the excess fibre length to collect in the low point of the span. This uneven distribution of excess fibre length compromises the optical performance of the cable with increased optical attenuation at low temperatures in the relatively crowded sections of tube in the middle of spans and at high temperatures where the fibres are under strain at the high sections close to the towers. These problems are worse on longer spans.|$|E
50|$|Chorispora tenella is {{a species}} of plant in the mustard family known by several common names, {{including}} purple mustard, blue mustard, musk mustard, and crossflower. This mustard is native to Eurasia but {{is well known in}} other parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions, as an introduced species and a noxious weed. This is an annual herb reaching a maximum of half a meter in height and covered abundantly in sticky foliage. The four tiny flower petals emerge from a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> of sepals and spread into a corolla about a centimeter wide. The flowers are lavender in color and a field heavily infested with purple mustard can take on a distinct lavender wash. The plant has a strong scent which is generally considered unpleasant. The fruits are long upturned cylindrical capsules about 4 centimeters long containing round, reddish-brown seeds. This is a tenacious weed which can be troublesome in agriculture. It reduces yields in grain fields and when it is consumed by dairy cattle it gives their milk a bad taste and odor. This plant reproduces by seed, so any control method preventing the plants from setting seed is effective.|$|E

5000|$|For use in more strenuous environments, a {{much more}} robust cable {{construction}} is required. In loose-tube construction the fiber is laid helically into semi-rigid tubes, allowing the cable to stretch without stretching the fiber itself. This protects the fiber from tension during laying and due to temperature changes. Loose-tube fiber may be [...] "dry block" [...] or gel-filled. Dry block offers less protection to the fibers than gel-filled, but costs considerably less. Instead of a <b>loose</b> <b>tube,</b> the fiber may be embedded in a heavy polymer jacket, commonly called [...] "tight buffer" [...] construction. Tight buffer cables are offered {{for a variety of}} applications, but the two most common are [...] "Breakout" [...] and [...] "Distribution". Breakout cables normally contain a ripcord, two non-conductive dielectric strengthening members (normally a glass rod epoxy), an aramid yarn, and 3 mm buffer tubing with an additional layer of Kevlar surrounding each fiber. The ripcord is a parallel cord of strong yarn that is situated under the jacket(s) of the cable for jacket removal. Distribution cables have an overall Kevlar wrapping, a ripcord, and a 900 micrometer buffer coating surrounding each fiber. These fiber units are commonly bundled with additional steel strength members, again with a helical twist to allow for stretching.|$|E
5000|$|The Trio's guitarist, Paul Burlison, {{explained}} that he noticed the sound after accidentally dropping his amplifier, which dislodged a power tube and later, [...] "whenever I wanted to get that sound, I'd just reach back and loosen that tube". He utilized this effect with the song's main instrumental feature, a three-note minor key guitar line repeated throughout. Burlison recounted how {{he came up with}} the signature guitar riff: was in the dressing room with the <b>loose</b> <b>tube.</b> Johnny Burnett was playing an E chord and I was playing in a G position but I'd take my fingers off and play in octaves the thumb and middle or index finger. He wasn't singing 'The Train Kept A-Rollin', it was another song, and I got to doing doom diddle doom daddle doom daddle ... Later I told Owen Bradley about it at the Barn, where we cut the stuff, and he said, 'let me hear it'. So I started doing it and he said, 'Well, let's do it'. The day after recording [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin', the trio recorded a version of Big Joe Turner's [...] "Honey Hush", which features a more extensive use of the riff. Coral Records released both songs on a single in September 1956.|$|E
40|$|Optical fibre cables {{are made}} by placing optical fibres inside a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> packed with a water based gel, and then winding these loose tubes on to a central {{strength}} member in helically wound sections of alternating twist separated by reversing sections. The length of the loose tubes and their position on the strength member was modelled along with an analysis of where the optical fibres lie in the loose tubes...|$|E

40|$|Cabling of {{dispersion}} compensating tibres (DCF) {{has been}} examined {{for the first}} time. The micro and macro bending performance has been evaluated and compared to standard non-shifted single mode fibres (SSMF). At 1550 nm, {{it is found that}} the macro bending performance of DCF is comparable to SSMF. At 1550 nm, the micro bending performance is better for DCF than SSMF. The wavelength dependence of both macro and micro bending loss is much steeper for DCF than SSMF. The DCF has been cabled in a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> cable with good result. Compared to measurement on fibre spools, the attenuation dropped both at 1550 and 1580 nm on all fibres. On five out of six fibres, the PMD dropped as well. The cable was temperature cycled between - 40 and 70 �C without any significant change in attenuation...|$|E
40|$|Cellulose is an {{important}} component of cell wall, yet its location and function in pollen tubes remain speculative. In this paper, we studied the role of cellulose synthesis in pollen tube elongation in Pinus bungeana Zucc. by using the specific inhibitor, 2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB). In the presence of DCB, the growth rate and morphology of pollen tubes were distinctly changed. The organization of cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking were also disturbed. Ultrastructure of pollen tubes treated with DCB was characterized by the <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> wall and damaged organelles. DCB treatment induced distinct changes in tube wall components. Fluorescence labeling results showed that callose, and acidic pectin accumulated in the tip regions, whereas there was less cellulose when treated with DCB. These results were confirmed by FTIR microspectroscopic analysis. In summary, our findings showed that inhibition of cellulose synthesis by DCB affected the organization of cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking in pollen tubes, and induced changes in the tube wall chemical composition in a dose-dependent manner. These results confirm that cellulose is involved in the establishment of growth direction of pollen tubes, and plays important role in the cell wall construction during pollen tube development despite its lower quantity...|$|E
