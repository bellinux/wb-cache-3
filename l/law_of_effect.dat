25|$|Operant conditioning, {{sometimes}} called instrumental learning, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874–1949), who observed {{the behavior of}} cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes. A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained the cats {{took a long time}} to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly. Thorndike generalized this finding in his <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>effect,</b> which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences strengthen behavior and some consequences weaken behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal learning curves through this procedure.|$|E
2500|$|These {{observations}} and others appear {{to contradict the}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>effect,</b> and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement [...] (e.g.) [...] A more general view is that autoshaping is an instance of classical conditioning; the autoshaping procedure has, in fact, {{become one of the}} most common ways to measure classical conditioning. [...] In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter’s task is to work out how these interact.|$|E

[...] Also, many experiments concerning his learning theory came from Hull’s students, who carried out many different experiments in Hull’s lab after finding inspiration from seminars and lectures in classes that Hull taught.|$|E

2500|$|Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) {{supported}} the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement. Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>effect</b> states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that learning is done {{a little at a}} time or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level. [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale. His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning: ...|$|E

As {{we found that the}} kinds of sentences which are theoretically best, are those generally employed by superior minds, and by inferior minds when excitement has raised them; so, we shall find that the ideal form for a poem, essay, or fiction, is that which the ideal writer would evolve spontaneously. One in whom the powers of expression fully responded to the state of feeling, would unconsciously use that variety in the mode of presenting his thoughts, which Art demands. This constant employment of one species of phraseology, which all have now to strive against, implies an undeveloped faculty of language. To have a specific style is to be poor in speech. If we remember that, in the far past, men had only nouns and verbs to convey their ideas with, and that from then to now the growth has been towards a greater number of implements of thought, and consequently towards a greater complexity and variety in their combinations; we may infer that we are now, in our use of sentences, much what the primitive man was in his use of words; and that a continuance of the process that has hitherto gone on, must produce increasing heterogeneity in our modes of expression. As now, in a fine nature, the play of the features, the tones of the voice and its cadences, vary in harmony with every thought uttered; so, in one possessed of a fully developed power of speech, the mould in which each combination of words is cast will similarly vary with, and be appropriate to the sentiment.|$|E
6000|$|... § 50. Before inquiring {{whether the}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>effect,</b> thus far traced, {{explains}} {{the superiority of}} poetry to prose, it will be needful to notice some supplementary causes of force in expression, {{that have not yet}} been mentioned. These are not, properly speaking, additional causes; but rather secondary ones, originating from those already specified reflex results of them. In the first place, then, we may remark that mental excitement spontaneously prompts the use of those forms of speech which have been pointed out as the most effective. [...] "Out with him!" [...] "Away with him!" [...] are the natural utterances of angry citizens at a disturbed meeting. A voyager, describing a terrible storm he had witnessed, would rise to some such climax as--"Crack went the ropes and down came the mast." [...] Astonishment may be heard expressed in the phrase--"Never was there such a sight!" [...] All of which sentences are, it will be observed, constructed after the direct type. Again, every one knows that excited persons are given to figures of speech. The vituperation of the vulgar abounds with them: often, indeed, consists of little else. [...] "Beast," [...] "brute," [...] "gallows rogue," [...] "cut-throat villain," [...] these, and other like metaphors and metaphorical epithets, at once call to mind a street quarrel. Further, it may be noticed that extreme brevity is another characteristic of passionate language. The sentences are generally incomplete; the particles are omitted; and frequently important words are left to be gathered from the context. Great admiration does not vent itself in a precise proposition, as--"It is beautiful"; but in the simple exclamation--"Beautiful!" [...] He who, when reading a lawyer's letter, should say, [...] "Vile rascal!" [...] would be thought angry; while, [...] "He is a vile rascal!" [...] would imply comparative coolness. Thus we see that alike in the order of the words, in the frequent use of figures, and in extreme conciseness, the natural utterances of excitement conform to the theoretical conditions of forcible expression.|$|E

60|$|It is {{necessary}} here to remark, {{that in this}} resolution <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> a complex <b>effect,</b> the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> which it is compounded {{are not the only}} elements. It is resolved into the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the separate causes, together with the fact of their co-existence. The one is as essential an ingredient as the other; whether the object be to discover the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effect,</b> or only to explain it. To deduce the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the heavenly motions, we require not only to know the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> a rectilineal and that of a gravitative force, but the existence of both these forces in the celestial regions, and even their relative amount. The complex <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> causation are thus resolved into two distinct kinds of elements: the one, simpler <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> causation, the other (in the aptly selected expression of Dr. Chalmers) collocations; the collocations consisting in the existence of certain agents or powers, in certain circumstances of place and time. We shall hereafter have occasion to return to this distinction, and to dwell on it at such length as dispenses with the necessity of further insisting on it here. The first mode, then, of the explanation <b>of</b> <b>Laws</b> <b>of</b> Causation, is when the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> an <b>effect</b> is resolved into the various tendencies of which it is the result, together with the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> those tendencies.|$|R
60|$|It appears, then, that in {{the second}} of the three modes in which a law may be {{resolved}} into other laws, the latter are more general, that is, extend to more cases, and are also less likely to require limitation from subsequent experience, than the law which they serve to explain. They are more nearly unconditional; they are defeated by fewer contingencies; they are a nearer approach to the universal truth of nature. The same observations are still more evidently true with regard to the first of the three modes of resolution. When the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> an <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> combined forces is resolved into the separate <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the causes, the nature of the case implies that the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effect</b> is less general than the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> any of the causes, since it only holds when they are combined; while the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> any one of the causes holds good both then, and also when that cause acts apart from the rest.|$|R
