In October 1835, he began [...] "translating an alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arranging a grammar of the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients." [...] In doing so, Smith worked closely with Cowdery and Phelps. The result of this attempted deciphering was a collection of documents and manuscripts {{now known as the}} Kirtland Egyptian papers. One of these manuscripts was a bound book simply titled [...] "Grammar & Aphabet of the Egyptian Language", which contained Smith's interpretations of the Egyptian glyphs. The first part of the book focuses almost entirely on deciphering Egyptian characters, and the second part deals with a form of astronomy that was supposedly practiced by the ancient Egyptians. The majority of the pages in this tome were penned in July 1835, and of note, most of the writing in the book was written—not by Smith—but rather by a scribe taking down what Smith said. The [...] "Egyptian Alphabet" [...] manuscript is particularly important because it illustrates how Smith attempted to translate the papyri. First, the characters on the papyri were transcribed onto the left-hand side of the book. Next, a postulation as to what the symbols sounded like was devised.

5000|$|Gat employs {{his concept}} of color to convey the blazing Mediterranean sun, the earth, from the sands and {{the flesh of the}} mountains. Heat is the Israel land factor in his works. The green {{surfaces}} of his canvases resemble oases' saturated shadows in a desert of fire. [...] "I'm a painter of Israel's heat, not necessarily of its light'" [...] he says. Gat adopts the harmonious synthetic color approach.By intentionally admixing strong colors to create a synthesis of contrasts ("in this country both the light and the shade are hot"), he joins an Israeli impressionist landscape tradition which developed in the thirties under the influence of French painting ("painting the landscape, {{we have no choice but}} to be impressionists" [...] Menahem Shemi said at the time). The color contrasts in Gat's paintings also have an emotional quality. The express the painter's dynamic impression of the subject. The multiple rapid strokes,while conveying the dancing light, are also lines of rhythm, conveying not so much the rhythm of the landscape as the psychological rhythm of being moved by it. The line, rather than forming a structural foundation, constitutes a driving force, the embodiment of energy and movement in the painting process. It does not serve to separate areas; on the contrary, it unifies them with its vibration.the contour lines of the objects blend like arabesques in the general weave of the brushstrokes. Gat in both a colorist and a draftsman. The translucent air of Israel renders colors in a distance as strong as those near by, hence the colors are spread over the canvas in equal intensity. Thus Gat creates a uniform surface reminiscent of abstract painting which, in addition to its identification as a landscape having a spatial depth and linear perspective, constitutes yet another <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Like in the abstract mode, Gat institutes a complex reworking of the canvas surface: opaque alongside transparent, dry with glowing, translucent and turbid, rough and smooth - all these qualities are distributed evenly over the canvas without a particular faithfulness to the depicted landscape.At the same time, Gat is not an advocate of the intellectual structuring of a composition. Everything flows in this paintings and, like in a free sketch, he preserves the heat of the pictorial process.|$|E

40|$|In this work, I propose an {{analytical}} rubric called the Interpretive Spiral designed {{to examine the}} process through which players create meaning in videogames, by examining their composition in three categories, across four levels of interaction. The most familiar of the categories I propose is the Mechanical, which refers to the rules, logic, software and hardware that composes the core of videogames. My second category, which I call the Thematic, {{is a combination of}} Arsenault and Perron's Narrative Spiral of gameplay, proposed in their Magic Cycle of Gameplay model (accounting for embedded text, videos, dialog and voiceovers) and Jason Begy's audio-visual level of his Tripartite Model of gameplay (accounting for graphics, sound effects, music and icons), though it also accounts for oft-neglected features such as interface and menu design. The third category, the Affective, refers to the emotional response and metaphorical parallels inspired by the combination of the other two levels. The first level of interaction I explore actually precedes gameplay, as it is common for players to begin interpreting games before playing them, and is called the Pre-Play <b>Level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Next I examine the Fundamental <b>Level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> which entails the learning phase of gameplay. The Secondary Level of gameplay is the longest level of play and describes the shift from learning the game to informed, self-conscious play. The Third and final, elective <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> is where the player forms connections between his gameplay experience, and other concepts and experiences that exist outside of the game artifact.
