2500|$|Peggy Moffitt modeled {{the suit}} for Gernreich. She {{said it was}} a logical {{evolution}} of Gernreich's avant-garde ideas in swimwear design as much as a scandalous symbol of the permissive society. In the 1960s, the monokini led the way into the sexual revolution by emphasizing a woman's personal freedom of dress, even when her attire was provocative and exposed more skin than had been the norm during the more conservative 1950s. Like all swimsuits, the monokini bottom portion of the swimsuit can vary in cut. Some have g-string style backs, while others provide full coverage of the rear. The bottom of the monokini may be high cut, reaching to the waist, with high cut legs, or may be a much <b>lower</b> <b>cut,</b> exposing the belly button. The modern monokini, which is less racy than Gernreich's original design, takes its design from the bikini, and is also described as [...] "more of a cut-out one-piece swimsuit," [...] with designers using fabric, mesh, chain, or other materials to link the top and bottom sections together, though the appearance may not be functional, but rather only aesthetic. In recent years, the term has come into use for topless bathing by women: where the bikini has two parts, the monokini is the lower part. Where monokinis are in use, the word bikini may jokingly refer to a two-piece outfit consisting of a monokini and a sun hat. The original monokini is still sold by Victoria's Secret as a half-kini.|$|E

60|$|Section 123. Figure 2 gives a dorsal {{view of the}} rabbit's brain; a {{horizontal}} slice has been taken {{at the level of}} the corpus callosum. The lateral ventricle (i.e., the hollows of the hemisphere) is not yet opened. A <b>lower</b> <b>cut</b> (Figure 3) exposes this (V.L.). The level of these slices is approximately indicated in Figure 1 by the lines A and B. This latter figure will repay careful examination. The arrow, ar., plunges into the third ventricle, behind the great middle commissure (m.c.), and the barb is supposed to lie under the roof of the mid-brain, the corpora quadrigemina (c.q.). The position of ar. is also indicated in Figure 1. Before reading on, the beginner should stop a while here; he should carefully copy or trace our figures and, putting the book aside, name the parts, and he should then recopy, on an enlarged scale, and finally draw from memory, correct, and again draw. By doing this before the brain is dissected a considerable saving of time is possible.|$|E

The fraction of multiple events at LHCb is high; a veto on those events frees bandwidth for <b>lowering</b> <b>cuts</b> of zero-level hadronic triggers.

In these periods, firms incur <b>lower</b> <b>cuts</b> in investment expenditures when they can obtain extra credit.

25|$|During {{the diamond}} cutting process, the diamond cutter {{wants to get}} the {{heaviest}} diamond out of a rough stone. However, this can come {{at the cost of}} <b>lowering</b> <b>cut</b> grade. If a diamond is too deep, the carat weight will increase but result in a loss of brilliance due to light leakage. Diamond cutters have to contend with working a stone to its best finished form with the least amount of waste. This strategy depends {{on the quality of the}} stone and its final proportions. If two diamonds of equal weight are inspected there can be a noticeable difference in size when viewed from above; arguably the most important view. A well cut 0.90ct diamond for example could have the same width as a poorly cut 1.00ct diamond. This phenomenon is known as spread.|$|R
50|$|Boy shorts or boyshorts, {{also known}} as boy short panties, boys' cut, booty shorts, shorties, or boyleg briefs {{are a kind of}} women's {{underwear}} that goes {{all the way down the}} hips, named for their similarity in looks to men's knit boxer shorts, which themselves are a variation on traditional boxer shorts. Some even resemble men's briefs, complete with fly and contrast trim. Unlike men's briefs, however, this style is usually <b>lower</b> <b>cut,</b> and is designed to fit and flatter a woman's figure. Boy shorts often cover most of the buttocks area, therefore keeping privacy at maximum while still having comfort.|$|E
50|$|For most skating a {{high boot}} is used, which {{provides}} more ankle support and {{is easier to}} skate in, particularly for beginners. Speed skaters often use a carbon fiber boot which provides greater support with a <b>lower</b> <b>cut</b> allowing more ankle flexion.For recreational skating a soft boot is used for greater comfort, but many other disciplines prefer a harder boot, either to protect the foot against impact or for better control of the skate. The boot may also contain shock absorbent padding for comfort. Downhill skaters often use boots that are heat-molded {{to the shape of}} the foot, with a foam liner.|$|E
5000|$|NBRC-TMC — The Therapist Multiple-Choice Examination is {{designed}} to objectively measure essential knowledge, skills, and abilities required of entry-level respiratory therapists, as well as determine eligibility for the Clinical Simulation Examination.

30|$|Referring to Table  3, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that the fuzzy formulation led to lower costs for all cuts compared with the deterministic mode. However, cuts greater than 0.6 resulted in an equal value for the annual fixed cost. In order to compare the results {{with respect to the}} elapsed solution time (i.e., the CPU time), it is apparent that the deterministic mode needs a rather small time although the <b>lower</b> <b>cuts</b> do the same. However, it indicates an approximately ascending order, so the last cuts required much more time that the first ones. On the other hand, the average customers' satisfaction measure showed the third lowest value for the deterministic mode. However, the measure increases as the cut magnitude goes up until it reaches the maximum value and then starts to decrease.|$|R
30|$|The Box {{osteotomy}} {{described by}} Agarwala et al. in 2001 also used a transverse lateral incision with the knee held in approximately 90 ° of flexion. The peroneal nerve is not explored. The anteroinferior {{part of the}} fibular head is excised and proximal tibiofibular joint removed. A trapezoidal-shaped osteotomy is performed on the lateral tibial cortex. The upper cut is made parallel to the joint; both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>cuts</b> are made to the medial cortex. The TT is left on the distal fragment with the posterior part curved to fit the anterior part of the trapezoid. The posterior fragment is shifted to posterior and lateral to cover the osteotomy surface. Offset staples are used for fixation. The graft obtained from the wedge is then placed around the staple [20].|$|R

5000|$|Symptoms {{of summer}} patch appear {{very similar to}} {{necrotic}} ring spot. This makes {{it very difficult to}} identify; if correct diagnosis is critical contact a local cooperative extension program or a qualified commercial lab. Although it is difficult to identify alone, if one takes into account grass species and cultural practices a trained eye can diagnose summer patch. Summer patch will appear as irregular patches, rings (less than 10 inches in diameter), and crescents. The [...] "frog eye" [...] appearance is often from the Poa annua being killed by the fungus while the middle living grass is Bentgrass. On <b>lower</b> <b>cut</b> turf, typically lower than 1.4 inches, summer patch is much easier to identify. A tug test can be performed and look for blackened roots. Yellowing and decline is often found on Poa annua in a mixed bentgrass area.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{picture of}} the Coulomb logarithm in the ideal plasma is controversial, the arguments for the <b>lower</b> <b>cut</b> off need revision. The two cases of far subthermal and of far superthermal electron drift motions are accessible to a rigorous analytical treatment. We show that the <b>lower</b> <b>cut</b> off b_ {{is a function of}} symmetry and shape of the shielding cloud, it is not universal. In the subthermal case shielding is spherical and b_ is to be identified with the de Broglie wavelength; at superthermal drift the shielding cloud exhibits cylindrical (axial) symmetry and b_ is the classical parameter of perpendicular deflection. In both situations the cut offs are determined by the electron-ion encounters at large collision parameters. This is in net contrast to the governing standard meaning that attributes b_ to the Coulomb singularity at vanishing collision parameters b and, consequently, assigns it universal validity. The origin of the contradictions in the traditional picture is analyzed...|$|E
