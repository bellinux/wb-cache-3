5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> model {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from Environmental Defense Fund, {{concluded}} that ILUC affects the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> and {{that instead of}} saving, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|A <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> (LCA) {{can help}} avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and {{economic}} concerns by assessing {{a full range of}} impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process: from extraction of raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling.

25|$|In recent years, the {{literature}} on <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> of energy technology has begun to reflect the interactions between the current electrical grid and future energy technology. Some papers have focused on energy life cycle, while others have focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. The essential critique given by these sources is that when considering energy technology, the growing nature of the power grid {{must be taken into}} consideration. If this is not done, a given class of energy technology may emit more CO2 over its lifetime than it mitigates.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations, Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) {{predicted}} that 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases come {{directly or indirectly}} from the world’s livestock. This report also suggested that the emissions from livestock were {{greater than that of}} the transportation sector. While livestock do currently play a role in producing greenhouse gas emissions, the estimates have been argued to be a misrepresentation. While the FAO used a <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> of animal agriculture (i.e. all aspects including emissions from growing crops for feed, transportation to slaughter, etc.), they did not apply the same assessment for the transportation sector.|$|E
25|$|Determining {{the balance}} of how the several effects of reuse {{interact}} is often best accomplished by a formal <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment.</b> For example, {{research has shown that}} reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete product life cycle. A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.|$|E

By using <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>assessment</b> can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E
