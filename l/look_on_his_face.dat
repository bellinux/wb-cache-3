5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E

25|$|For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to {{take several}} {{reference}} head shots {{and asked him to}} strike a sly <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> They showed him a rough of the Frank Frazetta-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film. Raimi ran into further troubles when the MPAA gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating. In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.|$|E
25|$|Muviro (Kevin Michael Richardson) - a treacherous Waziri warrior {{and one of}} Basuli's subordinates. Despite serving for Basuli, Muviro holds a {{personal}} hatred and jealousy against the chief's son, and is hostile towards outsiders (mainly Tarzan and his friends). Upon learning that Basuli is planning to get an eagle's feather with Tarzan's help {{as part of the}} customs for Basuli to marry and be future chief, Muviro secretly plotted to dispose of Basuli so that he himself can be the new chief. He caused several incidents during Tarzan and Basuli's journey: such as chopping down a tree into a river they were crossing over, disturbing a herd of rhinos to stampede after the duo and causing a rock slide on them in an elephant graveyard near the mountain. After the third attempt fails, Muviro reveals his true colors to both Tarzan and Basuli before engaging into a fight with the latter. Fortunately, Basuli defeats Muviro and banishes him from the tribe for his treachery, and Muviro is last seen walking away into the midst with an angry <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> implying that he might return to get revenge.|$|E
500|$|He was {{executed}} by electric {{chair on the}} morning of July 2, 1942. At the time of his execution, Waller had been on death row for 630 days, then the longest death row stay in the state's history. His funeral was held on July 5 and was attended by 2,500 people. Only one white person, WDL Secretary Morris Milgram, attended. Other whites had been asked not to come; a reporter wrote of the exclusion that [...] " [...] did not want 'Odell Waller's murderers' to <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in death".|$|E

500|$|After 1982, Weaver retired, and Ripken {{hoped to}} be a {{candidate}} for the managerial position. The Orioles announced they wanted someone with many years of experience for the job, but they went with Joe Altobelli instead. After Altobelli was fired in 1985, Ripken finally got his chance to manage, but it was only for one game in the absence of Weaver, who came out of retirement. On June 14, 1985, Ripken managed his son for the first time. The Orioles defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 83 that day, and Melody Simmons of the Baltimore Evening Sun wrote that Ripken had [...] "a Christmas-morning <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face...</b> the evening's purist, a Cinderella in spikes." [...] Ripken showed no disappointment over getting passed over each of those times, although he [...] "thought he was the choice" [...] in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E
500|$|In 1997 and 1998, Todd {{was given}} comedic {{partners}} {{similar to the}} set-up in comedy teams, in which the [...] "funny guy" [...] usually has a [...] "straight man" [...] who either sets up the joke or simply does not understand it. [...] Todd's first partner was Charlie Briggs, portrayed by actor Robert J. Hogan. Hogan was first seen as Briggs in 1995, working for the rival publication The Banner before Todd [...] " [...] him away" [...] to work at his newspaper. Hogan said, [...] "Briggs {{had been on the}} show for 17 years, but they never showed him." [...] Scenes between Todd and Briggs typically involved Todd issuing [...] "some bizarre order" [...] to Briggs, or Todd asking Briggs a [...] "way-out question" [...] that was often [...] "way out of line". During these scenes, Briggs would often respond with a stupefied <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Though Briggs appeared lost at some of Todd's comments, Todd was sometimes unable to realize that the joke was about him. Hogan felt Briggs was [...] "more than a match" [...] for Todd. [...] "You look at a kid yelling at you," [...] he said, [...] "and you can't take him seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|On Easter weekend 1991, Kennedy {{was at a}} get-together at the family's Palm Beach, Florida, estate when, {{restless and}} maudlin after reminiscing about his brother-in-law, he left for a late-night visit to a local bar, getting his son Patrick and nephew William Kennedy Smith to {{accompany}} him. Patrick Kennedy and Smith returned with women they met there, Michelle Cassone and Patricia Bowman. [...] Cassone said that Ted Kennedy subsequently walked in on her and Patrick, dressed only in a nightshirt and with a weird <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Smith and Bowman {{went out on the}} beach, where they had sex that he said was consensual and she said was rape. The local police made a delayed investigation; soon Kennedy sources were feeding the press with negative information about Bowman's background and several mainstream newspapers broke a taboo by publishing her name. The case quickly became a media frenzy. While not directly implicated in the case, Kennedy became the frequent butt of jokes on The Tonight Show and other late-night television programs. Time magazine said Kennedy was being perceived as a [...] "Palm Beach boozer, lout and tabloid grotesque" [...] while Newsweek said Kennedy was [...] "the living symbol of the family flaws".|$|E
500|$|Pam {{says that}} her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) always makes her great Christmas gifts so {{she wants to make}} him one too. She creates a {{hand-drawn}} comic book about Jim who gets attacked by a radioactive bear and takes its powers. She asks for others' opinions before giving it to Jim, but most of them give her harsh critiques. Jim gives Pam a beautiful bracelet and he is equally amazed at the comic book she gives him. Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is too afraid to go outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight is fear, and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E
