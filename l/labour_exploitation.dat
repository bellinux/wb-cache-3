In 2011, Giammarinaro was interviewed on CNN's Freedom Project - Ending Modern Slavery by Jim Clancy, drawing attention to the growing problem of trafficking for <b>labour</b> <b>exploitation</b> and child trafficking in Europe.|$|E

The founders of the HDP, Yavuz Önen and Fatma Gök, both {{emphasised}} the HDP's fundamental principle of rejecting capitalism and <b>labour</b> <b>exploitation</b> for the benefit of all Turkish citizens regardless of race, gender or religion. The party in this sense is therefore secular, though has refrained from endorsing the secularism enshrined in the principles of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The HDP has also called for a new constitution that enshrines minority rights for Kurds, Alevis and other minorities.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{communism}} and {{collapse of the}} Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has contributed {{to an increase in}} human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. Russia is a country of origin for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Russia is also a destination and transit country for persons trafficked for sexual and <b>labour</b> <b>exploitation</b> from regional and neighbouring countries into Russia and beyond. Russia accounted for one-quarter of the 1,235 identified victims reported in 2003 trafficked to Germany. The Russian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticised for failing to develop effective measures in law enforcement and victim protection.|$|E

Speaking at the UN General Assembly in 2010, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, its Causes and Consequences noted women’s particular vulnerability and increased risk of experiencing violence following disasters. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, large numbers of women and girls living in Internally Displaced Persons camps experienced sexual violence. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recognized the need for state actors to respond to gender-based violence committed by private actors, {{in response to a}} petition by Haitian groups and human rights lawyers calling on the Haitian government and international actors to take immediate measures—like increasing lighting, security, and access to medical care—to address sexual violence against women and girls in the IDP camps.|$|E
25|$|From October 1940 to May 1942, about 4,000 Jewish {{people were}} {{deported}} from Będzin to slave labour in {{the rapidly growing}} number of camps. Until October 1942 the internal boundaries of the Ghetto remained unmarked. No fence was built. The area was defined by neighbourhoods of Kamionka and Mała Środula bordering the Sosnowiec Ghetto, with the Jewish police placed by the SS along the perimeter. As {{was the case in}} other ghettos across occupied Poland, German authorities exterminated most of the Jews of Będzin during the murderous Operation Reinhard, deporting them to Nazi death camps, primarily to nearby Auschwitz-Birkenau for gassing. During this time, the leaders of the Jewish community in Zagłebie including Moshe Merin (Mojżesz Merin, in Polish) cooperated with the Germans {{in the hope that the}} survival of the Jews might be tied to their forced <b>labour</b> <b>exploitation.</b> It was a false assumption.|$|E
