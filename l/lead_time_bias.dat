Development of metastatic spread was detected in 112 patients during this period and classified as early phase or advanced phase based on tumor load and operability. The impact of <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias</b> on differences in survival probabilities was examined using different statistical approaches. Of 59 patients with metastases detected in an early phase of development, 64. 4 % died of CM, of 43 patients with advanced phase metastases 86 % died (P= 0. 013). The 10 -year overall survival probability was 42. 6 % for early and 25. 6 % for advanced phase metastases (P= 0. 012). This comparison remained significant after adjustment for sojourn time. Multivariate analysis identified detection of early phase metastases (P= 0. 022) and stage at primary diagnosis (P< 0. 0001) as independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, this long-term follow-up study showed a factual gain in survival time for the detection of metastasis in an early phase of development beyond <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias.</b> The classification of metastasis detected in early and advanced phase may be used in future studies aiming to improve melanoma surveillance...|$|E

In the node-positive group, recurrence occurred sooner and their primary tumors were larger.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discuss the}} merits of the patient follow up study design for the {{evaluation}} of some specific mass screening programmes. DESIGN: Theoretical evaluation illustrated by two examples. SETTING: Department of Public Health Erasmus University Rotterdam. MAIN RESULTS: The gold standard for evaluation of favourable effects of screening is the randomised controlled trial (RCT). Application of an RCT, however, is often not feasible, in which cases observational studies will have to be relied on. The case-control study design is generally considered to be second best. In some situations, however, a patient follow up study design may be applicable and may have some major advantages. The use of the patient follow up design for screening evaluation will often be very problematic or even unacceptable, particularly as far as screening for cancer is concerned. The most important objections are resulting from <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias,</b> length bias, selection bias and over-treatment bias. For the evaluation of screening for congenital heart disease and congenital hip dislocation in Dutch child health care, however, these objections may relatively simply be overcome. <b>Lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias</b> will be of little importance, as the ages of onset of these disorders are fixed, namely at birth, and their ultimate outcomes may be expected within relatively short time. Length bias may largely be avoided by correction for severity of the disorder, which can be adequately assessed by modern diagnostic procedures. Selection bias is generally hard to rule out, but in these cases it probably plays a minor part. Over-treatment can be avoided by the policy of "watchful waiting", which in these disorders can be applied with little risk for fatal outcomes. In principle bias might be avoided more successfully in a case-control screening evaluation than in a patient follow up study. However, the patient follow up study is for both screening programmes discussed here the more feasible design and can provide more supplementary information. The results of two example studies suggest that both screenings probably yield considerable benefits CONCLUSION: Under a number of specific conditions a patient follow up study is an efficient alternative to more customary designs for screening evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Metastatic {{breast cancer}} (MBC) is a {{heterogeneous}} disease {{that has a}} variety of different clinical scenarios, ranging from solitary met-astatic lesions to diffuse and multiple organ involvement. Overall, survival of patients with MBC is slowly but steadily improving (1) —the risk of death is decreasing by 1 %– 2 % each year (2). The greatest improvement is most probably related to the development and widespread availability of modern systemic therapies (3). In addition, modern diagnostic tools allow the detection of early met-astatic disease, which may be more responsive to treatment than late metastatic disease (4, 5). However, earlier diagnosis of meta-static disease may also result in a <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias,</b> falsely increasing the survival times of these patients (2).

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that transition risks from initial clinical high risk (CHR) status to psychosis are decreasing. The role played by remission {{in this context is}} mostly unknown. The present study addresses this issue by means of a meta-analysis including eight relevant studies published up to January 2012 that reported remission rates from an initial CHR status. The primary effect size measure was the longitudinal proportion of remissions compared to non-remission in subjects with a baseline CHR state. Random effect models were employed to address the high heterogeneity across studies included. To assess the robustness of the results, we performed sensitivity analyses by sequentially removing each study and rerunning the analysis. Of 773 subjects who met initial CHR criteria, 73 % did not convert to psychosis along a 2 -year follow. Of these, about 46 % fully remitted from the baseline attenuated psychotic symptoms, as evaluated on the psychometric measures usually employed by prodromal services. The corresponding clinical remission was estimated as high as 35 % of the baseline CHR sample.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patient demographics, primary tumour characteristics and overall survival (OS) in 550 advanced CRC patients with metachronous vs synchronous metastases, who participated in the phase III CAIRO study. For this purpose only patients with a prior resection of the primary tumour were considered. RESULTS: The clinical and pathological characteristics associated with poor prognosis that we observed more often in patients with synchronous metastases (n= 280) concerned an abnormal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (P= 0. 01), a worse WHO performance status (P= 0. 02), primary tumour localisation in the colon (P= 0. 002) and a higher T stage (P= 0. 0006). No significant difference in median OS was observed between patients with synchronous metastases and metachronous metastases (17. 6 vs 18. 5 months, respectively, P= 0. 24). CONCLUSION: Despite unfavourable clinicopathological features in patients with synchronous metastases with a resected primary tumour compared to patients with metachronous metastases, no difference in the median OS was observed. Possible explanations include a (partial) chemoresistance in patients with metachronous disease because of previous adjuvant treatment, whereas {{differences between the two groups}} in screening procedures resulting in a <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias</b> to diagnosis or in prognostic molecular markers remain speculative...|$|E

40|$|To improve {{hydrological}} predictions, real-time measurements {{derived from}} traditional physical sensors are integrated within mathematic models. Recently, traditional sensors are being complemented with crowdsourced data (social sensors). Although measurements from social {{sensors can be}} low cost and more spatially distributed, other factors like spatial variability of citizen involvement, decreasing involvement over time, variable observations accuracy and feasibility for model assimilation {{play an important role}} in accurate flood predictions. Only a few studies have investigated the benefit of assimilating uncertain crowdsourced data in hydrological and hydraulic models. In this study, we investigate the usefulness of assimilating crowdsourced observations from a heterogeneous network of static physical, static social and dynamic social sensors. We assess improvements in the model prediction performance for different spatial–temporal scenarios of citizen involvement levels. To that end, we simulate an extreme flood event that occurred in the Bacchiglione catchment  (Italy) in May 2013 using a semi-distributed hydrological model with the station at Ponte degli Angeli (Vicenza) as the prediction–validation point. A conceptual hydrological model is implemented by the Alto Adriatico Water Authority and it is used to estimate runoff from the different sub-catchments, while a hydraulic model is implemented to propagate the flow along the river reach. In both models, a Kalman filter is implemented to assimilate the crowdsourced observations. Synthetic crowdsourced observations are generated for either static social or dynamic social sensors because these measures were not available at the time of the study. We consider two sets of experiments: (i)  assuming random probability of receiving crowdsourced observations and (ii)  using theoretical scenarios of citizen motivations, and consequent involvement levels, based on population distribution. The results demonstrate the usefulness of integrating crowdsourced observations. First, the assimilation of crowdsourced observations located at upstream points of the Bacchiglione catchment ensure high model performance for high lead-time values, whereas observations at the outlet of the catchments provide good results for short <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> Second, <b>biased</b> and inaccurate crowdsourced observations can significantly affect model results. Third, the theoretical scenario of citizens motivated by their feeling of belonging to a community of friends has the best effect in the model performance.

We address this by estimating the effect of screen detection on cause-specific fatality in breast cancer, corrected for all potential biases, using population cancer registry data. Subjects (= 26, 766) comprised all breast cancers notified to the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit and diagnosed in women aged 50 – 74, from 1988 to 2004. These included 10, 100 screen-detected and 15, 862 symptomatic breast cancers (6, 009 women with interval cancers and 9, 853 who had not attended screening). Our endpoint was survival to death from breast cancer. We estimated the relative risk (RR) of 10 -year cause-specific fatality (screen-detected compared to symptomatic cancers) correcting for <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias</b> and performing sensitivity analyses for length bias. To exclude self-selection bias, survival analyses were also performed with interval cancers as the comparator symptomatic women.

40|$|Background. Although the {{randomized}} controlled trial (RCT) {{is widely considered}} the most reliable method for evaluation of health care interventions, challenges to {{both internal and external}} validity exist. Thus, the efficacy of an intervention in a trial setting does not necessarily represent the real-world performance that decision makers seek to inform comparative effectiveness studies and economic evaluations. Methods. Using data from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), we performed a simplified economic evaluation of age-based management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) among women who were referred to the study with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). We used data from the trial itself to adjust for 1) potential <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> <b>bias</b> and random error that led to variation in the observed prevalence of CIN 3 by study arm and 2) potential ascertainment bias among providers in the most aggressive management arm. Results. We found that using unadjusted RCT data may result in counterintuitive cost-effectiveness results when random error and/or bias are present. Following adjustment, the rank order of management strategies changed for 2 of the 3 age groups we considered. Conclusions. Decision analysts need to examine study design, available trial data, and cost-effectiveness results closely in order to detect evidence of potential bias. Adjustment for random error and bias in RCTs may yield different policy conclusions relative to unadjusted trial data.

In the present paper we describe some of the main features of version VII of this Database, assembled in year 2006. This update included all residents in Sweden born or immigrated in 1932 and later (offspring) with their biological parents, a total of 11. 5 million individuals. Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from years 1958 to 2004, including over 1. 2 million first and multiple primary cancers and in situ tumours. We show one application of the Database in the study of familial risks in prostate cancer, with special reference to the modification of familial risk at the time of about 50 % increase in incidence due to prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. The familial risks for prostate cancer were 1. 92 for sons of affected fathers, 3. 03 for brothers and 5. 44 for men with an affected father and an affected brother. Familial risk for prostate cancer according to the time since the first family member was diagnosed showed significant increases for two family members being diagnosed in the same year compared to 5 + years apart. Increased surveillance and the availability of PSA screening are the likely reasons for the overestimated familial relative risk shortly after the first diagnosis.

If <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is considered as variable, the models try to select the best value to minimize the cost and delivery time. Nielson and Michna (2016) developed an approach for designing order size dependent <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> models for use in inventory and supply chain management. Heydari et al. (2009) presented a study of <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variation impact on supply chain performance. <b>Lead</b> <b>time</b> is the duration between placing an order and receiving it. This duration is due to production, transportation, batch processing, etc., which may be long and stochastic. Long and stochastic <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> can interrupt the production process and inventory planning and also decrease service level (Louly and Dolgui 2013). In real cases, a supply chain may encounter long and stochastic <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> because of the competitive condition of today’s global trades. A Change in the production process, transportation, and inspection procedures leads to fluctuations in <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and, consequently, unexpected shortages/surplus in inventory systems (Sajadieh et al. 2009).|$|R
