5000|$|The {{evidence}} shows that CAFOs may be contributing to the drop in nearby property values. There are many reasons for the decrease in property values, such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenities,</b> potential risk of water contamination, odors, air pollution, and other health related issues. One study shows that property values on average decrease by 6.6% within a 3 mi radius of a CAFO and by 88% within 1/10 of a mile from a CAFO. Proponents of CAFOs, including those in farm industry, respond by arguing that the negative externalities of CAFOs are limited. One executive in the pork industry, for instance, claims that any odor or noise from CAFOs is limited to an area within a quarter-mile of the facility. [...] Proponents also point to the positive effect they believe CAFOs have on the local economy and tax base. CAFOs buy feed from and provide fertilizer to local farmers. And the same executive claims that farmers near CAFOs can save $20 per acre by using waste from CAFOs as a fertilizer.|$|E

It examines the evolution, in Italy and in the European Union, towards compensation of non-pecuniary loss for breach of contract in legislation and case law. It also points out how in contracts Business to Consumers for services (like energy, telecommunication etc.) consumers are confident to receive the service as advertised. The breach of this promise causes a loss of the amenities that the service was supposed to bring. It can also result in an unfair competition action, which gains clients to the unfair competitor who, for the breach, pays less than what he gains. The Independent Authorities, which have to control the services’ market (as Energy, Telecommunication etc [...] ), should adequate the level of automatic compensation for the breach (to pecuniary and non pecuniary loss) to help deterrence...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong is {{notorious for}} her high {{construction}} accidents rates. Although the accidents rate {{has dropped from}} 350 per 1000 workers in mid 1980 to 60 per 1000 workers in 2007, it still accounted for nearly one-fifth of all the industrial accidents in Hong Kong. Contractors were economically pressed and battered by exorbitant compensation over the years. This paper presents a comprehensive study of non-fatal accidents compensation court cases from 2004 to 2008. Although approximately one-third of the cases with injured persons aged between 47 and 56, the percentage of court cases over construction employees by age group was highest in age group 17 - 26. In terms of trade of workers, General laborers/causal workers stood the highest, then came electrical technicians and painters/decorators/plasterers. The highest rates of injury were falling from height and hitting by falling objects. Increasing from HK$ 10, 997, 637 in 2004, the total compensation reached the peak of HK$ 39, 643, 353 in 2006. The heaviest compensation was HK$ 13, 800, 000 among 101 cases. Most {{of the victims were}} compensated under loss of earnings and Pain Suffering and <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>Amenities.</b> While general labourers marked the highest number of cases, less than one-fourth of them were awarded compensation which exceeded HK$ 1, 500, 000.

50|$|This <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity</b> {{and space}} {{was one of}} the major {{complaints}} of local groups during negotiations over further motorway widening connected to the Mangere Bridge duplication. Proponents of a restored beach eventually won a $18 million commitment from Transit New Zealand (now NZ Transport Agency), which was topped up by a further $10 million from Auckland City Council. The sum is to fund a large-scale new shoreline west of the motorway, connected to downtown Onehunga with new pedestrian/cyclebridges, and creating 11ha of new beach and headland landscape. Three designs out of seven initial competitors have been shortlisted for further work as of late 2009, and it is hoped to complete the restoration of the foreshore by mid-2014.|$|R
50|$|In Heil v.

50|$|The Southport to Liverpool line {{also had}} a through service to London Euston on weekdays, when a steam hauled train, {{generally}} {{of two or three}} carriages, would call at selected stations on the line including Blundellsands & Crosby and Waterloo. The train would leave the line after Bootle Oriel Road, to take the line round the city to join the main line into Lime Street. The through coaches were discontinued in 1966 when the Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston line converted to electric powered locomotives from steam power. To compensate for this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity,</b> British Rail introduced a diesel multiple unit service between Southport Chapel Street and Liverpool Lime Street. Generally five trains a day ran on weekdays. This service operated until Liverpool Exchange Station closed in 1977, when the trains from Southport were diverted, proceeding under the city to Liverpool Central Low Level.|$|R
50|$|On 21 September 1951 {{he was one}} of 35 people {{injured by}} the Weedon rail crash, the {{derailment}} of a passenger train on the West Coast Main Line near to Weedon Bec which killed 15 people. He was partially handicapped as a result and was awarded £47,720 damages by Mr Justice Pearce in the Queen's Bench Division in a judgment delivered on 1 April 1954, comprising £37,720 for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> earnings, £9,000 for pain, suffering and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity,</b> and £1,000 for out-of-pocket expenses. The damages awarded for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> earnings were not subject to tax, but the amount awarded did not take account {{of the fact that the}} net earnings retained by Gourley - if he had not been injured - would have been reduced substantially by tax. An appeal against the damages was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, but the House of Lords reduced the damages for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> earnings to £6,695, to take account of the hypothetical income tax and surtax that would have been due on the actual earnings, setting a legal precedent known as the Gourley principle that remains important in English law.|$|R

40|$|By definition, {{effective}} and efficient competitive markets need a supply side and a demand side. One criticism of electric restructuring efforts in many states {{is that most of}} the attention has been focused on the supply side, in a market focused on the short term. In general, the demand side of the market has been under-addressed. The objective of the New England Demand Response Initiative (NEDRI) is to develop a comprehensive, coordinated set of demand response programs for the New England regional power markets. NEDRI aims to maximize the capability of demand response to compete in the wholesale market and to improve the economic efficiency and environmental profile of the electric sector. To those ends, NEDRI is focusing its efforts in four interrelated areas: (1) ISO-level reliability programs, (2) Market-based price-responsive load programs, (3) Demand response at retail through pricing, rate design, and advanced metering, and (4) End-use energy efficiency resources as demand response. The fourth area, energy efficiency, is the subject of this framing paper. Energy efficiency reduces the energy used by specific end-use devices and systems, typically without affecting the level of service and without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity.</b> Energy savings and peak load reductions are achieved by substituting technically more advanced equipment, processes, or operational strategies to produce the same or an improved level of end-use service with less electricity. In contrast, load management programs lower peak demand during specific, limited time periods by either (1) influencing the timing of energy use by shifting load to another time period, or (2) reducing the level of energy use by curtailing or interrupting the load, typically with some <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> service or <b>amenity...</b>|$|R
