5|$|After another Chicago punt, the Colts {{advanced}} to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> score remained 16–14 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5|$|Both Burgoyne and Arnold {{understood}} {{the importance of}} the American <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need to control the heights there. After the morning fog lifted around 10 am, Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns. Baron Riedesel led the left column, consisting of the German troops and the 47th Foot, on the river road, bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river. General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, which would attack the heights, and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies, to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights.|$|E

The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E

5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking the}} 51st House {{district}} state house seat, representing Loveland, Marostica first faced a challenge from Kevan McNaught in the Republican primary. McNaught {{was endorsed by}} the Colorado Club for Growth, who criticized Marostica for his support of higher taxes and his use of eminent domain {{when he was a}} member the Loveland city council. Marostica edged out McNaught in the Republican primary by about 250 votes, or 5% of voters. In contrast with McNaught's conservative credentials, Marostica was considered by observers on both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right to be a moderate Republican; he supported Colorado's 2005 Referendum C, a loosening of state spending restrictions under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.|$|E

5|$|Kingsbury was {{originally}} {{assigned to the}} 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, but requested a transfer to the 2/14th Infantry Battalion to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted {{on the same day}} at a different recruitment centre. The pair undertook basic training at Puckapunyal, where they were assigned to the same section (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training. After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> marriage never took place.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{improves}} total burnup. A {{fuel rod}} is reprocessed {{after three years}} of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's focus now shifted {{towards the}} {{southern}} end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals Kienmayer and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could. Buxhowden, the commander of the Allied <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O'Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November 1757 the Prussian camp lay between Rossbach on the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> village of Bedra on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, {{commanding}} the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire's forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank {{near the town of}} Branderoda and their left at Mücheln. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.|$|E
5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953. He had accomplished this task by deft political maneuvering between both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right to achieve what no other ruler or political group in Indochina had managed, a relatively bloodless transition to independence. During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance {{while at the same}} time maintaining his nation's neutrality (guaranteed by the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E
