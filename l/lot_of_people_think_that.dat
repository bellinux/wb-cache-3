They are just different names for the same language, and the reason the names are different was to get around trademark issues.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In 2010, the {{clinical}} use of Denosumab for osteopororis´ treatment was approved in the EEUU. Even though a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is a bisphosphonate, actually it is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL. Hypothesis and objectives: The hypothesis {{of this article}} is that osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is an adverse effect of Denosumab. Material and method: Bibliographic review from the data base Pubmed and the virtual library of the UCM. Discussion and results: Denosumab, as an antiresorptive drug, gets its importance in the etiology of ONJ because of the excessive suppression of bone remodeling. In patients under treatment of this drug, we {{have to pay attention to}} the interval between the doses and the accumulative dose in order to evaluate the risk of developing it. The AAOMS suggests a multidisciplinary approach where the dentist assumes an important role, especially in prevention. Conclusions: We have to stop considering that the ONJ is only caused by bisphosphonates because other drugs such as Denosumab can also cause it. We should take preventative measures with this possibility. Introducción: En 2010 se aprobó en EEUU el uso clínico del Denosumab para el tratamiento de la osteoporosis. Aunque muchos lo confundan con un bisfosfonato, en realidad es un anticuerpo monoclonal que inhibe el RANKL. Hipótesis y objetivos: La hipótesis de este trabajo es que la osteonecrosis de los maxilares (ONM) es un efecto secundario del Denosumab. Material y método: Revisión bibliográfica desde la base de datos Pubmed así como en la Biblioteca de la UCM. Discusión y resultados: El Denosumab cobra su importancia en la etiología de la ONM por la supresión excesiva del remodelado óseo. Ante un paciente tratado con este fármaco hay que tener en cuenta el intervalo entre las dosis y la dosis acumulativa para evaluar el riesgo a desarrollarla. La AAOMS recomienda un abordaje multidisciplinar basado en la prevención. Conclusiones: Debemos modificar el término ONM por bisfosfonatos a ONM por fármacos. Esto hace que la historia clínica y la prevención sean fundamentales...|$|E
