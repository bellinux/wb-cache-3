5|$|Ancient Chinese Daoism, {{ancestor}} worship, and foreign-originated Buddhism {{were the}} most prominent religious practices in the Song period. Daoism developed <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> teachings of the Daodejing, attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ("Old Master"), {{considered one of the}} Three Pure Ones (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by Yuezhi, Persian, and Kushan missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|St Chad's Church, the Anglican parish church, is in {{the centre}} of town, {{bordering}} the market place. It has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. The current structure dates <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mid-18thcentury when the previous church was demolished, although the tower is from the 17thcentury. The church is constructed of stone and has a slate roof. A round Norman-style apse was added in 1868. The churchyard, mainly {{to the south and}} east of the building, is noted for its display of crocuses in the spring.|$|E

After a short debate, the House passed a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hardcore {{scene in the}} 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors {{to be far}} beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E

5|$|Jarrow, {{situated}} on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, {{as the home of}} Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little changed in the remote rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> influx of mineworkers.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> habitat loss and fragmentation {{produced by the}} human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and {{political}} changes, stemming <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities.|$|E

5|$|The emperor {{was at the}} {{pinnacle}} of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{significant}} migrations {{came as a}} result of the 19911995 Croatian War of Independence. In 1991, more than 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs were displaced by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence in areas with significant Serb populations. During the final days of the war, in 1995, between 120,000 and 200,000 Serbs fled the country before the arrival of the Croatian forces during Operation Storm. Ten years after the war, only 117,000 Serb refugees returned out of the 300,000 displaced during the entire war. Most of the Serbs in Croatia who remained never lived in areas occupied during the Croatian War of Independence. Serbs have been only partially re-settled in the regions they previously inhabited; some of these areas were later settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Republika Srpska.|$|E
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, {{it was a small}} city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized {{at the beginning of the}} century. During Japan's military buildup in the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city has shown a large increase in population in recent years, this trend results <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's economic revival strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Thornton {{returned}} to New Zealand {{to serve as}} the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army, and this was followed as a term from 1956 to 1958 as its Adjutant General. During this period, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1955, New Zealand {{became a member of the}} South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and in July 1958, Thornton moved to Bangkok, where he served as head of the Military Planning Office of SEATO. In this capacity, he gained valuable insight in the scenarios in which New Zealand's military might be expected to play a part. The following year he was promoted to acting major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the youngest ever to serve in this role which was effectively the commander of the New Zealand Army. This was to prove a challenging term for Thornton for, driven by the Labour Government, there was a significant change in New Zealand defence policy. Since the Second World War, defence planning had been based around the concept of an infantry division being raised <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Territorial Force. This had now changed to a self-sufficient brigade-sized force made up of a combination of Regular and Territorial Force personnel. While not a policy Thornton personally agreed with, he oversaw the reorganisation that was required to achieve the desired structure and this saw some longstanding regiments being amalgamated. In 1962, part way through his term as CGS, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{maintained}} {{the tradition of}} ruling {{with the support of}} advisers drawn <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aristocratic class. The queen's most powerful ministers were also her consorts. Her first chief adviser was a young army officer from Namehana named Andriamihaja, who served as First Minister from 1829 to 1830. Major-General Andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen's only son, Prince Rakoto (later King Radama II), who was born eleven months {{after the death of his}} official father, King Radama I. In the early years of Ranavalona's reign, Andriamihaja was the leader of her court's progressive faction, who favored maintaining the relations with Europe initiated under Radama. The conservative faction was led by the brothers Rainimaharo and Rainiharo, the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal sampy. These talismans were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the Merina people since at least the 16th century reign of Ralambo. The conservative faction conspired to reduce Andriamahaja's progressive influence over the queen, and in September 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason. He was immediately captured in his home and killed.|$|E
5|$|Tensions and the {{geographic}} {{differences between the}} working and ruling classes led to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made {{up as much as}} 80% of the population. Rebels, <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at Middle Plantation of the Treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of The College of William & Mary in 1693 and was renamed Williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699. In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company, with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains. France, which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). A militia from several British colonies, called the Virginia Regiment, was led by then-Lieutenant Colonel George Washington.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E
