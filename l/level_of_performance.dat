It first flew on 23 November 1943 but the manufacturer's flight tests were not completed until June 1944. Since several other aircraft with about the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> were already available, it was not placed into production.|$|E
5|$|At these concerts, Bache {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} soloist, accompanist or conductor, {{but he also}} engaged other artists {{in an attempt to}} show he was not giving the concerts out of self-aggrandizement. Bülow conducted two concerts, Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts. August Manns, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and an admirer of Liszt's works, led four concerts. The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> was as high as possible. Among guest soloists was the noted violinist August Wilhelmj, who played the Bach Chaconne in D minor at one concert.|$|E

Baggio managed 12 goals and 9 assists during the 2002–03 season, helping Brescia to an eighth-place finish and another UEFA Intertoto Cup spot. He scored his 300th career goal from a penalty on 15 December 2002, in Brescia's 3–1 home victory over Perugia, also setting-up one of Igli Tare's goals. Baggio {{was the first}} player in over 50 years to reach this milestone, and with 318 goals, he is the fourth-highest scoring Italian player in all competitions, behind only Silvio Piola, Alessandro Del Piero and Giuseppe Meazza.|$|E

However, Alonso and Button still qualified on the penultimate row of the grid ahead of the Manor Marussia drivers Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens. Both cars retired from the race with mechanical problems. The team did not score any points during {{the first round of}} flyaway races, struggling with poor reliability and a lack of engine performance; the Chinese Grand Prix was the only race where both cars were classified as finishing. Although Alonso repeated the team's best finish of eleventh place in Bahrain, any hope of improved performance was arrested with the start of the European season at the next round in Spain, where Button finished sixteenth and Alonso retired with brake problems.|$|E
5|$|While Totti was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, {{he was also}} renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, {{as well as his}} ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and wide range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, generous, quick and dynamic centre forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian. Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in his later career.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis is on researching of the {{correlation}} between a statement of the child's present <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and annual goals in the individualized education program for children with moderate mental retardation. Also, we want to discover how many team members are involved in both phases {{of the creation of}} the individualized education program. The theoretical part describes individualized education program, statement of the child's present <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> annual goals, teamwork and the population of children with moderate mental retardation. The empirical part deals with the analysis of 7 individualized education programs and 14 assessment scales {{of the members of the}} teams. We analyzed 7 individualized education programs by the criteria prepared for their evaluation. Assessment scales have been processed using SPSS Statistics 17. 0. The research results show a weak correlation between a statement of the child's present <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and annual goals because the planned goals don’t cover all the areas described in statement of the child's present <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> The research <b>of</b> assessment scales shows that individualized education programs are not based on team work. In most cases, each teacher forms an individualized education program for his area after which the class teacher combines all the programs into one. This is presented to parents who usually do not have any remarks and just sign the papers. The conclusion shows some possible suggestions and solutions to improve the correlation between a statement of the child's present <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and annual goals and also to improve cooperation between the members of the teams. ...|$|R
