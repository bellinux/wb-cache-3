40|$|The {{finite element}} {{modeling}} of an <b>airframe</b> <b>structure</b> requires knowledge of general purpose programs such as NASTRAN {{as well as a}} detailed understanding of the <b>airframe</b> <b>structure.</b> Due to the sophistication of general purpose programs such as NASTRAN, a substantial investment in time and effort is required to gain expertise in using them effectively. This paper describes the development of an expert system used in the validation of NASTRAN based finite element models. Experts in the NASTRAN based {{finite element modeling}} of <b>airframe</b> <b>structures</b> were interviewed to document, understand, and represent their knowledge and reasoning in the expert system. Finite element stress analysis and internal loads reports generated by the experts were reviewed to determine expert resolution of problem areas. As a result, areas requiring expert assistance in the modeling of the <b>airframe</b> <b>structures</b> were identified. The finite element input data is represented as a set of 'facts'. A rule based representation is used to code the expert knowledge. A hierarchical set of rules are applied. The expert system first acts as an intelligent front end to insure that all the prerequisites needed to perform the analysis are present. This includes material properties, boundary conditions, and connectivity information. The next step examines if incompatible sets of elements are connected. The succeeding step examines if the specific airframe component is modeled by the appropriate set of elements. The next and final step examines if the airframe members used are adequate to represent the anticipated state of stress. The expert system is designed to inform the user the severity of the error, the likely consequence and possible remedial action. The shell used {{in the development of the}} expert system is CLIPS. CLIPS contains a forward chaining inference engine based on the Rete algorithm. CLIPS may be implemented on most personal computers as well as mini computers and mainframes. The approach taken is general and can be implemented using commercially available expert system shells...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{experimentally}} derived compensation factors {{to account for}} missing environmental history (temperature and humidity) during fatigue testing of large composite structures (components). Compensation factors are either factor by which the fatigue tests is increased or by which the required residual strength has to be increased if preloading did not include environmental history. Preconditioned coupon specimens were subjected to accelerated quasirealistic mechanical and environmental flight-by-flight loading, and other coupon specimens were loaded exactly like the composite <b>airframe</b> <b>structure</b> (that is, with less complete simulated environment). Temperature and moisture content in residual strength testing were the same for surviving coupon specimens and the composite <b>airframe</b> <b>structure.</b> Different types of laminates and specimens were used to generate predominantly matrix shear stresses or fiber normal stresses within the coupon specimens. At present design load levels, the fatigue life to be proven was reached without failures of the coupon specimens subjected to the flight-by-flight load conditions of the component test or to quasirealistic combined mechanical and environmental loading...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing of {{composite}} structures {{with a high}} degree of dimensional accuracy remains a challenge in modern fabrication. Residual stresses in fibre reinforced laminates which develop during the autoclav processing lead to a variety of process induced deformations. Dimensional changes such as spring-in of angled structures and warpage of flat sections are characteristic for composite manufacturing. This paper presents an engineering approch for a thermo-elastic simulation of the spring-in effect on large <b>airframe</b> <b>structures</b> based on the FE method performed at the DLR Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems. Due to the use of Ni 36 as tooling material it was possible to blank out the influence of varying CTE between tool and part which are responsible for warpage. Investigations on small manufactured L-profiles with a flangelength of 50 mm deliver the necessary simulation parameters for the constitutive model of the relevant <b>airframe</b> <b>structure.</b> For estimating the influence of different autoclav processes on the amount of spring-in, investigations with different temperature profiles were conducted and will be presented...|$|R
