25|$|The {{career of}} most kisaeng was very short, {{generally}} peaking at age 16 or 17, and over by age 22.

All kisaeng were obliged by law to retire at age 50. The best prospect most kisaeng had for <b>long-term</b> <b>support</b> was through becoming the concubine of a patron. However, even this was not an option unless their patron first purchased them from the state, which few men of the Joseon period could afford.

25|$|Proponents of the Electoral College see its {{negative}} effect on third parties as beneficial. They argue the two party system has provided stability because it encourages a delayed adjustment during times of rapid political and cultural change. They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, <b>long-term</b> <b>support</b> across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections.

25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide <b>long-term</b> <b>support</b> the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E

We {{have chosen to}} use semi structurized interviews to achieve our goal of reaching the clients experience of <b>long-term</b> income <b>support</b> dependency. The study consists of interviews of six clients whose answers have been analyzed through appliance of Kielhofner´s Model of human occupation, Scheff´s Shame in self and society.    Our results show regarding, 1) the factor health that <b>long-term</b> income <b>support</b> dependency may elevate the risk of illness and less experienced options of possibilities to act. 2) regarding the factor goal setting, that goals may be inefficiently used during social work with <b>long-term</b> income <b>support</b> dependent clients and may result in a disorganized relationship between client and social worker in the sense of making the parties pull in opposite direction. 3) regarding the factor motivation, that <b>long-term</b> income <b>support</b> dependency and the living with the emotion of shame elevates the risk of maintaining a negative image of oneself that limits the willpower to assimilate new knowledge and/or skills. This also effects the clients belief in their own capacity to change their current negative situation. Which may impact the rate of success in motivational social work and the individuals own possibilities to live an independent life, free of income support. Throughout the study we have encountered the traces of shame as a social emotion and emphasize on the environments pressure for change and socialization. ...|$|R

500|$|According to Ubisoft, {{the game}} adopted a [...] "game as a service" [...] approach, {{as they would}} provide <b>long-term</b> <b>support</b> for the game and offer post-release content to keep players engaged. The {{management}} team initially doubted the idea, but eventually decided to approve it.

They also introduced an auto-kick system, which automatically removes players from a match when they kill a friendly player, and launched the BattleEye system in August 2016 to punish cheaters. All downloadable content maps was released to all players for free. The team avoided adding more modes to the game because most would not fit well with the game's close-quarter combat. Downloadable content for the game were divided into several seasons, with a Mid-Season Reinforcement patch which added new weapons and modified some of the operators' core abilities.
