40|$|The "Linking Directive" {{establishes}} {{a link between}} the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The <b>Linking</b> <b>Directive</b> allows installations within the EU ETS to use emission reduction units from joint implementation (JI) in order to comply with the emission caps in the scheme. This increases the geographical scope of the EU ETS and aim to ensure cost-efficient reductions are achieved. The <b>Linking</b> <b>Directive</b> will however considerably reduce the potential for JI in EU Member States due to the so-called double-counting provisions. This report examines the significance of the <b>Linking</b> <b>Directive</b> for the JI potential in the Baltic Sea Region. The report commences with a review of the double counting provisions set by the European Commission for JI host countries. Then it proceeds to examine, the status and implications of the <b>Linking</b> <b>Directive</b> in the countries of the Baltic Sea Region are described. Finally, an overview is given on the country studies and on the total potential for JI, the results are compared with JI potential elsewhere, and the prospects of Green Investment Schemes are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Despite initial scepticism in the EU {{towards the}} Kyoto Protocol’s project {{mechanisms}} (the CDM and JI), the "Linking Directive " was adopted in October 2004, connecting the EU emissions trading scheme {{with the project}} mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract: Main {{innovations}} {{in the field}} of water management and pollution control, introduced by legislation in Italy in the last decade, derive from a few general social trends, such as the awareness of the need for environmental protection and demand for improved public services management. In particular, two innovative principles, namely the sustainability of water use and the stakeholders participation in water resources planning and management, have affected the recent legislative acts. In this paper a review of Italian water legislation development on water resources use, flood defence, and pollution control is presented, indicating main <b>links</b> with European <b>directives.</b> On the basis of such a review, it is pointed out that legislators have tried to improve the institutional structure for planning and management of water supply systems, as well as to solve the conflicts between water withdrawal uses and ecological in-stream uses and to allow a wider public access to information on water issues. However, a very slow implementation of water reform has been experienced, particularly at regional level.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, August 2002, {{responded to}} a new cycle of global {{meetings}} {{that began with the}} Millennium Summit. The main characteristic of this new cycle is that the focus of the debate has moved away from declarations of principle toward identifying objectives and areas of concrete action, with quantitative commitments and deadlines for compliance. Debates about energy held an important position in Johannesburg. The positive links between access to energy, eliminating poverty and improving People's health and quality of life were emphasized. Although there was agreement on the need to expand the use of renewable energy resources and increase the percentage of energy produced from renewable sources, unlike other areas of debate, {{it was not possible to}} establish global targets and deadlines. Nonetheless, some regions, among them Latin America and the Caribbean through the Latin American and Caribbean Initiative for Sustainable Development, did agree on concrete targets. The Brasilia Regional Conference on Renewable Energy (Brasilia, October 2003), represented not only one of the first efforts to concretize the target agreed upon on at Johannesburg, but also the first joint meeting of authorities and representatives of Latin American and Caribbean Ministries of the Environment and Energy. This instance of convergence approved the Brasilia Platform on Renewable Energies, which establishes among its main points: To further efforts to achieve the goal set forth in the Latin American and Caribbean Initiative for Sustainable Development of ensuring that by the year 2010 the use of renewable energy by the region, taken as a whole, amounts to at least 10 % of its total energy consumption on the basis of voluntary efforts and taking into account the diversity of national situations. This percentage may be increased by those countries or subregions that voluntarily wish to do so. " As this paper reveals, in late 2002, Latin America and the Caribbean had already met the targets established in Brasilia, with renewable sources contributing more than one quarter of the Total Energy Supply 1 (25. 7 %), led by hydro-electric energy accounting for almost 15 %, sustainable fuelwood with 5. 8 %, and cane products with 4. 1 %. The rest of renewables, such as other biomass (0. 5 %) and geothermal (0. 7 %) are marginal, while wind and solar energy, although used, are yet not counted as part of energy supply. The region has an important store of both fossil and renewable resources. The reserve to production ratio stands at more than 35 years for oil and more than 40 years for natural gas, while hydroelectric power potential that is economically feasible stands at more than 500 GW, of which just 22 % is being used. Despite the resources available, no suitable development of geothermal energy is apparent and, at the same time, it would seem that the contributions of other technologies such as solar and wind power are not duly counted, as we will see below in the subregional analysis. In preparing this paper, ECLAC has sought to achieve the balanced integration of sustainable development's many components as its referential framework, so this study covers the economic, social, energy and environmental spheres using an integrated perspective. From this perspective, the target achieved by the region as a whole must be carefully analyzed, since there are clear differences between subregions and countries within subregions: -In terms of the store of natural resources and energy supply and consumption structures; -In terms of the institutions and baseline conditions for encouraging policies to promote and ensure the use of renewable sources. An analysis of the renewability of the total supply shows that Caribbean subregion " 1 " (including Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago) is well below the 10 % line, while Mexico is just slightly above it; this means these countries must make a significant effort if they want to achieve the target for renewables' share over total supply, in the case of the former, and to sustain it, in the case of the latter. Those subregions that have achieved the 20 % to 30 % range (the case of the Caribbean 2 subregion countries, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba, and the Andean Community) should act decisively in both political terms and in promoting renewable energy. Moreover, in certain Central American countries, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, the role of forest energy (wood fuel) is very important and if, on one hand, in terms of sustainable development this is positive, since it points to weak use of fossil fuels, on the other it is clearly negative, due to the strong impact on national forestry resources and the quality of users' lives. In contrast, in countries where the use of biomass for energy purposes is virtually non-existent, as in Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador, problems of sustainability could exist due to the heavy use of fossil fuels at the final industrial and residential level, and intermediate consumption in generating electric power. In these countries, hydrocarbons account for 80 % to 90 % of total energy supply Apart from this general positioning of the subregions and certain countries in terms of this initiative, other points of analysis arise that should be explored, due to both the medium-term implications of this positioning and the composition and structure of sustainability of the energy supply. The Residential Sustainability Index (RSI) reveals the importance of fuelwood in supplying families' basic calorie requirements, mainly for cooking, heat, and hot water. A high RSI means that the country is heavily dependent on fuelwood to satisfy the population's needs. This study has revealed a wide range of technologies using fuelwood combustion and conditions of use throughout the region, which are relevant in terms of energy efficiency and negative health effects. The RSI can also be read in terms of social liabilities, with reference to the general population's poverty levels and the access that people in marginal urban and rural areas have to better quality energy sources. Thus better quality sources are generally associated with a higher monetary cost, but also to greater efficiency and higher yields, to less time spent gathering fuel and to lower levels of household pollution. The subregions most dependent on fossil fuels (Caribbean 1 and Mexico) are below the RSI line of 20 %, as they are heavy users of secondary liquid hydrocarbons. In this case, they could post a consumption of useful energy and therefore a higher level of satisfaction of the basic requirements for caloric use, than the other subregions. At the opposite extreme are the Central American countries, with a ratio that is over 1. 4 times, which indicates not only an excessive dependence on fuelwood in both rural and marginal urban areas, but also an insufficient supply of the necessary basic calories, in terms of both access and quality. Another indicator that to some degree measures the sustainability of energy systems is the Polluting Electric Power Generation benchmark (Generación Eléctrica Contaminante), measured by the amount of CO 2 emitted as compared to total electric power production (tons CO 2 /GWh). Generation in the Caribbean subregions " 1 " and " 2 ", and Mexico, is particularly polluting in terms of CO 2 emissions. In Mexico's case, this reflects the dominant role of fossil fuels in generation (almost 70 % of the total is thermal). In the case of the Caribbean countries this role is clearly associated with a less efficient generation process with low yields in terms of thermal generation. As expressed above, the specific objective of this document has been to analyse the sustainability of energy supply to 2002. That is, we have attempted to portray the situation up to the year 2002, obtaining positive conclusions in some cases and questions in others. The application of a more dynamic, rather than static, analysis, remains pending. This would involve proposing a set of possible scenarios for the progress of Latin American and Caribbean countries and identifying the national, subregional and regional conditions that prevent those countries or subregions that do not meet the Latin American Initiative target from approaching these goals. Likewise, it could suggest ways for those that meet them, but run the risk of slipping below them, to redirect trends and policies toward the more sustainable development of their energy sector. The detection of specific barriers along with other actions should become the basis for public policies in favor of renewable energies. The barriers to implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy measures are well documented and generally fall into five categories: technical, regulatory, economic, financial and institutional. This document includes an analysis of these barriers and adds a new type of obstacle detected, which has to do with specific social behaviour in the region. From the diagnosis included in this study comes the need to develop and modernize institutional structures to truly integrate public policies and, moreover, encourage synergies with international financing and private investment. Thus, just as the most important task of the past decade was to build nvironmental institutions, the fundamental task for the coming decade must be to ensure that the environmental theme fully penetrates the economic and social agenda. An essential element in making the transition to the full incorporation of environmental sustainability into the economic agenda requires treating it as an opportunity and not merely a restriction on economic development. Similarly, it is necessary to reduce the room for multiple governmental errors that appears during the complex process of managing, formulating, articulating and coordinating public interventions. The quality of and interactions among an important set of organizations, institutions and public policies must also be improved; these are often considered separately, as if they were bodies with a life of their own, autonomous from each other. This is common in several of the cases examined, in which programs attempted to achieve wide penetration of renewable sources, but later proved to provide insufficient information and incentives to ensure the necessary integration, coherency and coordination of sectoral policies with each other and in relation to the general objectives of energy policy. Moreover, this was compounded by the fact that all subregions experience the presence of multiple, isolated international actors, governmental and intergovernmental, regional and extraregional bodies, NGOs, etc., which get involved in different policy spheres (generally speaking, project design and implementation). As a result, in the case of renewable sources, it is clear that political authorities and instances must be defined to establish the necessary mechanisms, as occurred with the process of reforming the energy system. Countries should therefore explicitly include in their strategic efforts a greater penetration of renewable sources that contribute to achieving greater energy security, and a more efficient energization in the framework of anti-poverty programs; mitigate environmental problems; and, given the greater use of external sources, permit foreign currency savings. This implies that alliances must be built with local groups, within the framework of international cooperation. Essentially this strategy proposes reproducing the conditions on which the changes arising from reforms depended. If these processes were accompanied by actions aiming to change the institutional organization, regulatory principles and coordination modes, then these same elements should be involved in renewable sources (i) to ensure stronger institutions, more in line with the proposal; (ii) to introduce fundamental modifications to existing regulatory frameworks; and (iii) to change market organization, the degree of jurisdictional decentralization, access conditions, and areas for the State to provide subsidies. This therefore assumes that in these three planes the State's role will be inevitable, as coordinator of the space created to ensure policy viability, intervening directly in investment implementation (rural electrification, for example), or through development tools, which make the participation of private investors attractive. Among the development instruments, taxes and subsidies that act on energy prices could be considered, along with a tax on the substitution of sources and/or on the penetration of cleaner sources, to encourage the rational use of energy, environmentally oriented objectives, and others. Undoubtedly, the dose of public intervention and the nature of incentives will depend on conditions in each country. Today, the issue of renewable energies is placed on the public agenda by those within the authorities or civil society who are concerned with the environment. This is useful for stimulating initiatives for their use, but is not consistent enough in the framework of energy policies, which have tended to give priority to conventional sources, because upon approaching energy from an essentially economic perspective, renewable energies end up in the background due to their higher entry costs. This situation is slowly changing, however, since other issues on the public agenda, linked one way or another with the use of renewable energies, today hold a prominent place in the concerns of national and in some cases sub-national governments, in most of the region's countries. The different initiatives apparent in the region's countries should be incorporated into a vision of the energy sector as a whole, making the demands of sustainable development a condition for their evolution. From this perspective certain strategic lines should arise that guide public policy formulation. These should suitably weigh the role that renewable energies could play in economic growth, employment, the environment, rural development, universal energization, and the governability of resources, in particular water. Based on this integrated vision, this study puts forward four relevant issues and initiatives with concrete proposals for Latin America and the Caribbean: -A revaluation from an environmental and social perspective of hydro power according to the demands of sustainable development; -The contribution of renewable sources to the integrated development of rural communities; -The rational use of fuelwood; -The role of biomass and biofuels. These challenges must be dealt with considering the opportunities contained in the new European <b>linking</b> <b>directive</b> on emissions (EuroKyoto), which offers the region the chance to enter a global mechanism trading in emissions, which will attempt to create an institutionalized system as a function of projects already identified in the pilot phase of the Kyoto Protocol; and evaluating the possibility of applying guaranteed buying modes or "Feed-In", which in Europe have enjoyed significant success. ...|$|E

Does the French National Basin Network provide enough information in order to make consistent water quality maps? How does the temporal indicator - the 90 percentile - vary in space? The outputs of the ProSe model applied to the Seine River are used to compare two different methods for calculating the 90 percentile: the classical method based on the empirical percentile function and a method that aims to reduce the estimation bias of the 90 percentile. This second method includes temporal weighting and linearization o the empirical percentile function, and therefore its application is a little more complex. But with this method the bias induced by irregular and/or few measurements is reduced. Three methods for spatializing the 90 percentiles have been tested in order to obtain occurrence percentages of the percentiles for each quality class. The first one is based on the "failure principle" and consists in keeping only the worst site for the considered "River Water Body". The second one respects the proportion of percentiles located in each quality class, while the third one allocates an influence segment to each measurement site.

With the help of some radio technicians, they were able to transmit on 11 September the first message of the King of Italy, Victor Emanuel III, after his departure from Rome.Radio Bari was thus able to broadcast the first broadcast of free Italy.Starting from 23 September 1943, the premises of Radio Bari were occupied by the Americans who immediately made it the organ of their headquarters in Algiers.The core programme was Italia combatte (Italy fights on) in which, while complying with the directives of the Allied Command, the speakers targeted the public opinion of southern Italy with interesting features full of news and testimonies from the front, as well as on guerrilla actions, together with information for partisans and anti-fascist propaganda.These political programmes were supported by [...] "a lot of music for which an entire record store was seized". In his 2011 history of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) in Italy in the years 1943-45, David Stafford says: [...] Contact with resistance groups was also maintained through Radio Bari. This was a station under allied control from which, every night at 2030 GMT, a special resistance programme, produced jointly by No. 1 Special Force and the Political Warfare Board Executive, was broadcast throughout Italy. It was through this <b>link</b> that general <b>directives</b> were sent to resistance groups, and that reception committees were alerted to supply drops. It would also be the means by which the resistance in general would be ordered to act when the signal was given." ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{set out to}} {{establish}} a sound framework to analyse delinking for diverse waste related trends, within a WKC conceptual environment that encompasses the policy evaluation stage. This study has provided new evidence on waste generation and disposal delinking, exploiting a rich and up to date EU-based dataset that allows various analyses of the relative roles of economic drivers in the waste process, including economic drivers, structural socio-economic drivers and policy factors. The core WKC hypothesis was tested and its robustness confirmed by the inclusion of explanatory variables. First, {{the results show that}} in terms of waste generation there is no WKC trend, though elasticity to income drivers appear lower than in the past, pointing to the presence of a current relative delinking. For the EU- 10, there are some stronger signs of delinking, although further investigation is needed to provide a more robust validation. There are no landfill or other policy effects that seem to be providing backward incentives for waste prevention, a result that calls for the introduction of waste policies targeted at the sources of waste generation. It confirms the current lack of policy emphasis at EU level, on landfill diversion. Second, we provide evidence confirming that landfill and incineration, as expected, are significantly decreasing and increasing respectively, along an endogenous cycle of economic development, but with policy effects driving these trends significantly: the policy dummies <b>linked</b> to EU <b>Directives</b> and the comprehensive policy index we defined, are negatively correlated to landfill waste across specifications. Some additional factors, such as urbanization and population density among others, appear to be playing a role. In the absence of policy, delinking for landfill seems to be being driven by the increasing opportunity and environmental costs associated with waste disposal. As far as incineration dynamics are concerned, they seem to be explained relatively more by R&D, an income-related country specific factor, rather than by policy levers...|$|R
40|$|Floods {{constitute}} a significant risk to human health, economic activity, cultural heritage {{and the environment}} in Europe. Flood risk is expected to even increase. The {{reason for this is}} mainly twofold. Firstly, climate change is likely to increase the magnitude and frequency of floods because of the expected increase in extreme rainfall events {{on the one hand and}} sea level rise on the other hand. Secondly, there is also a marked increase in the number of people and economic assets located in flood risk area. As a result it is believed flooding has the potential to undermine the EU’s drive towards sustainable development and a competitive economy. Flood management has predominantly been about ‘preventing flooding’. Floods, however, are part of nature and will continue to exist. Flood protection is never absolute. It is neither technically feasible nor economically affordable to prevent all properties from flooding. Therefore, a risk-based approach is taken to achieve the best results possible using the budget and resources available. Flood management should seek to limit flood risk, but not at all cost. The costs should be reasonable compared to the expected benefits. The way flood problems are tackled often starts from a wrong perspective; focussing too much on local protection, neglecting the broader picture. The way forward is to adopt a coordinated, long-term and integrated basin level approach. In order to manage the flood problem in an optimal way flood risks of all kind have to be assessed and mapped; covering impacts to economic, social, cultural and ecological receptors. This report aims at identifying and drafting practices and methods for assessing flood risks and the benefits of flood risk management measures, such as damage avoided, as well as other aspects of economic assessments, to support decision making in the framework of flood risk management. In anticipation to all of the above the Directive 2007 / 60 /EC on the assessment and management of flood risks, hereafter referred to as the Floods Directive, sets out a framework for an efficient and effective flood risk management. The Floods Directive aims at the reduction of the adverse consequences for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity. The Floods <b>Directive</b> has important <b>links</b> with <b>Directive</b> 2000 / 60 /EC which establishes a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, better known as the Water Framework Directive. Measures implemented in the framework of the Water Framework Directive may also promote flood risk reduction by e. g. the restoration of wetlands and flood plains. Because of the synergy between both Directives some Member States have already considered flood risk management related aspects in their first River Basin Management Plans. The Water Framework Directive requires the development and selection of cost-effective programmes of measures. Similar economic considerations are also important in the framework of the Floods Directive. The thinking and work on economics that has been done with regard to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive shall therefore also be considered in this context. Care shall be taken to ensure that the efforts on flood related economics rather promote synergies than overlap with the work carried out for the Water Framework Directive. The successful and effective implementation of the Floods Directive raises a number of shared technical challenges for the Member States, the Commission, the Candidate and EEA Countries as well as stakeholders. The shared challenges with the implementation of the Floods Directive are addressed by Working group F on Floods of the Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) for the Water Framework Directive. An important issue with regard to the Floods Directive concerns the requirement to "take into account relevant aspects such as cost and benefits" when developing flood management plans. The role of economics in the implementation of the Flood Directive will be tackled in a thematic workshop that is organised within the framework of the activities of Working group F on Floods and will be held in October 2010. The present scoping paper on floods and economics is prepared in function of this workshop. This paper will also serve as input for a living reference document ‘flood risk management, economics and decision making support’ that aims bringing together good practices on flood risk management and economics. A questionnaire circulated to EU Member States via WG F will further contribute to substantiating this paper prior to the workshop. nrpages: 72 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, water {{management}} is moving from flood defense to a risk management approach, which takes both the probability {{and the potential}} consequences of flooding into account. In this report, {{we will look at}} Directives and (non-) EU- initiatives in place to deal with flood risk in Europe indirectly and directly. Emphasis will lie on the two Directives most specifically aimed at floods: the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Floods Directive (FD) – how are they related and how they have been or are implemented in the Member States (MSs) ? In February 1995, the Netherlands and France took the initiative for a discussion on streamlining the water legislation of the European Union (EU) which resulted {{in the creation of the}} WFD in 2000. The WFD provided a new system for the protection and improvement of Europe’s water environment – its rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwaters. Its main innovation is the requirement that water be managed in an integrated way, with river basin management as leading managing unit. Since flood protection is not explicitly addressed in the WFD, the need to clarify the role of the WFD in flood protection was put on the European agenda as early as 2003, and in 2007, the FD became a fact. The FD is to be implemented in coordination with the WFD, notably by coordinating Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) and River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs). Both the WFD and the FD reflect a shift in EU-governance. Instead of the more traditional top-down legalistic approach they emphasise the importance of more bottom up initiatives from the actors who have to implement the Directives. Combined with the expanded freedom and flexibility for national and local governments, with this new approach, the FD is the first Water Directive in EU law that does not offer an equal minimum level of protection for EU citizens. While both Directives are meant to harmonise European legislation, much flexibility on objectives and measures in the FD is left to the MSs, justified by the nature of flooding and the subsidiarity principle. This creates multi-actor, multi-level and multi-sector challenges addressed in report D 1. 1. 2 (Hegger et al. 2013). For instance, the FD sets out general obligations for transboundary cooperation, but at the national level, the scope and distributions of duties, rights and powers of the various organizations involved should be set out in law. Other challenges identified in the literature are concrete issues related to mandatory flood risks assessments, flood risk maps, and Flood Risk Management plans, but also the involvement of the public and stakeholders, the science-policy interface, uncertainties related to climate change predictions and effects, the coordination with the WFD, the lack of safety standards, the lack of possibilities for EU citizens to rely on substantive provisions before the administrative courts and finally, transboundary aspects such as issues of scale, mismatches between national policies, the assessment of transboundary effects and division of costs related to this. In sum, this report has clarified the development, content and implementation of the current European flood risk governance policies, possible synergies between the two most important <b>Directives</b> <b>linked</b> to floods, and identified topics and questions for more in-depth questions relevant for the next work packages, pertaining to, in no particular order, a) the level of implementation and level of ambition as well as the competent authorities in the case study countries; b) the transboundary nature of floods; c) synergies and conflicts between FD and WFD and other issues not mentioned in these Directives; d) the degree of harmonization, for instance when it comes to flood safety standards and e) the subsidiarity principle – is this conform the requirements set out in the FD? Because while current European flood regulation specified in the WFD and FD provides several potential opportunities for improving flood risk governance, it is not self-evident that all of these opportunities will materialise in all MSs...|$|R
