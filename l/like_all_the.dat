5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Brumaire-class {{submarines}}, Curie {{began her}} First World War {{service in the}} Mediterranean, {{and was one of}} the first French submarines to appear in the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Bouvier family, {{his voice}} has become croaky through chain-smoking {{for a number}} of years. He also shares the same grunt as Patty and Selma, both of whom {{resemble}} younger female versions of him, while Marge more resembles her mother.|$|E

50|$|He may likely {{return for}} the new season, based on teaser footage aired during Season 2 reruns. He also is known to love puppies and he <b>likes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hoes.|$|R
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Naruto {{becomes a}} ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on {{whom he has}} a crush, to form Team 7, under an {{experienced}} sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. <b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.|$|E
5|$|Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, the {{daughter}} of the leader of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest. The character, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated. Saldana has also signed on for potential sequels.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds {{to the larger}} electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the capital}} and largest city of the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje enjoys a {{particular}} status granted by law. The last revision of its status was made in 2004. Since then, the City of Skopje has been divided into 10 municipalities which all have a council and a mayor, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia. Municipalities only deal with matters specific of their territory, and the City of Skopje deals with matters that concern all of them, or that cannot be divided between two or more municipalities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. <b>Like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E
5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of plate tectonics. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also realised that <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other land birds of the Tristan Archipelago, it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.|$|E

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds {{to the large}} and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium is {{the third}} member of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and neodymium to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{comparable to that of}} silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f36s2; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Praseodymium is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the Aufbau principle, which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and cerium, because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at cerium to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid praseodymium takes on the 4f25d16s2 configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other trivalent lanthanides (all but europium and ytterbium, which are divalent in the metallic state).|$|E
5|$|The design main {{armament}} for the Type 1936A (Mob) class was, {{like the}} Type 1936A class {{on which it}} was based, five 15 cm (5.9in) TbtsK C/36 naval guns, with one twin turret forward and three single mounts aft. Development of the twin turret was slow however, and Z31 (<b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Type 1936A class), was completed with an additional single 15cm gun replacing the unavailable twin turret, giving {{a total of four}} 15cm guns. The forward gun was replaced by the intended twin turret in 1944, but the twin turret was replaced by a single 10.5 cm (4.1in) SK L/45 naval gun after the twin turret was wrecked in battle in January 1945. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of 2 twin 3.7 cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns (later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns) and nine 20 mm cannon in one quadruple and five single mounts. A second quadruple 20mm mount was fitted forward of the ship's bridge in 1943, replacing one of the single mounts, while additional 3.7cm were fitted in 1945, giving a final anti-aircraft armament in German service of fourteen 3.7cm and twelve 20mm guns. Eight 533mm (21in) torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts were fitted, and up to 60 mines could be carried.|$|E

5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window (shaped, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> others in the church, like a star) set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns of lights and coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E

The artwork for the UK cover was designed by Julian Barton and David Howells. As <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> 2 Unlimited releases, most other territories featured a different album cover to the UK edition of the album. Unlike their previous album in the UK, where many of the tracks featured on it were instrumental, the artwork to this album featured band members Ray and Anita on the front cover.|$|E
