40|$|It {{is assumed}} {{worldwide}} that {{the assessment of}} coastal erosion and induced risk {{can be carried out}} through Concise indexes which take into account both morphological and anthropic characteristics of <b>littoral</b> <b>system</b> as well as energy intensity of wave climate. The classic literature proposes different indicators in order to describe erosion/progradation activities along the coast and climate wave conditions, generally expressed by wave energy.

In the present paper, the maritime erosion index has been proposed to be employed in risk assessment induced by continuous nearshore wave modelling and storm events corresponding to different boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} cycle of mercury (Hg) is affected {{not only by}} the physical, chemical and hydrological characteristics of the environment, but also by changes in productivity and biodiversity. In waters the complexes of Hg are related to the salinity and to the load of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the dissolved and in the particulate phases. Surface and bottom seawater were sampled along the Venetian coast at ten sites with different characteristics. Samples were analyzed employing hyphenated techniques and LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) were quantified. Although for some samples both the species were under the LOQ, the presence of methyl mercury (CH 3 Hg+) and ionic mercury (Hg 2 +) {{at the same time in}} surface and in bottom waters were observed.

40|$|Abstract: Extreme {{rainfall}} causing {{floods and}} great damage occurred {{in many areas}} of central-east Sardinia in the period 6 – 11 December 2004. A total of approximately 700 mm of rain was measured during this extreme event, with a maximum reaching 510 mm of rainfall in 1 day at the rain gauge of Villagrande (Ogliastra). During and immediately after the event all fluviokarstic canyons were activated for at least 1 week, reaching the highest water levels in at least 50 years and reversing great quantities of sediment-loaded water onto the coast and with important geomorphical modifications. There was public fear that serious damage to the natural resources would occur, such as the famous Cala Luna beach that was almost completely destroyed by the flooding of the Codula Ilune River and by the coinciding sea storm. The river, in fact, eroded the longshore bar (beach) and destroyed the small backshore lagoon.

Beachmed-e Interreg IIIc Project, to distinguish relic coastal deposits on the continental shelf, suitable for beach nourishment. These deposits are related to transgressive-regressive sedimentary cycles, and they are due to Quaternary glacio-eustatic sea level variations. In fact, during the sea level low stand associated with the last glacial maximum (c. 18 – 20, 000 yBP) the sea level was 110 – 120 m lower than its present level and the continental shelf was exposed. During the Versilian Transgression the coastline migrated from the shelf break to its present position. This migration was not continuous and conspicuous sediment bodies, associated with deltaic or <b>littoral</b> <b>systems,</b> were deposited during static periods. The results of a marine geology campaign with seismostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses enabled us to distinguish gravelly and sandy littoral deposits at depths of 20 – 40 m near the coast and 60 – 80 m on the outer shelf, in areas with only a thin Holocene mud cover (high stand deposits) ...|$|R
40|$|For over 30 years {{a primary}} coastal {{management}} concern in south-east Queensland, Australia {{has been the}} eroded beaches of the southern Gold Coast. The 380 m extension of the Tweed River training walls from 1962 - 1964 interrupted the littoral supply of sand to the beaches of the southern Gold Coast which experienced sudden and severe erosion. A series of tropical cyclones and severe storms in 1967 initiated {{an investigation into the}} erosion problems by the Delft Hydraulics Laboratory. The report outlined the need for Gold Coast beaches to be able to withstand the impacts of a series of storms and erosion volumes similar to those of 1967. Several recommendations for structures and nourishment programs to address the issue have been implemented and the desire for a long-term solution resulted in the establishment of the Tweed River Bypassing Scheme in 2001. Since 2001, 4. 6 M m 3 of sand has been dredged from the Tweed River and 4. 7 M m 3 of sand has been bypassed and deposited within the active profile of southern Gold Coast beaches.

40|$|Developed {{coastal areas}} often exhibit a strong {{systemic}} coupling between shoreline dynamics and economic dynamics. "Beach nourishment", a common erosion-control practice, involves mechanically depositing sediment {{from outside the}} local <b>littoral</b> <b>system</b> onto an actively eroding shoreline to alter shoreline morphology. Natural sediment-transport processes quickly rework the newly engineered beach, causing further changes to the shoreline that in turn affect subsequent beach-nourishment decisions. To the limited extent that this landscape/economic coupling has been considered, evidence suggests that towns tend to employ spatially myopic economic strategies under which individual towns make isolated decisions that do not account for their neighbors. What happens when an optimization strategy that explicitly ignores spatial interactions is incorporated into a physical model that is spatially dynamic? The long-term attractor that develops for the coupled system (the state and behavior to which the system evolves over time) is unclear. We link an economic model, in which town-manager agents choose economically optimal beach-nourishment intervals according to past observations of their immediate shoreline, to a simplified coastal-dynamics model that includes alongshore sediment transport and background erosion (e. g. from sea-level rise). Simulations suggest that feedbacks between these human and natural coastal processes can generate emergent behaviors. When alongshore sediment transport and spatially myopic nourishment decisions are coupled, increases {{in the rate of}} sea-level rise can destabilize economically optimal nourishment practices into a regime characterized by the emergence of chaotic shoreline evolution...|$|E

The analysis was finished at the end of 2004 with the development of a hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model of the <b>littoral</b> <b>system.</b> These studies were looking for a solution to the erosion suffered by the Cancun littoral barrier (“island”) and to obtain a good understanding of the littoral dynamic processes in the barrier of Cancun-Nizuc. Although the erosion of this barrier only became obvious after Gilbert occurred, there is evidence to conclude that the hurricane effects are not the origin of the erosion. The hurricane only worsened a process that existed for a long time, probably due to the inadequate and excessive occupation of the beach front that reduced the capacity of recovery (“resilience”) of the beach profile. Different measures were taken to protect the zone, but they soon failed; the erosion continued and hurricanes Ivan and Wilma worsened the conditions of the whole barrier. Finally, the recovery of the barrier was tackled by means of sand nourishment. This nourishment has been completed in June 2006 in parallel with the drafting of this paper...|$|E

Chromis chromis has many of the characteristics required of an indicator species (e. g. it is easy to recognize in the field, small sized, widespread and abundant). In this study we focused on individual size, sex-ratio and body condition in a damselfish population occurring in a central Mediterranean marine protected area. Fishing trials on a monthly basis (April–November) allowed us to assess seasonal changes in population structure. Fish were measured and weighed and a subsample was aged and sexed. On average, males were larger than females. The allometric coefficient, b, for the whole population was 2. 99; the maximum age recorded was 7. 5 yr. Before reproduction sex-ratio was close to parity (M:F 1 : 0. 78), while a larger proportion of females was captured during the reproductive period. In conclusion, our results show that the population dynamics of C. chromis is influenced by both sex and size. Since males and females have different behavioural strategies, and since the length of the spawning period is shorter in the smaller than in the larger-sized individuals, this is reflected in temporal changes observed in the population structure...|$|E

The Coastal Modeling System (CMS) was applied to analyze the morphological impact on the sediment dynamics for ebb-tidal delta mining at St. Augustine Inlet over 1. 4 -year simulations. Results determined that dredging scenarios under 4 Mill cu yd removed did not significantly modify the ebb-tidal delta. The CMS modeling results on sustainable dredging volumes, combined with historical infilling rates, provided constraints with which to develop dredging and beach fill scenarios for GenCade, a 1 -D numerical model that predicts shoreline change. GenCade was applied to evaluate sediment management alternatives for dredging intervals of 5, 7 and 10 years, and varying beach fill volumes and placement lengths. Results indicate that imposing a 10 -year dredging interval to the navigation project and ebb delta with the maximum dredging quantity of 3 million cubic yards will yield the best performance of the regional projects of St. Johns County.

40|$|Abstract We {{hypothesized}} that supply from macroalgal propagule banks {{may influence the}} relative abundance of annual and perennial algae and that this may alter the ef-fects of grazers and nutrients on species composition. In a factorial field experiment in the Baltic Sea <b>littoral</b> <b>system</b> we tested the effects of manipulating propagule banks, the abundance of crustacean and gastropod graz-ers, and nutrient supply on recruitment and growth of macroalgae over a year. Moreover, we determined sea-sonal patterns of macroalgal propagule dispersal at the experimental site and quantified algal abundance and re-cruitment at 25 locations throughout the Baltic Sea. Ex-perimental manipulations had minor effects on adults of the dominating perennial alga, Fucus vesiculosus. In-stead, we found that species composition was determined by processes operating at early life stages. Propagule supply from a propagule bank strongly favored the fast-growing annual alga Enteromorpha spp. which then blocked settlement and recruitment of Fucus. Grazers re-duced the abundance of annual algae and indirectly fa-vored Fucus recruitment. There was an apparent trade-off between gains from the propagule bank and losses to herbivory in five of seven colonizing species. Nutrient enrichment overrode grazer control of annual algae and accelerated the decline of Fucus only when annual algae had already achieved high densities through the propa-gule bank. Corroborating the experimental findings, field surveys across the Baltic showed that Fucus recruit den-sities can be predicted from the cover of annual algae {{during the period of}} Fucus reproduction and settlement. Recruitment inhibition by annual algae, which is driven by the abundance of annuals in the propagule bank, in-creasing nutrient levels, and declining consumer control, is suggested as a mechanistic explanation of the current decline of perennial algae in the Baltic Sea...|$|E

This research was conducted in the framework of the research theme carbon and nutrient dynamics in vegetated <b>littoral</b> <b>systems</b> of the department of Littoral Vegetation of the Centre for Estuarine and Coastal Ecology (Netherlands Institute of Ecology, Yerseke). Emphasis is given to the biogeochemical processes involved in the production, oxidation and transport of CH 4.

In situ rates of rhizospheric CH 4 oxidation were measured and results showed a significant seasonal pattern for reed and bulrush and a significant difference between both plant species. The relatively large capacity of bulrush plants for rhizosphere oxidation apparently also attenuated availability of substrate for methane producing bacteria.

40|$|International audienceThe Maguelone shore extends {{along the}} {{northern}} coast of the Gulf of Lions, west of the Rhone Delta and east of high-gradient coastal streams that have provided most of the clastic sediments to the Gulf of Lions margin since the early Miocene. This 10 km-wide area is constituted by a small coastal watershed (15 km long) in low-lying carbonate hills, a kilometre-wide marsh, a sandy beach barrier and a shoreface experiencing local low sedimentation rates. This onshore-offshore transition zone is a key area to understand the relationships between erosion, by-pass, deposition and preservation processes. Unlike the neighbouring Rhone deposits that display numerous thick deltaic sequences related to a continuous sediment flux, the Maguelone shore exhibits peculiar sedimentary bodies. The analysis of about 250 km of new VHR seismic profiles acquired over the study area, 9 short cores and outcrops data allowed us to determine the three-dimensional high-resolution geometry of the coastal system tracts from Quaternary to present-day. This revealed dominant denudation processes in the Upstream catchments associated {{with the formation of}} incised valleys during Quaternary lowstands. In addition, this study investigates the erosion and deposition mechanisms controlled by littoral hydrodynamics that have been taken place on this shore since the last transgression. In particular, metre-high and hundreds of metre-long sandy bodies constructed by alongshore hydrodynamics were identified and their effect on the morphodynamics of the whole <b>littoral</b> <b>system</b> is discussed. The Maguelone shore can be used as an experimental study for onshore/offshore dynamics under the influence of microtidal wave/current hydrodynamics and very low river-derived sediment flux during a eustatic cycle. Geometry of system tracts across flood plain to shoreface is usually considered to be controlled by relative sea-level changes, and is successfully analysed with 2 D sequence stratigraphy cross-shore models. It is observed that in areas like the Maguelone shore, traditional sequence stratigraphy methods might not be fully relevant and need to integrate alongshore hydrodynamical processes...|$|E
40|$|Property {{development}} {{along the}} west coast of Barbados has led to an increasing pressure on the coastline as property owners desire to have their residences close to the sea. The addition of new coastal structures including revetments, breakwaters, and groynes, changes the dynamics of the natural <b>littoral</b> <b>system.</b> The sediment transport mechanism(s) between the beach cells characteristic of the west coast is not fully understood, so accurately predicting the effects of additional structures is difficult. Additionally the potential effects of sea level rise and a healthy reef on the mechanics and stability of the system is un-researched. Recent increases in interest of the design of multi-purpose reefs (MPR) and artificial surfing reefs (ASR) has further led to the desire for insight into the sediment dynamics at headland-reef-bay systems. This study evaluates the response and interaction mechanism(s) acting at a beach cell system with a focus under swell conditions and oblique waves typical of {{the west coast of}} Barbados. Using the Delft 3 D numerical model and a schematized section of coastline, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on parameters of interest to determine their effects on the sediment transport in the system. Delft 3 D was determined to be a valid tool to examine sediment transport in this type of system. Model results indicated that the most important parameters governing the sediment behaviour are the significant wave height, direction, and sediment diameter. Other factors of importance included reef size, reef shape, reef asymmetry, and reef roughness. Perhaps surprisingly, sea level had little effect on overall transport rates but was the most important factor affecting the location and type of transport. These changes to the mode of transport are important as they govern the public perception of what is occurring. The transport associated with elevated sea levels, although not a problem from the system perspective, becomes an issue from the beach user and public opinion perspective as erosion takes place at the beachface where it is highly visible and has significant effects on beach usability.

40|$|The morphodynamics of an {{inlet channel}} {{draining}} an estuary or bay {{are governed by}} a complex system of temporally and spatially varying physical processes, including wind, waves, tides, sediment transport, and both tide and wave driven currents. In addition, sediment availability and characteristics in conjunction with underlying geologic framework bear on the morphology and morphologic behavior of an inlet system. This study examines the morphodynamics, sediment transport patterns and time-series morphologic change of John’s Pass and Blind Pass, two structured tidal inlets that collectively make up a dual-inlet system sharing the tidal prism of northern Boca Ciega Bay, in Pinellas County, Florida. To quantify wave and tidal forcing and response mechanisms an array of hydrodynamic sensors were deployed over a 12 month period at both inshore and offshore locations. In order to capture morphologic changes and quantify volumetric changes within the inlets, bathymetric surveys of the inlets were conducted in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014. Similarly, bi-monthly beach survey data for the same range of time was acquired in order to quantify volumetric changes along adjacent stretches of beach. In addition to gaining insights into sediment pathways based on morphologic and volumetric variability, those data were also used to develop a regional sediment budget along the studied stretch of coast. To gain insights into the morphodynamics of the dual-inlet system, bathymetric and hydrodynamic data was used to develop a numerical model of the dual inlet system. Numerical model simulations based on existing or baseline conditions were compared with numerical simulations employing synthetic bathymetric and hydrodynamic conditions {{in order to examine}} inlet behavior under a range of different morphological and hydrodynamic conditions. John’s Pass is the dominant of the two inlets. It exhibits mixed-energy straight morphology and captures ca 81 % of the available tidal prism. The inlet has a well-developed mature ebb shoal, and actively bypasses sediment {{from one side of the}} inlet to the other supplying sediment to the downdrift <b>littoral</b> <b>system.</b> Blind Pass captures less than 20 % of the available tidal prism, and while also exhibiting mixed-energy morphologic characteristics has a less well developed ebb shoal that currently has not fully established a sediment bypassing system. Both inlets channels and ebb shoals have been dredged on multiple occasions to provide sediment for the nourishment of nearby chronically eroding stretches of beach. Dredge pits excavated along the distal margins of the ebb shoals are infilling at rates substantially slower than expected due to limited sediment transport along those regions of the ebb shoal, while inlet channel dredge pits infill at rapid and expected rates. The objective of this study was to characterize the morphodynamics of the dual-inlet system with the aim of identifying sediment pathways and bypassing mechanisms, and quantify a balanced regional sediment budget in order to design more sustainable approaches to inlet management...|$|E

Fish densities were reduced to less than 15 % of ambient levels in both experiments. In the bluegill–bass pond, density and biomass of most invertebrate taxa and size classes were unaffected by the fish manipulation. Total invertebrate densities {{did not differ significantly}} between fish treatments, but total invertebrate biomass was significantly greater where fish density was reduced, averaging 30 % higher {{over the course of the}} study. Likewise, manipulation of fish in the bluespotted sunfish–pickerel pond had few significant effects on individual taxa and size classes. There were no significant effects on total invertebrate abundance in the bluespotted sunfish–pickerel pond.

Their original source, is suggested as from marine erosion of Castlecliffian sediments, such as exposed in the coastal cliffs at Matata. Net littoral drift is suggested as bi-directional from a centre-point near Otamarakau, to both the north-east along Pukehina Spit, and to the south-west towards Matata. Some counter-drift occurs between the Tarawera River mouth and Matata, and along the tip of Pukehina Spit, with nourishment of this area by the Waihi estuary. Nearshore sedimentary-morphodynamic units show that the nearshore and inner-shelf at Town Point, and from southern Pukehina Beach to Otamarakau, is characterised by the presence of numerous rock outcrops, which are responsible for the coarse sands and relatively higher carbonate abundances in this area. Sediment volumes within the beach-nearshore system, and alongshore transfers between sectors of the coast are small, with annual net littoral drift estimated as 15, 000 m³ at Matata. Diabathic processes are considered to dominate, with the limit of significant onshore-offshore sediment transport no more than 12 m, and a parabathic limit of less than 6 m. The net change in sediment volume for the entire beach system within the Pukehina-Matata coastal sector between 1989 and 1993, produced a calculated deficit of sediment of 90, 570 m³. In comparison a longer-term change, between 1978 and 1993, showed a sediment surplus of 218, 560 m³. Over the Pukehina-Matata coastal sector these volume changes are reasonably small and their variability reflects both the dynamic nature, and the delicate state of equilibrium, of the beach-dune-nearshore system. The derived littoral sediment budget shows that in order to balance the inputs and outputs within the system approximately 27, 400 m³ of annual onshore sediment transport must occur. Current sand extraction at Otamarakau has resulted in a decline in the beach sediment volumes between Otamarakau and Pikowai, with this sector in a sediment deficit. Although natural processes mask the true impacts, the increased sand extraction rate of 36, 000 m³ per year is liable to further deplete the beach-dunenearshore system. However, in the short-term these effects are unlikely to be immediately noticeable...|$|E

[...] 105 pagesWave {{storms and}} river inputs {{have been found}} to be the dominant forcing mechanism of sediment transport in continental shelves dominated by medium to large rivers around the world (e. g. Drake and Cacchione, 1985; Sherwood et al., 1994; Ogston and Stemberg, 1999; Traykovski et al., 2000; Wadman and McNinch, 2008) and in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Jiménez et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2001; Guillén et al., 2002, 2006; Palanques et al., 2002, 2011; Ferré et al., 2005; Roussiez et al., 2005; Ulses et al., 2008). However, the contribution of “small” Mediterranean river systems in fine-grained sediment dynamics is not well known. Flood and storm events redistribute not only sediment but also all the associated matter as well, such a heavy metals, which are indicators of the impact of industrial and urban activities. For these reasons, the present thesis project involves studying the dynamics of sediments and associated heavy metals across the inner continental shelf off the Besòs River (Barcelona), and in particular determining the effect of floods and storms in a <b>littoral</b> <b>system</b> affected by industrial and urban activities. To this end, several oceanographic surveys were carried out between 20 and 40 m water depths in the Barcelona continental shelf to obtain a variety of data: to register vertical hydrographical profiles (temperature, salinity and turbidity); to record time series of physical parameters (currents, salinity, temperature, turbidity and seabed variation) by deploying oceanographic equipment; and to take sediment samples (short cores and Van Veen grabs) and suspended and downward particulate matter from water samples and sediment traps for further sedimentological and geochemical analysis. The time period of the present study comprised three seasons, from autumn 2007 to spring 2008, which showed distinct features between them. The purpose of section 3 was to describe the main hydrographic and hydrodynamic conditions during the study period to support the interpretation of sediment transport processes. Three different periods in terms of storm and river activity matched the natural seasons of the year: The period comprised between end of September 2007 and December 2007 (autumn) was characterized by an intense frequency of northeastern-eastern storms mostly coupled with high but short river discharges and a convergence of the across-shelf current between 20 m and 30 m water depths; between January and early March 2008 (winter), the wave and river activity and frequency were reduced significantly with offshore currents dominating the across component; and finally, from March to mid June 2008 (spring), specially between May and June 2008, river discharges lasted more than one month and occurred under low wave energy conditions or in conjunction with S-SE and SW wave stormsLa presente tesis ha sido llevada a cabo gracias al proyecto SEDMET (CMTM 2006 - 06919) financiado por el Ministerio de Economía y CompetitividadPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|My {{doctoral}} work {{stems from}} an original motivation {{to understand more}} closely why some areas of sandy coastlines erode and others accrete an intriguing fundamental question and one of societal relevance wherever human coastal infrastructure exists. What are the physical processes driving shoreline change, and over what spatial and temporal scales are they manifest? If forces driving the <b>littoral</b> <b>system</b> change, how does the shoreline respond? Can we attribute observed patterns of shoreline change to a particular process? Recent novel numerical shoreline-evolution modeling demonstrated that wave-driven gradients in alongshore sediment transport could produce self-organized, emergent features on spatial scales from sand waves to large-scale capes [Ashton et al., 2001], introducing a new theoretical perspective to the cross-shore-oriented considerations of the coastal scientific community. The unexpected model results inspired fresh hypotheses about shoreline pattern formation and the forcing mechanisms behind them. One overarching hypothesis was that under regimes of high- and low-angle deep-water incident waves, alongshore shoreline perturbations grow or diffuse away, respectively. To test the hypothesis we looked for a correlation between shoreline curvature (showing perturbations to a nearly straight coastline) and shoreline change in observed measurements. High-resolution topographic lidar surveys of the North Carolina Outer Banks from 1996 2006 allowed robust, quantitative comparisons between shoreline surveys spanning tens of kms. In Chapter 1 [Lazarus and Murray, 2007] we report {{that over the last}} decade, at multi-km scales along the barrier islands, convex-seaward promontories tended to erode and concave-seaward embayments accrete a pattern of diffusion consistent with the smoothing effects of alongshore-transport gradients driven by a low-angle wave climate. Why then, after a decade or more of smoothing, do plan-view bumps in the shoreline still persist? In Chapter 2 [Lazarus et al., in review] we compile evidence suggesting that (a) a framework of paleochannels may control the areas of persistent multi-km-scale shoreline convexity that (b) in turn drive decadal-term transient changes in shoreline morphology by (c) affecting gradients in wave-driven alongshore sediment transport. In Chapter 3, a third investigation of large-scale coastal behavior, we explore an existing premise that shoreline change on a sandy coast is a self-affine signal wherein patterns of changes are scale-invariant, perhaps suggesting that a single process operates across the scales. Applying wavelet analysis a mathematical technique involving scaled filter transforms we confirm that a power law fits the average variance of shoreline change at alongshore scales spanning approximately three orders of magnitude (5 5000 m). The power law itself does not necessarily indicate a single dominant driver; beach changes across those scales likely result from a variety of cross-shore and alongshore hydrodynamic processes. A paired modeling experiment supports the conclusion that the power relationship is not an obvious function of wave-driven alongshore sediment transport alone. Our tests of theory against field observations are middle steps in pattern-to-process attribution; they fit into a larger body of coastal morphodynamic research that in time may enable shoreline-change prediction. Present hydrodynamic models are still too limited in spatial and temporal scope to accommodate the extended scales at which large morphological changes occur, but more integrated quantitative models linking bathymetry, wave fields, and geologic substrate are underway and will set the next course of questions for the discipline.

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{analysis of}} cores and geomorphic {{patterns in the}} marshes of Doñana National Park (SW Spain) has yielded new evidence regarding the sedimentary infilling and geomorphological evolution of the Guadalquivir estuary during the Holocene. The sedimentation and geomorphological disposition have been strongly conditioned by neotectonic activity along a set of SW-NE alignments, interrupted by other alignments that follow E-W and NW-SE directions. The most conspicuous of the SW-NE alignments is the Torre Carbonero-Marilópez Fault (TCMF). South of this fault, the estuary experienced a marked subsidence from about 4000 to 2000. cal. yr BP {{through a series of}} sedimentary sequences of retrogradation and aggradation within the context of relative sea-level rise. From c. 2000. cal. yr BP to the present the subsidence has remained relatively dormant, with progradation of the <b>littoral</b> <b>systems</b> and infilling of the marshland progressing within a context of sea-level stability. Our results reveal that neotectonic activity is a critical factor that must also be reckoned with in any attempt to understand the Holocene geomorphological evolution in the Guadalquivir estuary.

40|$|International audienceIn coastal systems, the {{multiplicity}} of sources fueling the pool of particulate organic matter (POM) leads to divergent estimations of POM composition. Eleven <b>systems</b> (two <b>littoral</b> <b>systems,</b> eight embayments and semi-enclosed systems and one estuary) distributed along the three maritime façades of France were studied for two to eight years in order to quantify the relative contribution of organic matter sources to the surface-water POM pool in coastal systems. This study was based on carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic ratios, used for running mixing models. The POM of the estuary is dominated by terrestrial material (93 % on average), whereas the POM of the other systems is dominated by phytoplankton (84 % on average). Nevertheless, for the latter systems, the POM composition varies in space, with 1) systems where POM is highly composed of phytoplankton (≥ 93 %), 2) systems characterized by a non-negligible contribution of benthic (8 to 19 %) and/or riverine (7 to 19 %) sources, and 3) the Mediterranean systems characterized by the contribution of diazotroph organisms (ca. 14 %). A continent-to-ocean gradient of riverine and/or benthic POM contribution is observed. Finally, time series reveal 1) seasonal variations of POM composition, 2) differences in seasonality between systems, and 3) an inshore-offshore gradient of seasonality within each system that were sampled at several stations. Spatial and seasonal patterns of POM composition are mainly due to local to regional processes such as hydrodynamics and sedimentary hydrodynamic (e. g. resuspension processes, changes in river flows, wind patterns influencing along-shore currents) but also due to the geomorphology of the systems (depth of the water column, distance to the shore). Future studies investigating the link between these forcings and POM composition would help {{to better understand the}} dynamics of POM composition in coastal systems...|$|R
