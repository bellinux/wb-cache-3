40|$|In this work, we {{show the}} {{existence}} of sampling walls in signal detection of nonuniformly sampling wideband signals {{in the presence of}} noise uncertainty. A sampling wall is the sampling rate below which the target error probabilities (namely the missed detection and false alarm probabilities) cannot be achieved at a given signal to noise ratio (SNR) regardless the number of acquired samples. Contrary to existing works, we address the signal detection as a binary hypotheses testing problem without having to reconstruct neither the signal nor the spectrum from the observations. Specifically, we adopt a Bernoulli distributed sampler as it exhibits good tradeoff properties between complexity and performance. We show that Bernoulli nonuniform sampling suffers from noise enhancement, which translates into a whitening effect in the correlation of the <b>legacy</b> <b>signal.</b> Therefore, in the presence of noise uncertainty, we derive explicit expressions for sampling walls {{as a function of the}} <b>legacy</b> <b>signal</b> occupation, the SNR and the noise uncertainty level.

40|$|The main {{motivation}} {{of this work}} is to introduce the criteria and to present an exemplary design of an acquisition aiding signal and to discuss the benefits of adding such {{a signal to the}} current GNSS baselines. First of all the main specifications that have to be satisfied by the design are identified, in order to improve the analyzed figures of merit and obtain the desired performance. Following the identified specifications and requirements, a design is proposed. The investigation starts from the spreading modulation and is followed by design of the navigation message. The aspects related to the message coding are discussed as well. Another essential problem is how the acquisition aiding signal can be transmitted with the <b>legacy</b> <b>signal</b> baseline. Also the issue of multiplexing is therefore discussed and analyzed. The design is realized by means of a trade-off of the identified specifications and solutions. The paper is closed with a comprehensive performance analysis of the newly defined signal acting together with the baseline signals. In particular the improved performance in terms of sensitivity and first position fix is highlighted.

Any bias resulting from this correlation process within the user receiver tends to be common across all receiver channels when the signal characteristics are identical (code type, modulation type, and bandwidth). Such common biases will cancel in the user navigation solution and appear as a fixed bias for timing solutions.

In this study, we explore {{the effect of}} migrating <b>legacy</b> <b>signal</b> processing software applications algorithms from large form factor devices to the smaller one such as handheld mobile devices known as Energy Conscious Mobile Computing Systems (EConMCS). We concentrate on Source Code Volatility (SCV), including inherent algorithm complexity and the developer implementation. We identify code Transformation Steering Factors (TSF), such as loop unrolling factor, decision tree grafting factor and their relation to SCV. The impact of TSF is discussed for different multimedia applications in native Digital Signal Processor (DSP) compiler optimization while switching between different transformation schemes. Our results show that SCV can be minimized by using an architecture-centric algorithm that both enables the effective use of underlying hardware architectures and the memory access required to optimize energy consumption. The coded spatial access is implicitly dependent on layout, content and location of options and legibility that relates to a developer’s implementation of loops, code blocks and decision trees. The compiler-centric transformation model minimizes the effect of legacy code migration for multimedia applications.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of localising a mobile {{terminal}} ("blind" node) in unknown position from a set of "anchor" nodes in known positions. The proposed method does not require any form of node synchronisation nor measurement (or control) of the transmission times, which is difficult or anyway costly to achieve in practice. It relies exclusively on reception timestamps collected by the anchor nodes, according to their local clocks, that overhear packets transmitted by the blind node and by (at least one) other transmitting node(s) in known position, e. g., other anchors. The clock differences between the nodes are not eliminated ex ante through clock synchronisation, as in traditional ToA and TDoA methods. Instead, they are counteracted ex post, during the data processing stage, leveraging the data redundancy that is intrinsic to the multiple reception of the same packet by different (anchor) nodes. We validate the proposed method in different experimental settings, indoor and outdoor, using exclusively low-cost Commercial-Off-The-Shelf WiFi devices, achieving sub-meter accuracy in full Line-of-Sight conditions and meter-level accuracy in mild Non-line-of-sight environment. The proposed method does not require that the blind node participate actively to the localisation procedure and can use "opportunistically" any <b>legacy</b> <b>signal</b> or packet available over-the-air for communication purposes. Considering the very minimal requirement on the system - basically, only that anchors in known positions are able to collect and share reception timestamps - the proposed approach can enable practical adoption of opportunistic and/or cooperative localisation on top of existing radio communication systems.

40|$|The use of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for {{remote sensing}} of ocean wind speeds has been {{explored}} {{for nearly two}} decades and has become an important passive remote sensing technique for verification of hurricane formation models. To obtain wind speed measurements, reflected GNSS signals are first cross-correlated with locally generated copies to construct delay-doppler maps (DDMs). Through statistical models, DDMs can provide information about the mean-square slope (MSS) of the ocean surface, which is related to wind speed. Previous studies have focused on <b>legacy</b> <b>signals</b> such as GPS L 1. However, it is expected that the MSS relationship with ocean wind field can be better understood by using similar methods with wider bandwidth signals, such as the GPS L 5 or Galileo E 5 signals.

This system used a Universal Software Radio Peripheral X 300 device configured to sample at 100 MHz. A receiver was designed to generate DDMs with the L 5 signal through zero-padded FFT techniques for cross-correlations. Lab tests showed that the resulting DDMs have the proper sinc function behavior with respect to doppler frequency and triangle function behavior to time delay.
