The 6-meter tall lobby on the ground floor is connected by the escalators coming up from the entrance hall and the platforms built underground.|$|E
5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E

5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial {{is on the other}} side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. <b>Large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E

5|$|Two {{prototype}} dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed. Striking such <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier reducing lathe {{to lower the}} relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore {{at least some of}} the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief. This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail. Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date. The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the San Francisco Mint) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to David Eisenhower (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.|$|E

25|$|Thon's last {{important}} commissions {{were the}} Nikolaevsky railway stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg (1849–51). In his {{design for the}} stations the architect implemented some of the newest construction technologies. Despite <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> steelwork used in the construction, Venetian facades and medieval clock towers of the stations cleverly masked their modern function. Both structures, although extensively reconstructed, are still standing.|$|E

25|$|Container-sized {{units are}} also {{often used for}} moving <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> {{equipment}} to temporary sites. Specialised containers are particularly attractive to militaries already using containerisation to move much of their freight around. Shipment of specialized equipment in this way simplifies logistics and may prevent identification of high value equipment by enemies. Such systems may include command and control facilities, mobile operating theatres or even missile launchers (such as the Russian 3M-54 Klub surface-to-surface missile).|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} smelter was a bole, a large fire {{built on}} a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> rich ore known as bing and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.|$|E
25|$|First, {{the north}} flank engaged the Song forces but were repulsed.

The {{materials}} used in its construction were mostly <b>large</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> roughly hewn red tufa (a common Armenian building material). One of the churches, named Surb Astvatsatsin church, was built in 1198 in white stone, {{on the eastern side}} of the complex. Surb Astvatsatsin is attributed to Yovhannes. The main church was built in 1205, using pink andesite, with a red andesite gavit.|$|E
