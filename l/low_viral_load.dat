50|$|If {{the status}} of the source patient is unknown, their blood should be tested for HIV as soon as {{possible}} following exposure. The injured person can start antiretroviral drugs for PEP as soon as possible, preferably within three days of exposure. There is no vaccine for HIV. When the source of blood is known to be HIV positive, a 3-drug regimen is recommended by the CDC; those exposed to blood with a <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> or otherwise low risk can use a 2-drug protocol. The antivirals are taken for 4 weeks and can include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), or fusion inhibitors. All of these drugs can have severe side effects. PEP may be discontinued if the source of blood tests HIV-negative. Follow-up of all exposed individuals includes counseling and HIV testing for at least six months after exposure. Such tests are done at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months and longer in specific circumstances, such as co-infection with HCV.|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a {{ubiquitous}} human herpesvirus, normally causes an asymptomatic {{latent infection}} with very {{low levels of}} circulating virus in the peripheral blood of infected individuals.

5000|$|R v Mabior, 2012 SCC 47 {{reflects}} the Supreme Court of Canada's most recent decision outlining criminal liability for serostatus nondisclosure. After {{being diagnosed with}} HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment {{at the time of}} pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004 and 2006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mr. Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault. The Court's vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to [...] "significant risk of bodily harm" [...] remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of Cuerrier. Because Cuerrier did not expressly define [...] "significant risk", lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In large part, Mabior represents a response to Cuerrier and an attempt to sharpen the criteria. In Mabior, the Court found that [...] "significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused’s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low; and (ii) condom protection was used".

50|$|During {{the initial}} weeks after HIV infection, {{qualitative}} {{differences in the}} cell-mediated immune response are observed that correlate with different disease progression rates (i.e., rapid progression to WHO stage 4 and the rapid loss of CD4+ T cell levels versus normal to slow progression to WHO stage 4 {{and the maintenance of}} CD4+ T cell counts above 500/µl). The appearance of HIV-1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) early after primo-infection has been correlated with the control of HIV-1 viremia. The virus which escapes this CTL response have been found to have mutations in specific CTL epitopes. Individuals with a broad expansion of the V-beta chain of the T cell receptor of CD8+ T cells during primo-infection appear seem to have low levels of virus six to twelve months later, which is predictive of relatively slow disease progression. In contrast, individuals with an expansion of only a single subset of the V-beta chain of the CD8+ T cells are not able to control HIV levels over time, and thus have high levels of virus six to twelve months later. LTNP’s have also been shown to have a vigorous proliferation of circulating activated HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell and CTL response against multiple epitopes with no detectable broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in the setting of an extremely <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load.</b> However, a few reports have correlated the presence of antibodies against Tat in LTNP status.|$|E
5000|$|Though Canadian {{federal law}} does not contain any HIV-specific statutes, HIV {{transmission}} and exposure are otherwise prosecuted under general offense laws. R. v. Mabior, (2012) SCC 47 reflects the Supreme Court of Canada's most recent decision outlining criminal liability for serostatus nondisclosure. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment {{at the time of}} pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004-2006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault. The Mabior ruling comes fourteen years after R. v. Cuerrier (1998) 127 CCC (3d) 1 (SCC) where the defendant was charged with aggravated assault for the sexual transmission of HIV under s268 Canadian Criminal Code. The Supreme Court of Canada found that the trial judge had misdirected himself and ordered a new trial on two counts of aggravated assault but, in May 1999, the Attorney-General for British Columbia announced that a new persons trial would not take place. The Supreme Court ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected of the English authority of R v Clarence, L’Heureux-Dubé stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise. Subsequent legal precedent has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning [...] "consensual" [...] sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. The Court's vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to [...] "significant risk of bodily harm" [...] remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of Cuerrier.

40|$|A {{detailed}} phenotypic {{analysis of}} {{major and minor}} circulating lymphocyte subsets is described in potential blood donors with markers of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including non-viremic and viremic groups. Although there were no changes in the hematological profile of either group, increased the levels of pre-NK cells (CD 3 -CD 16 +CD 56 -) and a lower frequency of mature NK cells (CD 3 -CD 16 +CD 56 +) characterized innate immunity in the non-viremic group.

Furthermore, this subset was significantly elevated in the viremic subgroup with a <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load.</b> In addition, {{an increase in the}} NKT 2 subset was observed only in this subgroup. An enhanced frequency of activated CD 4 + T-cells (CD 4 +HLA-DR+) was a characteristic feature of the non-viremic group, whereas elevated CD 19 + B-cells and CD 19 +CD 86 + cell populations were the major phenotypic features of the viremic group, particularly in individuals with a <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load.</b> Although CD 4 +CD 25 High T-cells were significantly elevated in both the viremic and non-viremic groups, it was particularly evident in the viremic <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> subgroup.

As RBV cannot be used in certain situations, we examined whether PEG-IFN-alfa- 2 a monotherapy for 24 weeks or less would be sufficient to obtain a sustained virological response (SVR) in patients infected with HCV genotype 2. Methods Forty-nine consecutive patients with HCV genotype 2 received PEG-IFN-alfa- 2 a (180 μg/week) subcutaneously without oral RBV for 8 - 64 weeks. HCV RNA level was determined by COBAS AMPLICOR HCV Test, v 2. 0. Results HCV RNA was equal to or less than 100 KIU/mL (defined as <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load)</b> in 15 of 49 patients, and the remaining 34 had HCV RNA above 100 KIU/mL (defined as high viral load). All 15 patients with <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load</b> achieved rapid virological response (RVR; HCV RNA negative at week 4), and also achieved SVR with an average treatment duration of 17. 1 weeks. The 34 patients with high viral load were treated for 33. 7 weeks on average, and 19 of them (55. 9 %) achieved RVR.

It has been detected primarily {{in children with}} acute lower respiratory tract infection, but its occurrence, clinical profile, and role as a causative agent of respiratory tract disease are not clear. METHODS: We investigated the presence of human bocavirus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and selected serum samples obtained from 259 children (median age, 1. 6 years) who had been hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing. The samples were analyzed for 16 respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction, virus culture, antigen detection, and serological assays. RESULTS: At least 1 potential etiologic agent was detected in 95 % of children, and > 1 agent was detected in 34 % of children. Human bocavirus was detected in 49 children (19 %). A {{large proportion of the}} cases were mixed infections with other viruses, but human bocavirus was the only virus detected in 12 children (5 %). High <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> of human bocavirus were noted mainly in the absence of other viral agents, suggesting a causative role for acute wheezing.

40|$|The use of {{quantitative}} real time {{polymerase chain reaction}} (qPCR) for herpesvirus detection has improved the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, as {{it is able to}} detect shedding episodes in the absence of clinical lesions and diagnose clinical specimens that have <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads.</b> With an aim to improve the detection and quantification of herpesvirus by qPCR, synthetic standard curves for human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV- 1 and HHV- 2) targeting regions gD and gG, respectively, were designed and evaluated. The results show that synthetic curves can replace DNA standard curves in diagnostic herpes qPCR...|$|R

Diverging mode of delivery patterns in Europe reflect uncertainties regarding the risk-benefit balance of elective CS for women on successful HAART...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn recent years, Madagascar and the Comoros {{archipelago}} {{have been}} affected by epidemics of Rift Valley fever (RVF), however detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in zebu, sheep and goats during the post epidemic periods was frequently unsuccessful. Thus, a highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the detection of RVFV at <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads.</b> A new RVF SYBR Green RT-PCR targeting the M segment was tested on serum from different RVF seronegative ruminant species collected from May 2010 to August 2011 in Madagascar and the Comoros archipelago and compared with a RVF specific quantitative real time RT-PCR technique, which is considered as the reference technique. The specificity was tested {{on a wide range of}} arboviruses or other viruses giving RVF similar clinical signs. A total of 38 out of 2756 serum samples tested positive with the new RT-PCR, whereas the reference technique only detected 5 out of the 2756. The described RT-PCR is an efficient diagnostic tool for the investigation of enzootic circulation of the RVF virus. It allows the detection of <b>low</b> <b>viral</b> RNA <b>loads</b> adapted for the investigations of reservoirs or specific epidemiological situations such as inter-epizootic periods...|$|R
