5|$|Ascension was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reception. Critics recommended it as a party game favorable to Super Smash Bros. and praised its balance. However, some felt that its single-player mode was a low point, and <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> lack of an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|Following her re-election, Roberts was {{nominated}} for the post of House Minority Caucus Chair, but lost the caucus' vote for the post to Rep. Amy Stephens. After losing the vote, Roberts publicly <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> lack of rural representation in legislative leadership and alleged that Republican lawmakers were threatened with primaries if they voted for her leadership bid.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Riley {{made his}} last tour, making stops {{in most of}} the major cities in the United States. Advertised as his final performances, there was {{incredible}} demand for tickets and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> lack of change in the program, but found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his outstanding contributions to medicine and academics, {{he is also a}} pundit. In his welcome address at a public lecture organised by the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa held at the International Conference Centre, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, he <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> decline of Africa's contribution to global scientific output. He advocated for the commensurate expansion in doctoral training to meet the human resources needs of the new institutions as well as the existing ones.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly's {{later years}} were troubled with poor health, {{including}} {{the loss of}} a leg. In late 1988, he suffered a major heart attack and was hospitalised for two months. He died in hospital in Sutherland in 1992, aged 86. O'Reilly <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.|$|E
5|$|The Wagga Wagga Civic Theatre {{was officially}} opened in 1963 {{at a cost}} of ₤165,000. During its design and {{construction}} and again after opening the theatre was the subject of severe criticism. Critics <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> destruction of rose gardens removed to allow construction, the size of the orchestra pit, the amount of seating (497 seats) as well as the design of the feature mural. A considerable refurbishment was carried out in the 1990s and now the theatre is {{regarded as one of the}} best in regional Australia, playing host to national and international touring acts.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequent}} crashes of {{the retail}} Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on censoring the game for marketing purposes instead of testing for and fixing the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers who managed to play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or lagged. GamesFirst <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> lack of dedicated low ping servers, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature.|$|E

5|$|Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were {{a close-knit}} couple, and {{contrary}} to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, {{who grew up in}} a warm family atmosphere. With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop a}} {{distinctive}} {{look for the}} various species of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge they provided to players; several critics <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in Halo 3 and conversely praised their return in the later Halo: Reach.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E

5|$|As he {{developed}} the series, Kishimoto created the three primary characters {{as a basis for}} the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Chambers <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> {{effects of}} his {{drug use and}} noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E
5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{particularly}} {{criticized the}} Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics {{not as a}} science but {{as a guide to}} good manners and for their adoption of Probabilism as a moral guide. He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study. In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors. In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.|$|E

In 2009, Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. Harvey vociferously called for Shane Warne and Mark Waugh to be banned from cricket after it was revealed that they accepted money from bookmakers to give pitch and weather information and the ACB privately fined them. He <b>lamented</b> <b>the</b> decline in player conduct in the modern era, also criticising the modern advent of sledging.|$|E
