5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage. The breeding behavior of this species is <b>largely</b> <b>unknown,</b> but the range in molting times implies that this species may breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} {{astrophysicist}} Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his 1995 commentary on Newton's Principia, this theorem remained <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> and undeveloped {{for over three}} centuries. Since 1997, the theorem has been studied by Donald Lynden-Bell and collaborators. Its first exact extension came in 2000 {{with the work of}} Mahomed and Vawda.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton first {{published}} his theorem in 1687, as Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica. However, as astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar {{noted in his}} 1995 commentary on Newton's Principia, the theorem remained <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> and undeveloped for over three centuries.|$|E
25|$|Plant genomes encode {{hundreds}} of proteases, <b>largely</b> of <b>unknown</b> function. Those with known function are largely involved in developmental regulation. Plant proteases {{also play a}} role in regulation of photosynthesis.|$|R

5|$|According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} in the early 1870s by the New York and Boston Air Line Railroad. The details on this bridge are <b>largely</b> <b>unknown,</b> but contradictory evidence exists placing {{the construction of the}} bridge between 1876 and 1877. According to Marshall, the Air Line Railroad was completed in 1873 and the Colchester branch was completed in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are <b>largely</b> <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{movements}} under Army {{control are}} <b>largely</b> <b>unknown,</b> but in January 1941, The New York Times reported that USAT West Corum {{had arrived in}} New York from Puerto Rico. Between February and March 1941, the ship was renamed USAT Will H. Point (though some sources indicate William H. Point instead) in honor of a former officer in the Quartermaster Corps.|$|E
40|$|Pseudo Chediak-Higashi anomaly {{in acute}} leukemia is a rarely {{described}} entity. The {{significance of this}} intriguing morphological finding <b>largely</b> remains <b>unknown,</b> although some authors have predicted a poorer outcome in such cases because of a higher susceptibility to fulminant infections. Our case also had a fatal outcome...|$|R
50|$|The Twilight {{is still}} <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown.</b> This {{may be because}} {{there are very few}} truly {{powerful}} magicians who can successfully navigate its levels. Night Watch mentions that the deepest levels have been navigated by Zabulon (see character descriptions below) but at the cost of great energy expenditure even to him.|$|R
50|$|The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: Corpus Hippocraticum), or Hippocratic Collection, is a {{collection}} of around 60 early Ancient Greek medical works strongly associated with the physician Hippocrates and his teachings. Even though considered as a singular corpus that represents Hippocratic medicine, they vary (sometimes significantly) in content, age, style, and are <b>largely</b> of <b>unknown</b> authorship.|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Oscar nominee Bracco (Goodfellas), Dominic Chianese (The Godfather Part II, along with stage work) and Emmy-winner Nancy Marchand (Lou Grant), the cast of the debut season of the series consisted of <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> actors. After the breakthrough success of the show, many cast members were noted for their acting ability and received mainstream attention for their performances.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain <b>largely</b> <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arghezi's texts for Seara were <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> {{to later}} generations. They again saw print in 2003, in a {{critical}} edition co-edited by daughter Mitzura Arghezi (Domnica Theodorescu) and Traian Radu. According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under false pretense by Mitzura Arghezi, and never returned. As an additional contribution to Romanian literature, Searas popularization of the expression craii de Curtea-Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel.|$|E
5000|$|O'Keeffe was {{instrumental}} in the republication of Flann O'Brien's novel At Swim-Two-Birds in 1959 as well as the posthumous publication of O'Brien's The Third Policeman in 1967; {{had it not been for}} O'Keeffe's determined efforts, the books would <b>largely</b> be <b>unknown</b> today. The Review of Contemporary Fiction has hailed O'Keeffe as [...] "among the most important publishing editors of the century." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1960-61 <b>Largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> team, without Robertson, {{and with}} a new head coach, Ed Jucker, in command, Cincinnati {{stumbled}} to a 5-3 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated Ohio State in overtime, 70-65.|$|R
50|$|Although widely {{considered}} one of the best South American players of all time, he still remains <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> figure in Europe. This is presumably due to his having never participated in a World Cup or playing in Europe. Similar fates awaited other greats such as Alfredo Di Stéfano and George Best, though both are far more known due to their domestic careers with Real Madrid and Manchester United respectively.|$|R
5|$|Before 2010, the {{computing}} {{reliability of}} GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was <b>largely</b> <b>unknown,</b> and circumstantial evidence {{related to the}} lack of built-in error detection and correction in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected soft errors in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm wrote {{well over}} 100 works, {{including}} 35 orchestral works, 7 concertante works (including a violin concerto and two piano concertos), 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus, 54 piano works, 3 organ works, 43 songs, 8 choral part-songs, 7 ballets, and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns. He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the Transcendental Études of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Excluding {{insects and}} other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have {{established}} themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 {{species of fish}} have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is <b>largely</b> <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
50|$|Brutus - Nessie's husband, Brutus is {{the silent}} {{member of the}} Boneyard, never saying {{anything}} more than grunts and growls. Nessie refers to him as mute at one point. He is similar in appearance to Frankenstein's monster, with stitch-lines and bolts in his neck. Due to his silence, Brutus is <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> quantity for now {{except to say that}} he is not terribly bright, not terribly small, and not terribly weak.|$|R
40|$|The “individuation” of oral {{language}} - {{what makes a}} speaker different from another - is still <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> territory [1], especially {{with respect to the}} individual and creative use of speech prosody. This pilot study raises fundamental, methodological and empirical issues concerning the relationship between speakers’ prosodic styles and their personality profiles. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis of a relationship between prosodic styles and "personality style" as perceived by listeners...|$|R
25|$|However, {{the concept}} of the modern prison <b>largely</b> {{remained}} <b>unknown</b> until the early 19th-century. Punishment usually consisted of physical forms of punishment, including capital punishment, mutilation, flagellation (whipping), branding, and non-physical punishments, such as public shaming rituals (like the stocks). From the Middle Ages up to the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, imprisonment was rarely used as a punishment in its own right, and prisons were mainly to hold those awaiting trial and convicts awaiting punishment.|$|R
5|$|From mid-June {{to the end}} of September 1918 Cotillo {{traveled}} around Italy, meeting officials and politicians, giving interviews to the press and addressing large crowds. His efforts in Italy were reported by the press and Italian language newspapers at home in the U.S.. When he returned to New York, Cotillo had risen from a <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> local politician to achieve public stature and become a leader of the Italian community. Based on this experience he wrote the book “Italy During the World War”, published in 1922.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> how baleen whales produce sound {{because of}} the lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E
5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are <b>largely</b> <b>unknown.</b> The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
50|$|John Carne Bidwill {{despite his}} enthusiasm and drive for botanical {{collecting}} and study is today <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> {{figure in the}} history of Queensland, New South Wales and {{in the history of}} the South Pacific. The suburb of Bidwill in Maryborough, and a Parish near Maryborough are named after him, as well as the suburb of Bidwill in Sydney. Ten Australian and three New Zealand plant species are also named after him. Altogether thirty plants carry his name.|$|R
25|$|After {{joining the}} MQM and {{taking part in}} {{national}} politics, Mirza soon participated in illegal activities such as extortion and involved in acquitting in political murders. Mirza <b>largely</b> remained <b>unknown</b> and was not a known figure in the MQM until 1995 when his close friend Faheem Farooqi got arrested in 1995 and described him as his right-hand man. At one time, Mirza was a major figure in the militant wing of the MQM as per Pakistani agencies allegations, running several death cells.|$|R
5000|$|Parton had {{previously}} contributed tracks to a 1963 Kitty Wells / Patsy Cline tribute album, but Hello, I'm Dolly represented her first full-length album. It contained Parton's hits [...] "Dumb Blonde" [...] (written by Curly Putman) and [...] "Something Fishy" [...] (written by Parton), {{both of which}} reached the top twenty on the U.S. country singles charts, and the album itself reached #11 on the country albums chart, a remarkable achievement, considering that Parton was <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> at that point.|$|R
5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley {{initially}} supported Bell's candidacy. Bell urged O'Malley {{to endorse}} him, and offered him {{the job of}} city solicitor {{in exchange for his}} support. However, O'Malley began to distance himself from Bell, not appearing at Bell's campaign announcement, due to disagreements on several bills debated at the City Council. Bell's supporters attempted to convince O'Malley to run for City Council President, but O'Malley announced his decision to run for mayor in June, becoming the first major candidate in the race who was Caucasian. He began the campaign <b>largely</b> <b>unknown</b> outside of Northeast Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains <b>largely</b> <b>unknown,</b> but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E
50|$|Breaking {{in other}} new Glasgow venues, {{including}} Glasgow's Nice'n'Sleazy, the band continued their musical development, narrowly escaping arrest {{along with their}} regular crew from Hyper PA when Strathclyde Police swept in to raid an impromptu rave in the disused printworks in Glasgow's Herbert Street. Organised <b>largely</b> by <b>unknown</b> street associates of the then Editor of M8 Magazine, {{the source of the}} police tip off was never discovered and the band escaped in a hire van as the police swept in and cordoned off the building.|$|R
50|$|Kawasaki {{remained}} <b>largely</b> an <b>unknown</b> on {{the national}} level during his high school career, partly due to his team's failing to make any national tournaments in those three years. Still, he {{made a name for himself}} locally, earning the nickname Satsurō, a portmanteau derived from Satsuma (the name given to a former province of Japan in present-day western Kagoshima) and former Seattle Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki's first name for the similarities in their playing styles. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1999 NPB amateur draft by the then-Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.|$|R
