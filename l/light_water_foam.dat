60|$|The ship {{answered}} her helm and became stationary, while the <b>water</b> <b>foamed</b> against her cut-water, {{as if she}} were driven ahead with the power of a brisk breeze.|$|R

60|$|He {{stopped and}} jerked the tiller, {{a moment too}} late, for a sea came over the bow. The <b>water</b> <b>foamed</b> about Marston's knees, the lantern went out, {{and he thought he}} felt the compass strike his legs.|$|R

60|$|They {{left the}} castle {{grounds for the}} quiet beach, and in the {{meantime}} Mabel Hilliard and Marston leaned against the rails on the pier. For a time the girl watched the <b>water</b> <b>foam</b> among the pillars and then looked up.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} {{rendering}} {{of water and}} terrain, which is {{a key part of}} many computer games and simulations. The resulting application runs fluently and is powered by XNA Framework. Rendering of terrain includes multi-texturing and <b>lighting.</b> The <b>water</b> simulation includes reflection and refraction of ray on <b>water</b> surface. <b>Foam</b> is rendered on the bank of water. Water waves are computed using the inverse discrete Fourier transform...|$|R
50|$|For {{aesthetic}} reasons, {{and for the}} sanitizer to work properly, water {{should be}} neither too alkaline nor too acidic (low pH). The hardness level water, measured {{as the amount of}} dissolved calcium, is also important. Insufficient hardness can lead to corrosion and <b>water</b> <b>foaming.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{landscape}} disintegrates into a rocky litoranea tumbling {{into the}} sea and stretching away {{to the north and}} south in a fractured coastline, with deep blue <b>water</b> <b>foaming</b> at the lands edge, whilst small sandy coves such as Porto Miggiano break up the rocky coastal ridges that are woven with half submerged caverns and grottoes.|$|R
60|$|He {{seized the}} other side of the wheel and helped to spin it around until it was hard down, and then we held it so. The boat resisted, and refused to answer for a while, and next she came surging to starboard, mounted the reef, and sent a long, angry ridge of <b>water</b> <b>foaming</b> away from her bows.|$|R
60|$|Jake {{braced himself}} for an effort and the <b>water</b> <b>foamed</b> about the punt's low bow. Floating weed and scum sped past; {{the bank was}} {{dropping}} {{to the level of}} the flats and its wet slope sparkled in the moonlight. Jake saw the sandy point that marked the bend and resolved to hold out until they reached the spot.|$|R
25|$|In RBMKs, <b>light</b> <b>water</b> {{was used}} as a coolant; {{moderation}} was mainly carried out by graphite. As graphite already moderated neutrons, <b>light</b> <b>water</b> had a lesser effect in slowing them down, but could still absorb them. This means that the reactor's reactivity (adjustable by appropriate neutron-absorbing rods) had to account for the neutrons absorbed by <b>light</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|As I sat cogitating, {{my brother}} scribblers {{called me to}} join them in a short {{promenade}} upon the wharf, preparatory to resuming our pens. Just as we reached it, a small Indian canoe from the interior swept round the point above the factory, and came rapidly forward, the sparkling <b>water</b> <b>foaming</b> past her sharp bow as she made towards the landing.|$|R
60|$|Wade soon {{entered the}} spruce forest. Then {{he came to}} a shallow, roaring river. The horses drank the <b>water,</b> <b>foaming</b> white and amber around their knees, and then with splash and thump they forded it over the {{slippery}} rocks. As they cracked out upon the trail a covey of grouse whirred up into the low branches of spruce-trees. They were tame.|$|R
60|$|Ben {{had just}} gained {{the bank of}} the stream when a low moan reached his ears. At first he could not locate the sound, but {{presently}} discovered that it came from the vicinity of the rocks. Feeling his way along he managed, but not without great difficulty, to gain the top of the rocks. Here he saw the <b>water</b> <b>foaming</b> and boiling twenty feet below.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{water is}} a neutron {{moderator}} used in some nuclear reactors; {{it also has a}} secondary function as their coolant. <b>Light</b> <b>water</b> reactors, both boiling water and pressurised water reactors the most common type, use ordinary (<b>light)</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} methods of near {{isothermal}} compression are being developed. Fluid Mechanics has {{a system with}} a heat absorbing and releasing structure (HARS) attached to a reciprocating piston. Light Sail inject a water spray into a reciprocating cylinder. SustainX use an air <b>water</b> <b>foam</b> mix inside a compressor. All these systems ensure that the air is compressed with high thermal diffusivity compared to the speed of compression.|$|R

I imagine the stream swept {{it under the}} ice, for I could only see the dark <b>water</b> <b>foam.</b> All the food I had except a bannock in my pocket was lost. I forgot the team {{for a few moments}} and when I looked up they had gone." ...|$|R
60|$|The wading was {{difficult}} this time. The <b>water</b> <b>foamed</b> furiously around his knees. Once he slipped on a stone, and nearly lost his balance. Uttering a little scream Helen grasped at him wildly, and her arm encircled his neck. What was still more trying, {{when he put}} her on her feet again, {{it was found that}} her hair had become entangled in the porcupine quills on his hunting-coat.|$|R

60|$|Marston {{signed to}} the steersman, the sails filled, and the canoe dropped astern. Columbine {{gathered}} speed and listed down, throwing spray about while the <b>water</b> <b>foamed</b> below her lee rail. Small white waves {{rolled down the}} glittering track ahead and Marston's mood got lighter. After all, {{it was a relief}} to put to sea; the salt wind was tonic and blew morbid thoughts away. It was bracing to grapple with breaking waves and savage squalls.|$|R
