50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Coccycua minuta) is {{a species}} of bird in the cuckoo family (Cuculidae) from South America and Panama. It was {{formerly}} placed in the genus Piaya but a monotypic genus Coccycua was once erected for it. This has been reinstated following the discovery that the closest living relatives of the <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo</b> are some species traditionally placed in Coccyzus or Micrococcyx, {{rather than the other}} members of Piaya.|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> bronze <b>cuckoo</b> (Chrysococcyx minutillus) is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. It is found in Southeast Asia, New Guinea and {{northern}} and eastern Australia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. This is the world's smallest cuckoo, at 17 grams and 15 cm. The subspecies rufomerus and crassirostris are sometimes given specific status.|$|R
5000|$|One {{commentator}} saw {{the phrase}} Let's do [...] "it" [...] as a euphemistic {{reference to a}} proposition for sexual intercourse. According to this argument, Let's do it was a pioneer pop song to declare openly [...] "sex is fun". According to it, several suggestive lines include a couplet from verse 4: [...] "Moths in your rugs do it, What's the use of moth-balls?" [...] and [...] "Folks in Siam do it, Think of Siamese twins" [...] (verse 1) and [...] "Why ask if shad do it? Waiter, bring me shad roe" [...] (verse 3) and [...] "Sweet guinea-pigs do it, Buy a couple and wait" [...] (verse 5). There is also a report that Porter's original version included the even more risqué line, [...] "Roosters with a doodle and a cock do it" [...] If true, this was probably replaced {{by one of the}} lines in the verse 2 couplet [...] "Penguins in flocks, on the rocks, do it, Even <b>little</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> in their clocks, do it." ...|$|R
50|$|Flowers are pollinated by {{a variety}} of bees, {{including}} <b>little</b> carpenter bees, <b>cuckoo</b> bees, halictine bees, and masked bees, as well as flies, including syrphid flies, bee flies, tachinid flies, flesh flies, anthomyiid flies, and muscid flies. Wasps, small butterflies, and other insects also visit the flowers to a lesser degree, seeking nectar, as well as a few pollen-feeding beetles.|$|R

50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo</b> {{has been}} found to be closer to some species {{traditionally}} placed in Coccyzus or Micrococcyx. These are now again separated in Coccycua.|$|E
50|$|The genus Playa is {{considered}} paraphyletic. The <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (P. minuta) doesn't cluster with the squirrel cuckoo and the black-bellied cuckoo, {{as it was}} traditionally classified.|$|E
50|$|Dakhla Peninsula and Cintra Bay {{are some}} of the most {{important}} wintering grounds for birds especially for waders. The greater flamingo is one of the most iconic birds in the region and there are numerous others known to migrate or inhabit. Some of these are; pelican, great cormorant, gulls (slender-billed, Audouin's, black-backed), larks (sparrow, bar-tailed), terns (little, Caspian, royal, Sandwich), black wheatear, western reef heron, marsh harrier, sparrowhawk, lesser kestrel, laughing dove, great spotted <b>cuckoo,</b> <b>little</b> swift, hoopoe, rock martin, cricket longtail, oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, pharaoh eagle owl, and red-knobbed coot.|$|R
50|$|For the cuckoos {{suitable}} habitat {{provides a}} source of food (principally insects and especially caterpillars) {{and a place to}} breed, for brood parasites the need is for suitable habitat for the host species. Cuckoos occur {{in a wide variety of}} habitats. The majority of species occur in forests and woodland, principally in the evergreen rainforests of the tropics. Some species inhabit or are even restricted to mangrove forests; these include the <b>little</b> bronze <b>cuckoo</b> of Australia, some malkohas, coucals, and the aptly-named mangrove cuckoo of the New World. In addition to forests come species of cuckoo occupy more open environments; this can include even arid areas like deserts in the case of the greater roadrunner or the pallid cuckoo. Temperate migratory species like the common cuckoo inhabit a wide range of habitats in order to make maximum use of the potential brood hosts, from reed beds (where they parasitise reed warblers) to treeless moors (where they parasitise meadow pipits).|$|R
50|$|Cuckoos are {{medium-sized}} {{birds that}} {{range in size}} from the <b>little</b> bronze <b>cuckoo,</b> at 17 g and 15 cm (6 inches), to the channel-billed cuckoo, at 630 g (1.4 lbs) and 63 cm (25 inches). There is generally little sexual dimorphism in size, but where it exists, it can be either the male or the female that is larger. One of the most important distinguishing features of the family are the feet, which are zygodactyl, meaning that the two inner toes point forward and the two outer backward. There are two basic body forms, arboreal species (like the common cuckoo) which are slender and have short tarsi, and terrestrial species (like the roadrunners) which are more heavy set and have long tarsi. Almost all species have long tails which are used for steering in terrestrial species and as a rudder during flight in the arboreal species. The wing shape also varies with lifestyle, with the more migratory species like the black-billed cuckoo possessing long narrow wings capable of strong direct flight, and the more terrestrial and sedentary cuckoos like the coucals and malkohas having shorter rounded wings and a more laboured gliding flight.|$|R
50|$|It was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} genus Coccyzus or Micrococcyx. Following the discovery that it belongs to a distinct lineage around the <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> the genus Coccycua has been reinstated for these.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the ruins}} of Erfenstein Castle, in the eponymous Ortsteil, there is a halt on the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway (Kuckucksbähnel). This is a {{heritage}} railway running between Neustadt an der Weinstraße and Elmstein.|$|E
50|$|Restoration and maintenance, upkeep of the {{buildings}} and operation of the associated museum railway are {{carried out by the}} society members. The preserved railway, called the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway (Kuckucksbähnel), starts at Neustadt and heads into the Palatine Forest, west of Neustadt.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{is home to}} Africa's {{big five}} game: elephant, {{rhinoceros}} (black/hook-lipped and white/square-lipped), Cape buffalo, lion and leopard. It is home to 86 special species including: Nile crocodile, hippo, cheetah, spotted hyena, blue wildebeest, jackal, giraffe, zebra, waterbuck, nyala, eland, kudu, impala, duiker, suni, reedbuck, common warthog, bushpig, mongoose, baboons, monkeys, a variety of tortoises, terrapins, snakes and lizards. [...] It {{is one of the}} world's top spots for viewing nyala. The park is a prime birding destination and is home to 340 bird species. The Hluhluwe River Flood Plain is one of the only areas in the whole of South Africa where yellow-throated, pink-throated and orange-throated longclaw species can be seen together. Bird life include night heron, Wahlberg's eagle, Shelley's francolin, black-bellied korhaan, Temminck's courser, Klaas's <b>cuckoo,</b> <b>little</b> bee-eater and crested barbet.|$|R
5000|$|The Neustadt/Weinstraße Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum Neustadt/Weinstraße), that {{is located}} in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the main station at Neustadt an der Weinstraße, in its former locomotive shed. The DGEG operates the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway (Kuckucksbähnel) from there, using its own rolling stock.|$|E
50|$|The Mannheim-Saarbrücken railway {{runs from}} east to west on a slight curve. About a {{kilometre}} and a half from the station area, the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway branches off the main line and turns south across the federal highway and runs through the Elmstein valley to Frankeneck.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the ash-colored cuckoo and dwarf cuckoo [...] - [...] {{at one time}} {{separated}} in Micrococcyx [...] - [...] {{have been found to}} be closest relatives of the <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> formerly in Piaya. These three are now again placed in the reinstated genus of the latter, Coccycua.|$|E
50|$|From the 1980s onwards Übergabezüge (goods {{exchange}} trains) {{served the}} station, which {{at that time}} no longer had an important market. It was based in Neustadter Hauptbahnhof. In the meantime, the former Frankeneck station, which functions {{as a part of}} Lambrecht station, is served by the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway. Freight traffic has now been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, an {{industrial}} siding was opened via Frankeneck to the hamlet of Sattelmühle {{as a stage}} towards building a line to Elmstein. Finally, the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway running up to Elmstein was opened on 23 January 1909. The train that was expected to make the opening trip from Elmstein, however, was involved in an accident, {{and had to be}} replaced by a train from Lambrecht.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{industrial}} heritage include the Stumpfwald Railway at Ramsen, a heritage Feldbahn since 1996, {{as well as}} the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway (see Transport), which has been worked by historic steam trains since 1984 and operates services from March to October at weekends between Neustadt and Elmstein. In addition, there is a good overview of nearly 150 years of Palatine railway history at the German Railway Museum in Neustadt which has numerous exhibits.|$|E
50|$|This small cuckoo occurs from Panama and Trinidad south through Colombia to Bolivia, Peru and Brazil; in Ecuador, it {{has been}} {{recorded}} as high up as 1900 m ASL. The <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is found in mangrove swamps, and scrubby woodland near water. It is generally believed to be an all-year resident, but its irregular occurrence in some areas has led to speculations that it undertakes seasonal short-distance migrations. Fairly widely distributed and not particularly rare, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|Lambrecht (Pfalz) {{station is}} located on the {{northern}} outskirts of Lambrecht (Pfalz). Since 1909, the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway has branched off there; since 1984 it has been a heritage railway. The original entrance building was built in the architectural style of the Palatinate used {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, especially for railway stations. It was burnt down in the Second World War during military action. The current station building dates from 1957, but it is no longer used for railway operations. The station has been electrified since 12 March 1964.|$|E
50|$|This {{large and}} {{extremely}} long-tailed cuckoo is 40.5 - 50 cm long and weighs 95 - 120 g. The adult has mainly chestnut upperparts and head, becoming paler on the throat. The lower breast is grey and the belly is blackish. The central tail feathers are rufous, but the outer are black with white tips. The bill is yellow and the iris is red. Immature birds have a grey bill and eyering, brown iris, and less {{white in the}} tail. It resembles the <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> but that species is smaller and has a darker throat.|$|E
50|$|On 24 December 1881, Palatine Ludwig Railway Company (Pfälzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft) {{established}} a yard for loading timber near {{the station in}} order to improve operations. This later developed into Lambrecht freight yard, since Lambrecht station had reached the limits of its capacities and, for reasons of topography, an extension of the track layout was impossible. Frankeneck freight yard was also built {{at the other end of}} the track that developed into the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway. In order to get to the freight yard, the trains had to reverse in Frankeneck station, with the locomotive running around the train. The freight yard itself had four main tracks.|$|E
50|$|Within the Palatine Forest, {{the number}} of curves along the line {{increases}} significantly. The line runs parallel to the federal highway 39 through the middle range, which it repeatedly crosses on bridges in this region. On the 33.5 kilometre-long section between Neustadt an der Weinstraße and Kaiserslautern, the line climbs through a height difference of 109 metres and passes through a total of twelve tunnels. Along this section, the line passes next to several sandstone cliffs. West of Neustadt, the line passes through the Wolfsberg Tunnel. The line runs along the Speyerbach to Lambrecht, where the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway (Kuckucksbähnel), operated as a heritage railway since 1984, branches off.|$|E

5000|$|Sylvanas {{was also}} listed #2 on Matthew Rossi of Engadget's [...] "Top 10 {{magnificent}} bastards of Warcraft", as [...] "Sylvanas Windrunner has clawed {{her way to}} the number two slot by basically becoming ever more ruthless and viciously pragmatic in every appearance. She's cultivated a personality that has in turn formed its own cult among her Forsaken followers." [...] He also wrote that [...] "Sylvanas is an interesting character because despite her often abominable actions, her actions make sense when related to her backstory. She's not an unknowable menace, and while you may not support what she does, you have to admit that it's hard to imagine not being as she is when she's experienced what she has." [...] Actress Michele Morrow stated her desire to play as Sylvanas in the Warcraft film, stating [...] "To be honest, I’d be happy to play any of the characters in the movie. But, Sylvanas… I love her because she's determined. She's insidious. She's arrogant and spiteful, but you can’t really blame her. She's very tortured. I love this imagination of her. She truly takes her own council"; with an associated Facebook page receiving over 5,000 likes. However, Anne Stickney of Engadget reviewed Sylvanas more negatively, claiming [...] "Sylvanas Windrunner? Technically dead. Obsessed with procreation. Sylvanas actually stands on her own two feet, but her story is leaning more and more away from a competent leader and more toward someone who may just be a <b>little</b> <b>cuckoo</b> for Cocoa Puffs, if you know what I mean." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1949, {{the newly}} founded Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) {{transferred}} {{the station to}} the Bundesbahndirektion Mainz (Bundesbahn railway division of Mainz), which was assigned all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The new entrance building was opened on 5 June 1957. Regular passenger services ended as early as 1960 on the <b>Little</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Railway. Due to the thin population of the area, it was mainly useful for freight traffic; passenger traffic had always been minor. Since the main line from Mannheim had always had a great significance for long-distance traffic to Saarbrücken, it was gradually electrified, starting in 1960. The Saarbrücken-Homburg section could be operated electrically on 8 March 1960. The Homburg-Kaiserslautern followed on 18 May 1961 and from 12 March 1964 the entire line, including Lambrecht station, was electrically operated. The electrification of the remaining section was delayed {{mainly because of the}} numerous tunnels between Kaiserslautern and Neustadt that had to be enlarged. On 1 August 1971, the station came {{under the jurisdiction of the}} railway division of Karlsruhe with the dissolution of the railway division of Mainz. At the same time the platforms were raised. The last scheduled freight train south of Frankeneck operated on the Cuckoo Railway on 30 June 1976. A year later the traffic on it was officially abandoned. In the last years of operations, the branch was officially designated as only a siding of Lambrecht station. From the mid-1970s onwards, Frankeneck station, which was located on the branch, was officially designated as a part of Lambrecht station. Since 1984, the branch line has been operated as a heritage railway. Since 1990, the station has been part of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar transport association, VRN).|$|E
