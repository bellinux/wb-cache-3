25|$|The {{launch of}} the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It {{was a far cry}} from the {{original}} system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each <b>listed</b> <b>security</b> in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.|$|E

It let the airline expand its fleet, leading to introduction of the One-Eleven, Boeing 707, Hawker Siddeley 748, Boeing 727,Boeing 737, BAe 146 and, eventually, the Airbus A300.Most were acquired second-hand.|$|E

Shizuka and Nobita managed to beat it by turning the head itself into stone by using a mirror. During the incident, Kurt's monitor was recovered by Nobita. When Kaitou intercepted the group, Nobita managed to discover the real identity of Kaitou which in turn known to be Kurt himself. Kurt reveals himself as the Copy Robot who took his place. When asked about the reason, Kurt explains the discovery that he and Dr. Pepura were about to create. In order to convert all the FullMetal into Pepura-metal, he needs to recover the chips which Dr. Pepura hides it under the six lost items while they were at repairing stage.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse the {{development}} and growth of the Kenyan private security sector, and to establish its role and impact on safety and security. The study included determining {{the impact of the}} private security sector in Nairobi and the mobile patrol functions on safety and security in Kenya. Furthermore, to determine the impact of the Kenyan private security sector on loss prevention functions; reviewed how special events security and private investigation functions affect the safety and security of Kenyans; and also considered how in-house security functions of the private security sector further influence safety and security in Kenya. The researcher reviewed previous studies with a view to establish academic gaps which the present study sought to bridge. This study adopted a census survey design and employed quantitative research methods as the main approach to guide the study. The research targeted all of the private security firms in Kenya. There are 23 <b>listed</b> <b>security</b> firms under the Kenya Security Industry Association (KSIA) and 44 under the Protective Security Industry Association (PSIA) - a total of 67 security firms in Kenya. The research instrument used for data collection was a questionnaire to elicit the required information from the respondents. The respondents were either the Managing Director or Head of Security at these firms, since they have a broad knowledge about the business activities being conducted by the company. Most of them have been with the company for a significant number of years. Emanating from the research findings it is recommended that the security firms should better train the private security guards in order to enhance overall security being provided to clients. Security guards must be able to respond to different changes in their environment, which include action such as traffic movement; ensure the safety of people among and inside different localities; observing and handling the admittance and exit of individuals and cars and evaluating and monitoring individuals and coming up with a policy and legal framework for regulating and observing Private Security Company (PSC) activity. The study concludes that the private security sector in Kenya impacts on and influences overall safety and security. The study, therefore, finds that there has been growth and development of the private security sector in Kenya and it continues to do so currently. Finally, advances the view that a significant relationship does exist between the functions of the private security sector and the development of the private security sector in Kenya which have had an extensive influence on levels of safety and security in that country.
