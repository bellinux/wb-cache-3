Patients suffering from irreversible brain damages after cardiac arrest are commonly considered candidates for DCDMIII, but little is known regarding the proportion of these patients who could be eligible for this procedure. Using a cohort of post-cardiac arrest patients, {{our aim was to}} assess the rate of contra-indications for DCDMIII and to measure the delay between withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatments</b> (LSTW) and the appearance of low values for common physiological parameters during the agonal phase, which may compromise the process by altering graft function.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prior studies {{attempting}} to improve end-of-life care {{have focused on}} specific outcomes deemed important to healthcare providers, with disappointing results. Improvement may be best achieved by identifying concerns important to individual patients, communicating the patients' concerns to the treating medical team, and repeating the process frequently until all concerns are addressed. Our objective was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of this innovative patient-centred quality improvement strategy. Methods Initial interviews elicited participants' ideas for improvement, which were then fed back to health care providers by the study investigator. A rapid-cycle change model ensured frequent reassessment and continued feedback. The study involved 36 seriously ill, hospitalized patients on teaching general medical inpatient units of a tertiary care hospital. The main outcome measure was participants' ratings of satisfaction within different domains of care on follow-up interviews. Results The proportion of participants who rated various aspects of their care as "excellent" or "very good" on initial interview was 72 % for overall care, 64 % for symptom control, 66 % for level of support, and 75 % for discussions about <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatments.</b> Patients and families identified many actionable steps for improvement such as; better control of pain and shortness of breath, better access to physicians and medical information, more help with activities of daily living, improving the patient's environment, and shorter waits for nursing care, diagnosis, and treatment. Following feedback to the clinical team, participants reported improvement in overall care (32 %), symptom control (44 %), and support (40 %). Only a minority had further discussions about <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatments.</b> Conclusion A patient-centred approach using rapid-cycle change was feasible and shows promise for {{improving the quality of}} end-of-life care.

50|$|Patients {{should also}} include advance health care directives. These three medical orders (DNR, MOST, POLST) must be signed by a {{physician}} and are {{the most frequently used}} medical directives. The DNR (Do Not Resuscitate order) expresses the patient's preference to decline Cardio-Pulmonary-Resuscitation (CPR). The names of the other more comprehensive physician orders (MOST form or POLST form) will vary by your state. In some states - it is called a MOST order form (Medical Order for Scope of Treatment) and in other states this document is called a POLST order form (Physician Order for <b>Life</b> <b>Sustaining</b> <b>Treatment).</b> These medical treatment preference documents are critical - especially for the elderly for whom resuscitation by emergency responders (EMTs) may cause painful and/or life-threatening injuries. Without these documents to guide the emergency responder - patients must understand that EMTs are trained to automatically administer a full range of emergency life saving measures. For many patients such measures may be a wonderful blessing; for others who are elderly or frail or in very poor health - these same measures may be a curse. The patient who wishes to decline automatic EMT measures - should be aware that most jurisdictions will require that the DNR, the MOST, and the POLST documents included in the Vial of Life container be original versions including the physician's signature.|$|E

Design: Qualitative Medical Ethnography. Setting: Tertiary care children 2 ̆ 7 s hospital affiliated with a college of medicine. Participants: Eleven {{critical care}} providers in the department of pediatrics (attending physicians, critical care fellows, pediatric nurse practitioners, physician assistants). Interventions: In depth, semi-structured interviews designed to explore the experiences of providers in the participation of end-of-life care decision-making. Measurements and Main Results: Findings from the data included concepts and themes that were then organized into a conceptual framework to help understand the decision making process for critically ill children {{at the end of life}}. The four major themes identified were: Expectations and Perspectives, Communication Enhancers and Inhibitors, Decision Enablers and Barriers, and Conversation Mechanics. Each theme consists of several concepts from the data that further inform the process. The Expectations and Perspectives theme explains differences between parents and providers that, if understood, can be managed more effectively. The themes focused on communication and decisions elucidate concepts that will improve the process and concepts that have been identified as barriers. The Conversation Mechanics theme provides insight into the process of acquiring the skills that providers have experienced. Conclusions: After conducting in-depth interviews with critical care providers who care for children at the end of life 1 a conceptual framework is proposed to provide a better understanding of the decision-making process and to suggest interventions to make advancements...|$|R

This study is conducted to review attitudes {{and practice of}} pediatrics and gynecology physicians in this field. Materials and methods: This survey was conducted during 2009 in Sari and Babol. A total of 140 pediatricians, gynecologists and residents/fellows in these fields were recruited by census; 106 doctors completed an anonymous questionnaire (response rate 75. 7 %). Results: More than 70 percent of respondents disagreed and {{less than a quarter}} of them agreed with euthanasia. Thus far, none of the doctors prescribed drugs to expedite neonatal death. Withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatment</b> in infants with adverse prognoses and incurable conditions was uncommon, and reported by one fifth of physicians in their diagnosis of infants with multiple congenital anomalies. Influential factors in their decision to withdraw <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatment</b> in these infants were: the number of children, the insistence of hospital staff, the request from parents, the infant's sex, lack of hospital facilities, parental history of infertility and family income, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to describe, and to further {{understand}} the lived experience of intensive care nurses, who care for patients for whom <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatment</b> is being withdrawn. It is known that a large percentage of patient deaths that occur in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) follow the withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatment.</b> Nurses are the primary care givers of patients in the ICU and are directly involved in end-of-life care and the initiation of withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatment.</b> Interpretive phenomenology served as the methodology by which the researcher explored and interpreted the lived experience of these ICU nurses. Unstructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with six intensive care nurses employed in the ICU of a large tertiary care hospital. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using approaches outlined by Colaizzi (1978) and van Manen (1990). The essence of this experience was described by intensive care nurses as "trying to do the right thing". Three major themes emerged from the data: A Journey [...] Creating Comfort Along the Way; Working in Professional Angst and Providing Memories. The findings have given a voice to intensive care nurses in their role of providing care to patients and families during this experience...|$|E
40|$|Background: Continuous deep {{sedation}} {{at the end}} of life is {{a practice}} that has been the topic of considerable ethical debate, for example surrounding its perceived similarity or dissimilarity with physician-assisted dying. The practice is generally considered to be legal as a form of symptom control, although this is mostly only assumed. France has passed an amendment to the Public Health Act that would grant certain terminally ill patients an explicit right to continuous deep sedation until they pass away. Such a framework would be unique in the world. Discussion: In this paper we will highlight and reflect on four relevant aspects and shortcomings of the proposed bill. First, that the bill suggests that continuous deeps sedation should be considered as a sui generis practice. Second, that it requires that sedation should always be accompanied by the withholding of all artificial nutrition and hydration. In the most recently amended version of the legal proposal it is stated that <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>treatments</b> are withheld unless the patient objects. Third, that the French bill would not require that the suffering for which continuous deep sedation is initiated is unbearable. Fourth, the question as to whether the proposal should be considered as a way to avoid having to decriminalise euthanasia and/or PAS or, on the contrary, as a veiled way to decriminalise these practices. Summary: The French proposal to amend the Public Health Act to include a right to continuous deep sedation for some patients is a unique opportunity to clarify the legality of continuous deep sedation as an end-of-life practice. Moreover, it would recognize that the practice of continuous deep sedation raises ethical and legal issues that are different from those raised by symptom control on the one hand and assisted dying on the other hand. Nevertheless, there are still various issues of significant ethical concern in the French legislative proposal...|$|R

Doctor of Philosophy (Public Administration), August 2012, 203 pp., 21 tables, 2 figures, references, 142 titles.

This dissertation determines that all 50 states have advance directive laws that protect a patient’s right to refuse LSMT even when a healthcare provider objects, yet only some states have policies that protect the patient’s right to choose to continue LSMT when a healthcare provider objects (a dispute known as medical futility). Some states have pro-patient laws that protect the patient’s right to make the final decision, while other states have enacted pro-provider medical futility policies that explicitly grant the provider authority to remove LSMT against the patient’s wishes. Finally, in one state, the law delegates the final decision to a third-party: institutional healthcare ethics committees.

40|$|Hospice {{care has}} been proved to result in changes to the medical {{behaviors}} of terminally ill patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects and medical behavior changes of hospice-shared care intervention among terminally ill gastric cancer patients. A total of 174 patients who died of gastric cancer between 2012 and 2014 were identified. These patients were divided into two groups: a hospice-shared care group (n = 93) and a control group (n = 81). Among the 174 patients, 84 % had advanced stage (stage III or stage IV) cancer. The females and the patients cared by medical oncologists had a higher percentage of hospice-shared care than the males (71 % vs 44 %, p = 0. 001) and those cared by other physicians (63 % vs 41 %, p = 0. 004). Compared to the control group, the hospice-shared care group underwent lower incidence of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> or aggressive medical treatments, including intensive care unit admission (2 % vs 26 %, p< 0. 001), intubation (1 % vs 27 %, p< 0. 001), cardiopulmonary-cerebral resuscitation (0 % vs 11 %, p = 0. 001), ventilator use (1 % vs 27 %, p< 0. 001), inotropic agent use (8 % vs 46 %, p< 0. 001), total or partial parenteral nutrition use (38 % vs. 58 %, p = 0. 029), and blood transfusion (45 % vs 74 %, p< 0. 001).

Using a family symbolic interactionism theoretical framework and a hermeneutic phenomenological perspective, this study sought to answer the question: What do families experience during the process of withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> therapy from a family member with an unexpected, life threatening illness or injury? ^ Van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) phenomenological method of qualitative research was used.

Multiple interviews and observations occurred over a period of days to weeks as families participated in the process of withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>sustaining</b> therapy. Four critical care units of a metropolitan medical center were used for data collection. Theoretical purposive sampling was used to obtain families with a variety of experiences.
