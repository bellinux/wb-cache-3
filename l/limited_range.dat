5|$|The {{field has}} erupted andesite. Such a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of {{composition}} is typical for Austral Volcanic Zone volcanoes, which only feature andesite and dacite. Lava domes feature columnar joints. The surface {{texture of the}} rocks is trachytic to porphyritic.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the natural history of the Borneo shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> within heavily fished waters.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E

5|$|In the game, {{the player}} assumes control of American forces and must {{eliminate}} all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility {{with black and}} white television sets, as the game was only accessible in a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of colours. The easy difficulty of the gameplay was also criticised.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{is found}} {{throughout}} the highly <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House. The insects also {{found their way to}} Lundy cabbages artificially seeded within the cabbage's range within a year. It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|E
5|$|SCPA {{offers a}} <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> {{of sports and}} other {{activities}} compared to other CPS schools, as {{students are expected to}} commit significant after-school time to practice and performance. Volunteer community service opportunities are organized by the Positive School Culture committee and made available to students in every grade. Student Council is elected from each grade and raises funds for student activities. National Honor Society (for grades ten to twelve) and National Junior Honor Society (for grades seven through nine) are by invitation only to students who demonstrate outstanding achievement, service, leadership, and citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{published}} numerous compilations of songs, {{including two}} six-volume textbook series, which were widely {{used throughout the}} United States. Most of her writings were focused on children's voices and contained short songs written with attention paid to the <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> and short attention span of children. Many of her compositions were still being used in music education programs {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} Mascarene martin is restricted to three islands. Madagascar has an area of , but the next largest island, Réunion, is just 2,512km2 (790km2). Although this bird has a <b>limited</b> <b>range,</b> it is abundant on Mauritius and Réunion, and locally common in Madagascar. The population is unknown, but exceeds the vulnerability threshold of 10,000 mature individuals and {{is believed to be}} stable. This martin is therefore also classed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.|$|E

5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a <b>limited</b> <b>range.</b> The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' parish {{church was}} rebuilt in 1873 {{and is a}} grade II listed building. James Oglethorpe, {{the founder of the}} state of Georgia, now part of the United States of America, is buried with his wife at the centre of its chancel. The area around the church forms a {{conservation}} area. There is a second church called St Luke's further north on Front Lane. Cranham Hall, the former manor house, is a grade II listed building. There are two community associations that are both registered charities. The Cranham Community Association operates a broad range of sporting, self-improvement and hobby activities at Cranham Community Centre on Marlborough Gardens. Cranham Social Hall, with a capacity of 100, is separately operated by the Front Lane Community Association, and provides a <b>limited</b> <b>range</b> of activities.
