50|$|A Polyarnaya Aviatsiya G-2 (CCCP-N210) {{crashed on}} landing at Bukhta Teplits; ground fog forced {{the crew to}} perform a go-around. As a result of poor CRM the {{aircraft}} re-entered the fog. Descent was continued until the left <b>landing</b> <b>ski</b> struck snow, ripping off the landing gear and causing the aircraft to crash; all seven on board survived, but the aircraft was written off.|$|E
50|$|Newly built 346-1 {{incorporated}} minor aerodynamic refinements {{over the}} 346-P, and was first flown by Ziese on September 30, 1948, with dummy engines installed. The glider was released {{at an altitude}} of 9700 m, and the pilot realised that he hardly could maintain control of the aircraft. Consequently, while attempting to land, he descended too fast (his speed was later estimated at 310 km/h). After first touching the ground he bounced up to a height of 3-4 m and flew 700-800 m. At the second descent, the <b>landing</b> <b>ski</b> collapsed and the fuselage hit the ground hard.|$|E
50|$|Turbo Tubing was {{discontinued}} during January 2009. It {{was located}} {{in front of the}} Base Lodge, on The <b>Landing</b> <b>ski</b> trail, and was serviced by the Skidway Chairlift. It operated on select nights such as weekends and holidays. Previously it had been located east of the Whiffletree and featured high-speed tracks with a large hill at the base to slow the tubes. Riders used a handle-tow line which has since been removed. It has since been replaced by Kids Tubing which uses the same tubes but only runs about 300 ft next to the Moosecalator, and is serviced by that lift.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 Australian Aviation {{reported}} that, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of developing a new Defence White Paper, the Australian Government was considering purchasing two LC-130J Hercules fitted with <b>landing</b> <b>skis</b> and other equipment needed to allow the aircraft to operate in Antarctica. If acquired, these aircraft would be used to support the Australian Antarctic Division's operations following the closure of the Wilkins Runway near Casey Station.|$|R

50|$|Both models had ovoid {{cross section}} fuselages with ply skinning. In other respects the fuselages and empennages {{of the two}} types {{differed}} significantly, most obviously {{in the design of}} the cockpit and canopy and the related fuselage depth, as well as in the undercarriage. The upper edge of the fuselage of the Acore was straight and at about the height of the wing tips, higher than that of the earlier aircraft, enabling the fuselage top, teardrop shaped canopy of the Pinguino to be replaced by one with an upper line co-linear with that of the fuselage. The two models shared a rather upright windscreen, halfway between the nose and the wing leading edge. The Arcore had a shorter <b>landing</b> <b>ski</b> than its predecessor, ending at a fixed, partly recessed monowheel assisted by a small tail bumper. As before, its horizontal tail was raised above the fuselage on a shallow step but the elevator area was reduced by taper and it carried a small trim tab. The narrow fin was shorter than before, which allowed a shorter, broader rudder to be horn balanced. The control surfaces were fabric covered, and the fixed surfaces ply skinned.|$|E

50|$|The {{helicopter}} emerges over an ice-shelf before Charlie. Shephard {{looks on}} helplessly as Charlie climbs up towards the aircraft and {{grabs hold of}} one of its <b>landing</b> <b>skis.</b> In an attempt to evade Charlie's grasp, the helicopter pilot pulls up, but Charlie dangles beneath the aircraft while it continues to climb high into the sky. The co-pilot offers a hand to Charlie to save him, but an elated and ecstatic Charlie cries out and releases the aircraft, seeming to float through the sky while he plunges.|$|R
50|$|The Vale Niseko {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of ski-in ski-out {{buildings}} in Niseko due the limited amount of residential <b>land</b> bordering the <b>ski</b> runs. Sitting at the base of the Family Run and approx 120 m to the village centre, owner/developer Niseko Alpine Developments (NISADE) bought additional neighbouring <b>land</b> on the <b>ski</b> run to ensure the ski run views are preserved.|$|R

5000|$|During the Pit Stop, {{teams were}} moved to Pecenongan Street in Jakarta to begin this leg of the Race. The Detour was a choice between Basket Bikes and Bandung Biathlon. In Basket Bikes, teams must ride {{downhill}} along a 5 km bicycle trail and deliver 2 dozen sell-able eggs in their baskets to the egg merchant. Only if all their eggs were in perfect condition would they get their next clue. However {{if any of the}} eggs broke along the way, teams would have to start the entire task over again. In Bandung Biathlon, teams must hit a set of targets with traditional bamboo guns while trekking uphill in a pair of traditional tandem <b>land</b> <b>skis,</b> known as bakiak [...] When they hit all the targets, they would get their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Kitesurfing (1996) : Also {{known as}} kiteboarding.

50|$|Because {{the gear}} of snowboarders, skiers, and inline skaters is affixed to their feet, the 900 is not {{considered}} to be a difficult trick for professionals in those sports and is performed rather often. 1620 and 1800 degree spins have been <b>landed</b> on <b>skis,</b> a 1620 has been performed on a snowboard as well as on inline skates, 1080 on BMX, 1080 on scooter.|$|R
50|$|In December 1911 Grandjean {{was invited}} at Davos to fly above the resort; he pioneered in {{building}} ski to skid {{on the snow}} without sinking into it. On 2 February 1912, he carried out the first take off and <b>landing</b> on <b>ski</b> in Switzerland, followed by more than hundred flights within few days without any incident. He was probably the first glacier pilot in the world.|$|R

25|$|A P-38J {{was used}} in {{experiments}} with an unusual scheme for mid-air refueling, in which the fighter snagged a drop tank trailed on a cable from a bomber.

25|$|The {{airplanes}} had no radios or navigational instruments. Only a {{very few}} of the large cities had landing fields. In summer the planes were equipped with pontoons for landing on lakes and rivers. Lake Spenard was the Anchorage pontoon base.

50|$|The Mt. Okura Ski Jump Stadium {{is one of}} the venues of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, {{and also}} one of the few 90 metre class jumping hills {{throughout}} the world. The maximum inclination of the Approach Slope, the area from the starting point to the take-off ramp with 101 metres, is 35 degrees, and the Landing Slope, the area drew lines of P-spot and K-spot, is 37 degrees. The P-spot was displayed by the blue line on the slope, which indicates the standard points for <b>landing</b> of <b>ski</b> jumping, while the K-spot is partitioned by the red line, and is designated as the area which gives ski jumpers additional points in the case of successful landing.|$|R

50|$|The bridge's {{importance}} as {{the gateway to}} Aspen increased further when Aspen-Pitkin County Airport was built in 1953 just outside the city. Over the 1950s the population of Pitkin County grew 44%, due to migration to the upper Roaring Fork Valley, the second highest growth rate on Colorado's Western Slope. Ten years after the airport was opened, in 1963, the bridge was expanded to its current width to handle the traffic increase. Ranchers began selling their <b>lands</b> for <b>skiing</b> and housing development, some of which became the town of Snowmass, where the workers in Aspen's hotels, restaurants and shops settled, eventually incorporating in the mid-1970s. Aspen became a destination {{for more than just}} skiing, and its population continued to grow.|$|R
