The B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation pathway that eventually generate IgE-secreting plasma cells {{go through the}} intermediate steps of IgE-expressing B lymphoblasts and involves the interaction with IgE-expressing memory B cells. Tanox, a biotech company based in Houston, Texas, proposed in 1987 that by targeting membrane-bound IgE (mIgE) on B <b>lymphoblast</b> and memory B cells, those cells can be lysed or down-regulated, thus achieving the inhibition of the production of antigen-specific IgE and hence a shift of immune balance toward non-IgE mechanisms. Two approaches targeting the IgE pathway were evolved and both are in active development. In the first approach, the anti-IgE antibody drug omalizumab (trade name Xolair) recognises IgE not bound to its receptors and is used to neutralise or mop-up existing IgE and prevent it from binding to the receptors on mast cells and basophils. Xolair has been approved in many countries for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma. It has also been approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U.

Uptake was greater with <b>lymphoblasts</b> from donors in the late prodromal phase of adjuvant-induced arthritis (arthritic donors) than from normal donors. With arthritic donors, recruitment of <b>lymphoblasts</b> from TD lymph was greater than from mesenteric duct lymph, suggesting {{that most of the}} joint-seeking <b>lymphoblasts</b> in arthritic rats arose in peripheral lymphoid tissues. <b>Lymphoblasts</b> from arthritic donors were also detected in the synovium of paws from normal rats.

The efficiency with which the labelled cells were extracted from the blood and retained by the intestine was quantified by examination of the accumulations observed over the first 4 hr after cell transfer. The kinetic parameters for the uptake and retention of <b>lymphoblasts</b> determined from these early times were found to provide a good approximation to the entire time course of accumulation observed from 1 hr to 22 hr after cell transfer. For normal mice, approximately 1 % of <b>lymphoblasts</b> delivered by the blood stream {{at any given time}} gained entry to the small intestine and were retained with an average half-time of 6. 5 hr. We also studied the accumulation of <b>lymphoblasts</b> in the small intestine of mice undergoing a self-limited enteric infection with the nematode, Trichinella spiralis. There was a greater accumulation of <b>lymphoblasts</b> in the small intestine of these animals. This was the consequence of a prolongation of the half-time for retention of <b>lymphoblasts</b> within the intestine to 15 hr, rather than increased uptake of <b>lymphoblasts</b> from the blood. During a secondary infection with T. spiralis, the half-time for retention of <b>lymphoblasts</b> in the intestine was decreased to 3 hr.

In this in vitro study, we investigated whether different heparin concentrations can affect the cell cycle of <b>lymphoblasts</b> in newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Materials and Methods: <b>Lymphoblasts</b> were incubated in different heparin concentrations (0, 10, 20 U/ml), and the percentages of <b>lymphoblasts</b> in each phase of the cell cycle were simultaneously measured by flow cytometry at 0, 1, and 2 hours (h). Results: The percentages of <b>lymphoblasts</b> at the G 2 /M and S phases were significantly increased in 20 U/ml heparin concentration at 1 h compared to 0 U/ml (without heparin) concentration. We demonstrated that heparin increases the percentages of <b>lymphoblasts</b> in the S and G 2 /M phases in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Conclusion: It was shown that heparin expands the proliferation of <b>lymphoblasts</b> by increasing the transition to G 2 /M and S phases and the S-phase fraction ratio.

40|$|The glycolytic enzyme {{hexokinase}} is {{studied in}} cultured leukemic <b>lymphoblasts,</b> in normal lymphocytes and in <b>lymphoblasts</b> obtained by stimulation of normal lymphocytes with phytohaemagglutinin.

Besides hexokinase I, which is detected in all the lymphoid cells, they are characterized by the presence of hexokinase II. The concentration of type II increases during cell growth. Another difference between leukemic <b>lymphoblasts</b> and mature and stimulated lymphocytes is found in the regulatory properties of hexokinase I. Hexokinase I from both normal and stimulated lymphocytes is inhibited by glucose- 1, 6 -diphosphate. This inhibition is decreased in part by addition of inorganic phosphate. Hexokinase I from leukemic lymphocytes, however, is inhibited to a lesser extent by glucose- 1, 6 -diphosphate. Inorganic phosphate has no effect at all on this inhibition. In accordance with these findings a different pattern in the hexokinase I region was detected in electrophoresis with several cell types.

However, under identical conditions, an equimolar concentration of 9 -O-AcGD 3 failed to induce similar effects. Interestingly, 9 -O-AcGD 3 protected the <b>lymphoblasts</b> from GD 3 -induced apoptosis when administered in equimolar concentrations simultaneously. In situ de-Oacetylation of 9 -O-AcGD 3 with sodium salicylate restores the GD 3 -responsiveness to apoptotic signals. Although both GD 3 and 9 -O-acetyl GD 3 localize to mitochondria, these two structurally related molecules may play different roles in ALL-disease biology.

Deregulation of intracellular signaling pathways linked to activation of insulin and IGF- 1 receptors (IR,IGF- 1 R), Akt, and ERK was largely restored by IGF- 1 and, at a less extent, by insulin in HD human <b>lymphoblasts.</b> Importantly, both neurotrophic factors stimulated huntingtin phosphorylation at Ser 421 in HD cells. IGF- 1 and insulin also rescued energy levels in HD peripheral cells, as evaluated by increased ATP and phosphocreatine, and decreased lactate levels. Moreover, IGF- 1 effectively ameliorated O 2 consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in HD <b>lymphoblasts,</b> which occurred concomitantly with increased levels of cytochrome c.

Cells from these tumor lines are regularly rejected when transplanted into normal syngeneic C 3 H mice but grow progressively in animals immunosuppressed by irradiation with ultraviolet light or by x-irradiation and thymectomy. Immunization of normal mice with 1591 -specific <b>lymphoblasts</b> that had been generated in mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures caused a loss of resistance to 1591 tumor cells, but the animals remained resistant to 1316 tumor cells. In vitro, spleen cells from animals immunized with 1591 -specific <b>lymphoblasts</b> did not generate cytolytic T cells to 1591 fibrosarcoma cells, but spleen cells from the same animals responded normally to 1316 fibrosarcoma cells. Furthermore, spleen cells from animals immunized with 1591 -specific <b>lymphoblasts</b> contained idiotype-specific T cells that lysed 1591 -specific <b>lymphoblasts,</b> whereas 1316 -specific <b>lymphoblasts</b> were unaffected. Immunization of normal animals with nonresponding lymphocytes from the same mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures as the 1591 -specific <b>lymphoblasts</b> showed normal responses to both tumors in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that changes {{in the balance of}} tumor-specific and anti-idiotypic T lymphocyte clones can influence the capability of an individual to respond effectively to tumor antigens and can determine whether a tumor grows or regresses...|$|R
40|$|Adenosine deaminase (ADA) {{activity}} has been {{measured in the}} <b>lymphoblasts</b> of 23 untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and related to {{the presence or absence}} of immunologic cell surface markers. The mean ADA activity in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia population as a whole was increased fourfold over that in normal lymphocytes. 9 of the 23 patients were classified as thymus-derived (T-) cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia on the basis of erythrocyte rosette positivity; the remaining 14 patients had null-cell leukemia. The mean ADA activity (ADA U/mg protein) of T-cell <b>lymphoblasts</b> (102 U) was 3 times higher than the mean of null <b>lymphoblasts</b> (30 U). This difference is statistically significant (P less than 0. 02). Measurement of ADA activity offers a biochemical method of distinguishing between immunological subtypes of <b>lymphoblasts</b> which may be of prognostic and therapeutic value...|$|R
40|$|Hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes, or a DNA index> 1. 16) confers a {{favorable}} prognosis in B-lineage acute lymphoblas-tic leukemia of childhood. Children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose <b>lymphoblasts</b> at diagnosis accumulate {{high levels of}} methotrexate (MTX) and MTX polyglutamates (MTXPGs) in vitro experience a better event-free survival than those whose <b>lymphoblasts</b> do not (Blood 76 : 44, 1990). <b>Lymphoblasts</b> from 13 children with hyperdip-loidy (> 50 chromosomes) accumulated high levels of MTX-PGs (1, 095 and 571 t o 2, 346 pmol/lO 9 cells [median and 25 % to 75 % intraquartile range]). These levels were higher than those in B-lineage <b>lymphoblasts</b> from 19 children with other aneuploidy (326 and 159 t o 775 pmol/lOg cells) and 15 children with diploidy (393 and 204 to 571 pmol/ 109 cells) (P =. 0015).
