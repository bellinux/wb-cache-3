40|$|Severe {{disturbances}} cause {{a number}} of problems in the operation of power plants. The plant subsystem that often suffers the most is the boiler. Alleviating the severity of the problem requires improving the boiler's capability in dealing with disturbances. One of the more severe upsets is partial or full <b>load</b> <b>rejections.</b> Withstanding <b>load</b> <b>rejections</b> depends almost exclusively on the boiler control. This paper presents a fuzzy supervisory scheme to improve the performance of the boiler response during such disturbances. This scheme consists of a robust local controller designed using the Linear Quadratic Gaussian with Loop Transfer Recovery (LQG/LTR). The set-points to the controller are modified whenever necessary by a supervisor partially based on fuzzy logic...|$|R

At the supervisory level, a fuzzy reference governor generates the water level set-point deviations during <b>load</b> <b>rejections</b> according to a fuzzy rule-based policy. At the control level, a robust control system via LQG/LTR is implemented.

50|$|The dam is a steel-reinforced {{concrete}} gravity structure. It is 40 feet (12 m) high and 490 feet (150 m) long. It contains eight spillway bays. When the spillway gates are open, water is discharged down the normally dry Chelan River channel. Water {{to power the}} turbine generators is delivered through an underground penstock connecting the dam and the powerhouse. It delivers water from the dam at the southeasterly end of Lake Chelan to the powerhouse at Chelan Falls, a vertical drop of nearly 400 feet (120 m). This steel and concrete tunnel is approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) in length. The only visible portion of the tunnel is a 130-foot (40 m) high surge tank constructed on the hill above the plant to absorb hydraulic momentum {{of the water in}} case of <b>load</b> <b>rejection.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} fault described above also affected unit 2 by causing breakers in the 230kv switchyard to trip cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus B on unit 2. EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored {{power to the}} vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on unit 2's main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated and opened the transformer's output breaker causing a full <b>load</b> <b>rejection</b> to unit 2 {{which led to a}} turbine trip and reactor scram. After the unit tripped, the B non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (which is powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip, though the plant cool down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital B electrical trains allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the unit would have remained online.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Piping systems {{commonly}} {{experience the}} transient-state situation {{as the result}} of changes to ow conditions during pump failures, valve closures or turbine <b>load</b> <b>rejection.</b> This paper addresses transients {{as a consequence of the}} <b>load</b> <b>rejection</b> of a Francis hydropower plant (Karun 4, Ahwaz, Iran). To control the turbine system and related equipment during <b>load</b> <b>rejection,</b> the valve closing law of wicket gates is of paramount importance. The pressure rise at the end of the pressure shaft, the pressure drop in the draft tube and the speed rise while the electromagnetic braking torque disappears are solely dependent on the closing curve. Thus, an optimum closing law can eliminate the probable risk of damage to the units. This paper develops a computational model to calculate water-hammer system components, such as pressure rise, speed rise, discharge variations and pressure uctuations. Results obtained from the present model are compared and validated with those obtained by a consultant at the Karun project. The eects of dierent valve-closing laws on the maximum head rise at the end of the pressure shaft and other components are also investigated...|$|E

40|$|A double-controller {{structure}} is proposed {{for control of}} processes with dominant time delay. In contrast to the Smith predictor, the proposed control scheme contains two controllers, a setpoint controller and a load controller, and a process model.

The load controller is tuned to be insensitive to the model structure and parameters, to accommodate large model uncertainty, for which the standard Smith predictor may give poor regulatory performance and even fail to work.

40|$|Injection {{velocity}} {{has been}} recognized as a key variable in thermoplastic injection molding. Its closed-loop control is, however, difficult due {{to the complexity of}} the process dynamic characteristics.

It is difficult for a conventional control scheme to meet all of these requirements. Injection velocity dynamics are first analyzed in this paper. Then, a novel double-controller scheme is adopted for the injection velocity control.

These two controllers can be designed independently to achieve good system performance for both set-point tracking and <b>load</b> <b>rejection.</b> Also, good robustness of the double-controller scheme to variations in system dynamics can be obtained by properly designing the load controller.
