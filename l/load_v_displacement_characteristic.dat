40|$|With the {{cooperation}} of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an investigative and design study was performed to examine the history of the W 80 - 0 Area Aft Mount, understand its performance, and explore potential new designs. Simultaneously, professional and technical enhancement of the author was achieved. The historical organization of LANL influences the design space for this project, and understanding those relationships provides insight into concept generation and selection. In addition, the current organizational structure within the laboratory as well as with its customers provides additional constraints that must be managed technically. The new design concepts attempt to simulate the nonlinear <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the previously employed B 3223 cellular silicone Pad Mount. New concepts separate the spring and damping characteristics of the cellular silicone into separate component parts. This uncoupled method should allow the new designs increased variability and control with respect to matching original Aft Area Mount performance in shock mitigation and deflection limiting. by Daniel K.

In the present investigation, FE modelling {{has been carried out}} to study the influence of friction on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy widely used for aerospace applications. The emphasis is placed on providing a comprehensive evaluation of the influence of friction coefficient on <b>load</b> <b>Vs</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>characteristics,</b> calculated hardness and young's modulus in conical and spherical indentations. The development of pile-up/sink-in during indentation process and its dependence on contact friction was also analyzed. Results indicates that, during indentation process, the amount of pile-up cannot be related solely to the strain-hardening exponent, rather, the contact friction also affects the pile-up geometry, Therefore, the material parameters which are related to projected area will lead to large error due to friction contradicting with the statement of researchers i the published literature i. e, the instrumented indentation experiments are not significantly affected by friction. The error in hardness and Young's modulus were found to be as high as 14. 59 % and 6. 78 % respectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cohesive zone model based {{finite element analysis}} of delamination resistance of z-pin reinforced double cantilever beam (DCB). The main difference between this and existing cohesive zone models is that each z- pin bridging force is governed by a traction-separation law derived from a meso- mechanical model of the pin pullout process, which is independent of the fracture toughness of unreinforced laminate. Therefore, two different traction- separation laws are used: one representing the toughness of unreinforced laminate and the other the enhanced delamination toughness owing to the pin bridging action. This approach can account for the large scale bridging effect and avoid using concentrated pin forces, thus removing the mesh dependency and permitting more accurate analysis solution. Computations were performed using a simplified unit strip model. Predicted delamination growth and <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> relation are in excellent agreement with the prediction by a complete model, and both models are in good agreement with test measured <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> relation.

The decks may also be used for other purposes than bridge decks. Load-carrying capacities of these decks are very high and friction alone carries load between individual members. Friction is achieved by using prestressed steel rods through the decks that give normal compressive forces between members, see Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Left: bridge deck in laboratory test situation. Right: FE modelThe <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> curve for a transversally loaded deck is normally nonlinear even for low load values but especially for high loads due to partial slip between members. FE simulations and laboratory tests for behaviour have been made earlier, see [1], [2], [3]. Two different approaches for FE-simulations have been used, one with an elastic-plastic material model without discrete member modeling and another with discrete member modeling and contact surfaces between members. In the presentation a summary of earlier results are shown and also some recent results due to additional features in the FE models. The additions are possibilities too simulate gaps between members for the elastic-plastic model and results from butt-end modeling with the contact model.

40|$|Energy {{absorption}} mechanisms {{have been}} investigated intensively for the past decades by various authors and institutions, and numerous articles and other literature sources are available in print, {{as well as on}} the Internet. Energy absorbers and crashworthiness structures are two main research components in the energy absorption field under investigation today. In this research geometric changes are introduced on Al 6063 -T 6 circular tubes in the form of horizontal and spiral grooves to asses their influence on energy absorption characteristics. The horizontal and spiral grooves were cut into the tube to a cut depth of half the wall thickness of the tubes. The pitch was varied for both the horizontal and spiral grooves, while the cut width was kept constant. A specially designed static impact sleeve was used to compress the test specimens axially in an Instron 250 kN universal hydraulic testing system. <b>Load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> graphs were generated from the captured experimental data for the uncut, horizontal and spiral grooved tubes. Energy <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> graphs were created from the experimental data. The final deformed tubes were visually examined to determine the effect the geometric change had on the circular tube form, as well as the deformation pattern of the crushed tube. A Finite Element Method model is presented for each of the experimentally investigated tube impact models. A two dimensional (2 D) model for the uncut as well as horizontally grooved tube is generated and analysed using a quasi static loading approach. Non-linear material properties are assigned to the model, and the Riks algorithm is used to model the non-linear post buckling behaviour of the various tubes. The results from the FEM analysis are used to generate <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> and energy <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> graphs that are compared with the experimental data. Three dimensional (3 D) FEM models of the normal, spiral and horizontal cut tubes were also generated in a CAD environment. A dynamic explicit non-linear analysis was done for each of the models to determine the reaction force and energy output values of each of the models. All analyses extend into the plastic material domain. Reaction force <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> and energy <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> graphs are generated from these analyses. A comparison is made between the numerically and experimentally determined gradients of the energy <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> graphs of each of the tubes investigated. This forms the basis for an energy absorber design with application in the transport industry. Unique geometric imperfections were investigated experimentally and numerically for aluminium tubes. A lower buckling load than that for the normal tubes was achieved with the introduction of these geometric imperfections. New deformation patterns on tubes with imperfections not previously observed were described and analysed extensively. The <b>load</b> <b>vs</b> <b>displacement</b> graphs showed a constant increase in the load for the spiral grooved tubes.

The small punch tests are conducted on diminutive specimen of circular shaped. Four different steels are chosen for this purpose. The load on diminutive samples is quasi-statically applied using different tip diameters hemispherical headed indenter. The experimental outputs of small punch (SP) test on diminutive specimen are obtained in the form breakaway <b>loads,</b> <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> curve/data and reduced thickness of tested diminutive samples is measured at failure. The resulted SP experimental data are analyzed used to establish the empirical relations to predict the mechanical behaviour of materials. For this purpose, the empirical correlations are proposed for the estimation of the yield stress ductility (fracture strain) and fracture toughness and are used to predict the behaviour of four different materials under study. The standard tensile and fracture toughness tests are also carried out for comparison. The small punch test on diminutive specimen is demonstrating the strong potential for the determination of mechanical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{specimen}} geometry on the ductile fracture behaviour is investigated by continuum damage mechanics techniques. A model introduced by Gurson and modified by Needleman and Tavergaard has been implemented in the Finite Element program package ADINA. The damege parameters of the model are measured and calculated from smooth tension test and the characteristic material distance is estimated from compact tension experiments. For a steel ASTM A 710 at room temperature {{a complete set of}} parameters is determined and used to precdict the experimental <b>load</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>displacement</b> curves of notched round bars and of a sidegrooved compact specimen as well as the J - resistance curve. A satisfactory agreement of prediction and and experiment is observed. In order to investigate the influence of the stress state (constraint) in cracked specimens a series a of numerical computations of different specimen geometries and loading situations is performed utilizing again the same set of parameter s. The slopes of the predicted J resistance curves increase with increasing ratio of tensin <b>vs.</b> bending <b>load</b> and with decreasing relative crack length...|$|R
