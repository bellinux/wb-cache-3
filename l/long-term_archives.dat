During all these phases, engineers use their tacit knowledge {{to fulfill their}} tasks. If engineers retire or leave a company, their embodied knowledge also resigns. To circumvent such loss of important company’s intellectual property, the engineer’s knowledge is captured as linked data and then used as annotation for product lifecycle data models. To enable the reuse of data {{not only in the}} near-term, the product data and its annotated metadata are ingested into special <b>long-term</b> <b>archives.</b> However, achieving full preservation of semantically enriched product data requires the consideration of the linked data lifecycle which includes the evolution of schemas and instances.

40|$|AbstractPattern {{languages}} {{have begun}} to appear and mature as a presentation of the structures and processes that support the building of complex software systems. A pattern language describes how to compose structures in a particular domain such as telecommunications, client–server architecture, or object-oriented programming, to achieve system-level architectures that are {{greater than the sum}} of their parts. A problem lurks on the horizon: How do you compose patterns from multiple domains—from multiple pattern languages—in a single system? For example, today there is nothing other than an ad hoc approach to combining the pattern languages for telecommunications and for object-oriented design to build object-oriented telecommunications systems from the respective pattern languages. To understand the solution to this dilemma, it pays to examine sequences: an important aspect of pattern application that is often overlooked. Sequences are the loci of concern about interleaving patterns, whether from a single pattern language or multiple pattern languages. Sequences are critical because pattern languages represent <b>long-term</b> <b>archives</b> of the rhythms of critical, recurring sequences...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, major {{progress}} has been made in the development of methods for establishing catchment sediment budgets. Reservoir bottom sediments are important because they provide valuable medium- to <b>long-term</b> <b>archives</b> of catchment sediment yield. Dating techniques, such as 137 Cs and 210 Pb further provide the opportunity to subdivide this stratigraphic record into shorter time periods. Recently, sediment-fingerprinting approaches have been applied to dated sediment cores to gain insight into changing patterns of sediment supply. In this study, a land-use-based sediment fingerprinting study was undertaken in the 4. 9 km 2 Crombie Reservoir catchment in northeast Scotland to infer historical changes in sediment supply over the past 135 years. The unmixing model employed, features a novel enrichment-inclusive subroutine. Fingerprinting results show a rise in agricultural sediment production from effectively zero in 1890 to > 80 % in 1980, with patterns broadly correlating to known land-use changes with a climatic overprint...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Commitment schemes {{are among}} cryptography’s most im-portant {{building}} blocks. Besides their basic properties, hidingness and bindingness, for many applications {{it is important}} that the schemes ap-plied support proofs of knowledge. However, all existing solutions which have been proven to provide these protocols are only computationally hiding or are not resistant against quantum adversaries. This is not suitable for long-lived systems, such as <b>long-term</b> <b>archives,</b> where com-mitments have to provide security also in the long run. Thus, in this work we present a new post-quantum unconditionally hiding commit-ment scheme that supports (statistical) zero-knowledge protocols and allows to refreshes the binding property over time. The bindingness of our construction relies on the approximate shortest vector problem, a lattice problem which is conjectured to be hard for polynomial approxi-mation factors, even for a quantum adversary. Furthermore, we provide a protocol that allows the committer to prolong the bindingness prop-erty of a given commitment while showing in zero-knowledge fashion that the value committed to did not change. In addition, our construc-tion yields two more interesting features: one is the ability to “convert” a Pedersen commitment into a lattice-based one, and the other one is the construction of a hybrid approach whose bindingness relies on the discrete logarithm and approximate shortest vector problems...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater mussels of {{the genus}} Diplodon (Unionida) are common {{inhabitants}} of lakes and rivers in South America, and have slow growth and long life spans. We established the annual periodicity of incremental shell growth in Diplodon chilensis patagonicus (d'Orbigny, 1835) and calculated growth rates at different ages, using internal ring counting supported by dyeing methods and δ¹⁸O isotope analyses, in two Patagonian populations (Lago Steffen and its effluent Río Manso Inferior, Argentina). Longevities of ca. 90 years (Lago Steffen) significantly extend the life spans reported in the past. Growth rates for old individuals (> 30 years) from both lake and river populations average 0. 16 mm per year along the axis of minimal growth. We evaluated the seasonal periodicity of minor and trace elements (Mn, Mg, Sr, Ba, Na, S) in situ by Laser Ablation ICP-MS and Electron Probe Microanalyser analyses. Line-scans in a valve from Lago Steffen show that Mn, Sr and Ba are preferentially accumulated during the summer, while higher concentrations of Mg {{are found in the}} winter bands.

40|$|Chinese loess is {{regarded}} as one of the most detailed and <b>long-term</b> <b>archives</b> of climate on land. However, there is still significant controversy over the deposit's origin, limiting interpretation of the sedimentological and paleoclimatic mechanisms responsible for its emplacement. Here this is addressed through morphology and the first laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from loess (last glacial age; northern Loess Plateau). These are compared to zircon U-Pb age spectra from desert and sandy lands surrounding the Loess Plateau. Surface samples were taken from the Tengger and Mu Us deserts, as well as the Horqin and Otindag sandy lands. The results demonstrate that zircon U-Pb ages can discriminate between potential source areas and highlight both similarities and differences in age spectra for the desert and sandy land samples. Most significantly, the loess age spectrum shows no single affinity to any of these regions and exhibits zircon ages associated with granitoid rocks representing tectonic events in both west and east northern China. Furthermore, and in contrast to proximal deserts, a significant proportion of zircons from the loess show affinities with rocks cropping out in the Qilian Mountains. The euhedral form of many of these grains further suggests direct transport from these crystalline source rocks, in contrast to previously hypothesized production or storage in deserts. Thus, dust-transporting storms tracked from the west during the last glacial maximum, although this does not explain all the zircon variability and implies multiple sources and storm-track variation over the depositional period...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} a Posidonia australis {{sedimentary}} archive has provided a record of changes in element concentrations (Al, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd, Co, As, Cu, Ni and S) over the last 3000 years in the Australian marine environment. Human-derived contamination in Oyster Harbor (SW Australia) started ~. 100 years ago (AD ~. 1900) and exponentially increased until present. This appears {{to be related to}} European colonization of Australia and the subsequent impact of human activities, namely mining, coal and metal production, and extensive agriculture. Two contamination periods of different magnitude have been identified: Expansion period (EXP, AD ~. 1900 - 1970) and Establishment period (EST, AD ~. 1970 to present). Enrichments of chemical elements with respect to baseline concentrations (in samples older than ~. 115 cal. years BP) were found for all elements studied in both periods, except for Ni, As and S. The highest enrichment factors were obtained for the EST period (ranging from 1. 3 -fold increase in Cu to 7. 2 -fold in Zn concentrations) compared to the EXP period (1. 1 -fold increase for Cu and Cr to 2. 4 -fold increase for Pb). Zinc, Pb, Mn and Co concentrations during both periods were 2 - to 7 -fold higher than baseline levels. This study demonstrates the value of Posidonia mats as <b>long-term</b> <b>archives</b> of element concentrations and trends in coastal ecosystems.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of GeographyKendra K. McLauchlanThroughout the Holocene, North American {{grassland}} vegetation {{has shifted}} in composition and spatial extent. However, {{it has been}} difficult to characterize these changes because the drivers—particularly climate, fire, topography, or grazing from large herbivores—operate at different spatial and temporal scales. <b>Long-term</b> <b>archives</b> such as lacustrine sediment cores, and the proxy records they contain, can help illustrate vegetation changes on relevant timescales. Yet, accurate interpretations of grassland vegetation composition from pollen (a common proxy used to infer vegetation of the past) remain limited by the number of calibrations of pollen and the drivers of vegetation change in modern conditions. This research addresses those gaps by evaluating grassland vegetation at different spatial and temporal scales in the context of modern and historical drivers. First, I reconstruct vegetation composition and diversity, fire activity, and erosion activity at a sub-regional scale over the last 9, 300 years by analyzing pollen, charcoal, and magnetic data from a sediment core from a grassland lake in southern Minnesota. Second, I quantify the relationships between modern grassland pollen and fire, grazing, and topography at a fine spatial and temporal resolution, using pollen samples collected annually from traps at Konza Prairie Biological Station in the Flint Hills of Kansas. Finally, I synthesize modern pollen assemblages across the Great Plains to create a transfer function that quantitatively links precipitation and temperature with pollen. I apply this function to pollen data from the past to interpret the climate history of three sites across the Great Plains, including the aforementioned site in southern Minnesota. The results from this research suggest that grassland vegetation diversity remained relatively resilient to the climatic fluctuations of the Holocene, including the driest time at 5, 000 yr BP. In addition, this work facilitates more informed interpretations of fossil pollen by effectively calibrating modern grassland pollen assemblages with their abiotic and biotic drivers...|$|E
