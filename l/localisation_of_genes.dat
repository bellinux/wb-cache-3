Several heritable components affect a boneâ€™s ability to resist fracture, including size, structure and strength; therefore identification of the genes underlying several bone characteristics will help elucidate the pathogenesis of fracture risk. Dissection of the genetic determinants of osteoporosis has been more effective in animal models than in human populations due {{to the possibility of}} environmental control and minimization of genetic heterogeneity. The aim of this thesis was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting osteoporosis-related phenotypes in an F 2 intercross between diabetic GK and non-diabetic F 344 rats, differing in their mitochondrial (mt) DNA. For bone measurements, tibia were characterized using four different methods generating several skeletal determinants of fracture risk. Comprehensive analysis identified several chromosomal regions linked to bone size, structure and strength that were influenced by both sex- and reciprocal cross. A region on chromosome 1 was identified with linkage to several bone phenotypes and also fasting glucose, making this region as a strong candidate for the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> contributing to bone regulation and potentially type- 2 diabetes. The observed interaction between nuclear QTLs for bone phenotypes and reciprocal cross, demonstrates a new interesting aspect when interpreting the genetics of phenotypes related to bone strength. Furthermore, preliminary studies suggest that this rat model can be a useful tool to delineate the genetics of type- 2 diabetes and osteoporosis in conjunction with lifestyle factors such as high-fat diet...|$|E
40|$|Primary open-angle {{glaucoma}} (POAG) can be subdivided {{into two groups}} according to age of onset: (1) the more prevalent middle to late-age-onset chronic {{open-angle glaucoma}} (COAG) diagnosed after age 40, and (2) the less common form, juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG), which occurs between 3 {{years of age and}} early adulthood. Susceptibility to either COAG or JOAG {{has been found to be}} inherited. The discovery of several genetic markers spanning the region 1 q 21 -q 24 in genetic linkage with autosomal dominant juvenile open-angle glaucoma (adJOAG) represents a major breakthrough towards the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gene(s)</b> responsible for the disease. Linkage analysis is a powerful means of distinguishing disease loci in large families with dominant disease. However the size of the group of families may represent a crucial factor for the linkage analysis. Sardinia is an island with a relatively isolated ethnic group showing a relatively high frequency of ad JOAG and COAG (Fossarello et al, 1994) and it is genetically more homogeneous than most Western populations. Therefore it represents an ideal ethnic group to search for linkage. We identified 18 families affected by POAG in which the disease appears to be inherited as autosomic dominant trait. In all families but two, occurrence of both JOAG and COAG in the same kindred was observed. Identification of adPOAG locus was performed by linkage analysis using 9 microsatellite markers spanning the region 1 q 21 -q 24. No significant linkage was observed. Our findings provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity in autosomal dominant primary open angle glaucoma, even in a geographic area where a relatively homogeneous genetic background exists. ...|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{dyslexia}} is {{a specific}} reading disability affecting children and adults who otherwise possess normal intelligence, cognitive skills, and adequate schooling. Difficulties in spelling and reading may persist through adult life. Possible <b>localisations</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> for dyslexia have been reported on chromosomes 15 Â (DYX 1), 6 p 21. 3 - 23 (DYX 2), and 1 p over the last 15 Â years. Only the localisation to 6 p 21. 3 - 23 has been clearly confirmed and a genome search has not previously been carried out. We have investigated a large Norwegian family in which dyslexia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A genome wide search for linkage with an average 20 Â cM marker density was initiated in 36 Â of the 80 Â family members. The linkage analysis was performed under three different diagnostic models. Linkage analysis in the family identified a region in 2 p 15 -p 16 which cosegregated with dyslexia. Maximum lod scores of 3. 54,Â  2. 92,Â and 4. 32 Â for the three different diagnostic models were obtained. These results were confirmed by a non-parametric multipoint GENEHUNTER analysis in which the most likely placement <b>of</b> the <b>gene</b> was in a 4 Â cM interval between markers D 2 S 2352 and D 2 S 1337. <b>Localisation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>gene</b> for dyslexia to 2 p 15 - 16, together with the confirmed linkage to 6 p 21. 3 - 23, constitute strong evidence for genetic heterogeneity in dyslexia.

40|$|In eukaryotes {{the genome}} adopts a non-random spatial organisation, which is {{important}} for gene regulation. However, very {{little is known about}} the driving forces behind nuclear organisation. In the simple model eukaryote fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, it has been known for a long time that transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin localise to the nuclear membrane (NM); the centromeres attaches to spindle pole body (SPB), while the telomeres are positioned at the NM on the opposite side of the nucleus compared to the SPB. Studies presented in this thesis aimed at advancing our knowledge of nuclear organisation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that the heterochromatic mating-type region localises to the NM in the vicinity of the SPB. This positioning was completely dependent on Clr 4, a histone methyl transferase crucial for the formation of heterochromatin. Additional factors important for localisation were also identified: the chromo domain protein Swi 6, and the two boundary elements IR-L and IR-R surrounding this locus. We further identify two other chromo domain proteins; Chp 1 and Chp 2, as crucial factors for correct subnuclear localisation of this region. From these results we suggest that the boundary elements together with chromodomain proteins in balanced dosage and composition cooperate in organising the mating-type chromatin. Gene regulation can affect the subnuclear <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes.</b> Using nitrogen starvation in S. pombe as a model for gene induction we determined the subnuclear localisation of two gene clusters repressed by nitrogen: Chr 1 and Tel 1. When repressed these loci localise to the NM, and this positioning is dependent on the histone deacetylase Clr 3. During induction the gene clusters moved towards the nuclear interior in a transcription dependent manner. The knowledge gained from work presented in this thesis, regarding nuclear organisation in the S. pombe model system, can hopefully aid to a better understanding of human nuclear organisation...|$|E

General {{introduction}} [...] Molecular markers for comparative {{and quantitative}} studies in macropods [...] Genetic linkage map {{construction in the}} tammar wallaby (M. eugenii) [...] Intraspecific variation, sex-biased dispersal and phylogeography of the eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus) [...] General discussion. The analysis of DNA using molecular techniques is an important tool for studies of evolutionary relationships, population genetics and genome organisation. The use of molecular markers within marsupials is primarily limited by their availability and success of amplification. Within this study, 77 macropodid type II microsatellite loci and two type I genetic markers were characterised within M. eugenii to evaluate polymorphic levels and cross-species amplification artifacts. Results indicated that 65 microsatellite loci amplified a single locus in M. eugenii with 44 exhibiting high levels of variability. The success of crossspecies amplification of microsatellite loci was inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance between the macropod species. It is revealed {{that the majority of}} species within the Macropodidae are capable of using many of the available heterologous microsatellites. When comparing the degree of variability between source-species and M. eugenii, most were significantly higher within source species (P 3. 0) with at least one other marker. More than 70 % (828 cM) of the genome had been mapped when compared with chiasmata data. Nine linkage groups were identified, with all but one (LG 7; X-linked) allocated to the autosomes. Theses groups ranged in size from 15. 7 cM to 176. 5 cM, and have an average distance of 16. 2 cM between adjacent markers. Of the autosomal linkage groups, LG 2 and LG 3 were assigned to chromosome 1 and LG 4 localised to chromosome 3 based on physical <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes.</b> Significant sex-specific distortions towards reduced female recombination rates were revealed in 22 % of comparisons. Positive interference was observed within all the linkage groups analysed. When comparing the X-chromosome data to closely related species it is apparent that it is conserved both in synteny and gene order. [...] The investigation of population dynamics of eastern grey kangaroos has been limited to a few ecological studies. The present investigation provides analysis of mtDNA and microsatellite data to infer both historical and contemporary patterns of population structuring and dispersal. The average level of genetic variation across sample locations was exceedingly high (h = 0. 95, HE = 0. 82), {{and is one of the}} highest observed for marsupials. Contrary to ecological studies, both genic and genotypic analyses reveal weak genetic structure of populations where high levels of dispersal may be inferred up to 230 km. The movement of individuals was predominantly male-biased (average N,m = 22. 61, average N p = 2. 73). However, neither sex showed significant isolation by distance. On a continental scale, there was strong genetic differentiation and phylogeographic distinction between southern (TAS, VIC and NSW) and northern (QLD) Australian populations, indicating a current and / or historical restriction of geneflow. In addition, it is evident that northern populations are historically more recent, and were derived from a small number of southern eastern grey kangaroo founders. Phylogenetic comparisons between M. g. giganteus and M. g. tasmaniensis, indicated that the current taxonomic status of these subspecies should be revised as there was a lack of genetic differentiation between the populations sampled.

In addition, a combination of chromosome prometaphase banding and DNA marker studies has allowed the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>genes</b> for retinoblastoma and for Wilms' tumour and the clarification of both the autosomal recessive nature of the mutation and the possible somatic mutations by which the normal allele can be lost in retina and kidney cells.

Recombination events were observed with DXS 425 in Xq 25 and DXS 984 at the Xq 26 -Xq 27 boundary, which localises MRX 46 to a 20. 9 cM (12 Mb) interval.

The protein- and oil-rich seed of cultivated legumes provides around one-third of the protein in the average human diet, with soybeans (Glycine max (L.)

Despite their critical importance to human and animal nutrition, we lack an understanding of how early seed development in legumes is orchestrated at the transcriptional level. We developed a method to isolate ovules from the model legume, Medicago truncatula Gaertn, at specific stages of embryogenesis, on the basis of flower and pod morphology. Using these isolated ovules we profiled the expression of candidate homeobox, AP 2 domain and B 3 domain-containing transcription factors.

40|$|Congenital malformations {{frequently}} arise sporadically, {{making it}} difficult {{to determine whether or not}} they are genetic in aetiology, let alone which gene(s) may be involved. Nevertheless, rapid progress has been made over recent years in the <b>localisation</b> and identification <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> mutations in specific malformations. This review draws from Mendelian inheritance in man (Johns Hopkins University Press, 11 th ed, 1994) and the online version (OMIM) to catalogue 139 loci (including 65 specifically identified genes) implicated in congenital malformations. Some of the most interesting recent developments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{hereditary}} myopathy with {{lactic acidosis}} during physical exercise, low physical work capacity, and paroxysmal myoglobinuria (HML), called "Myopathy with deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase" (McKusick 255125) {{has been described}} in 19 members of nine families who lived in two geographically separate areas in northern Sweden. By using the unique Swedish historical archives, including Catechetical Meeting Records {{from a number of}} northern Swedish parishes, it has been possible to trace ancestors of the nine families including all known 19 cases back in time to some key couples, who lived up to 300 years ago (that is seven to ten generations). No common single couple or common links between families in the past was found in these registers as a support for a single or several mutations that had developed far back in time. The mode of inheritance in this family is most likely autosomal recessive. This material will be used for the chromosomal <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gene...</b>|$|R
40|$|ADAMTS, constituting a {{recently}} discovered family of secreted zinc-dependent metalloproteases, {{have been shown}} to have critical physiological roles through identification of a number of natural animal and human gene mutations. The identification <b>of</b> six ADAMTS <b>genes</b> in the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis provides new insight into how, when and in what order the vertebrate orthologues have evolved. The phylogenetic assignments, based on sequences conserved across all genes, are supported by conserved domain structures within defined sub-families. The phylogeny and the frequent <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> ADAMTS <b>genes</b> in paralogous regions of the genome are consistent with the vertebrate lineages having arisen by large scale or genome duplication. The high level of conservation in the protease active site of vertebrate orthologues within some sub-families suggests subfunctionalisation, whereas the greater divergence in others would favour the evolution of novel substrate specificities and these observations are borne-out where substrate-specificity is known. The expansion and sub-specialization of the ADAMTS family is a component of the increased complexity of extracellular matrix that is associated with the evolution of vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|It was {{not until}} the nineteenth century that the heavy repressive {{measures}} usually taken against intersexed individuals were somewhat alleviated and a genuinely scientific approach to intersexuality began to be promoted. A first step was the application of the concept of pseudo-hermaphroditism to cases in which the external and/or internal sexual organs did not correspond to the gonadal sex. Through experimental application of the bovine freemartin model, the role of male hormones in embryonic sexual differentiation was able to be elucidated. Consequently, modern endocrinology has contributed significantly to the understanding of various types of intersexuality such as, for instance, the female adreno-genital syndrome and peripheral tissue insensitivity to androgens. Finally, chromosomal and molecular genetics have enabled the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>genes</b> responsible for sexual differentiation and allowed an understanding of the different causes of intersexed cases belonging to the vast chapter of gonadal dysgnesis. Some associations of patients are currently questioning medical and surgical treatments which aim at the production of strict sexual differentiation in morphologically ambiguous individuals.

40|$|In situ PCR is a {{technique}} that allows specific nucleic acid sequences to be detected in individual cells and tissues. In situ PCR and IS-RT-PCR are elegant techniques that can increase both sensitivity and throughput, but they are, at best, only semiquantitative; therefore, it is desirable first to ascertain the expression pattern by conventional means to establish the suitable conditions for each probe. In plants, in situ RT-PCR is widely used in the expression <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>genes,</b> including MADS-box and other function-specific genes or housekeeping genes in floral buds and other organs. This method is especially useful in small organs or during early developmental stages when the separation of particular parts is impossible. In this paper, we compared three different labelling and immunodetection methods by using in situ RT-PCR in Rosa hybrida flower buds and leaves. As target genes, we used the abundant -actin and RhFUL gene, which is expressed only in the leaves and petals/sepals of flower buds. We used digoxygenin- 11 -dUTP, biotin- 11 -dUTP, and fluorescein- 12 -dUTP-labelled nucleotides and antidig-AP/ streptavidin- fluorescein-labelled antibodies. All of the used methods gave strong, specific signal {{and all of them}} may be used in localization <b>of</b> <b>gene</b> expression on tissue level in rose organs...|$|R
40|$|With the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gene</b> for the {{autosomal}} recessive forms of proximal spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) to the chromosomal region 5 q 13 and the later detection of homozygous deletions <b>of</b> the SMN <b>gene</b> located in this region, prenatal prediction of SMA has become feasible and is widely applied now. In our experience with 77 prenatal predictions of SMA, follow-up of the 39 liveborn children from these pregnancies never {{led to a}} false-negative result. Application of SMN deletion analysis has consequences for prenatal prediction of SMA. When the index patient has a homozygously deleted exon 7 <b>of</b> the SMN <b>gene,</b> prenatal prediction and interpretation of results are straightforward. In families in which no DNA from the index patient is available, prenatal detection of a homozygous SMN deletion may be considered almost proof of SMA in the fetus. Absence of a deletion, however, will not guarantee an unaffected child. A real problem exists if the index patient does not show a homozygous deletion of SMN exon 7. In such cases with non-homozygous SMN deletions, one cannot be certain of 5 q linkage and {{autosomal recessive}} inheritance until other SMN mutations are detected. This is an argument to abstain from prenatal diagnosis by linkage analysis in these familie...|$|R
40|$|We have {{produced}} a detailed physical and transcriptional map of a 400 kb region within the narrowest flanking markers known to contain the hereditary breast and ovarian susceptibility gene, BRCA 1. The approach described here has avoided the problems of chimaerism, instability and rearrangements commonly observed in yeast artificial chromosomes by converting the YAC clones into ordered chromosome 17 -specific cosmid contigs and joining these contigs by cosmid end-walking. A detailed long-range restriction map provided a framework for the cosmid contig assembly and further refines existing physical mapping data. We have used a combined approach towards the isolation <b>of</b> the <b>genes</b> housed within these cosmids. This {{has resulted in the}} isolation and precise <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> eight novel <b>genes,</b> including a novel G protein and an endogenous retrovirus related to the HERV-K family, and the previously described dual-specificity VHR phosphatase and MOX 1 homeobox genes...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Chromosome 7 is {{frequently}} associated with chromosome aberrations, rearrange-ments, and deletions. It also contains many important genes, gene families, and disease loci. This brief review attempts to summarise {{these and other}} interesting aspects of chromosome 7. With the rapid accumulation <b>of</b> cloned <b>genes</b> and polymorphic DNA fragments, this chromosome has become an excellent substrate for molecular genetic studies. Chromosome 7 has been a subject of interest in medical genetics because of its frequent association with chromosome aberrations, rearrangements, and deletions, and because <b>of</b> the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> several important <b>genes,</b> gene families, and disease loci on this chromosome. It accounts for approximately 5 % of the human genomel and it {{is estimated to be}} 136 centimorgans (cM) in length 2 and to contain 150 million basepairs of DNA. The short (p) and long (q) arm size ratio is approximately 1 to 1 - 5 (figure) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} nucleic acid probes {{designed}} to hybridise to mouse renin messenger RNA (mRNA) {{have been prepared}} and used to study the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> renin <b>gene</b> expression in mouse tissue sections. The aims {{of the study were}} to compare the performance of the different probes in analysis of known sites <b>of</b> renin <b>gene</b> expression end then to employ them in order to elucidate the features <b>of</b> renin <b>gene</b> expression in the mouse embryo at different stages of develop-ment. The probes consisted of three oligonucleotides, each 30 bases and a riboprobe of 630, 177, or a variable number of bases in length. Their hybridisation properties were examined by Northern blot analysis and by in situ hybridisation to renin mRNA preserved in frozen or paraffin sections of adult mouse kidneys and salivary glands. The relative sensitivities of radio-labelled and bisbin-labelled oligonucleotide and riboprobes have been compared, and the problems associated with particular types of probe identified. Using a mixture of the radio-labelled oligonucleotide probes, renin gene expression has been identified in the mouse embryo. In addition to the expected expression within the immature metanephros on day 16 of gestation, evidence is present for relatively high renin gene expression outside, but adjacent to, the metanephros on day 15 of the gestation period. This discovery raises important questions concerning the role(s) of the renin-angiotensin system during development, and about the development of the highly local-ised nature <b>of</b> renin <b>gene</b> expression in the adult animal...|$|R
