5000|$|On November 29, 1963 Dr. Biard, Gary Pittman, Edward L. Bonin, and Jack Kilby filed {{a patent}} titled [...] "Photosensitive Transistor Chopper Using <b>Light</b> <b>Emissive</b> Diode" [...] (U.S. Patent US3304431); the first optical isolator. Within the patent they {{described}} a phototransistor chopper consisting of an LED optically {{coupled with a}} dual emitter, photosensitive, silicon transistor. The arrangement provided a switching function in which the switch was completely electrically isolated from the LED that drove it. The transistor operated in response to light emitted from the LED when forward current bias was generated across the junction of the diode. When emitted light struck {{the surface of the}} transistor, it was absorbed in the regions of both the emitter-base and base-collector junctions causing the transistor to conduct. This photoconductive transistor could be rapidly turned on and off by intensity modulating the LED at a very high frequency using high frequency alternating voltage. Prior to their invention, complete electrical isolation of the switch element in a chopper from the driving source for opening and closing the switch element was not possible, even through use of isolation transformers. Using isolation transformers, which were bulky and expensive, in miniaturized circuits to separate the driving source and the switch element resulted in magnetic pick-up and spike feed-through due to the transformer winding capacitance. Optical isolators were ideal because they're very small and can be mounted to a circuit board. In addition, they offer protection against excessively high voltages, reduce noise levels, and make measurements more accurate. In March 1965, Texas Instruments announced the SNX1304 Optoelectronic Pulse Amplifier, which was conceived and developed by Dr. Biard and Jerry Merryman, the inventor of the first handheld digital calculator. The SNX1304 consisted of a GaAs p-n junction light emitter optically coupled to an integrated silicon photodetector feedback-amplifier circuit. The device is thought to be the first commercial optically coupled integrated circuit.|$|E

40|$|Herewith a {{popularity}} of bicycling, various safety problems of cyclists are researched. Studies are connected with infrastructure, riding culture, choice of cyclist's suit and riding equipment. Overall, 382 respondents (159 cyclists, 119 drivers, 104 pedestrians) {{were involved in}} the survey. The road participants' mutual communication problems in the traffic and opportunities of solving them were clarified. Most of cyclists wear comfortable daily or sporty clothing with reflective elements, and in their opinion, clothing with <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> elements must be like daily clothing. The drivers could better notice cyclists, if they wear brightly colored suit with <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> and reflective elements, but pedestrians – if cyclists use warning sound signals. The opinions of road participants about the placement of <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> and reflective elements in cyclist's clothing were clarified. The prototype of cycling belt (Fig.   1 e) has been drawn up with LED stop signals, which are activated by the accelerometer placed in the central back pocket. The results of approbation have shown that the sensor does not provide the proper functioning of signals, due to a high level of riding movements. Using Motion Capture technology and bicycle exercise equipment, the research of oscillation of anthropometric points on the back has been carried out.

50|$|A {{recently}} exploited {{technique to}} accelerate traditional volume rendering algorithms such as ray-casting {{is the use}} of modern graphics cards. Starting with the programmable pixel shaders, people recognized the power of parallel operations on multiple pixels and began to perform general-purpose computing on (the) graphics processing units (GPGPU). The pixel shaders are able to read and write randomly from video memory and perform some basic mathematical and logical calculations. These SIMD processors were used to perform general calculations such as rendering polygons and signal processing. In recent GPU generations, the pixel shaders now are able to function as MIMD processors (now able to independently branch) utilizing up to 1 GB of texture memory with floating point formats. With such power, virtually any algorithm with steps that can be performed in parallel, such as volume ray casting or tomographic reconstruction, can be performed with tremendous acceleration. The programmable pixel shaders can be used to simulate variations in the characteristics of <b>lighting,</b> shadow, reflection, <b>emissive</b> color and so forth. Such simulations can be written using high level shading languages.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{researchers}} have made great efforts to obtain Si QDs with different <b>emissive</b> <b>light.</b> In general, their emission peak can be tuned {{by changing the}} particles size or their capping ligands [9 – 14]. The tunable emission wavelength of Si QDs in the visible range suggests that these materials are promising candidates for bio-applications. As reported, Si QDs with oxide surface passivation typically exhibit dipole-forbidden yellow-red emission [15, 16]. However, they have a long radiative lifetime (10 − 6 – 10 − 3  s), which heavily limits their application in biological imaging. Fortunately, once passivated by a hydrogen or carbon atoms, the Si QDs will show blue emission and have electric-dipole-allowed direct band gap transitions which lead to a shorter radiative lifetime (10 − 9 – 10 − 8  s) [15, 17] and are suitable for biological imaging. To date, many blue PL Si QDs were designed and synthesized by different methods [12, 18, 19]. However, only few of them were water-soluble [20], which still cannot nearly satisfy the growing need for biological study. Therefore, the requirement of blue PL stable and water-soluble Si QDs remains.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we are {{presenting}} a design method and its results for a space optical system with high resolution and wide field of view. This optical {{system can be}} used both in infrared and visible configurations. The designing of this system {{is based on an}} on-axis three-mirror anastigmatic (TMA) system. Here the on-axis concept allows wide field of view (FOV) enabling a diversity of designs available for the Multi-Object Spectrometer instruments optimized for low scattered and low <b>emissive</b> <b>light.</b> The available FOVs are upto 1 º in both spectrum ranges, whereas the available aperture range is F/ 15 - F/ 10. The final optical system is a three-mirror telescope with two on-axis and one off-axis segment and its resolution is 0. 3 m or even lower. The distinguished feature of this design is that it maintains diffraction-limited image at wide wavelengths. The technological developments in the field of computer generated shaping of large-sized optical surface details with diffraction-limited imagery have opened new avenues towards the designing techniques.

40|$|Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) -diamond {{films have}} been widely {{utilized}} {{not only as a}} hard protective coating for molds and dies but also as a functional substrate for bio-MEMS/NEMS. Micro-texturing into these hard coated molds and dies provides a productive tool to duplicate the original mother micro-patterns onto various work materials and to construct any tailored micro-textures for sensors and actuators. In the present paper, the high density oxygen plasma etching method is utilized to make micro-line and micro-groove patterns onto the DLC and diamond coatings. Our developing oxygen plasma etching system is introduced together with characterization on the plasma state during etching. In this quantitative plasma diagnosis, both the population of activated species and the electron and ion densities are identified through the <b>emissive</b> <b>light</b> spectroscopy and the Langmuir probe method. In addition, the on-line monitoring of the plasmas helps to describe the etching process. DLC coated WC (Co) specimen is first employed to describe the etching mechanism by the present method.

In this paper we further expand this method to model the Fresnel interactions at rough surfaces.

40|$|Ruthenium(ii) polyazaaromatic {{complexes}} {{have gained}} interest {{in recent decades}} as biomolecular tools, especially {{in the development of}} new phototherapeutic agents. These <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> Ru complexes based on π-deficient ligands were first designed to allow a photo-induced electron transfer (PET) with the guanine base in DNA since their 3 MLCT state is highly photo-oxidizing. Later the field of research was extended to proteins with the highlighting of a PET process with the tryptophan residue. This paper reports the kinetics of the luminescence quenching of [Ru(TAP) 2 phen] 2 + by several selected peptide sequences containing at least one tryptophan residue. By using a peptide library we highlight the important parameters influencing the kinetics of the photo-electron transfer process, such as the net electrostatic charge and the number of tryptophan residues. The best peptide candidates were selected to study the formation of photo-products by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry.

Bis-[(1, 2) (5, 6) ] indoloanthracene exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yield in solution {{as well as in the}} solid state. By using this novel semiconductor as active layer, an efficient OLED has been fabricated for which its emission pattern resembles at least two emitters in a single emissive region originated from the same molecule. One has its origin from the single molecule and is similar to the luminescence spectra in solution, whereas the other functions through the formation of aggregates being similar with the emission pattern found with crystals of bis-[(1, 2) (5, 6) ]indoloanthracene.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) are electronic devices made by sandwitching organic <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> materials between two electrodes. When voltage is applied across the two conductors, a bright light is generated. The color of the emitting light depends on the band gap of the semiconducting material. The work described here focuses on designing and synthesizing narrow band gap molecular systems derived from fused-arene derivatives for producing organic blue {{light emitting}} diodes. Three molecular systems derived from anthracene, pyrene, and carbazole, were designed and synthesized. Two molecular systems of anthracen- 9 -ylmethyl anthracene- 9 - carboxylate and pyren- 1 -ylmethyl 4 -bromobenzoate were synthesized through Steglich esterification reaction and the third, pyren- 1 -ylmethyl 4 -(9 -hexyl- 6 -{ 4 -[(pyren- 1 - ylmethoxy) carbonyl] phenyl}- 9 H-carbazol- 3 -yl) benzoate was synthesized by Grignard metathesis followed by Kumada coupling reaction. Structural characterizations were performed using 1 H, 13 C NMR and FTIR analysis. Photophysical properties of these systems were studied in chloroform (CHCl 3) solution using UV-visible and Fluorescence spectroscopies.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diode (OLED) is <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> device. The advantages of OLED are low power consumption, self electroluminescence and simple optical system. Furthermore, active matrix pixels and display drivers can be integrated together by standard CMOS technology for driving OLED. As a result, a novel microdisplay can be implemented by integrating OLED on a silicon backplane. Liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) microdisplay is well developed for head mount display (HMD) applications, there are limitations of high power consumption of backlight and complicated optical system. OLED microdisplay solves these problems by self electroluminescence and high efficiency. Moreover, the size can be as compact as LCoS and good for HMD application. The silicon backplane for OLED is developed. There are two topics on design. One is the pixel driving circuit, which has to ensure the current continuously flow through OLED. The major problem is process variation that affects the uniformity of luminance. The process independent pixel driving schemes are proposed. The other is that, the display drivers have to be integrated in the silicon backplane {{in order to simplify}} the I/O interface. The display drivers consist of column driver, row driver and digital-to-analog converter. All these circuits are efficiently integrated with the pixels. Finally, a OLED controller board is developed to convert conventional video for the silicon backplane. The controller board can support many video formats; including TV, PC graphic and DVI. Moreover, there are many other functions in the board to optimize the silicon backplane performance...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{photonic}} crystals {{offer the}} opportunity of light manipulation in all directions in space, {{but they are very}} difficult to fabricate. On the other hand, planar photonic crystals are much simpler to make, but they exhibit only a "quasi- 3 D" confinement, resulting from the combined action of 2 D photonic crystal and internal reflection. The imperfect confinement in the third dimension produces some unwanted out-of-plane loss, which is usually a limiting factor in performance of these structures. This thesis proposes how to fully take advantage of the relatively simple fabrication of planar photonic crystals, by addressing a problem of loss-reduction. One of the greatest challenges in photonics is a construction of optical microcavities with small mode volumes and large quality factors, for efficient localization of light. Beside standard applications of these structures (such as lasers or filters), they can potentially be used for cavity QED experiments, or as building blocks for quantum networks. This work also presents the design and fabrication of optical microcavities based on planar photonic crystals, with mode volumes of the order of one half of cubic wavelength of light (measured in material) and with Q factors predicted to be even larger than 10000. In addition to photonic crystals fabricated in semiconductors, we also address interesting properties of metallic photonic crystals and present our theoretical and experimental work on using them to improve the output of <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> devices. Feature sizes of structures presented here are below those achievable by photolithography. Therefore, a high resolution lithography is necessary for their fabrication. The presently used e-beam writing techniques suffer from limitations in speed and wafer throughput, and they represent a huge obstacle to commercialization of photonic crystals. Our preliminary work on electron beam projection lithography, the technique that could provide us with the speed of photolithography and the resolution of e-beam writing, is also discussed in this thesis. ...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{nanomaterials}} {{has become}} increasingly popular because of their unique physical, chemical, optical and catalytic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. Therefore, many efforts {{have been made to}} synthesize multidimensional nanostructures for new and efficient nanodevices. Among those materials, zinc oxide (ZnO), has gained substantial attention owing to many outstanding properties. ZnO besides its wide bandgap of 3. 34 eV exhibits a relatively large exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature which is attractive for optoelectronic applications. Likewise, cupric oxide (CuO), having a narrow band gap of 1. 2 eV and a variety of chemo-physical properties that are attractive in many fields. Moreover, composite nanostructures of these two oxides (CuO/ZnO) may pave the way for various new applications. This thesis can be divided into three parts concerning the synthesis, characterization and applications of ZnO, CuO and their composite nanostructures. In the first part the synthesis, characterization and the fabrication of ZnO nanorods based hybrid light emitting diodes (LEDs) are discussed. The low temperature chemical growth method was used to synthesize ZnO nanorods on different substrates, specifically on flexible non-crystalline substrates. Hybrid LEDs based on ZnO nanorods combined with p-type polymers were fabricated at low temperature to examine the advantage of both materials. A single and blended <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> polymers layer was studied for controlling the quality of the emitted white light. The second part deals with the synthesis of CuO nanostructures (NSs) which were then used to fabricate pH sensors and exploit these NSs as a catalyst for degradation of organic dyes. The fabricated pH sensor exhibited a linear response and good potential stability. Furthermore, the catalytic properties of petals and flowers like CuO NSs in the degradation of organic dyes were studied. The results showed that the catalytic reactivity of the CuO is strongly depending on its shape. In the third part, an attempt to combine the advantages of both ZnO and CuO NSs was performed by developing a two-step chemical growth method to synthesize the composite NSs. The synthesized CuO/ZnO composite NSs revealed an extended light absorption and enhanced defect related visible emission...|$|E
40|$|Low {{dimensional}} nanostructures of {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO), cupric oxide (CuO), and their composite nanostructures possess remarkable {{physical and chemical}} properties. Fundamental understanding and manipulation of these unique properties are crucial for all potential applications. Integration of nanostructured ZnO and CuO and their hybrid composites may {{play a significant role}} in the existing technology while paving the way for new exciting areas. Solution based low temperature synthesis of ZnO and CuO nanostructures have attracted extensive research efforts during the last decade. These efforts resulted in a plenteous number of nanostructures ranging from quantum dots into very complex three dimensional nanomaterials. Among the various low temperature synthesis methods the hydrothermal technique became one of the most popular approaches. The use of hydrothermal approach enabled the synthesis of diversity of nanomaterials on conventional and nonconventional substrates such as metals, glass, plastic and paper etc. The primary objectives of this thesis are to study and understand the characteristics of nanostructured ZnO, CuO, and their hybrid composites synthesized at low temperature. Likewise, the hybrid composites were successfully utilized to fabricate light emitting diodes and sensors. This thesis is organized into three major parts. In the beginning the synthesis and characterization of nanostructured ZnO, CuO, and their composite nanostructures are elaborated. Efforts have been made to understand the selective assembly of hierarchical CuO nanostructures on ZnO nanorods and to correlate it to the observed unique properties of the CuO/ZnO composite nanostructures. In the second part of the thesis fabrication, characterization, and device application of ZnO/p-polymer hybrid light emitting diode (HyLEDs) on flexible substrates are presented. In particular single and blended p-type <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> polymers were controllably developed for potential greener and cheaper white light emitters. It was found that the HyLEDs exhibited rectifying diode characteristics together with white light emission covering the entire visible range. In the third part, pH and relative humidity sensing applications of CuO nanoflowers, and CuO/ZnO nanocorals, respectively, are described. A pH sensor based on CuO nanoflowers demonstrated good sensitivity and reproducibility over a wide range of pH. By taking the advantages of the selective growth of CuO nanostructures on ZnO nanorods and their naturally formed p-n heterojunction the realization of high sensitivity humidity sensor was achieved. The humidity sensor fabricated from the CuO/ZnO nanocorals displayed the highest sensitivity factor reported so far for its constituent materials; along with reasonably fast dynamic responses. A brief outlook into future challenges and opportunities are also presented in the last part of the thesis.  Nanophotonic...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{printing}} optoelectronic devices {{has been developed}} {{over the last decade}} by various printing techniques such as screen printing, transfer printing, and inkjet printing, attributed to the advent of soluble organic semiconducting (OSC) materials. Printing of optoelectronic devices provides economical advantages for its fast and simple processing stages which is conceptually similar to the graphical printing. The advantage is expected to overcome the relatively low performance of organic materials where its charge transport is occurred by hopping process which is limited by its hopping distance and conformation of molecular chains. Printing techniques currently available should be optimized further to attract a huge impact. For example, the inkjet printing has a drawback of its low printing speed although it offers the printing of high definition pixels with its width around 60 μm. In this Thesis, gravure printing, a high throughput printing technique, is discussed to experimentally demonstrate its feasibility as a production method of optoelectronic devices. The targeted device structures are organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and field-effect transistors (OFETs). Both printed OFETs and OLEDs have reached device performance similar to reference devices with the same materials and structures fabricated by spin-coating. Unlike the graphic art printing, such as is used to fabricate newspapers, magazines and posters, the printing of OSC optoelectronic devices is very sensitive to processing conditions attributed to a thickness of very thin layers, usually less than 100 nm. Therefore, the surface uniformity of the printed layers must be very planar, with a surface roughness root mean square (RMS) value typically less than 3 nm. It is found that controlling hydrodynamic forces during the thin film formation, such as the coffee stain convection flow and the surface tension driven Marangoni flow, offer a clear opportunity for achieving devices with high performance in gravure contact printed thin films. Chapter 2 and 3 discuss background theory related to experiments in this thesis. Chapter 4 is an experimental chapter explaining materials used and experimental techniques. In Chapter 5, gravure printing of OLEDs with printed poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) hole injection and LUMATION Green 1300 (LG 1300) <b>light</b> <b>emissive</b> layers is developed with discussions of wetting {{of printing}} formulations and fluidic movements observed during film formation. A mixture of solvent method provides the circulation of hydrodynamic flows inside the printed formulation providing a deposition of highly uniform thin film after solvent evaporation. As a result, high performance of OLEDs with its performance of 8. 8 cd/A and 5. 4 lm/W with a maximum brightness of 66, 000 cd/m 2 is reported in OLEDs where both PEDOT: PSS and LG 1300 are gravure printed. The performance is the highest up to date among the OLEDs printed by the same printing method. Chapter 6 introduces an inverted structure type OLED where its high work function anode is placed {{on the top of the}} device so that it consequently improves device stability as high work function metals such as Au or Ag are less sensitive to ambient dopants. The use of carbonate or oxide layers on the top of a high work function metal at the bottom of the device induced efficient injection of electrons to the device. A very thin layer of caesium carbonate (Cs 2 CO 3) around 5 - 10 nm was gravure printed onto the ITO electrode. The printed Cs 2 CO 3 layer showed that the surface roughness is highly improved owing to molecular ordering is affected and improved by the mechanical forces such as pressure and thermal energy engaged during the printing. The inverted OLEDs with the printed Cs 2 CO 3 layer recorded the device performance of 10 cd/A and 3 lm/W with a maximum brightness of around 7, 500 cd/m 2. This is a first report showing that a very thin and inorganic layer can also be gravure printed. Chapter 7 describes charge balancing and position of recombination zone in inverted OLEDs using poly (9, 9 -dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F 8 BT) and poly (9, 9 -dioctylfluoreneco- N-(4 -butylphenyl) -diphenylamine) (TFB) bilayer structure. The two layers are either hole or electron transporting materials and can form a large energy offsets between the HOMO levels and the LUMO levels of the two materials at the interface which confines a large number of injected charge carriers there. It is shown that a position of recombination zone and the charge carrier confinement effect are dependent with the thicknesses of the two polymer layers. The confined charged carriers induce the recombination zone to be positioned close to the interface where charge carrier tunnelling and Föster energy transfer occur more frequently than the bulk. The experimentally optimized thicknesses of the two layers record the highest efficiency of 36 cd/A and 23 lm/W with a bright emission of 51, 200 cd/m 2 at a low voltage around 4 V. The efficiency is the highest efficiency reported so far to the best of our knowledge using fluorescence materials. Chapter 8 explains gravure printing of OFETs using a thiophene polymer. Poly(3 - hexylthiophene) - 2, 5 -diyl (P 3 HT) OSC, two dielectric layers, and top Ag gate electrode are sequentially gravure printed. The annealing condition of P 3 HT, choice of dielectric layer and issues related to printing P 3 HT are discussed. Fully gravure printed OFETs on the pre-patterend ITO source and drain pattern report a high mobility of 3 × 10 - 2 cm 2 /Vs and an on/off current ratio of 104. 62. The performance is the highest among the printed OFETs using P 3 HT. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
