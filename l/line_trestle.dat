50|$|The New York Daily News and the New York Post have {{published}} articles {{calling for the}} borough presidencies to be eliminated. A March 15, 2009 Daily News article criticized the borough presidents for spending {{millions of dollars on}} “pet projects”, including Stringer's “$2 million to renovate the old High <b>Line</b> <b>trestle</b> and create an immensely popular park - and another $150,000 for a database of senior citizens”.|$|E
5000|$|Auburn Mills Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located near Yorklyn, New Castle County, Delaware in Auburn Heights Preserve state park. It encompasses 9 contributing buildings, 4 contributing sites, and 1 contributing structure that were mostly between 1890 and 1910 and related to the Auburn Mill. The district contains industrial, commercial, and domestic structures. They include the Horatio Gates Garrett House, Israel Marshall House (1897), The [...] "Bank" [...] worker's row house, Auburn Store/NVP Office, Frame Workers' Housing Site, Insulite Mill (1900), Blacksmith's Shop Site, Auburn Mill, Utility Shed, and Trolley <b>Line</b> <b>Trestle</b> Piers.|$|E
50|$|Colonel Springs then {{heard of}} a main <b>line</b> <b>trestle</b> {{that was about to}} be {{abandoned}} by the railroad that owned it so they could replace it with a trestle that had double tracks. An added bonus was that the trestle also included a bridge for automobiles. Colonel Springs bought this trestle and then sold it to the county for what he had paid for it. He was left with only the expense of moving the trestle to the Catawba and attaching it to the stone piers of the old trestle that were spared by the flood. That the new trestle fit the piers of the old one was the stroke of luck that the L&C needed.|$|E
2500|$|For most of 2009, all {{service was}} suspended, {{so as to}} permit work to {{rehabilitate}} the <b>line's</b> four <b>trestle</b> bridges. The longest of these is Riverwood Trestle, which is [...] long and about [...] high.|$|R
50|$|The {{trail was}} {{previously}} a Union Pacific railway line {{as part of}} the Willow Glen Spur of the San Jose Branch <b>line.</b> A <b>trestle</b> bridge, the Willow Glen Trestle, was built in 1921 and crossed the Los Gatos Creek near Lonus Street. A train used to travel to and from a cannery. The tracks were abandoned by the early part of 2000s decade.|$|R
50|$|Just past Schunemunk's western ridge, {{the town}} line reaches another corner and changes course to due north. This {{takes in the}} rural, rolling {{countryside}} between the mountain and Salisbury Mills, where Storm King Art Center is located and the Moodna Viaduct, the highest and longest railroad trestle east of the Mississippi River, spans the valley between Schunemunk and the Salisbury Mills-Cornwall station on the Metro-North Port Jervis <b>Line.</b> This <b>trestle</b> was shown in the 2007 film Michael Clayton and is a well-known landmark. NY 94 runs through this section of town.|$|R
50|$|Sandy made {{landfall}} on October 29, {{dragging a}} ten-foot-high storm surge from Jamaica Bay that flooded all of Old and New Howard Beach plus the neighborhoods of Broad Channel and the Rockaways, {{along with some}} sections of Lindenwood and neighboring Ozone Park. The storm knocked out power to Howard Beach for three weeks. The flooding damaged most, if not all, houses in the neighborhood, all of the stores along Cross Bay Boulevard, the Howard Beach - JFK Airport station, and the IND Rockaway <b>Line</b> <b>trestle</b> that carries trains over Jamaica Bay into Broad Channel and the Rockaways. After Sandy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the New York City Office of Emergency Management provisionally re-classified Howard Beach along with the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Gerritsen Beach and Red Hook as Zone A neighborhoods.|$|E
5000|$|Although never {{actually}} proven, {{one of the}} more famous scenes in the serial which depicted a curved railroad bridge was supposedly the Ingham Creek trestle in New Hope, Pennsylvania on the Reading Company's New Hope Branch (now the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad <b>line).</b> The <b>trestle</b> still stands, just off Ferry Street along a private driveway. Some even nickname it Pauline's Trestle. The railroad is a tourist attraction and offers rides from New Hope to Lahaska, Pennsylvania, crossing over the original trestle. Other supposed locations for the railroad scenes include the Belvidere-Delaware Railroad in Lambertville and Raven Rock, N.J. and the Long Island Rail Road in the Hamptons on Long Island.|$|R
5000|$|SPC was {{incorporated}} in 1876 {{to purchase the}} unfinished Santa Clara Valley Company railroad at Dumbarton Point. Dumbarton Point was then a landing to transfer agricultural produce from the Santa Clara Valley onto sailboats for transport to San Francisco. Railway shops were built in Newark and a [...] narrow gauge line to San Jose was completed in 1876. The SPC ferry Newark offered connecting service from Newark to San Francisco in 1877. In 1878 the SPC was extended from San Jose to Los Gatos; and the subsidiary Bay and Coast Railroad completed a <b>line</b> of <b>trestles</b> and fill along {{the eastern edge of}} San Francisco Bay from Newark to Alameda. The ferry connection to San Francisco shifted to Alameda as SPC ferrys Bay City and Garden City increased the frequency and reliability of connecting service.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a railway}} trestle {{bordering}} {{the park on}} the west side of the highway. The trestle is clearly indicated on the park map past the westernmost tip of the 'Gold Mine Trail'. The hike affords spectacular views of Mount Finlayson to the east; however, the trestle itself is part of the E & N Railway, a semi-active rail <b>line.</b> While the <b>trestle</b> is noted on the map, it is not considered a part of the park's official trail system.|$|R
50|$|For most of 2009, all {{service was}} suspended, {{so as to}} permit work to {{rehabilitate}} the <b>line's</b> four <b>trestle</b> bridges. The longest of these is Riverwood Trestle, which is 686 ft long and about 75 ft high.Service resumed during the 2009 Christmas and holiday season. The 2010 season began on May 1, but the line's only streetcar broke down on July 16, 2010, causing an indefinite suspension of service. This suspension continued in 2011 and 2012, because the estimated cost to repair the car was high, and no substitute streetcar was available. After OERHS determined that repair of the 1932-built streetcar, Portland Brill car 813, would be prohibitively expensive in the foreseeable future, the group began looking for a replacement. Car 813 was moved from Lake Oswego to the Oregon Electric Railway Museum, near Salem, in June 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} well known for its sharp curves and {{spectacular}} scenery and {{was also one of}} the last lines to offer a 'Mixed Passenger and Goods' service in Victoria. The section from Yarram to Woodside was closed on 26 May 1953, with the section from Welshpool to Yarram closed on 26 October 1987 when the superphosphate freight services ceased. From this point until 30 June 1992, the track beyond Agnes, referred to as Barry Beach Junction received minimal usage, although a short branch leading from Agnes to Barry Beach was used extensively for goods traffic to serve the oil platforms in Bass Strait. After the withdrawal of this freight service the railway line beyond Leongatha was booked out of use for all rail traffic. This section of track was then dismantled in 1994, in which required the strengthening of the <b>line's</b> derilcit <b>trestle</b> bridges in order to allow the track removal machine to dismantle the tracks.|$|R
50|$|Although not to {{the extent}} that Rockefeller planned, the DM&N did start {{construction}} in early 1896 on new branches to the Victoria, Adams and Franklin mines. In 1897, DM&N construction was focused on improvements to the existing <b>line</b> including <b>trestle</b> filling and grade lowering projects, and plans were made to build a new coal dock in Duluth that would receive coal, from Rockefeller's ships, for delivery in the area, as well as a 762 ft extension to the existing dock. Rockefeller did not abandon his larger plan, and instead built up a company with $12 million in capital for construction that was projected to begin in 1898. But ore shipments in 1897 were down from previous years due to smaller winter stockpiles. Throughout much of 1898, the DM&N and D&IR were involved in a civil case brought by a few independent mine owners in the region; the mine owners alleged that the railroads were giving unfair advantage in rates to the mines that the railroads' parent companies owned. The suit was dropped on November 26, 1898.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line was}} started in 1911 by the Canadian Northern Pacific Railway (CNoPR) and while it was {{designed}} by engineers, it was built by local farmers and loggers, with investment funds from the Canadian Western Lumber Company, which was the largest lumber {{company in the world}} at that time. The trestle was never completed by the CNoPR, and the line only reached Youbou before construction was terminated. The CNoPR was taken over by Canadian National Railways in 1918, and its <b>line</b> and the <b>trestle</b> were completed in 1920 as part of the [...] "Galloping Goose" [...] rail line. The last train to cross the Kinsol was in 1979, and the trestle was abandoned 1 year later.|$|R
50|$|The Hamilton to Gatesville {{extension}} of 32 miles {{was built in}} 1910-1911 to establish a primary connection with the St. Louis Southwestern Railway at Gatesville. New brick stations of Cotton Belt design were built at Gatesville, Ireland, and Hamilton, with wooden depots at Levita and Aleman. The first train operated on this new line on February 15, 1911. The competing Temple Northwestern Railway sought a similar franchise and graded from Temple, Texas to Gatesville in 1910, with plans to build on to Hamilton and Comanche, but the SN&ST extensions were built first. The new 31-mile line from Edson, four miles north of Hamilton, to Comanche was completed in 1911 and the first train operated on September 3, 1911. A brick depot was built at Comanche, with wooden depots at Gustine, Lamkin, and Edson. Of note on this line was the spectacular curved Bear Creek Trestle, known on the <b>line</b> as <b>Trestle</b> #5, just west of Edson. The extensions of the SN&ST were built under contract with the firm of Thompson and Scott, based on a proposal. The northward extension to serve the bituminous coal mines at Thurber, Texas was never built.|$|R
500|$|A {{campaign}} to raise $500,000 for the renovation began on March 27, 2011; by June 30, about $50,000 had been raised. Two 2009 lawsuits brought by John E. Rahl against the New York Telephone Company over alleged fees due {{to him for}} a fiber optic <b>line</b> crossing the <b>trestle</b> were dismissed by two lower courts (in Vermont and New York). On November 18, 2011, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed Rahl's appeal. , a lawsuit brought by John Rahl over the ownership of the trestle remains pending before the Second Circuit Court. Rahl claimed that he retained ownership of the property because only the state, and not the county, had the right to seize the trestle, which was [...] "forever railroad under 19thcentury eminent domain legal doctrines– long forgotten by modern jurisprudence". The trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, and at least one wedding.|$|R
50|$|Trestle Glen is a {{neighborhood}} in Oakland, California. It is located east of Lakeshore Avenue, a shopping street which it shares with the Grand Lake District. It lies at {{an elevation of}} 144 feet (44 m). The streets are {{laid out in the}} curvilinear pattern of early 20th century garden suburbs. Many of the houses are nestled in the surrounding hills, and were built shortly before The Great Depression. The neighborhood is named after a railroad trestle built in 1893, which was dismantled in 1906 when the line was rerouted. The railroad <b>line</b> ran along <b>Trestle</b> Glen Creek, which was named Indian Gulch by early settlers after the Huchiun village that was located near the present-day intersection of Lakeshore and Trestle Glen Road. (The creek is now mostly underground.) The streetcar was instrumental in spurring the development of residential neighborhoods in the area. Mark Twain was a passenger on the maiden voyage of the streetcar.|$|R
40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningStephanie A. RolleyEconomically {{insecure}} times require {{reduction of}} energy and land consumption, enhancement of socio-economic and environmental quality of life, and reutilization of neglected existing structures and sites. Traditional planning and design dictates through top-down policy and ordered master planning. In contrast, interactive smart technology simulating human cognitive reactions offers an alternative design framework - an intelligent, adaptive environment – capable of redefining contemporary public open space design. Traversing through the neglected Fifth Ward north of downtown St. Louis, the adaptive reutilization of the abandoned Iron Horse Trestle interurban elevated railroad and subway applies the Sense Respond Adapt Mutate Emerge conceptual framework (the S. R. A. M. E. Strategy) by utilizing existing resources to create an interconnected, emergent open space network. Ten unique sites along the Iron Horse Trestle are initially embedded with sensory devices capable of gathering and synthesizing learned information. The real-time actions translate into physical structural responses. The site specifi c reactions extend outwards as structural adaptations to indeterminate changes from trail users. The evolving structural form connects and mutates the existing structure. Similar to a Choose your own adventure gamebook, the Trestle’s open-ended and reactive programmatic strategies emerge {{as a series of}} potential options for future inclusionary, interactive designs. By selectively enhancing, creating, or enabling an open space system reacting to real-time actual user needs over time directly along the <b>Trestle</b> <b>line,</b> the S. R. A. M. E. Strategy offers a potential alternative framework for the indirect revitalization of neglected infrastructural and economic conditions, a residential rejuvenation catalyst, and future socio-economic and ecological sustainable living patterns education tool. The Trestle’s revitalization serves as an education tool critiquing contemporary landscape architecture and general design practice - the static, dictated, and consumptive. Intelligent adaptive environments offer an alternative framework enabling interactive design decision making capabilities to the users as options evolving over time...|$|R
