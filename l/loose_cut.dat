60|$|Alan Thorn was not romantic but {{his love}} for Grace was, to some extent, a generous emotion. He knew Osborn's poverty, and it was plain that if he married Grace {{he might have to}} help him out of his embarrassments. He was fond of money and had grounds for imagining that the {{daughter}} of a rich neighbor would not refuse him; but he wanted Grace and saw he could not wait much longer. He was fastidious about his clothes, and their color and <b>loose</b> <b>cut</b> prevented people remarking that he was getting fat; his dark hair was carefully brushed. He knew, however, that he was getting heavier fast and that he would soon be bald.|$|E

50|$|Men's chemises {{may be said}} to {{have survived}} as the common T-shirt, which still serves as an undergarment. The chemise also morphed into the smock-frock, a garment worn by English laborers until the early 20th century. Its <b>loose</b> <b>cut</b> and wide sleeves were well adapted to heavy labor. The name smock is {{nowadays}} still used for military combat jackets in the UK, whereas in the Belgian army the term has been corrupted to smoke-vest.|$|E
5000|$|William Carson's first logging {{claim was}} in Bayside, {{and he brought}} in workers from New Brunswick, Canada who settled in the area.

[...] In 1907 a large jam of logs and debris that had piled up in Jacoby Creek due to logging operations came <b>loose,</b> <b>cut</b> a new channel of the creek and inundated about 80 acre of dairy land.|$|E
5000|$|Shag, {{also known}} as rolling tobacco, loose tobacco, baccy and rollies is {{fine-cut}} tobacco, used to make self-made cigarettes by hand rolling the tobacco into rolling paper or injecting it into filter tubes. It got {{its name from the}} finely cut strands appearing like 'shag' and was originally considered poor quality. Various types of cut are used; most shag blends use a simple mixture of cutting styles, consisting mostly of <b>loose</b> <b>cut</b> but also krumble kake, ribbon cut and flake may be used. Some shag blends use cuts reminiscent of pipe tobacco. These were imported to the United Kingdom by Rory Innes following the Virginia tobacco plantations in North America.|$|E

5000|$|Until 1914 the Algerian and Tunisian tirailleurs wore zouave style uniforms {{of light}} blue with yellow {{braiding}} (see photographs on this page). White turbans (for parade), red fezs and sashes were worn with this [...] "tenue orientale". A white field dress of similar <b>loose</b> <b>cut</b> was worn in France {{during the early}} months of World War I. The West African and Madagascan tirailleurs wore a dark blue parade dress with red sash and fez while the Indochinese regiments wore an indigenous style of blue, white or khaki uniform with a flat [...] "salacco" [...] headdress. Khaki had been widely worn as a hot-weather field dress in Indo-China and Africa during the years before the outbreak of World War I and thereafter became the norm. The North African tirailleurs however resumed their colourful full dress uniforms between 1927 and 1939 to assist recruitment.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} allowed {{parameter}} {{regime in the}} coupling-mass plane implied by the existing LEP 2 data on e + e − → hadrons at 172. 3 GeV for the leptoquark interpretation of the anomalous DESY positron-jet events for four different models of the leptoquark charges and chiral couplings to quarks, for both a <b>loose</b> <b>cut</b> on s ′ /s and a tight cut on s ′ /s. We find that this interpretation of the DESY phenomenon is still consistent with the LEP 2 data although, for vector leptoquarks, a significant regime of the relevant parameter space is already excluded.

40|$|A {{search for}} {{supersymmetry}} {{was performed in}} events with one electron or muon, jets, and missing transverse momentum. The dataset was the first 5. 0 fb - 1 of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV proton-proton events from the Large Hadron Collider, {{as measured by the}} CMS detector in 2011. A data-driven method was used to estimate the background at high values of the transverse mass, where the suppression of the Standard Model backgrounds allows for relatively <b>loose</b> <b>cuts</b> on the jet activity. No excess above the expected background was observed, so a limit was set in the m 0 -m 1 / 2 plane of the CMSSM at tan β = 10, A 0 = 0, and sgn(μ) =+ 1...|$|R
