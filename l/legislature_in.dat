5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} <b>legislature</b> <b>in</b> favor of statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the {{enforcement}} mechanisms necessary {{to give it}} effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state <b>legislature</b> <b>in</b> a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E
5|$|Many voters {{decried the}} bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to {{increase}} his political power, and the election board remained a controversial issue until its abolition in a special session of the <b>legislature</b> <b>in</b> 1900.|$|E

40|$|A {{recent survey}} {{conducted}} {{in a sample of}} 83 countries by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in collaboration with the World Bank Institute on the Relations between the Legislature and the Executive in the Context of Parliamentary Oversight allows cross-national comparison for the role of <b>legislatures</b> <b>in</b> the budgetary process. One of the survey’s most significant indications is that <b>legislatures</b> <b>in</b> presidential systems are generally more involved in the preparation of the budget than <b>legislatures</b> <b>in</b> either parliamentary or semi-presidential systems. The picture, however, is very different when we look at legislatures’ oversight of the budget. Parliaments are generally more involved in the examination and final approval of the budget than are <b>legislatures</b> <b>in</b> presidential and semi-presidential systems 1. In the light of these considerations, it should not be terribly surprising to find that the executive {{is more likely to be}} accountable to the legislature for its spending in parliamentary systems than in presidential systems...|$|R
