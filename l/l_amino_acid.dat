40|$|Uptake {{of system}} <b>L</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{substrates}} into isolated placental plasma membrane vesicles {{in the absence}} of opposing side amino acid (zero-trans uptake) is incompatible with the concept of obligatory exchange, where influx of amino acid is coupled to efflux. We therefore hypothesized that system <b>L</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> exchange transporters are not fully obligatory and/or that amino acids are initially present inside the vesicles. To address this, we combined computational modeling with vesicle transport assays and transporter localization studies to investigate the mechanism(s) mediating [14 C]L-serine (a system L substrate) transport into human placental microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) vesicles. The carrier model provided a quantitative framework to test the 2 hypotheses that L-serine transport occurs by either obligate exchange or nonobligate exchange coupled with facilitated transport (mixed transport model). The computational model could only account for experimental [14 C]L-serine uptake data when the transporter was not exclusively in exchange mode, best described by the mixed transport model. MVM vesicle isolates contained endogenous amino acids allowing for potential contribution to zero-trans uptake. Both L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) 1 and LAT 2 subtypes of system L were distributed to MVM, with L-serine transport attributed to LAT 2. These findings suggest that exchange transporters do not function exclusively as obligate exchangers. —Widdows, K. L., Panitchob, N., Crocker, I. P., Please, C. P., Hanson, M. A., Sibley, C.

Recombination was carried out between the genome of a temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV-A 59 (Alb 4) and RNA transcribed from a plasmid (pFV 1) containing the spike gene as well as downstream regions, through the 3 ′ end, of the MHV-A 59 genome. We have selected and characterized two recombinant viruses containing Q 159 L.

Ross x 708 male broiler chicks were placed in floor pens and fed common diets from d 1 to 34 that met or exceeded NRC (1994) recommendations.

The structure of 1 was determined by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, and advanced Marfey's analysis of 1 and of the products of its partial hydrolysis. Thermoactinoamide A inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 with an MIC value of 35 μM. On the basis of literature data and this work, cyclic hexapeptides with mixed d/l configurations, one aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residue, and a prevalence of lipophilic residues {{can be seen as}} a starting point to define a new, easily accessible scaffold in the search for new antibiotic agents...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} systemfor {{the determination}} of the L- 2 form of the majority of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> is presented. The method is based upon oxidative deamination of the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> coupled with oxidation of o-dianisidine by hydrogen peroxide. This procedure can be used comparatively for {{the determination of}} a mixture of L-a-amino acids or for the majority of separatedL-z-amino acids (especially in conjunction with column separa-tions from urine and blood which give falsely positive identification with ninhydrin detection). The stereospecific nature of the <b>L</b> [...] <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase enables the investigator to quantitate the amount of <b>L</b> [...] <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{in the presence of the}} D- 2 form. From an academic viewpoint, the extreme sensitivity and wide range of the detection system make it advantageous for the study of the enzyme itself. This automated method also may be employed to follow enzymatic reactions-e. g., those catalyzed by peptidases or racemases. The methodology is extremely convenient with good reagent stability and is much more sensitive than manometric technics. SEVERAL METHODS ARE AVAILABLE for the quantitation of <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> A microbiologic assay for the analysis of <b>L</b> [...] <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> was developed by Loy and Wright (1). The ninhydrin reaction has been utilized suc-cessfully for the automated analysis of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in ion-exchange eolumn effluents (2). An indirect polarographic analysis of a-amino acids was developed by Blaedel and Todd (3). A selective enzymatic method for {{the determination of the}} primary amino group in certain D [...] <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> was developed by Ma and Breyer (4). Malmstadt and Hadjiianriou (5) described a specific enzymatic determination of some L-a-amino acids by a semiautomatic, spectrophotometric reaction-rate method. This last system fulfilled our need, hut the lack of complete automa-tion and lessened sensitivity of the detection system led us to develo...|$|R
