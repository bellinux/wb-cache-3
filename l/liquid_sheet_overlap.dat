40|$|Liquid–liquid coaxial swirl atomizers {{are used}} in liquid rocket engines to achieve an {{efficient}} mixing between the fuel and oxidizer sprays. The characteristics of the mixed spray are mainly controlled by the flow behavior of merged <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> originating at the contact point of inner and outer swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> With an intention of identifying various flow regimes of merged <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> at different conditions of inner and outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets,</b> we report here a fundamental experimental investigation {{on the characteristics of}} merged <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> using water as the experimental liquid. The physical processes involved in the formation and separation of a merged <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> are described from the experimental measurements. For a given outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> condition, the merged <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> forms and separates at specific inner <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> flow conditions. At low outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> flow conditions with Weber number less than 50, the merged <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> exhibits a self-sustaining periodic separation process, whose frequency increases with increasing inner <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> Weber number for a given outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> Weber number.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the breakup {{behavior}} of swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> discharging from gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers with attention focused toward {{the understanding of the}} role of central gas jet on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> breakup. Cold flow experiments on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> breakup were carried out by employing custom fabricated gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers using water and air as experimental fluids. Photographic techniques were employed to capture the flow behavior of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> at different flow conditions. Quantitative variation on the breakup length of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and spray width were obtained from the measurements deduced from the images of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> The sheet breakup process is significantly influenced by the central air jet. It is observed that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> are more vulnerable to the presence of the central air jet and develop shorter breakup lengths at smaller values of the air jet Reynolds number Re-g. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of the central air jet at smaller values of Re-g and eventually develop shorter breakup lengths at higher values of Re-g. The experimental evidences suggest that the central air jet causes corrugations on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> surface, which may be promoting the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> increases with increasing Re-g. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations reveals that the entrainment process of air established between the inner surface of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the central air jet is the primary trigger for the sheet breakup...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{studying}} {{the breakup of}} swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> discharging from the outer orifice of gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Such atomizers are considered as propellant injection systems for semi-cryogenic liquid rocket engines. A gas centered swirl coaxial type atomizer discharges an annular swirling <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which is atomized by a gaseous jet issuing from the central orifice of the atomizer. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the fluid dynamic interaction process between the outer <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the central gas jet and its role on the breakup process of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> Cold flow experiments were carried out by constructing custom made gas centered swirl coaxial atomizers. Two different atomizer configurations with varying swirl effect were studied. The jets were injected into ambient atmospheric air medium with tap water and air as experimental fluids. The flow conditions were {{described in terms of}} Weber number (Wel) and Reynolds number (Reg) for <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the air jet respectively. Spray images were captured by employing an image acquisition system comprising a high resolution digital camera and a strobe lamp. The captured spray images at different combinations of Wel and Reg were analyzed to extract quantitative measurements of breakup length (Lb), spray cone angle (θs), spray width (SW) and two-dimensional surface profile of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> Quantitative analysis of the variation of Lb with Reg with different values of Wel suggested that low inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> undergo an efficient breakup process. High inertia <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> ignore the presence of central air jet at lower values of Reg however undergo air jet breakup at higher values of Reg. Qualitative analysis of experimental observations revealed that the entrainment process, established between the inner surface of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the boundary of central jet, triggers the air assisted sheet breakup by drawing the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> closer to the spray axis. The entrainment process may be developing corrugations on the surface of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> which promotes the production of thick liquid ligaments from the sheet surface. The level of surface corrugations on the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet,</b> quantified by means of tortuosity of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> profile, increases with increasing Reg. Limited studies on the effect of variation swirl intensity on the air assisted breakup process of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> did not show any significant influence for the atomizers examined in the present work...|$|R

It was also shown that the effect of introducing air in the nozzle is similar to the effect of inducing forced vibrations on the nozzle jaws. Thus, for each air flow rate, there is a specific vibration frequency for the nozzle. The frequency of these vibrations is proportional to the air velocity. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> natural frequency approaches that of the nozzle, resonance is established. At resonance, the maximum spray angle is achieved...|$|R

An opposite trend was observed for an axisymmetric configuration where surface tension tends to promote the development of vorticity. An increase in vorticity development and liquid dispersion was observed for increased <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness, while a decreasing trend was observed for higher gas pressure.

The generated ligaments can be categorized in two general types based on their orientation {{with respect to the}} flow field; span-wise and stream-wise ligaments. This work contains a two- and three-dimensional computational study of the primary breakup of a viscous <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet.</b> A Volume of Fluid (VOF) based code is used to solve the governing equations and capture the interface between the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> and the surrounding gas. Since the interaction between the liquid and gas is the major source of the breakup, the liquid-gas interface boundary is modified in this work and it is implemented using linear stability analysis. The variation in the breakup time and breakup length of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> with fluid properties is investigated by a two-dimensional study. Fluid properties are stated in three non-dimensional numbers: Weber number, Ohnesorge number and the gas to liquid density ratio. The liquid surface tension shows a stabilizing effect by increasing both the breakup time and breakup length of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> The <b>liquid</b> viscosity has more complicated effects; it increases the breakup length while at a certain range of Weber numbers, increasing the viscosity decreases the breakup time. Increasing the surrounding gas density decreases both breakup length and time. The study is extended to three-dimension to capture the stream-wise ligaments as well as span-wise ligaments captured in two-dimension. The effect of fluid parameters on the formation of stream-wise ligaments is presented. A mesh refinement study is conducted which demonstrates that providing at least 7 computational cells per sheet thickness would lead to results which are not dependent on the mesh size...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Liquid</b> <b>Sheet</b> Radiator (LSR) is an {{external}} flow radiator {{that uses a}} triangular-shaped flowing <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> as the radiating surface. It has potentially much lower mass than solid wall radiators such as pumped loop and heat pipe radiators, along with being nearly immune to micrometeoroid penetration. The LSR has an added advantage of simplicity. Surface tension causes a thin (100 - 300 microns) <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> to coalesce to a point, causing the sheet flow to have a triangular shape. Such a triangular sheet is desirable since it allows for simple collection of the flow at a single point. A major problem for all external flow radiators is the requirement that the working fluid be of very low (approx. 10 (sup - 8) torr) vapor pressure to keep evaporative losses low. As a result, working fluids are limited to certain oils (such as used in diffusion pumps) for low temperatures (300 - 400 K) and liquid metals for higher temperatures. Previous research on the LSR has been directed at understanding the fluid mechanics of thin sheet flows and assessing the stability of such flows, {{especially with regard to}} the formation of holes in the sheet. Taylor studied extensively the stability of thin <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> both theoretically and experimentally. He showed that thin sheets in a vacuum are stable. The latest research has been directed at determining the emittance of thin sheet flows. The emittance was calculated from spectral transmittance data for the Dow Corning 705 silicone oil. By experimentally setting up a sheet flow, the emittance was also determined as a function of measurable quantities, most importantly, the temperature drop between the top of the sheet and the temperature at the coalescence point of the sheet. Temperature fluctuations upstream of the <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> were a potential problem in the analysis and were investigated...|$|R

The spray droplets {{results from the}} destabilization of a <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> formed by the nozzle. Standard pesticide solution adjuvants as dilute solution of long polymer chains or dilute emulsions are known to influence the spray drop size distribution. Although being documented, these effects are not understood yet. In order to elucidate the physical mechanisms at {{the origin of the}} change on the drop size distribution, we investigate the influence of different complex fluids on the destabilization mechanisms of <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets.</b> We here form <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> by the collision of a liquid drop on a small solid target. Upon impact, the drop flattens into a radial sheet expanding in the air bounded by a thicker rim. Different destabilization mechanisms of the sheet are observed depending on the fluid nature. A pure water sheet spreads out radially until it reaches a maximum diameter and then retracts due to the effect of surface tension. The destabilization mechanism is drastically modified when a dilute oil in water emulsion is used. The <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> spreads out radially but holes perforate the sheet before the retraction, as already observed for some surfactant solutions [1]. The holes grow until they merge together and form a web of ligaments, which are then destabilized into droplets. To investigate the different sheet destabilization mechanisms, we use a fast camera imaging coupled to an original technique recently developed to access the time and space-resolved sheet thickness. Physico-chemical parameters of the dilute emulsion are modified to rationalize their influence on the perforation mechanism as for instance the influence of the emulsion concentration. We show in particular that the number of hole nucleation events per <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> is directly governed by the emulsion concentration. In striking concordance, we find that the emulsion concentration directly controls the drop size distributions of a spray, as measured with a diffraction-based size analyzer, suggesting that experiments on <b>liquid</b> <b>sheets</b> are appropriate model experiments to gain an understanding on the physical mechanisms governing the spray drop size distribution.

The steady {{state of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>sheet</b> has been calculated by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for variable density incompressible flows and the interface between the two fluids has been determined by using the Volume of Fluids method.
