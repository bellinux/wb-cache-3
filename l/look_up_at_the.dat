5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{described}} {{the mood in}} the execution chamber as somber, and Williams showed no resistance as he was led into the execution chamber. After Williams was strapped to the gurney, he struggled against the straps holding him down to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> press gallery behind him, and to exchange glances with his supporters.|$|E
500|$|They <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> awesome West {{wall of the}} {{mountain}} above them. They walk up the glacier wearing new crampons, probing for crevasses with their ice-axes. They cross the bergschrund and climb [...] "a few feet of easy rock". Carless suggests rappelling 200 feet (60 m) to the next glacier. They agree [...] "it would be difficult" [...] to get back if they did that. They return to their base camp and try again the next morning, again finding their way blocked. They wish the climbing waitresses from Wales were with them.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the {{citizens}} try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six [...] "strangers" [...] watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually they decide to go outside, where they <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair. During this scene, you hear a voicing softly in Russian, a reference to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the informality {{suggested}} by the cigarette, University of Tennessee photography professor Baldwin Lee {{points out that the}} photo was carefully planned and posed. According to Lee, Westcott instructed Oppenheimer to sit [...] "slightly askance" [...] and to lean forward slightly, and then he took the photograph from a low vantage point that [...] "makes the viewer physically <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man," [...] thus enhancing the subject's perceived importance. Lee's critique also notes that Oppenheimer's gaze {{does not appear to be}} directed anywhere in the room, but instead is aimed at [...] "something very distant and something only he can see." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jake & Jim and grew from an idea the band had to record a video in Iceland {{at the start of}} 2003 which didn't come off. The video begins with a close up of a cardboard box featuring a logo of two apples with the title 'Golden'. The band is shown playing along to [...] "Golden Retriever" [...] inside the box with Gruff Rhys wearing a red sports visor. Bassist Guto Pryce and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are both sat on settees with guitars on their laps which they are not playing. As the chorus begins the band transform into yetis and all begin playing [...] "Golden Retriever", several members headbanging in time with the track. The group wear their regular clothes for the second verse before the yeti costumes reappear for the second chorus. As the video ends the camera zooms out to show a Golden Retriever approach the box in an alleyway. The Super Furries raise their hands in the air and <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dog who then urinates on the box and runs away.|$|E

2500|$|The Dunbar {{hosted a}} jazz show in 1991, {{attended}} by noted music journalist Leonard Feather.

2500|$|Zhou Yu {{was known}} to be very {{experienced}} in music. Even when he was not sober, he could still detect a mistake or a wrong note when a musical piece was being played.

There was a saying at that time to describe this: [...] "If {{there is a problem with}} the tune, Zhou Yu will look up." ...|$|E
