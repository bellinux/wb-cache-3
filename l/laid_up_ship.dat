5000|$|Polar Sea {{has been}} out of service since 2010 due to {{complete}} failure of five of her six Alco main diesel engines. Examination of her engines indicated excessive engine wear, with engine pistons welded to their sleeves. A root cause analysis apparently traced the problem to improper installation of piston rings and/or installation of incorrect (chromed vs. plain) rings. In 2011 the Coast Guard slated Polar Sea for demolition in 2012, but the scrapping of the 35-year-old icebreaker was postponed by Congress for at least six months in June. A congressional authorization required the Coast Guard to make a report to Congress on the feasibility of retrofitting Polar Sea. The report was submitted in November 2013 and indicated that it is feasible to retrofit and reactivate Polar Sea. As of 25 February 2015 the <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> <b>ship</b> was still in limbo alongside a pier at the Coast Guard Station on Elliott Bay, Seattle. It has not been determined if a new class may be funded, commercial icebreaker leasing options will be explored, and/or if the ship should be scrapped.|$|E

50|$|Cox is {{the founder}} and web master of the site, much of the content on Maritime Matters is written by travel writer and liner expert, Peter Knego. Post and blogs cover {{contemporary}} cruise ships, stories of preserved or <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> <b>ships,</b> shipping news, such as an announcement of a newbuild for a cruise line, or updates on what ships are being scrapped. Maritime Matters went through an upgrade to a different format at one point, its old pages available via Google until the site was moved to a new server in May 2010. Knego was one of many press members who were on board the Norwegian Epic for a short cruise upon arrival in New York, and was able to post a large blog chronicling the ships interior, from the pool deck, public spaces, and suites. If visitors of the site enter their name and email to a commenting engine {{they would be able to}} comment on posts. In September 2010 Google announced that news posts from the website would be featured on the news aggregator Google News. It was also announced that the site would be undergoing an upgrade, which would include the option of changing pages to different languages.|$|R

She was chartered to DFDS Seaways in August 2010 and early September 2010 to provide refit cover on the Birkenhead - Dublin and Belfast routes. On completion of this charter the ship was sent for its annual overhaul and then proceeded to Dunkerque for layup. She remained in Dunkerque until early February 2011 when she sailed for Liverpool in preparation for returning to service on the Liverpool-Dublin service replacing the M/V Norcape.|$|R
40|$|The steel Canadian paddle steamer the "Toronto" {{was built}} for the Canadian S. S. Company in Toronto, Ontario, in 1899. She {{operated}} between Toronto, Rochester, Kingston, and Prescott. In 1938, the "Toronto" was <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> at the <b>Ship</b> Channel in Toronto, Ontario, as she needed new boilers and other maintenance operations.

50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II the Augustus and the Roma were <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> but both <b>ships</b> were subsequently {{taken over by the}} Italian Navy. Like her sister, the Augustus was converted into an aircraft carrier and renamed Falco and later Sparviero. In 1944, both ships were taken over by the German troops but on September 25 of that year she was scuttled, in order to blockade Genoa harbour from the Allies. After the war she was raised and scrapped in 1946.|$|R
500|$|From 2003, {{the demand}} for new ships started to grow, {{resulting}} in 2007 in a record breaking order backlog for shipyards, exceeding their capacity with rising newbuilding prices as a result. This resulted in a glut of ships when demand dropped due to a weakened global economy and dramatically reduced demand in the United States. The charter rate for very large crude carriers, which carry two million barrels of oil, had peaked at $309,601 per day in 2007, and has dropped, as of 2012, to $7,085 per day, far below the operating costs of these ships. [...] As a result, several tanker operators <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> their <b>ships.</b> Prices rose significantly in 2015 and early 2016, but delivery of new tankers was projected to keep prices in check.|$|R
25|$|Little {{information}} is available regarding West Elcascos movements in the interwar period, but the ship {{is known to have}} been active from 1919 through the mid-1920s in transatlantic service, when the ship transported passengers and cargo from various ports in Spain, France and Italy to the United States. West Elcasco was sold in 1930 to the Mississippi Shipping Co. and homeported at New York. With the reduction in international trade brought about by the Great Depression however, West Elcasco like many other U.S. ships of the era was eventually <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> by the <b>Shipping</b> Board for lack of work.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{realistic}} and flexible approach concerning the forecast of tanker freight rates in a pre-determined number of tanker routes. We aim to do this by using certain analytical techniques. In general, tanker freight rates can reflect the global socio-economical and environmental-oriented situation of various aspects of maritime transport market and practices. Moreover, {{the development of a}} realistic and event-driven way in order to achieve acceptable forecasts is in position to further analyze and promote the actual role of such parameters (e. g. tanker freight rates etc). By using the term event-driven we refer to possible maritime market (e. g. tanker rates) reaction to a (local) warfare, to an international embargo, to the enforcement of new regulations etc. Thus, the specific tanker routes were selected with regional, volume and cargo type criteria; this means that they can adequately cover some of the important oil maritime flows in a world-wide scale. We aim to accomplish the aforementioned task by implementing a detailed single-parameter time series model analysis and certain supportive explanatory models. In this way, we formulate an operational and practical framework capable to support a possible corresponding effort for decision making in this cognitive area. The key issue of this effort is to structure a logical-realistic approach to model the recorded fluctuations of tanker freight market. The proposed methodology is applied to forecasting the spot and period freight rates of tankers up to 30. 000, 130. 000, and 250. 000 tn dwt, using as input among others the supply, demand and the number of <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> <b>ships</b> (ranging from 10. 000 to 39. 999 tn dwt). The success of forecasting is satisfactory in most cases. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
50|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the early 1930s, the {{merchant}} navies around the world faced increasing unemployment. However, through a number of strategic mergers, as well as the continuing support of the Shah of Iran, APOC managed to strengthen its position within the industry, and the BTC's fleet continued to grow until the launch of British Energy in 1931 marked the end of the post-war fleet renewal. In 1932, APOC reached an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell to combine their UK domestic marketing and distribution networks. This involved the transfer of some ships to a jointly owned company, Shell-Mex and BP. With careful management BTC only <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> 6 <b>ships</b> for an average of 6 weeks between 1930-35. In 1935, with the Depression receding, the company started placing orders with British shipyards for a further 24 ships. The same year, at the Shah's request, the company was renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.|$|R
60|$|He {{equipped}} a sloop of 140 tons burden, {{and sailed}} for Darien. When {{he arrived at}} this isthmus, he <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> his <b>ship</b> and marched inland, guided by Indians. After traveling twelve leagues among the mountains, {{he came to a}} small river running down into the Pacific. Here he and his comrades built a boat, launched it in the stream, and dropped down into the bay of Panama. Then he rowed to the Isle of Pearls, and there captured a small barque, from Quito, with sixty pounds of gold. This raised the spirits of the adventurers, and six days later they took another barque, with a hundred and sixty pounds of silver. They then set off in quest of pearls. They searched for a few days, but did not find them in proportion to their expectations. They therefore determined to return, and re-entered the mouth of the river they had descended. Here they loosed the prizes they had taken, and let them go.|$|R
50|$|After the English Restoration, Charles II of England became king, {{and tried}} to serve his dynastic {{interests}} by putting pressure on the States-General to make his nephew, the later William III of Orange, stadtholder. Believing the Dutch were weakened by their political divisions the English parliament grew ever more enthusiastic to start a war {{to take over the}} Dutch colonial empire. At first the Dutch tried to fend off this disaster by bribing Charles, but they soon understood he was too weak a king to resist the pressure from the English elite. In 1664 it became obvious war was unavoidable. In reaction the Dutch began to expand their fleet. <b>Laid</b> <b>up</b> obsolete <b>ships</b> from the previous war were activated and a new ad hoc building programme was started that year, soon followed by an official plan at a price of eight million guilders to build sixty heavier ships (so as to completely replace the core of the fleet) in the years 1665-67. Company warships were brought over from the Indies. Large merchants were hired or bought to be rebuilt.|$|R
500|$|When Bethlehem Steel Corporation {{permanently}} <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> Fitzgeralds sister <b>ship,</b> SS Arthur B. Homer, {{just five}} years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her, questions were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems. The two vessels {{were built in the}} same shipyard using welded joints instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas, while welded joints are more likely to break. Reports indicate that repairs to Fitzgeralds hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup. Homer was lengthened to [...] and placed back in service by December 1975, not long after Fitzgerald foundered. In 1978, without explanation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on Homer. Homer was permanently <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.|$|R
50|$|Thunder {{returned}} to Canada in August 1944 {{to undergo a}} refit at Sydney. The minesweeper {{returned to}} European waters in November and {{was assigned to the}} 31st Minesweeping Flotilla. In April 1945, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla was assigned to the last large-scale combined operation in the European theatre. Sailing to the Gironde estuary on 12 April, the minesweeping flotilla swept an invasion channel for the attack force landing in the area. Once their minesweeping duties were completed, the minesweepers performed an anti-submarine patrol in the area. They continued in these duties until 16 April when the minesweepers returned to Plymouth. While transiting the Bay of Biscay, Thunder accepted the surrender of the German auxiliary minesweeper FGi 07 and with a prize crew aboard, took the vessel back to the United Kingdom. Thunder and the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla spent the next five months sweeping the English Channel. Thunder remained in European waters until September, when the minesweeper returned to Canada. Thunder was paid off on 4 October 1945 and <b>laid</b> <b>up.</b> The <b>ship</b> was sold to Marine Industries in 1947 and broken up at Sorel, Quebec.|$|R
60|$|After a month's close {{confinement}} in {{the house}} I was at length {{able to go out}} a little, and about the same time I succeeded in getting a boat and six natives to take Ali and Lahagi to Amberbaki, and to bring them back {{at the end of a}} month. Ali was charged to buy all the Birds of Paradise he could get, and to shoot and skin all other rare or new birds; and Lahagi was to collect insects, which I hoped might be more abundant than at Dorey. When I recommenced my daily walks in search of insects, I found a great change in the neighbourhood, and one very agreeable to me. All the time I had been <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> the <b>ship's</b> crew and the Javanese soldiers who had been brought in a tender (a sailing ship which had arrived soon after the Etna), had been employed cutting down, sawing, and splitting large trees for firewood, to enable the steamer to get back to Amboyna if the coal-ship did not return; and they had also cleared a number of wide, straight paths through the forest in various directions, greatly to the astonishment of the natives, who could not make out what it all meant. I had now a variety of walks, and a good deal of dead wood on which to search for insects; but notwithstanding these advantages, they were not nearly so plentiful as I had found them at Sarawak, or Amboyna, or Batchian, confirming my opinion that Dorey was not a good locality. It is quite probable, however, that at a station a few miles in the interior, away from the recently elevated coralline rocks and the influence of the sea air, a much more abundant harvest might be obtained.|$|R

60|$|The Beaver arrived safe at Canton, where Captain Sowle {{found the}} letter of Mr. Astor, giving him {{information}} {{of the war and}} directing him to convey the intelligence to Astoria. He wrote a reply, dictated either by timidity or obstinacy, in which he declined complying with the orders of Mr. Astor, but said he would wait for the return of peace, and then come home. The other proceedings of Captain Sowle were equally wrongheaded and unlucky. He was offered one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the fur he had taken on board at St. Paul's. The goods for which it had been procured cost but twenty-five thousand dollars in New York. Had he accepted this offer, and re-invested the amount in nankeens, which at that time, in consequence of the interruption to commerce by the war, were at two thirds of their usual price, the whole would have brought three hundred thousand dollars in New York. It is true, the war would have rendered it unsafe to attempt the homeward voyage, but he might have put the goods in store at Canton, until after the peace, and have sailed without risk of capture to Astoria; bringing to the partners at that place tidings of the great profits realized on the outward cargo, and the still greater to be expected from the returns. The news of such a brilliant commencement to their undertaking would have counterbalanced the gloomy tidings of the war; it would have infused new spirit into them all, and given them courage and constancy to persevere in the enterprise. Captain Sowle, however, refused the offer of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and stood wavering and chaffering for higher terms. The furs began to fall in value; this only increased his irresolution; they sunk so much that he feared to sell at all; he borrowed money on Mr. Astor's account at an interest of eighteen per cent., and <b>laid</b> <b>up</b> his <b>ship</b> to await the return of peace.|$|R
