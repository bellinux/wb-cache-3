40|$|Introduction: In Italy {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in claims for damages for alleged medical malpractice. A study was therefore conducted that aimed at assessing the content of the coverage of insurance policy contracts offered to oral health professionals by the insurance market. Material and methods: The sample analysed composed of 11 insurance policy contracts for professional dental liability offered from 2010 to 2015 by leading insurance companies operating in the Italian market. Results: The insurance products analysed are structured on the “claims made” clause. No policy contract examined covers the damage due to the failure to acquire consent for dental treatment and, in most cases, damage due to unsatisfactory outcomes of treatment of an aesthetic nature and the failure to respect regulatory obligations on privacy. Discussion: On entering into a professional liability insurance policy contract, the dentist should pay particular attention to the period covered by the guarantee, the risks both covered and excluded, as well as the extent of the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and any possible fixed/percentage excess. Conclusions: When choosing a professional liability contract, a dentist should examine the risks in relation to the professional activity carried out before signing...|$|E
40|$|The {{stipulation}} of the {{age limit}} of child’s livelihood based on {{to the number of}} year is important to do, because standard of age maturity (not child authonomy) that has been used can lead to the harm to the child who has been in age maturity but she or he is not authonomous yet. On the other hand, the lack of independent age limit can be burden to the parents, because granting a living become limitless. The age limit is not available through the texts of the Shari‘a, therefore, it should be studied by using uṣūl al-fiqh approach (maqāṣid al-syarī‘ah). This study use mixed method; deductive and inductive. The findings were analyzed by using istiṣlāḥiyyah reasoning patterns. Based on this study, it was concluded that the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> of parents for their children is until the child reaches the age of 23 years. Because at the age of 22 years, children in Indonesia generally have completed undergraduate.

40|$|Colombia {{is not a}} Member State of the Maritime Carriage Conventions {{currently}} in force (Hague-Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules) and it is uncertain whether it will ratify the Rotterdam Rules in the upcoming future. Pursuant to the foregoing, the regulation of the contracts of carriage of goods by sea is governed by the Colombian Code of Commerce. Accordingly, the Colombian Code of Commerce provides certain provisions which particularly regulate {{the carriage of goods}} by sea under bill of lading. Amongst those provisions, Article 1644 is of paramount significance for the liability of the carrier, considering that it allows in situations where there is no declaration {{of the value of the}} goods in the bill of lading, the possibility to apply the limitation of liability agreed by the parties in the carriage contract. However, the case law in Colombia has never concerned the limitation of the carrier’s liability in the context of an international multimodal carriage contract that includes a sea leg. In that respect, Article 16 of Decision 331 of 1993 of the Andean Community sets forth that when a damage or loss to the goods carried occurs in a stage of an international multimodal carriage contract where an international convention applicable or a mandatory national law provides a higher <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for the carrier that the one agreed by the parties in the carriage contract, the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> sets forth either by the international conventions or mandatory national law shall prevail upon the one agreed in the contract. According to the foregoing legal framework, the aim of this master thesis is to determine whether in accordance with Article 16 of Decision 331 of 1993 of the Andean Community and Article 1644 of the Colombian Code of Commerce the limitation of liability provided either in the Hague-Visby Rules or the Hamburg Rules shall apply compulsory in the Colombian jurisdiction in a situation of localized loss or damage to the goods sustained during the sea leg of an international multimodal carriage contract, in order to adjust Colombian jurisdiction with international standards on this subject matter.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the obligation of care of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to cargo claims by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the optional port of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known doctrine of deviation under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize the doctrine of deviation. Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|E
