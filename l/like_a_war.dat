Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said: [...] "I can't think {{of a time when}} there was ever a story generated by a news organisation where the White House, the Kremlin, Chávez, India, China, everyone in the world was talking about these things. ...

500|$|On Majuro atoll in the Marshall Islands, the {{developing}} Nangka produced strong westerly winds near gale force, producing high waves and flooding along the lagoon. At least 25vessels in the island's lagoon broke loose from or were dragged by their moorings. High winds from Nangka tore roofs from homes and downed trees and power lines. Nearly {{half of the}} nation's capital, Majuro, was left without power. Tony deBrum, the Marshall Island's foreign minister, stated [...] "Majuro [...] <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone."

He explained, [...] "Unbridled, and full of anarchistic madness, this song is crushed full of passion and energy." [...] He further described it as [...] "big and bombastic and full of guitars". The track features combative lyrics and repeated chants of [...] "We will rise again". Nadia Noir of CBS News felt that [...] "conquistador" [...] is an [...] "apt title" [...] for the [...] "bombastic blitzkreig-rock tune, an apocalyptic summons to something greater". Michael Depland of MTV explained that the song's lyrics suggest [...] "tumult and upheaval", while critic Emily Zemler from Billboard magazine wrote that its chanting chorus makes the song feel [...] "almost <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> cry". In {{a preview of the}} record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse felt that the track is [...] "self-detonated with the band's recognizable alt-rock bombast, complete with soaring violins," [...] and noted that it [...] "closed with a massive, stadium-filling chorus, delivered in [...] famous screamo vocal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unger's {{work was}} {{exhibited}} in the 1985 show, “The Figure as an Image of the Psyche”, at the Sculpture Center in New York, whose main theme {{was the use of}} human figures to confront and transform difficult and extreme responses and experiences. [...] The gallery looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone and was a reminder that declaratory emotional statements are always possible. [...] The show had the edge and tone of the work Mary Ann Unger contributed. One of her works, Supplicant, was an overwhelming piece made of hydrocal. [...] It can be described as representing a bald head impaled on a spine that supports four vertically-aligned breasts. [...] With small outstretched arms, like the feathers or wings of some prehistoric bird, and a huge mouth open toward the sky, the sculpture suggests frantic desire and symbolizes both a cry of pain and a song of faith.|$|E

[...] Nixon said that Ferguson security will be overseen by Captain Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol. Johnson, an African-American, said he grew up in the community and [...] "it {{means a lot to me}} personally that we break this cycle of violence." [...] Nixon said, [...] "The people of Ferguson want their streets to be free of intimidation and fear" [...] he said, but during the past few days, [...] "it looked a little bit more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone and that's not acceptable." [...] St. Louis county prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch criticized the governor's decision, saying [...] "It's shameful what he did today; he had no legal authority to do that. To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey {{gets back}} into Silas's [...] "bad books" [...] {{when he finds}} her looking at his {{hospital}} records. Silas then tries to scare Lynsey off with a menacing warning. In August 2011, Rawle confirmed that Silas would start terrorising Lynsey. Rawle explained that Silas is intent on discrediting Lynsey as she knows he is a killer. He said [...] " [...] job {{over the next few}} weeks, it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of attrition - [...] going to wear her down and send her mad." [...] Lynsey is determined to see Silas punished for his crimes as the investigation into India's murder gathers pace. Of this, Hassan told Inside Soap [...] "When Silas realises that Lynsey is on his case again, he basically tells her to bring it on." [...] Silas [...] "gets off" [...] on the idea that Lynsey is trying to stop him from killing again and Hassan said [...] "it makes the game a lot more interesting". Lynsey's suspicions are reconfirmed when she sees Silas among the press at a televised appeal about India's attacker. Lynsey frames Silas by planting India's necklace on him before ringing the police anonymously. Hassan said that Lynsey hopes Silas's [...] "web of lies" [...] will unravel. Lynsey's attempt to frame him backfires.|$|E
2500|$|When Silas {{suffers a}} heart attack, Lynsey {{is faced with}} a dilemma when he is placed under her care. Hassan {{revealed}} that her character is not [...] "thinking straight" [...] {{and even though it}} is her job to save lives, Lynsey can not decide if she should {{come to the aid of}} the person who attempted to kill her. Lynsey is not sure if Silas is genuinely ill. In March 2011, Hassan revealed that Silas would want revenge on Lynsey after her telling people that he is behind recent murders. Hassan told a reporter from All About Soap that Lynsey innocently buys diet pills for Cheryl off the internet but Silas sees this as an opportunity to seek revenge and switches them with his heart medication, leading to Cheryl collapsing in Chez Chez. Cheryl is found by Lynsey, who is terrified for Cheryl and feels guilty. Lynsey is told that Cheryl has sedatives in her system although she is [...] "completely flummoxed" [...] as to how this happened as she does not consider that Silas would have wanted to hurt Cheryl. Hassan explained that Silas plans to [...] "blacken" [...] Lynsey's name with the scheme. Rawle revealed that Silas would work on [...] "discrediting" [...] Lynsey and would undermine her because she is aware of his secret. He explained that Silas would do this by breaking into her flat and moving things around in the middle of the night, adding that [...] "it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of attrition" [...] with Silas planning to [...] "wear her down and send her mad".|$|E

At this council there was a good deal of discussion, since many of the Boers did not think the expedition wise--at any rate, if it was to be carried out on so large a scale. One of them, I forget which, an old man, pointed out that it might look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> party, {{and that it would be}} wiser if only five or six went, as they had done before, since then there could be no mistake as to the peaceful nature of their intentions.|$|E
60|$|The {{march of}} Pitt's policy went on; and the chasm between light and {{darkness}} deepened. Order was restored; and wherever order spread, there spread an anarchy more awful than {{the sun has}} ever looked on. Torture {{came out of the}} crypts of the Inquisition and walked in the sunlight of the streets and fields. A village vicar was slain with inconceivable stripes, and his corpse set on fire with frightful jests about a roasted priest. Rape became a mode of government. The violation of virgins became a standing order of police. Stamped still with the same terrible symbolism, the work of the English Government and the English settlers seemed to resolve itself into animal atrocities against the wives and daughters of a race distinguished for a rare and detached purity, and of a religion which makes of innocence the Mother of God. In its bodily aspects it became <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of devils upon angels; as if England could produce nothing but torturers, and Ireland nothing but martyrs.

60|$|Then an {{elephant}} trumpeted, {{and they all}} took it up for five or ten terrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and brought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and it sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> drum beaten {{at the mouth of}} a cave. The dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on, and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth. Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two or three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a shuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours, and Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the night air that the dawn was coming.|$|E
6000|$|Reading Pepys is thus {{like reading}} Montaigne, whose cheery scepticism his revelations recall. But Pepys {{has all the}} {{advantage}} of the man living in the busiest world over the recluse in that famed library, with the mottoes on the wall. Montaigne wrote in a retired and contemplative home, viewing life, as Osman Digna has viewed strife, [...] "from afar," [...] almost safe from the shots of fortune. But Pepys writes day by day, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> correspondent, {{in the thick of the}} battle; his head [...] "full of business," [...] as he declares; his heart full of many desires, many covetings, much pride in matters that look small enough. He notes how, by chewing tobacco, Mr. Chetwynde, who was consumptive, became very fat. He remarks how a board fell, and the dust powdered the ladies' heads at the play, [...] "which made good sport." [...] He records every venison-pasty, every flagon of wine, every pretty wench whom he encountered in his march through his youth towards the vault in St. Olave's. He is vexed with Mrs. Pepys and troubled by [...] "my aunt's base ugly humours." [...] He is [...] "full of repentance," [...] like the Bad Man in the Ethics, and thinks how much he is addicted to expense and pleasure, [...] "so that now I can hardly reclaim myself." [...] He interests himself in Dr. Williams's remarkable dog, which not only killed cats, but buried them with punctilious obsequies, never leaving the tip of puss's tail out of the ground. Then he goes to the play, [...] "after swearing to my wife that I would never go to the play without her." [...] He remembers one night that he passed [...] "with the greatest epicurism of sleep," [...] because he was often disturbed, and so got out of sleeping more conscious enjoyment. Now he sleeps what Socrates calls the sweetest slumber of all, if it be but dreamless, or, somewhere, he enjoys all new experience, with the lusty appetite of old.|$|E
