A {{tradition}} of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of homosexual activity in Greece. In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, movie theatres, public <b>lavatories</b> (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.|$|E

A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class <b>lavatories.</b> First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury <b>lavatories</b> were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E

Two tests were conducted: one involving a standard Boeing 747 <b>lavatory</b> and one involving a simulated DC- 10 cargo compartment. A production <b>lavatory</b> module was furnished with conventional materials and was installed in an enclosure. The ignition load was four polyethylene bags containing paper and plastic waste materials representive of a maximum flight cabin waste load. Standard aircraft ventilation conditions were utilized and the <b>lavatory</b> door was closed during the test. <b>Lavatory</b> wall and ceiling panels contained the fire spread during the 30 -minute test.

40|$|Section 5. 1 of the {{approved}} Waste Handling Plan for Demolition ofthe K- 25 and K- 2 7 Building Structures and Remaining Components Located at the East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (WHP) {{includes two}} Environmental Management Waste Management (EMWMF) waste lots: (1) Asbestos-contaminated roofing/transite; and (2) Construction debris, such as nonasbestos roofing, structural steel/miscellaneous metal/equipment, nonradiological piping, wood, and miscellaneous small quantities of concrete. This concurrence form adds an additional EMWMF waste lot 6. 47 for <b>lavatory</b> sink drains. Based on {{an analysis of}} the building structure characterization data, the only individual building structure with either an analytic carcinogenic or Hazard Index (HI) sum-of-fractions (SOF) greater than 1 is the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains (Table 1). The HI SOF for the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains is 1. 34 (Table 2). When all media are combined with the material of construction calculations, the HI SOF is 1. 22 (Table 3). However, when the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains are segregated from all other media, the HI SOF is only 0. 256, which is well below the EMWMF waste acceptance criteria SOF limit of 1 (Table 4). Given the large volume (124, 625 cubic yards) of other building structure media with a small HI SOF of 0. 256 and the small volume (one cubic yard) of <b>lavatory</b> sink drains with a large HI SOF of 1. 34, a separate waste lot for <b>lavatory</b> sink drains is recommended. Lead is the primary contributor to the large HI SOF in the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains. Lead in the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains was shown using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistically to have higher concentrations than all other building structure media combined. Other analytes having statistically different median concentrations in the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains compared to all other media are antimony, arsenic, boron, cadmium, selenium, solver, vanadium, zinc, mercury, strontium, and Uranium- 233 / 234 (Table 5). A separate waste lot for the <b>lavatory</b> sink drains minimizes the volume weighted sum-of fractions since a much smaller volume of waste will have the higher HI SOF of 1. 34, while a much larger volume of waste will have a small HI SOF of 0. 256...|$|R
