Reports have raised concerns about the analytical performance of some of these devices. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis using a novel approach to compare the accuracy and precision of POC HbA 1 c devices. Methods Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched in June 2015 for published reports comparing POC HbA 1 c devices with laboratory methods. Two reviewers screened articles and extracted data on bias, precision and diagnostic accuracy. Mean bias and variability between the POC and laboratory test were combined in a meta-analysis. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS 2 tool. Results Two researchers independently reviewed 1739 records for eligibility. Sixty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis of mean bias. Devices evaluated were A 1 cgear, A 1 cNow, Afinion, B-analyst, Clover, Cobas b 101, DCA 2000 /Vantage, HemoCue, Innovastar, Nycocard, Quo-Lab, Quo-Test and SDA 1 cCare. Nine devices had a negative mean bias which was significant for three devices. There was substantial variability in bias within devices. There was no difference in bias between clinical or <b>laboratory</b> <b>operators</b> in two devices.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Independent {{evaluation}} of angiographic images is becoming widely {{applied in the}} assessment of treatment outcomes of cerebral aneurysms. In the current study, we assessed the agreement between an independent core <b>laboratory</b> and the <b>operators</b> regarding angiographic appearance in a recent randomized, controlled trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were derived from the Cerecyte Coil Trial. Angiographic images of each coiled aneurysm, taken immediately after embolization and at 5 - to 7 -month follow-up, were evaluated by the operator at the treating center and by an independent neuroradiologist at the core laboratory. For the purpose of this study, images were interpreted on a 3 -point scale to provide uniformity for analysis; grade 1 : complete occlusion, grade 2 : neck remnant; and grade 3 : sac filling. "Unfavorable angiographic appearance" was defined as grade 3 at follow-up or interval worsening of grade between the 2 time points. RESULTS: The study included 434 aneurysms. Immediately after embolization, grade 3 was reported by operators in 39 (9 %) compared with 52 (12 %) by the core laboratory (P =. 159). On follow-up, grade 3 was reported by operators in 44 (10 %) compared with 81 (19 %) by the core laboratory (P <. 0001). Overall, operators noted unfavorable angiographic appearance in 78 (18 %) compared with 134 (31 %) by the core laboratory (P <. 0001). At every time point, agreement between the core <b>laboratory</b> and the <b>operators</b> was slight.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the AngioJet® coronary device, given the uncertain risk-benefit balance of rheolytic thrombectomy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Current risk of inadequate myocardial perfusion for thrombus embolization in primary coronary interventions is not negligible. The AngioJet thrombectomy device showed promising results in terms of safety and efficacy, but failed to confirm them in a large, multicenter, randomized trial, and the risk-benefit balance is still uncertain. METHODS: The AngioJet device was employed in 116 consecutive patients with AMI and angiographic evidence of extensive thrombosis in a vessel with a reference diameter > 2. 5 mm. Stents and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were liberally used. Epicardial and myocardial reperfusion angiographic parameters, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE, i. e., cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization) were assessed. RESULTS: The AngioJet was successfully used in all patients. Angiographic analysis showed that the AngioJet significantly improved epicardial coronary flow (p < 0. 01), frame count (p < 0. 01) and myocardial blush (p < 0. 01), while stenting yielded significant improvements only in diameter stenosis, minimum lesion diameter and correlated vessel parameters (p < 0. 01). In-hospital MACE were uncommon [9 (8 %) ], despite the patients' characteristics. When compared to an AMI population with similar thrombus burden but not undergoing thrombectomy, our AngioJet population showed significant improvement of reperfusion parameters. Moreover, there was greater AngioJet benefit in the high versus moderate thrombus burden subset; <b>laboratory</b> and <b>operator</b> experience also correlated significantly with final angiographic results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the favorable risk-benefit profile of AngioJet device use in selected patients with AMI when used in experienced laboratories and by trained operators...|$|R

In the present study, three laboratories from two different countries participated in a validation trial to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of a real time PCR assay in the detection and quantification of M. bovis from environmental samples. The sample panels consisted of negative badger faeces spiked with a dilution series of M. bovis BCG Pasteur and of field samples of faeces from badgers of unknown infection status taken from badger latrines in areas with high and low incidence of bovine TB (bTB) in cattle. Samples were tested with a previously optimised methodology. The experimental design involved rigorous testing which highlighted a number of potential pitfalls {{in the analysis of}} environmental samples using real time PCR. Despite minor variation between <b>operators</b> and <b>laboratories,</b> the validation study demonstrated good concordance between the three laboratories: on the spiked panels, the test showed high levels of agreement in terms of positive/negative detection, with high specificity (100 %) and high sensitivity (97 %) at levels of 10 (5) cells g(- 1) and above. Quantitative analysis of the data revealed low variability in recovery of BCG cells between <b>laboratories</b> and <b>operators.</b> On the field samples, the test showed high reproducibility both in terms of positive/negative detection and in the number of cells detected, despite low numbers of samples identified as positive by any laboratory.

Silver in situ hybridization (SISH) is an alternative technique to the {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) 2013 guidelines recommend both methods. The primary aim of this analysis is to evaluate the economical and organizational impact of adopting FISH or SISH methods for HER 2 testing. MethodsWe conducted an analysis to evaluate costs, staff times (laboratory working hours) and laboratory-space to process a sample using the manual method (FISH) compared to the automated system (SISH). The analysis was performed from the pathology laboratory perspective. We analysed the complete workflow (laboratory personnel and medical resource used) to perform the two tests (FISH and SISH) during pathology laboratory standard working days. The time required to test one sample was timed for each methodology separately and the pertaining costs were calculated. The working dimension of the two technologies and of the instruments needed was also measured. ResultsThe hands-on time for SISH was 80 % lower than for FISH and the dedicated space needed to carry out the SISH test was 45 % less than FISH. Finally, the costs of <b>laboratory</b> personnel (<b>operator</b> + pathologist) using an automated SISH system were lower than FISH (- 58 %).

The results of these proficiency panels demonstrate the ability of seven laboratories, located across three continents, to process PBMC samples and to rank volunteers with differential magnitudes of IFN-gamma ELISPOT responses. These findings also illustrate the ability to standardize the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay across multiple laboratories when common training methods, reagents such as fetal calf serum, and standard operating procedures are adopted. These results are encouraging for laboratories that are using cell-based immunology assays to test HIV vaccines and other vaccines...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe solve a convection–diffusion–sorption (reaction) {{system on}} a bounded domain with {{dominant}} convection using an operator splitting method. The model arises in contaminant transport in groundwater induced by a dual-well, or in controlled <b>laboratory</b> experiments. The <b>operator</b> splitting transforms the original problem to three subproblems: nonlinear convection, nonlinear diffusion, and a reaction problem, {{each with its}} own boundary conditions. The transport equation is solved by a Riemann solver, the diffusion one by a finite volume method, and the reaction equation by an approximation of an integral equation. This approach has proved to be very successful in solving the problem, but the convergence properties where not fully known. We show how the boundary conditions must be taken into account, and prove convergence in L 1,loc of the fully discrete splitting procedure to the very weak solution of the original system based on compactness arguments via total variation estimates. Generally, this is the best convergence obtained for this type of approximation. The derivation indicates limitations of the approach, being able to consider only some types of boundary conditions. A sample numerical experiment of a problem with an analytical solution is given, showing the stated efficiency of the method...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, the {{knowledge}} and understanding of wastewater treatment has advanced extensively and moved away from empirically based approaches to a fundamentally-based first principles approach embracing chemistry, microbiology, and physical and bioprocess engineering, often involving experimental laboratory work and techniques. Many of these experimental methods and techniques have matured to the degree that they have been accepted as reliable tools in wastewater treatment research and practice. For sector professionals, especially a new generation of young scientists and engineers entering the wastewater treatment profession, the quantity, complexity and diversity of these new developments can be overwhelming, particularly in developing countries where access to advanced level laboratory courses in wastewater treatment is not readily available. In addition, information on innovative experimental methods is scattered across scientific literature and only partially available in the form of textbooks or guidelines. This book seeks to address these deficiencies. It assembles and integrates the innovative experimental methods developed by research groups and practitioners around the world. Experimental Methods in Wastewater Treatment forms part of the internet-based curriculum in wastewater treatment at UNESCO-IHE and, as such, may also be used together with video records of experimental methods performed and narrated by the authors including guidelines on what to do and what not to do. The book is written for undergraduate and postgraduate students, researchers, <b>laboratory</b> staff, plant <b>operators,</b> consultants, and other sector professionals...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C vims (HCV) was {{discovered}} in 1989 and was identified as the causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Third-generation ELISA techniques, incorporating the use of antigens specific to all hepatitis C viral regions, are used to diagnose HCV infection by serum antibody determination. Rapid immunoblot assay (RIBA) testing identifies antibodies specific to structural and non-structural viral proteins. RT-PCR is established as the gold standard of HCV RNA detection. A positive result on the developed assays does not indicate that the hepatitis C virus is present and replicating. A confirmatory test is needed to assess current HCV status and to monitor treatment. The development of qualitative anti-HCV immunoglobulin G antibody tests is described in this study. A microtitre plate assay, suitable for multiple sample screening was optimised for use in standard laboratories. The rapid membrane-based assay, developed for use at point-of-care, requires no sample preparation. It is a user-friendly assay requiring no <b>laboratory</b> equipment or <b>operator</b> training. Both formats utilise bound synthetic peptides specific for non-structural and core regions of the HCV genome. Optimisation of assays was based on testing with characterised sera. Performance evaluation of the plate assay was carried out on 530 samples achieving 97. 9 % specificity and 93. 6 % sensitivity. A total of 751 samples evaluated on the rapid assay resulted in 99. 4 % specificity and 98. 9 % sensitivity...|$|R
