5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he {{described}} as a developed colony with an existing community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had {{put in charge of}} the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.|$|E

Evans was later cornered by police and <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> his death.|$|E

25|$|In April 1947, new {{producing}} {{oil wells}} were drilled near Iago {{on the southwest}} edge of the Boling salt dome. Soon after, other successful wells were drilled on the north, northeast, and south flanks of the structure. Between 1947 and 1951, the field's production <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> an average of 1 million barrels per year. At the end of 1952 there were 180 oil wells. In 1927, a sulphur-rich core sample was retrieved from the caprock {{and the production of}} sulphur began. From that year until 1952, about 38 million tons of sulphur were extracted from the Boling salt dome.|$|E
25|$|Miller has {{collected}} two Turkish traditions about {{the fall of}} Trebizond. One tells how {{the citizens of the}} city, expecting an army to arrive before dawn that would force the Sultan to lift the siege, agreed to surrender at cock-crow. However, on that occasion the roosters crowed in the small hours of the night, whereupon the Turks forced the city-dwellers to keep their word. The other describes how a girl, dressed in black, held out in the tower of the palace, and when all was lost, <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> her death from its heights; consequently that tower was called Kara kızın saray ("The Black Girl's palace").|$|E
25|$|Prior to the play, the Packers {{were leading}} the Seahawks 12–7.

On the final play of the game, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson unleashed a Hail Mary pass into the Packers end zone. Several Packers and Seahawks <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> catch the ball. As the players jumped, Packers safety M. D.

25|$|The Spurs {{had spent}} {{the second half of}} the 1980s as an also-ran, {{bottoming}} out in 1988–89 with a 21–61 record, the worst in franchise history at the time. While it was widely thought that the Spurs would become respectable again once Robinson arrived, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single season turnaround in NBA history at the time (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season). The Spurs <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA rookie of the year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled David Robinson's Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals placed Fedde on the 10-day {{disabled}} list on September 4 and recalled starting pitcher A. J. Cole from Syracuse, along with catcher Pedro Severino. Fedde was listed with a flexor strain {{in his right}} throwing arm, an injury expected to rule him out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Cole got the start on September 4 against the division rival Miami Marlins and earned the win in the 7−2 contest, in which Read notched his first career hit by chopping an infield single deflected off the glove of pitcher Jarlin García. Inserted in the ninth inning as a defensive substitute in left field, Alejandro De Aza <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> take a home run away from Marlins pinch-hitter Tyler Moore to end the game. Posting six shutout innings while leading the Nationals to a 2−1 victory over Miami on September 5, starter Stephen Strasburg set a new team record for consecutive innings without allowing a run, at 26. Washington finished off the series with an 8−1 rout of the Marlins, their eighth victory against their second-place division rival in a row, in front of a crowd Reuters estimated at fewer than 800 at first pitch on September 6, with Hurricane Irma bearing down on South Florida and an evacuation order in place. Rookie Dillon Peters, starting on the mound for the Marlins, received his first career decision with the loss. Zimmerman homered off Peters on a count of three balls and no strikes, the first time in his 12-year major league career he had notched a hit in that count.|$|E

500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately <b>leaped</b> <b>to</b> that conclusion when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his baby sister Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E
