5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also <b>less</b> <b>predictable</b> causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting <b>less</b> <b>predictable</b> than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has <b>less</b> <b>predictable</b> stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetrical gait {{patterns}} {{such as the}} gallop {{provide insight}} into the complexity of human locomotion. The nature of spontaneous (e. g., walk-run), quasi-spontaneous (e. g., gallop-walk), and intentional (e. g., walk-gallop) transitions was analyzed in 2 ways in the present study. In Analysis 1, the authors used step-wise regression to associate 10 physical characteristics with gait transitions. Transition predictability was moderate; thigh length best predicted 3 of 6 transitions. In Analysis 2, the dynamic characteristics of transitions (order parameters, phase shifts, multistability, and critical fluctuations) were described; those characteristics existed for all transition types. The results of the analyses suggest that intentional transitions are <b>less</b> biomechanically <b>predictable</b> than are spontaneous transitions and that transitions between gait pairs (e. g., walk-gallop and gallop-walk), regardless of velocity direction, have more in common than do transitions requiring specific intentio...|$|R

25|$|Many {{structural}} alloys corrode merely {{from exposure}} to moisture in air, but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result, methods to reduce {{the activity of the}} exposed surface, such as passivation and chromate conversion, can increase a material's corrosion resistance. However, some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and <b>less</b> <b>predictable.</b>|$|E

Previous studies of German GDP covering data until 1997 finds that revisions of real seasonally adjusted GDP are predictable. This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the revisions of real seasonal adjusted GDP, of nominal unadjusted GDP, of the seasonal pattern, and of the GDP deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the revisions of the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the revisions of the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, revisions of real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly <b>predictable</b> and <b>less</b> well <b>predictable</b> compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that revisions of seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R

After reviewing the history behind Welsh devolution, we examine survey evidence on public attitudes, demonstrating that though perceptions of the Assembly failing to improve many areas of life are widespread, opposition to devolution has fallen substantially since the referendum. These findings are reinforced by evidence from focus group research. Although such data indicate only limited public engagement with devolution, the principle appears widely accepted, with much support existing for giving the National Assembly greater powers. The final section of the paper constructs a multivariate model to explain variation in support for devolution. Attitudes to the principle of devolution appear well-defined (primarily by national identity, party attachments and generational differences), but differences in the level of devolution desired are much <b>less</b> readily <b>predictable.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|This {{premise is}} Porter’s work and perhaps his most {{significant}} contribution to the field of psychology. Based on his observations with clients and ongoing research into the results of his own psychometrics, he stated, “When we are free to pursue our gratifications, we are more or <b>less</b> uniformly <b>predictable,</b> but in the face of continuing conflict or opposition we undergo changes in motivations that link into different bodies of beliefs and concepts that are, in turn, expressed in yet different behavior traits.” [...] Porter’s description of the conflict sequence suggests that people experience changes in their motivation predictably and sequentially in up to three stages. The first stage characterized by a concern for one’s self, the problem and the other person; the second by a concern for one’s self and the problem and the third by a concern only for the self. The theory further states that the universal productive motive of behavior in conflict is to preserve personal integrity and self-worth.|$|R

25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} MP3 encoder can produce variable bitrate audio. MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it. VBR is used when {{the goal is}} to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is <b>less</b> <b>predictable</b> than with constant bitrate. Average bitrate is a type of VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread. The most evolved LAME MP3 encoder supports the generation of VBR, ABR, and even the ancient CBR MP3 formats.|$|E

When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as <b>less</b> <b>predictable.</b> Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the discussion surrounding involvement of interest groups {{in the political process}} on the European and global level. My purpose here is to examine how groups of interest can affect EU’s role as a global actor and find out which mode of lobbying regulation could strengthen Europe’s position in global governance. In this article, I am trying to bind concepts which at first glance might seem quite remote: groups of interests and global governance. By analyzing Europe’s position on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)  and the Trans-Pacifi c Partnership (TPP), I argue that European ambitions on international arena are undermined by innertensions. These tensions are mainly caused by discrepancy in positions of different groups of interest who try to infl uence the outcome of the political process and, thus, make it <b>less</b> stable and <b>predictable.</b> At the same time, adequate lobbying regulation could increase accountability and transparency and, therefore, help to overcome inconsistencies in EU’s position in global governance system. The results suggest that without proper backing from inside actors like business groups and civil society associations the EU will constantly wobble and will not be able to fully achieve its global goals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Determining a {{dialysis}} patient`s dry-weight is {{an exercise}} that oftentaxes the clinical judgement {{of even the most}} astute nephrologist. This is all the more true for CAPD, where undetected hyperhydration may be even more frequent than in hemodialysis, because patients treat themselves at home and the ultrafiltration volume is <b>less</b> well <b>predictable.</b> Therefore, a reliable and easily accessible biochemical marker for the detection of fluid overload would substantially enrichthe diagnostic manual. It has repeatedly been shown that in chronic hemodialysis patients, the plasma levels of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and of its second messenger cyclic GMP (cGMP) are markedly elevated. The levels of both substances fall during ultra- filtration and thus reflect the hydration state. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a particularly close relation between the postdialytic plasma cGMP level and the hydration state in chronic hemodialysis patients. There are only few data on ANP and cGMP levels in CAPD. We conducted the following study in order to determine ANP and cGMP levels in patients treated with CAPD, to compare them with the ones found in hemodialysis and to assess their value as markers of fluid overload...|$|R

Moreover, there was only a very small difference in the initial landing position on the target word as a function of predictability when the target words were fixated which is most parsimoniously explained by positing that a few programmed skips of the target word fell short of their intended target. These results suggest that low-level processing is primarily responsible for landing position effects in reading...|$|R
