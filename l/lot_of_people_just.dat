I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|Band {{publicist}} Derek Taylor told NME: [...] "A {{key factor}} in the breakdown {{had to be the}} Beach Boys themselves, whose stubbornness by [...] had seemingly twisted itself into a grim determination ... {{to get back to the}} old accepted, dumb formulas." [...] An unnamed observer told Gaines: [...] "... knowing that everyone in that group was married, and had children and a house. I think he [...] felt like more of a benefactor than an artist." [...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell." [...] Ultimately, Wilson put an end to the Smile project once he felt he did not have a [...] "commercial feeling about some of these songs ... Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them ... but a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> don't like it." [...] A replacement LP, Smiley Smile, [...] was released on September 18, 1967 to mixed reviews and the group's worst sales yet, becoming the first in a seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums. According to writer Scott Schinder, the album was released to [...] "general incomprehension.

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves.

2500|$|As {{of early}} 2017, Cardi B began {{publicly}} dating fellow American rapper Offset, {{of the southern}} hip hop group Migos, and the two quickly became a prevalent couple in the music industry.

[...] Cardi B and Offset became engaged on October 27, after Offset proposed to Cardi B at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, during the Power 99 Powerhouse concert. According to a report from TMZ, shortly after Offset and Cardi B became engaged, a handful of TV networks, including BET, VH1 and WE tv, began making offers for a nationally televised wedding special.|$|E

5000|$|He further {{describes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "third nature" [...] or telesthesia, where devices such as television and the telephone creates a platform which we use to communicate to people over large distances {{and not just a}} machine that we learn to operate individually.

It's no longer a case of making second nature out of nature, of building things and getting used to living in the world people build. I think it might be interesting to consider telesthesia to be something fundamentally different. What gets woven out of telegraph, telephone, television, telecommunications is not a second nature but what I call third nature.|$|E

It’s difficult, too, you know, because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have <b>just</b> discovered us, and they’re going to go on this record initially; but we didn’t want to make a record that was too ‘now’.
