500|$|Even {{with close}} friends, I don't believe in <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> hair down, confiding {{this and that}} and the other thing—saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep'... I believe you should keep your {{troubles}} to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts... reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way. When told that most Americans, even {{at the end of his}} career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, [...] "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Iconic" [...] {{talks about}} {{taking control of}} your life and <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> inner fire burn and {{encourages}} listeners to pursue their dreams. During the song, she urges the listeners to [...] "making [...] voices heard before someone does it for [...] " [...] with her voice [...] "echoing like the announcer in the ring." [...] In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that [...] "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," [...] while also inspiring the listeners {{to find their own}} greatness, singing: [...] "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." [...] Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he [...] "worked hard and sweated [...] tears." [...] He later proclames: [...] "I'm never falling again and if I did, I'll come back." [...] Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though you can call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E

500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is about <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E

The lyrics have motivational undertones, {{speaking}} of self-love and assurance, and referring to <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> hair down as a representation of this in parts like the line, [...] "Keep fighting until I get there, when I'm down and I feel like giving up/I whip my hair back and forth, I whip it, I whip it real good." ...|$|E
