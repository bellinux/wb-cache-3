This loose consistency may explain the lack of megablocks. Its total volume is about , less than the volume of the Mount St. Helens and Socompa deposits. It is comparable to the volume of the landslide that the Ancash earthquake triggered on Huascarán in Peru in 1970, resulting in more than 20,000 fatalities. Evidence points to previous flank collapses at Lastarria.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in <b>loose</b> <b>material.</b> As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E

This is the orbital {{distance}} inside of which <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> (e.g. regolith) on the surface of the satellite closest to the primary would be pulled away, and likewise material on the side opposite the primary will also be pulled away from, rather than toward, the satellite.|$|E
25|$|Arcing between tube {{elements}} {{can destroy}} the tube. An arc {{can be caused}} by applying voltage to the anode (plate) before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing excess current through a rectifier, which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.|$|E
25|$|The term {{diagenesis}} is used {{to describe}} all the chemical, physical, and biological changes, exclusive of surface weathering, undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition. Some of those processes cause the sediment to consolidate into a compact, solid substance from the originally <b>loose</b> <b>material.</b> Young sedimentary rocks, especially those of Quaternary age (the most recent period of the geologic time scale) are often still unconsolidated. As sediment deposition builds up, the overburden (lithostatic) pressure rises, and {{a process known as}} lithification takes place.|$|E

25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} formed when {{sediment}} is deposited out of air, ice, wind, gravity, or water flows carrying the particles in suspension. This sediment is often formed when weathering and erosion break down a rock into <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> in a source area. The material is then transported {{from the source}} area to the deposition area. The type of sediment transported depends on the geology of the hinterland (the source area of the sediment). However, some sedimentary rocks, such as evaporites, are composed of material that form at the place of deposition. The nature of a sedimentary rock, therefore, not only depends on the sediment supply, {{but also on the}} sedimentary depositional environment in which it formed.|$|E

500|$|Mount Adams {{was born}} in the mid to late Pleistocene and grew in several pulses of mostly lava-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was {{separated}} from one another by long periods of dormancy and minor activity, during which, glaciers eroded the mountain to below [...] Potassium-argon dating has identified three such eruptive periods; the first occurring 520,000to 500,000 years ago, the second 450,000years ago, and the third 40,000to 10,000 years ago. Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the volcano, consist of lava flows with little tephra. The <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> that makes up much of Adams' core is made of brecciated lava.|$|E

2500|$|A {{less severe}} glaciation, known as Bull Lake, started {{sometime}} between 160 and 130 thousand years ago. Bull Lake helped repair {{some of the}} damage of the Buffalo event by forming smaller glaciers which deposited <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> over the bedrock.

50|$|A debris cone is {{commonly}} made when rock from a high-up narrow slit or gorge {{falls into a}} ﬂat-ﬂoored valley. Here the soil and <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> are deposited, leaving a mound of conical shape. While an alluvial fan is formed when ﬂowing water rushes rock and soil down a slope, debris cones come from one of several dry processes known as mass wasting. That is gravity pulling <b>loose</b> <b>materials</b> downslope. Such mounds can reach sizes large enough to obstruct river channels. Similar deposits {{can also be found}} lying on boulders moved by a landslide, or on a glacier, where a cone-shaped mound of ice or snow may be covered with a veneer of debris thick enough to prevent the underlying ice from melting. A debris cone is also called a dirt cone or cone of detritus.|$|R

2500|$|Pope still {{insisted that}} he needed a gunboat to cover his {{projected}} landing on the Tennessee side of the river. Foote called two councils of war among his captains; in the first, on March 20, his decision not to risk running past the batteries was confirmed. When Halleck wrote to Foote, saying, [...] "Give him (Pope) all the assistance in your power," [...] Foote called a second council, on March 29. This time, Commander Henry Walke, captain of , thought that the risk was worth the candle, and volunteered to take his boat through. Foote gave the necessary orders, and Carondelet was prepared for the run. She was covered with rope, chain, and whatever <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> lay at hand. A coal barge filled with coal and hay was lashed to her side. Her steam exhaust was diverted from the smokestacks (called [...] "chimneys" [...] on river craft) to muffle the sound.

Sometimes {{it seemed as}} if the vessel were rushing against a mighty rock, that towered high above the masts, but this was only optical illusion, or, perhaps, a denser storm-cloud than usual passing by, for the steamer continued to plough her onward way unchecked, save, now and then, by the bursting on her bows of a monster billow, which caused her to quiver from stem to stern, and swept the decks with green seas fore and aft. One such sea had carried away part of the bulwarks, and swept overboard all the <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> on the decks. Presently, there was a slight diminution in the force of the seas.

60|$|At {{the end of}} an hour she again knocked softly at the door, {{carrying}} {{some light}} nourishment she had prepared for him. He was asleep, but she was astounded to find that in the interval he had managed to dress himself completely in his antiquated finery. It was a momentary shock to the allusion she had been fostering, but she forgot it in the pitiable contrast between his haggard face and his pomatumed hair and beard, the jauntiness of his attire and the collapse of his invalid figure. When she had satisfied herself that his sleep was natural, she busied herself softly in arranging the miserable apartment. With a few feminine touches she removed the slovenliness of misery, and placed the <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> and ostentatious evidences of his work on one side. Finding that he still slept, and knowing the importance of this natural medication, she placed the refreshment she had brought by his side and noiselessly quitted the apartment. Hurrying through the gathering darkness between decks, she once or twice thought she heard footsteps, and paused, but encountering no one, attributed the impression to her over-consciousness. Yet she thought it prudent to go to the galley first, where she lingered a few moments before returning to the cabin. On entering she was a little startled at observing a figure seated at her father's desk, but was relieved at finding it was Mr. Renshaw.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} curious groups of birds, the Megapodii, or mound-makers, is very {{abundant}} in the Moluccas. They are gallinaceous birds, {{about the size of}} a small fowl, and generally of a dark ashy or sooty colour, and they have remarkably large and strong feet and long claws. They are allied to the [...] "Maleo" [...] of Celebes, of which an account has already been given, but they differ in habits, most of these birds frequenting the scrubby jungles along the sea-shore, where the soil is sandy, and there is a considerable quantity of debris, consisting of sticks, shells, seaweed, leaves, &c. Of this rubbish the Megapodius forms immense mounds, often six or eight feet high and twenty or thirty feet in diameter, which they are enabled to do with comparative ease, by means of their large feet, with which they can grasp and throw backwards a quantity of material. In the centre of this mound, at a depth of two or three feet, the eggs are deposited, and are hatched by the gentle heat produced by the fermentation of the vegetable matter of the mound. When I first saw these mounds in the island of Lombock, I could hardly believe that they were made by such small birds, but I afterwards met with them frequently, and have once or twice come upon the birds engaged in making them. They run a few steps backwards, grasping a quantity of <b>loose</b> <b>material</b> in one foot, and throw it a long way behind them. When once properly buried the eggs seem to be no more cared for, the young birds working their way up through the heap of rubbish, and running off at once into the forest. They come out of the egg covered with thick downy feathers, and have no tail, although the wings are full developed.|$|E
