Children used the water drawn by the women {{to put out the}} fires. A flaming arrow landed in baby Richard Johnson's crib, but it was doused by his sister Betsy. Help arrived from Lexington and Boone Station, and the Indians retreated.|$|E
5|$|After a {{break in}} Cape Town, Coghlan and his wife left Kimberley for Bulawayo on 30 July 1900. There, they found the {{conditions}} to be very basic and the buildings, ramshackle. Nevertheless, the settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits, dances and musical and theatrical performances. Coghlan and his wife lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. A second child, a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age.|$|E

Later that year, their cousin, Fred Garrett, {{convinced}} the couple to leave the tobacco farm in Virginia and move to Maryland where Day Lacks could work at Bethlehem Steel in Sparrow's Point. Not <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> moved to Maryland, Garrett was called to fight in World War II. With the savings gifted to him by Garrett, Day Lacks was able to purchase a house at 713 New Pittsburgh Avenue in Turner Station.

5|$|Fingleton {{enlisted in}} the {{military}} during World War II and was eventually sent to work on media matters for Prime Minister John Curtin {{and one of his}} predecessors, Billy Hughes. After the war, Fingleton worked as a political correspondent in Canberra and commentated on cricket during the summer months in Australia and England. He was a prolific author, {{regarded as one of the}} finest and most stylish cricket writers of his time, producing many books. Fingleton was known for his forthright opinions and willingness to criticise, and his cricket reports were published by newspapers in several countries. He was known for his ongoing feud with Bradman—the pair repeatedly spoke out against one another's judgement and play on the field <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> retired.|$|E

25|$|The main {{criticism}} of the show as it wore on was a general belief that the show was growing stale. The same recurring characters and sketches were used week after week, <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> became tired. The Chicken Cannon became a popular segment early in the TV show's run, but kept being used every episode for years, becoming predictable and often repeating the same jokes.|$|E

25|$|The {{one major}} {{exception}} to mundane missions occurred in late 1944. Due to their garrisons {{on the various}} islands of the Aegean, the Germans had maintained control over the Aegean Sea <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> had lost {{other areas of the}} Mediterranean to Allied control. In late 1944, that changed as an Allied carrier task force moved into the area. Composed entirely of escort carriers, the task force wreaked havoc with German shipping in the area and re-asserted Allied dominance over the last remaining area of the Mediterranean still controlled by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Malachi {{was written}} {{to correct the}} lax {{religious}} and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with Elohim, it was not <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> had been restored {{to the land and}} to Temple worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.|$|E
25|$|Jim Murray {{left the}} group not <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> {{performed}} at the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. The band began a period of heavy touring on the West Coast of the United States where they built up a solid following and featured on many star-studded bills at the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore West. Sound engineer (and infamous LSD chemist) Owsley Stanley regularly recorded concerts at major San Francisco venues during this period, and his archive includes many Quicksilver Messenger Service live performances from 1966 and 1967, which were released on his Bear Recordings label in 2008 and 2009.|$|E

50|$|The {{long-term}} effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even <b>long</b> <b>after,</b> as <b>they</b> clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind. A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{determination}} to accomplish great victories Haig too often disregarded key factors such as weather, and the condition of the battlefield, placed his objectives beyond the range which his artillery could cover and incorporated in his schemes a role for cavalry which this arm was helpless to accomplish. These shortcomings, it needs to be stressed, were not at all peculiar to Haig.... But the outcome, too often, was British operations directed towards unrealizable objectives and persisted in <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> had ceased to serve any worthwhile purpose. The consequence was excessive loss of British lives, insubstantial accomplishment, and waning morale.|$|E
25|$|One widely {{accepted}} theory about {{the transformation of}} autonomous communities to chiefdoms is that an individual, or group of individuals must have used some degree of coercion to begin controlling others in their community. Stronger factions may have used coercion to force weaker factions to submit to their desires, {{and in order to}} do this they may have obtained their strength through a number of different ways. First, canny choices of farming plots allowed an individual or group of individuals to systematically gain an upper hand in crop production. Second, good alliance-building tactics may have been performed to stave off attacks by competing factions. And, lastly, healthy offspring would have ensured that an individual's lineage was secure for <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> were gone, allowing strong hereditary associations to control the fate of the dynasty.|$|E
25|$|People are not {{the only}} {{economic}} actors who are required to accept banknotes. In the late 20th century vending machines were designed to recognize banknotes of the smaller values <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> were designed to recognize coins distinct from slugs. This capability has become inescapable in economies where inflation has not been followed by introduction of progressively larger coin denominations (such as the United States, where several attempts to make dollar coins popular in general circulation have largely failed). The existing infrastructure of such machines presents one of the difficulties in changing the design of these banknotes to make them less counterfeitable, that is, by adding additional features so easily discernible by people that they would immediately reject banknotes of inferior quality, for every machine in the country would have to be updated.|$|E

25|$|Some {{international}} volunteer organizations {{define their}} primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty {{and improve the}} living standards {{of people in the}} developing world, (e.g. Voluntary Services Overseas has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported. Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One {{reason for this is that}} development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.|$|E
25|$|He argued infants were {{engaging}} {{in an act}} of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked. The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures {{to meet the demands of}} the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. To start out, the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not <b>long</b> <b>after,</b> <b>they</b> would pick up objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual development. The constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.|$|E
25|$|The world's oldest known {{depiction}} of a sternpost-mounted rudder {{can be seen on}} a pottery model of a Chinese junk dating from the 1st century AD during the Han Dynasty, predating their appearance in the West by a thousand years. In China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). Sternpost-mounted rudders started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, the Chinese continued to use the steering oar <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>they</b> invented the rudder, since the steering oar still had limited practical use for inland rapid-river travel. One of oldest known {{depiction of}} a stern-mounted rudder in China can be seen on a 2-foot-long tomb pottery model of a junk dating from the 1st century AD, during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). It was discovered in Guangzhou in an archaeological excavation carried out by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and Academia Sinica of Taiwan in 1958. Within decades, several other Han Dynasty ship models featuring rudders were found in archaeological excavations. The first solid written reference to the use of a rudder without a steering oar dates to the 5th century.|$|E
