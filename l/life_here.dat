5|$|The Sihanaka have a {{generally}} egalitarian social structure, with the eldest male {{at the head}} of the family. Traditional beliefs predominate, although Christianity has also had an influence. Social <b>life</b> <b>here,</b> as elsewhere in Madagascar, is guided by the principles of respect for the ancestors and the fady (taboos) established by them. Traditional social practices include complex funeral and divorce rites and a strong and continuing prohibition on working in paddy fields on Tuesdays.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant <b>life</b> <b>here</b> includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find work, Fisher and {{his brother}} emigrated to Queensland in 1885. Despite leaving Scotland, Fisher {{is said to have}} {{retained}} a distinctive Scottish accent {{for the rest of his}} <b>life.</b> <b>Here,</b> Fisher worked as a miner, first in Burrum and then in Gympie. He became an engine driver (a role involving the operation of machinery to raise and lower cages in the mine shaft) after attaining the necessary qualifications in 1891. In the same year, he was also elected as the president of an engine driver's union. He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union, becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891.|$|E

5|$|From September 1513 to 1516, under Pope Leo X, Leonardo {{spent much}} of his time living in the Belvedere in the Vatican in Rome, where Raphael and Michelangelo were both active at the time. In October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan. On 19 December, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna. Leonardo was {{commissioned}} to make for Francis a mechanical lion that could walk forward then open its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies. In 1516, he entered Francis' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé, now a public museum, near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise. He spent the last three years of his <b>life</b> <b>here,</b> accompanied by his friend and apprentice, Count Francesco Melzi, and supported by a pension totalling 10,000scudi.|$|E

After a pardon and his return from exile, Nichiren moved to Mt. Minobu in today's Yamanashi Prefecture, where he and his disciples built a temple, Kuon-ji.

500|$|Until 1901, Mahler's {{compositions}} {{had been}} {{heavily influenced by}} the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn ("The Youth's Magic Horn"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No.2, No.3 and No.4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional <b>life.</b> <b>Here,</b> the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No.5, No.6 and No.7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as [...] "more stern and forthright..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration".|$|E
500|$|In July 1938, deHavilland {{began dating}} {{business}} tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, {{who had just}} completed his record-setting flight {{around the world in}} 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, [...] "He was a rather shy man ... and yet, in a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn't do anything heroic in <b>life,</b> <b>here</b> was this man who was a real hero." [...] In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor's agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, but she felt that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life. [...] "John was a very great love of mine", she would later admit, [...] "He was a man I wanted to marry." ...|$|E

James Plath of DVD Town {{described it as}} [...] "funny," [...] and Brian Tallerico of UGO Networks considered it {{to be one of}} the season's best episodes, describing it as having [...] "some awesome road comedy." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide gave the episode a positive review as well, writing [...] "The life of the trucker, as made popular in C. W. McCall's 1976 hit single [...] "Convoy", is brought to <b>life</b> <b>here</b> in all its glory. For once, Homer is in the right and you cannot help but cheer as the truckers spectacularly fail to stop him getting to Atlanta." [...] They concluded by writing [...] "A nice, bonding story for Homer and Bart which is diametrically opposed to the one featuring Marge and Lisa." [...] On the other hand, giving the episode a more mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "If nothing else, 'Homerdrive' takes unanticipated paths. The eating contest leads to a long truck drives leads to that 'shocking secret'. All of this means the show manages to become pretty unpredictable." [...] However, he maintained that the episode is only [...] "sporadically" [...] funny, and that it [...] "doesn’t ever excel in that department – at least not in terms of the trucker story." [...] He enjoyed the episode's B-story more, because of its [...] "absurdity", however he criticized the inclusion of Gil in the episode, calling the character [...] "increasingly overused". Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News gave the episode a mixed review as well, writing that it [...] "may have been a fairly decent episode but for the fact that something similar was done (and done better) on King of the Hill." ...|$|E
