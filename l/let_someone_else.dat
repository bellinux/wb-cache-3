40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{exploring}} the Role of Succession Planning on effective Organisational work performance. A study {{was carried out}} in five public and private organisations in the Coast region. These organisations include, The NMB Kibaha branch, TTCL - Kibaha, Kibaha Education Centre, NSSF- Kibaha and Kibaha Independent Primary School. By using questionnaires and administering face - to - face interviews, relevant data were collected from which a critical analysis was conducted to bring about logical findings and study recommendations. The study revealed that, only about 20 percent of the organisations studied, practice Succession Planning Programmes. Many organisations in Tanzania find it difficulty to replace a key employee or manager when a vacancy or a job opening exists. Employees in many work organisations are not prepared or are rarely prepared to replace out going employees or managers. Many executives avoid preparing successors because they are afraid of becoming dispensable. They feel secure if no one can replace them. There are also primitive territorial instincts involved. Senior directors have worked hard to achieve their status and they feel a lot of ownership for their territory. Preparing someone to take over means facing the fact that, someday, they will have to lose one of their most beloved possessions, the job they have driven themselves so hard to win for so many years. When people achieve high office they can feel invincible, that no one could do the job better than they can do it, so making it unthinkable that anyone could replace them. Many senior executives also feel that they have reached the summit of their capability and aspirations. If there is nowhere else in the organisation for them to go, why prepare someone to take their place? Finally, developing a successor means <b>letting</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> learn those parts of the job that provide the most job satisfaction. Many executives identify so closely with their jobs that <b>letting</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> do parts of it feels like being put out to pasture before they are ready. People gain job satisfaction from making a valued contribution and that means doing the most important parts of their role. It is very common for executives to feel that they are working through people because they delegate fairly well, but they are really glorified "doers" because they reserve too much of the content of their work for themselves. Working through others more fully entails working oneself out of a job. It means being a catalyst,cilitator, coach and developer of others. Executives who fail to fully involve people in their work are actually not adding as much value to the organisation as they could do. Every executive should have dual responsibilities: to make sure today's work gets done but also to contribute to building the organisation of the future. Unfortunately, most organisations are caught up in short-tern thinking so that it is only today's results that matter. Some of the reasons why succession planning does not get done are similar to why the environment gets damaged; everyone is racing to meet short-term objectives regardless of how much the future is sacrificed. The philosophy that organisations should live longer than the people running them becomes practical when good Succession Plans are kept in place. Thus the long run objectives can be achieved when the required number and quality of people are available at all times. It's planning and implementation stages should be optimally organized. It is my expectation that this study will provide a challenging environment to those institutions without Succession Programmes to start employing these programmes to facilitate effective organisational work performanc...|$|R

For this, software developers have an interesting distributed, decentralized, and partition-tolerant data storage system right at their fingertips: distributed version control. Inspired by distributed version control, we have researched and developed a prototype for a scalable high-availability system called Distributed Media Versioning (DMV). DMV expands Git's data model to allow files to be broken into more digestible chunks via a rolling hash algorithm. DMV will also allow data to be sharded according to data locality needs, slicing the data set in space (subset of data with full history), time (subset of history for full data set), or both. DMV repositories {{will be able to}} read and to update any subset of the data that they have locally, and then synchronize with other repositories in an ad-hoc network. We have performed experiments to probe the scalability limits of existing version control systems, specifically what happens as file sizes grow ever larger or as the number of files grow. We found that processing files whole limits maximum file size to what can fit in RAM, and that storing millions of objects loose as files with hash-based names incurs disk space overhead and write speed penalties. We have observed a system needing 24 seconds to store a 6. 8 KiB file. We conclude that the key to storing large files is the break them into many small chunks, and that the key to storing many chunks is to aggregate them into pack files.
