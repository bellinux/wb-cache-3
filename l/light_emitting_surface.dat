Particularly interesting {{is the case of}} multiply images gravitational lenses, where differences in the brightness histories of the multiple images can reveal the presence of the microlensing particles and allow inferences about the quasar’s structure. The long brightness history measured for the Q 0957 quasar has been analyzed previously for information about the microlensing particles, and evidence for the existence of a cosmologically significant population of planetary mass particles has been reported.

40|$|In {{conventional}} luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) {{incident light}} is absorbed by luminophores and emitted isotropically. Most of the <b>emitted</b> <b>light</b> is trapped inside the LSC by {{total internal reflection}} and guided to solar cells at the edges. <b>Light</b> <b>emitted</b> towards the <b>surfaces,</b> however, is lost in the escape cone. Furthermore, when the luminophore <b>emits</b> <b>light</b> in its absorption range, light is lost due to reabsorption. To overcome these losses, we embed the luminescent material in photonic structures to influence the emission characteristics. Directional and spectral redistribution of emission is supposed to enhance the light guiding in LSCs and reduce reabsorption losses. For this purpose, we prepared opal films from PMMA colloids, in which Rhodamine B was embedded during the polymerization process. In direction-resolved luminescence measurements a strong dependence of the emitted spectrum on the detection direction was observed.

In this paper, we report a new method to produce large area periodical bowl-like micropatterns of single crystal ZnO through aqueous-phase epitaxial growth on a ZnO single crystal substrate. A self-assembled monolayer of polystyrene microspheres {{was used as}} a template to confine the epitaxial growth of single crystal ZnO from the substrate, while the growth morphology was well controlled by citrate anions. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} self-assembled monolayer of colloidal spheres plays an important role in reduction of the defect density in the epitaxial ZnO layer. Though the mechanism is still open for further investigation, the present result indicates a new route to suppress the dislocations in the fabrication of single crystal ZnO film.

30|$|The {{implementation}} of surface plasmon-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (SPFS) to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors enables increasing their sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. In SPR-based biosensors, surface plasmons probe the binding of target molecules {{contained in a}} liquid sample by their affinity partners attached to a metallic sensor surface. SPR biosensors relying on the detection of refractive index changes allow for direct observation of the binding of large and medium size molecules that produces sufficiently large refractive index changes. In SPR biosensors exploiting SPFS, the capture of fluorophore-labeled molecules to the sensor surface is observed by the detection of fluorescence <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> from the <b>surface.</b> This technique {{takes advantage of the}} enhanced intensity of electromagnetic field accompanied with the resonant excitation of surface plasmons.
