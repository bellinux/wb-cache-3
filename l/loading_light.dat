50|$|In essence PCDitch {{is a set}} of coupled {{ordinary}} differential equations. With {{more than}} 40 state variables and more than 400 parameters the model is considered fairly complex. The model describes a completely mixed water body comprising the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall nutrient cycles for nitrogen and phosphorus are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow, denitrification and burial). Inputs to the model are: water inflow, evaporation, nutrient <b>loading,</b> <b>light</b> intensity, water temperature, sediment characteristics and depth of the ditch. Six functional groups of water plants are modelled: floating-leaved plants, emerged plants, non-rooted floating plants, non-rooted submerged flowering plants, rooted submerged flowering plants, Charophytes, and one phytoplankton group. The default configuration of PCDitch does not take spatial heterogeneity into account. However, PCDitch can be coupled with spatial explicit hydrodynamical models to model networks of ditches.Although PCDitch is primarily used for Dutch ditches, the model can be applied to other non-stratifying freshwater ecosystems where competition between primary producers is a key determinant of ecosystem functioning, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made.PCDitch was calibrated with data of experimental ditches with sand and clay sediments that were exposed to different nutrient loading treatments. As phosphorus in PCDitch is related with aluminium, iron, lutum content (sediment particles smaller than 2 µm), porosity and organic matter content in de sediment, it is assumed that the model {{can also be used to}} describe peat ditches.|$|E

Several traditional approaches, like lambda-iteration and gradient method are utilized to find out the optimal solution of non-linear problem of economical dispatch. More recently, the soft computing techniques have received more attention and were used in a number of successful and practical applications such as economic dispatch. The main objectives of this thesis is to find solution for economic load dispatch problem so that the total fuel cost is minimized while satisfying the power generation limits.

The effect of various parameters, such as catalyst <b>loading,</b> <b>light</b> intensity, presence of inorganic ions, addition of hydrogen peroxide and pH, on the photocatalytic inactivation of E. coil was investigated. Photolysis alone had a small effect on inactivation while the dark experiment resulted in no inactivation and Ag/TiO 2 showed the maximum inactivation. At a catalyst loading of 0. 25 g/L, all the combustion synthesized catalysts showed better inactivation of E. coil compared to commercial Degussa P- 25 (DP- 25) TiO 2 catalyst. An improved inactivation was observed with increasing lamp intensity and addition of H 2 O 2. A negative effect on inactivation was observed by addition of inorganic ions such as HCO 3 -, SO 42 -, Cl-, NO 3 -, Na+, K+ and Ca 2 +. The photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli remained unaltered at different pH of the solution.

40|$|Twenty {{years after}} model {{equations}} describing the in situ {{growth rates of}} phytoplankton were first devised and eight since their successful incorporation into a computer simulation was first published, {{we set out to}} affirm the general validity and utility of PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental Change). Elaborated originally for commercial purposes, PROTECH {{has been shown to be}} capable of simulating simultaneous seasonal fluctuations in the standing crops of several contrasting species of alga, making it attractive for testing the impacts of various simulated management of the growth conditions. These have been sufficiently convincing to persuade us to use PROTECH as a research tool; over a number of years, it has been used to simulate such ‘traditional’ problems of ecology as succession, competitive exclusion and species diversity, in the context of intermediate disturbance. In this paper, we review critically the workings of the model, especially how complex but consistent outcomes emerge in compliance with simple trait-based rules of community assembly. We affirm that temperature-specific growth rates of algae are strongly influenced by algal morphology, that slender species are tolerant of low average light exposure and that periodicity is related to species-specific characteristics of motility and buoyant behaviour. The results of some applications of PROTECH are presented, simulating responses of the phytoplankton community to adjustments in nutrient <b>loading,</b> <b>light</b> penetration and hydrological flushing rates; an explicit investigation of the sensitivity of population responses of Cyanobacteria to eutrophication is also reported, in the context of varying availabilities of combined inorganic nitrogen. Considering future developments of PROTECH, we affirm the virtues of its central growth equations; we anticipate that future applications will mostly depend upon improved representation of the physical environments it is sought to simulate and that these may more frequently relate to aquatic systems other than the lakes and reservoirs for which it was originally devised...|$|E

Experimental results from competition reactions {{indicate that there}} is a marked difference in kinetic behaviours between the systems with (heterogeneous) and without (homogeneous) a TiOdollar 2 dollar suspension, which confirms that the reaction pathway of dollar·dollarOH radicals in the TiOdollar 2 dollar suspension is at least partly heterogeneous. A photocatalytic mechanism is proposed.;A method of determining the trapping efficiency of dollar·dollarOH radicals was developed {{with the help of a}} spin trap/EPR method, using the spin trap 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), for the measurement of growth rates of the spin adduct DMPO-OH and HPLC measurement for the dollar·dollarOH radical generation rates. The agreement of the trapping efficiency (0. 33 dollar±dollar 0. 04) in the homogeneous (dollar H 2 O 2 dollar) system with the literature value (0. 35) confirms the reliability of the measurement method. The trapping efficiency in the heterogeneous (TiOdollar 2 dollar) system was found to be 0. 28 dollar±dollar 0. 03.;A method for quantum yield determinations in heterogeneous systems was developed, based on the measurements of dollar·dollarOH radical generation rates and the flux of absorbed photons by TiOdollar 2 dollar suspensions. In this procedure a modified integrating sphere method was used for the measurement of the absorbance of TiOdollar 2 dollar suspensions. A ferrioxalate chemical actinometer was used to measure the flux of absorbed photons.

40|$|Working {{electrodes}} or photoanodes of dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSCs) {{play a vital role}} in dye <b>loading,</b> <b>light</b> harvesting, electron transport and thus the overall photovoltaic performance. With high surface area, superior light scattering and controllable pore sizes and diameters, mesoporous TiO 2 beads have shown promising applications in DSCs and were employed as the major material for the studies in this thesis. Due to the unique hierarchical structure of TiO 2 beads, a 'building block' concept has been developed by Cheng's group. These 'building blocks' could be pretreated and thus enhance light harvesting and electron transport properties. In the first part of this work, TiO 2 beads were subject to a pre-sintering process to enhance inter-particle contacts within each bead and photoanodes constructed with the beads were compressed in a cold isostatic press (CIP) to enhance the contacts between beads in the films. Detailed studies were carried out to investigate the effect of presintering temperature and CIP pressure on properties such as bead morphology, diffuse reflectance, electron transport, and thus the photovoltaic performance of flexible DSCs. The 100 MPa pressed film made of 650 °C pre-sintered beads was found to achieve the highest conversion efficiency (6. 7 %), attributing to strong interparticle and inter-bead connections. Secondly, a novel pre-sensitizing technique was designed to prepare both bilayered and mix type photoanodes on flexible substrates using TiO 2 beads. The pre-sensitizing technique was first time developed to prepare multilayered photoanodes for flexible DSCs in order to enhance the light harvesting and thus the photovoltaic performance. An overall energy conversion efficiency of 6. 1 % was achieved with multilayered photoanodes consisting of a N 719 sensitized bottom layer and a N 749 pre-sensitized top layer. Besides, the effect of bead pore sizes and diameters on the diffusion of cobalt-complexes redox couple and the photovoltaic performance of glass based DSCs were investigated. The mass transport of the cobalt redox electrolyte was greatly improved by increasing pore size of the beads and an overall conversion efficiency of 8. 5 % was achieved. In the final chapter, a simple compression process was employed in the preparation of photoanodes on glass. Enhancements in device performance were observed with compressed photoanodes using both P 25 and highly crystalline TiO 2 aggregates, which was mainly because of densely packed particles with well-developed interparticle connections that allow faster charge transports. Overall, an efficiency of 9. 5 % was achieved for the device with compressed photoanodes using TiO 2 aggregates...|$|E
40|$|My {{original}} contribution to knowledge is the successful application of two modelling paradigms 1) SALMO-PLUS process based model and 2) HEA data driven model to tropical lakes of different morphometry and trophic status. The application of SALMO-PLUS to tropical lakes involves utilising the SALMO-OO model structure for optimisation. This {{was followed by}} multi objective parameter optimisation on selected parameters to seek the optimum parameter values that can model the algal dynamics and state variables fluctuations in the tropical lakes to an acceptable magnitude and peaks. SALMO-PLUS is another version SALMO-OO with capability to run optimisation by means of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method. SALMO-OO {{has been used as}} a research tool over a number of lakes with different trophic states and mixing conditions to simulate algal succession and respond to ecosystem dynamic. SALMO-OO is driven by process-based differential equations and works by utilizing a library of three phytoplankton growth and three grazing process models. Evolutionary algorithms (EA) are bio-inspired adaptive methods which mimic processes of biological evolution, natural selection and genetic variation such as cross-over and mutation to develop solutions to complex computational problems (Recknagel et al, 2006). HEA is designed for rule discovery in water quality timeseries (Cao et al., 2006 b) and is capable of forecasting potential algal population dynamics and outbreaks in water bodies. The SALMO-PLUS model was applied for simulating the state variables of selected lakes (Lake Kenyir, Lake Penang, Saidenbach Reservoir, Roodeplaat Dam and South Para Reservoir). Measured data from the year 2005 and 1992 were used for Lake Penang and Lake Kenyir respectively. The HEA was applied for predicting the Chl-a and algal biovolume abundance on tropical lakes (Lake Putrajaya, Lake Penang and Lake Kenyir) in Malaysia. This study discusses the application of SALMO-PLUS and HEA towards tropical lakes eutrophication management. The results of application of SALMO-PLUS on tropical lakes are presented, simulating response of the phytoplankton community to fluctuation in nutrient <b>loading,</b> <b>light</b> availability and hydrological aspect in the water bodies. Results of applying HEA on tropical lakes are also interpreted in the context of empirical and causal knowledge on Chl-a and algal biovolumes dynamics under tropical lake water quality conditions by means of rule-based model. Results for both Lake Kenyir and Penang showed that SALMO-PLUS were able to predict annual average trends not only for chlorophyll-a but also other state variables and algal functional groups. Simulated state variables namely Chl-a, N and P showed good agreement with field observations data for both lakes. Despite the fact that this is the first time SALMO-PLUS been used for tropical lakes and the limited data availability from this region, the simulated values of biological and nutrient state variables match reasonably with measured data. Outcomes from SALMO-PLUS simulation show consistent compliance with algal community assembly obtained from other researchers. The HEA achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting timing and magnitudes of algal blooms up to 7 -days-ahead. The HEA proved to be most efficient in modelling and predicting seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and algal biovolumes. A sensitivity analysis conducted for Lake Penang revealed that algal abundance is not only driven by physical and chemicals characteristics of the water body but also by impact of inorganic substances in the water that contributes to high level of chemical oxygen demand in the water as well. In addition, this study has successfully implemented a new process model from Law et al. (2009) consisting algal growth, algal grazing, zooplankton growth and zooplankton mortality functions into the SALMO-OO simulation library. Combination of this new process models were tested on dataset from Lake Kenyir, Lake Penang, Saidenbach Reservoir and Roodeplaat Dam within the simulation library to discover the optimal model structures for respective water bodies. Even though the new process model was not selected in complete totality as the optimal model structure for any of the test lakes, the addition has added another alternative for water body simulation in SALMO-OO process library. Based on these forecasting results, both SALMO-PLUS and HEA have showed potential for utilisation in early warning and strategic control of algal blooms in tropical freshwater lakes. The generic nature of HEA forecast model was also observed when tested for forecasting algal biovolume for merged data of similar lake ecosystem category. Results from merged Lake Kenyir and Lake Penang data showed reasonable accuracy in predicting the timing and magnitudes of algal blooms up to 7 -days-ahead. Addition of the new process model from Law et al. (2009) into the SALMO-PLUS simulation library has also expanded the alternative for lake category simulation to give a more comprehensive decision support tool for lake and reservoir management. This study has also affirmed the generality and flexibility of SALMO-PLUS for usage in tropical lakes modelling. SALMO-PLUS was observed to be capable of simulating simultaneous seasonal fluctuations in algal growth and nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) making it valuable for forecasting the impacts of various simulated scenarios for various lake management regimes.

The loss characteristics of a switching IGBT, such as turn-off switching loss due to the tail current under either ZVS or ZCS condition is defined as an important factor that limits {{the efficiency of the}} converter, especially in small size power supplies used at high operation switching frequency.
