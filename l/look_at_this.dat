5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|A fresh <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> concept {{started at}} ARPA around 1963–64 {{under the name}} Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E

25|$|A common {{criticism}} of full cutoff lighting fixtures {{is that they}} are sometimes not as aesthetically pleasing to <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> <b>This</b> is most likely because historically {{there has not been a}} large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures, and because people typically like to see the source of illumination. Due to the specificity with their direction of light, full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect.|$|E

This man, Hector Mitchell, was made the chair of this committee, comprising three others including the Mayor of Kingston.

It had been said that Lecesne had sold arms to an insurrection in St George and {{that the two of them}} kept correspondence with people in Haiti for treasonable purposes.|$|E
25|$|On the March 3, 2006, {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Animal {{teamed up with}} Matt Hardy to face MNM. After he and Hardy lost the match, Animal turned heel {{for the second time}} in his career by attacking and {{injuring}} Hardy's knee. Animal reasoned that he had realized that Hardy and Heidenreich were screw-ups and that Road Warrior Hawk was the only tag team legend and partner for him. After the heel turn, Animal, once again known simply as The Road Warrior, would drop many aspects of the well-known Road Warrior gimmick, losing the face paint, and shoulder pads. Animal's <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time was similar to his old Road Warrior gimmick in the early 1980s he had prior to teaming up with Hawk.|$|E

25|$|In the Torah the Israelites are {{commanded}} to dye one of {{the threads}} of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds {{to the color of}} the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.|$|E

His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, and we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and {{what is he doing}} here?'

500|$|The group {{begins with}} [...] (Gloomy premonitions of what {{must come to}} pass), in which a man kneels in the {{darkness}} with outstretched arms. The following plates describe combat with the French, who—according to art critic Vivien Raynor—are depicted [...] "rather like Cossacks, bayoneting civilians", while Spanish civilians are shown [...] "poleaxing the French." [...] Plates 31 to 39 focus on atrocities and were produced on the same batch of plates as the famine group. Others are based on drawings Goya had completed in his Sketchbook-journal, in studies where he examined {{the theme of the}} grotesque body in relation to the iconography of the tortured or martyred one. In his India ink wash drawing We cannot <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> (1814–24), he examined the idea of a humiliated inverted body with pathos and tragedy, as he did to comical effect in [...] (1791–92).|$|E
500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've got to take another <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> situation".|$|E

500|$|Goya's {{series of}} {{aquatint}} etchings The Disasters of War (...) was not completed until 1820, {{although most of}} the prints were made in the period 18101814. [...] The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the British Museum, provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed. The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as I saw this, which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa. [...] (One cannot <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this)</b> is clearly related compositionally and thematically; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.|$|E
500|$|Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone {{cited the}} episode {{as an example}} of the series' decline. Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices wrote [...] "I have to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> special like the 'Friend or Foe?' special. While 'WhoBob WhatPants?' works well as a regular story for SpongeBob SquarePants, I'm not entirely {{convinced}} that it deserved to be hyped up as a special. While this story had the potential to be 'special material,' it just didn't materialize in the final produced product." [...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said, [...] "It makes me sad to think about how something so pleasurable has declined into something so tedious." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "With a laugh-skimpy script, 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' may be confirming a trend I noticed back with the last original SpongeBob toon to get its own disc release, Pest of the West: SpongeBob shorts are starting to get tired. And 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' is even less funny than 'Pest of the West'," [...] adding the episode was [...] "Not a good sign." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us one last <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> quirky {{group of people in}} their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E
