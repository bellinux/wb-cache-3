It is sometimes intended as a pejorative, bearing the implication that the scarce medical research resources allocated to develop such drugs were spent frivolously when {{they could have been}} better spent researching cures for more serious medical conditions. Proponents, however, point out that improving the patient's subjective quality of life has always been a primary concern of medicine, and argue that these drugs are doing just that.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of the birth control pill from contraceptive technology to a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>drug</b> over the past fifty years. Drawing from biomedicalization theory, I suggest that contraception is one of many areas of life that have become subject to medical intervention, and use the pill to illustrate how contemporary health is characterized by a shifting landscape of privatization and commodification, new sources of information and knowledge, and an emphasis on optimization of the body. First, I conducted a critical discourse analysis of popular media texts related to the birth control pill in order to highlight problematic themes that characterize dialogue surrounding the pill. Secondly, these issues were compared with the results that emerged from a series of interviews with women who have taken the pill. Through exploring both the public and private realms, I argue that the pill is an agent of both biomedicalization and of gender performativity, and articulate the ways that this important pharmaceutical development enforces hegemonic standards of femininity...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the roles and perceptions of general practitioners (GPs) in the management of erectile dysfunction (ED). This qualitative study used focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. This study was conducted based on 28 GPs from an urban area in Malaysia who had managed patients with ED and prescribed anti-ED drugs. Main outcome measures included the roles of GPs in managing patients with ED (active or passive), perceptions regarding ED and the treatment, and factors influencing their decision to prescribe. Majority of the GPs assumed a passive role when managing patients with ED. This was partly due to their perception of the disease being nonserious. Some also perceived ED as mainly psychological in nature. The anti-ED drugs were often viewed as a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>drug</b> with potentially serious side effects. The fear of being perceived by patients as 'pushing' for the drug and being blamed if the patients were to develop serious side effects also hampered the management of this disease. GPs who participated in this study remained passive in identifying and treating patients with ED and this was attributed to their perception of the disease, drug treatment and patient's background...|$|E

40|$|Lifestyle {{drugs are}} used to {{alleviate}} or enhance: 1. lifestyle problems or conditions, regardless of the cause; and 2. health problems for which the underlying cause is {{in the realm of}} personal responsibility. It is the particular use of a drug, rather than its inherent properties, that determines whether it is called a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>drug.</b> The increasing availability of, and high demand for, lifestyle drugs contributes to their expanding role in healthcare. In the absence of objective pharmacoeconomic data, the subjective value or cost effectiveness of these agents varies among patients, medical professionals, regulatory agencies and payors. Most nations rely on value systems that are implied, rather than clearly articulated. The aims of largely institutional payors, and the individual patients and their physicians do not always coincide, creating tensions over who should pay for these drugs. Cost-sharing between patient and payer, drug limitations and prior authorisation protocols are some methods used to manage access to these drugs. There is an urgent need to formulate coherent values, priorities and strategies for dealing with lifestyle drugs. To do this, local and national regulatory agencies, politicians, healthcare providers, insurers and patients need to formulate broad areas of consensus.

40|$|The article {{introduces}} the research behind {{the making of}} Viagratool. org, the Lay Decision Support System on the World Wide Web. Viagratool. org is a 'web knowledge instrument' made to provide realities about a drug, available by searching, form-filling, online prescription, e-commerce and the post. Collaborative filtering, made famous by the disciples of Vannevar Bush, is used to ascertain information about Viagra. As we found {{with the aid of}} a group of collaborative filterers, Viagra comes across on the Web as a party drug, with distinct user groups [...] clubbers, sex tourists and others [...] not addressed by more official information providers [...] regulatory bodies, the medical industry or the manufacturer. Presented here are the findings that have led to two versions of the support system, one for the potential Viagra consumer, and another for the often overlooked second and third parties caught up in 'Viagra situations'. In the first system, the collaborative filters found and kept information about its marketing (and re-selling), its serious harm in cocktail dosages, and insider accounts provided by seasoned aphrodisiac and other <b>lifestyle</b> <b>drug</b> users. The information is displayed in thought trajectories, each asking whether to consume it, from different angles. Importantly, the system is not a consumer-to-consumer information service or pure cohort support service. Rather, it allows a consumer to hear about Viagra from the marketeer, the emergency room medic, the humorist, and the user of Viagra and Viagra substitutes. Each could play a part in the Viagra decision. In the second version, we present Viagra situations, quite remote from the placid beach scenes with loving couples (on the Pfizer website), or a jogging Bob Dole, as seen on TV. Here, we move closer to employing the Web as an anticipatory medium by first resurrecting the second parties in Viagra situations, different from those in 'normal, loving' relationships.

40|$|Background Child and {{adolescent}} obesity is increasingly prevalent, {{and can be}} associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences. Objectives To assess the efficacy of <b>lifestyle,</b> <b>drug</b> and surgical interventions for treating obesity in childhood. Search strategy We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library Issue 2 2008, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, DARE and NHS EED. Searches were undertaken from 1985 to May 2008. References were checked. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lifestyle (i. e. dietary, physical activity and/or behavioural therapy), drug and surgical interventions for treating obesity in children (mean age under 18 years) with or without the support of family members, with a minimum of six months follow up (three months for actual drug therapy). Interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook. Where necessary authors were contacted for additional information. Main results We included 64 RCTs (5230 participants). Lifestyle interventions focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour in 12 studies, diet in 6 studies, and 36 concentrated on behaviorally orientated treatment programs. Three types of drug interventions (metformin, orlistat and sibutramine) were found in 10 studies. No surgical intervention was eligible for inclusion. The studies included varied greatly in intervention design, outcome measurements and methodological quality. Meta-analyses indicated a reduction in overweight at 6 and 12 months follow up in: i) lifestyle interventions involving children; and ii) lifestyle interventions in adolescents with or without the addition of orlistat or sibutramine. A range of adverse effects was noted in drug RCTs. Authors' conclusions While there is limited quality data to recommend one treatment program to be favoured over another, this review shows that combined behavioural lifestyle interventions compared to standard care or self-help can produce a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in overweight in children {{and adolescent}}s. In obese adolescents, consideration should be given to the use of either orlistat or sibutramine, as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions, although this approach needs to be carefully weighed up against the potential for adverse effects. Furthermore, high quality research that considers psychosocial determinants for behaviour change, strategies to improve clinician-family interaction, and cost-effective programs for primary and community care is required...|$|E

40|$|The public {{perception}} of selenium has changed significantly over the last decades. Originally mainly known for its high toxicity, it was later recognized as an essential trace element and is now (despite its narrow therapeutic window) almost being marketed as a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>drug.</b> Indeed, some clinical and preclinical studies suggest that selenium supplementation may be beneficial in {{a large number of}} clinical conditions. However, its mode of action is unresolved in most of these cases. At present, our main focus in the laboratory is the synthesis and evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of selenium-containing compounds. With the aim of develop new anticancer drugs and clarify its mechanisms of action and taking into account the results obtained in previous studies, twenty new derivatives that contain this trace element have been synthesized. All of them have been screened for their cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities against a panel of five human tumor cell lines: breast adenocarcinoma (MCF- 7), colon carcinoma (HT- 29), lymphocytic leukemia (K- 562), hepatocarcinoma (Hep-G 2) and prostate cancer (PC- 3) as well as the non-malignant mammary gland cell line MCF- 10 A. These cell lines represent common cancer tumor types. Regardless of the type of tumor cell, several common features have been observed in the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. Among the cancer cell lines tested, MCF- 7 and HT- 29 are the most susceptible ones, with GI 50 values in the nanomolar range. Comparison of the results with the cytotoxicity values for the standard drugs show that of the compounds had GI 50 values lower than those found for doxorubicin, nine lower than those obtained for etoposide and lower than those observed for taxol in MCF- 7 cells. The biological activities of the designed compounds confirm our hypothesis that molecular symmetry and the presence of a selenomethyl moiety is a valid approach to obtain potent new antitumor agents. A wide variety of biological assays have also been performed in order to elucidate a possible mechanism of action of some of the derivatives. These assays include in vitro studies, as the determination of the effects cell cycle distribution, apoptosis induction, protein kinases inhibitory activity, effects on selenoprotein expression, effects on cancer stem cells (CSCs) viability and maintennace; and in vivo studies, with the aim of finding new active drugs for cancer treatment. In summary, this study validates our initial strategy of designing organoselenium compounds with particular chemical characteristics that may therefore confer antitumor activity. The strategy of narrowing down a large number of potentially active compounds based on their biological properties have led to the identification of one organoselenium compound as the most active antitumor compound. This novel multikinase drug affects strongly PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways in human solid tumors, which probably would prevent the negative feedbackloops secondary to mTOR inhibition. We have demonstrated that it is an inducer of G 0 /G 1 arrest, accompanied by an induction of both autophagy and apoptosis. Moreover, the lead compound of this series {{is one of the few}} identified compounds that targets the number, size and self-renewal capacity of CSCs grown in spheres and alters expression of ALDH, ABCG 2, CD 44 and CD 133. This compound also exhibits promising single-agent antitumor activity in vivo in a molecularly relevant human prostate cancer model, without associated toxicity. Although the precise mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of this compound is not yet fully understood, our preclinical findings suggest that it could be a valuable compound in the treatment of patients displaying aberrant activation of PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling cascades...|$|E
