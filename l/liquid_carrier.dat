40|$|This is {{a summary}} for work {{performed}} under cooperative agreement DE FC 36 04 GO 14006 (Design and Development of New Carbon-based Sorbent Systems for an Effective Containment of Hydrogen). The project {{was directed to}} discover new solid and liquid materials that use reversible catalytic hydrogenation as the mechanism for hydrogen capture and storage. After {{a short period of}} investigation of solid materials, the inherent advantages of storing and transporting hydrogen using liquid-phase materials focused our attention exclusively on organic <b>liquid</b> hydrogen <b>carriers</b> (<b>liquid</b> <b>carriers).</b> While <b>liquid</b> <b>carriers</b> such as decalin and methylcyclohexane were known in the literature, these carriers suffer from practical disadvantages such as the need for very high temperatures to release hydrogen from the carriers and difficult separation of the carriers from the hydrogen. In this project, we were successful in using the prediction of reaction thermodynamics to discover <b>liquid</b> <b>carriers</b> that operate at temperatures up to 150 C lower than the previously known carriers. The means for modifying the thermodynamics of <b>liquid</b> <b>carriers</b> involved the use of certain molecular structures and incorporation of elements other than carbon into the carrier structure. The temperature decrease due to the more favorable reaction thermodynamics results in less energy input to release hydrogen from the carriers. For the first time, the catalytic reaction required to release hydrogen from the carriers could be conducted with the carrier remaining in the liquid phase. This has the beneficial effect of providing a simple means to separate the hydrogen from the carrier...|$|R

40|$|Ferrofluids {{containing}} γ-Fe 2 O 3 /Ni 2 O 3 nanoparticles (not chemically treated) were synthesized using {{water and}} mixed water–glycerol as <b>carrier</b> <b>liquid</b> and the ferrofluid viscosity was modified by varying the glycerol {{content in the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>liquid.</b> The apparent magnetization of the ferrofluids decreased with increasing glycerol content. The loss in magnetization is described by the ratio of effective magnetic volume fraction to physical volume fraction of nanoparticles in the ferrofluids as a characteristic parameter. We ascribe the loss {{to the formation of}} “dead aggregates” having a ring-like structure of closed magnetic flux rather than to any chemical reaction. Such dead aggregates exist in zero magnetic field and do not contribute to the magnetization in the low or high field regime, so that the effective magnetic volume fraction in the ferrofluids decrease. An increase in <b>carrier</b> <b>liquid</b> viscosity is similar to a weakening of the thermal effect, so the number of dead aggregates increases and the magnetization decreases in inverse proportion to the viscosity. This relationship between the apparent magnetization and ferrofluid <b>carrier</b> <b>liquid</b> viscosity can be termed the “viscomagnetic effect”...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Collagen barrier {{membranes}} {{were first}} introduced to regenerative periodontal and oral surgery to prevent fast ingrowing soft tissues (ie, epithelium and connective tissue) into the defect space. More recent attempts have aimed at combining collagen membranes with various biologics/growth factors {{to speed up}} the healing process and improve the quality of regenerated tissues. Recently, a new formulation of enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system (Osteogain) has demonstrated improved physico-chemical properties for the adsorption of enamel matrix derivative to facilitate protein adsorption to biomaterials. The aim of this pioneering study was to investigate the use of enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system in combination with collagen barrier membranes for its ability to promote osteoblast cell behavior in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Undifferentiated mouse ST 2 stromal bone marrow cells were seeded onto porcine-derived collagen membranes alone (control) or porcine membranes + enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system. Control and enamel matrix derivative-coated membranes were compared for cell recruitment and cell adhesion at 8 hours; cell proliferation at 1, 3, and 5 days; and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 3 and 14 days for genes encoding Runx 2, collagen 1 alpha 2, alkaline phosphatase, and bone sialoprotein. Furthermore, alizarin red staining was used to investigate mineralization. RESULTS: A significant increase in cell adhesion was observed at 8 hours for barrier membranes coated with enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system, whereas no significant difference could be observed for cell proliferation or cell recruitment. Enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system significantly increased alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels 2. 5 -fold and collagen 1 alpha 2 levels 1. 7 -fold at 3 days, as well as bone sialoprotein levels twofold at 14 days postseeding. Furthermore, collagen membranes coated with enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system demonstrated a sixfold increase in alizarin red staining at 14 days when compared with collagen membrane alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system with a barrier membrane significantly increased cell attachment, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts in vitro. Future animal testing is required to fully characterize the additional benefits of combining enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system with a barrier membrane for guided bone or tissue regeneration...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Enamel matrix {{derivatives}} (EMDs) {{have been}} used clinically {{for more than a}} decade for the regeneration of periodontal tissues. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect on cell growth of EMDs in a gel carrier in comparison to EMDs in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier.</b> EMDs in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> have been shown to adsorb better to bone graft materials. METHODS Primary human osteoblasts and periodontal ligament (PDL) cells were exposed to EMDs in both gel and liquid carriers and compared for their ability to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Alizarin red staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of genes encoding collagen 1, osteocalcin, and runt-related transcription factor 2, as well as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2), transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, and interleukin (IL) - 1 β, were assessed. RESULTS EMDs in both carriers significantly increased cell proliferation of both osteoblasts and PDL cells in a similar manner. Both formulations also significantly upregulated the expression of genes encoding BMP 2 and TGF-β 1 as well as decreased the expression of IL- 1 β. EMDs in the <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> further retained similar differentiation potential of both osteoblasts and PDL cells by demonstrating increased collagen and osteocalcin gene expression and significantly higher alizarin red staining. CONCLUSIONS The results from the present study indicate that the new formulation of EMDs in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> is equally as potent as EMDs in a gel carrier in inducing osteoblast and PDL activity. Future study combining EMDs in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> with bone grafting materials is required to further evaluate its potential for combination therapies...|$|E

40|$|A new process, phase {{enhanced}} absorption, was invented. The {{method is}} carried out in an absorber, where a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> (aqueous solution), an organic mixture (or organic compound), and a gas mixture containing a gas to be absorbed are introduced from an inlet. Since the organic mixture is immiscible or at least partially immiscible with the <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier,</b> the organic mixture forms a layer or small parcels between the <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> and the gas mixture. The organic mixture in the absorber improves mass transfer efficiency {{of the system and}} increases the absorption rate of the gas. The organic mixture serves as a transportation media. The gas is finally accumulated in the <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> as in a conventional gas-liquid absorption system. The presence of the organic layer does not hinder the regeneration of the <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> or recovery of the gas because the organic layer is removed by a settler after the absorption process is completed. In another aspect, the system exhibited increased gas-liquid separation efficiency, thereby reducing the costs of operation and maintenance. Our study focused on the search of the organic layer or transportation layer to enhance the absorption rate of carbon dioxide. The following systems were studied, (1) CO{sub 2 }-water system and CO{sub 2 }-water-organic layer system; (2) CO{sub 2 }-Potassium Carbonate aqueous solution system and CO{sub 2 }-Potassium Carbonate aqueous solution-organic layer system. CO{sub 2 }-water and CO{sub 2 }-Potassium Carbonate systems are the traditional gas-liquid absorption processes. The CO{sub 2 }-water-organic layer and CO{sub 2 }-Potassium Carbonate-organic layer systems are the novel absorption processes, phase enhanced absorption. As we mentioned early, organic layer (transportation layer phase) is used for the increase of absorption rate. Our study showed that the absorption rate can be increased by adding the organic layer.
