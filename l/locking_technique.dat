Clearly, immediate materialized view maintenance with transactional consistency, if enforced by generic concurrency control mechanisms, can result in low levels of concurrency and high rates of deadlock. While this problem is superficially amenable to well-known techniques, such as fine-granularity locking and special lock modes for updates that are associative and commutative, we show that these previous high concurrency <b>locking</b> <b>techniques</b> do not fully solve the problem, but {{a combination of a}} “value-based ” latch pool and these previous high concurrency <b>locking</b> <b>techniques</b> can solve the problem.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this work, we {{attempted}} to develop a modified single-knot Kessler-loop <b>lock</b> suture <b>technique</b> and compare the biomechanical properties associated with this single-knot suture technique with those associated with the conventional modified Kessler and interlock suture techniques. METHODS: In this experiment, a total of 18 porcine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were harvested and randomly divided into three groups. The tendons were transected and then repaired using three different techniques, including modified Kessler suture with peritendinous suture, interlock suture with peritendinous suture, and modified Kessler-loop lock suture with peritendinous suture. Times required for suturing were recorded and compared among groups. The groups were also compared with respect to 2 -mm gap load, ultimate failure load, and gap at failure. RESULTS: For tendon repair, compared with the conventional modified Kessler suture technique, the interlock and modified Kessler-loop <b>lock</b> suture <b>techniques</b> resulted in significantly improved biomechanical properties.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceServer {{virtualization}} {{has become}} the modern trend in various industries. Industries are resorting to the deployment of virtualized servers in order to cut the cost of additional, expensive hardware and consolidate the servers on minimal hardware for easier management and maintenance. Virtualized servers are often seen connected to disk arrays in many industries ranging from small to medium business to large data centers. In such a setup, assuring a low latency of data access from the disk array {{plays an important role}} in improving the performance and robustness of the overall system. Caching techniques have been researched and used in the past on traditional processors to reduce the number of memory accesses and have proven benefits in alleviating the response times of applications. The research done in this paper explores caching on the hypervisor and analyzes the performance of data cache <b>locking</b> <b>technique</b> in hypervisor caches. The research aims at reducing the Input / Output (I/O) latency in a server virtualized Storage Area Network (SAN) setup, which thereby increases the performance of applications running on the virtualized servers. The authors introduce a miss table that can determine the blocks of data in the hypervisor cache that need to be locked. Way cache locking method is used for locking, such that only selected lines of cache are locked (not the entire cache). The proposed cache <b>locking</b> <b>technique</b> is later evaluated with the introduction of a small victim buffer cache and probability based cache replacement algorithm.
