50|$|Tupou, became {{widely known}} as a schoolboy rugby player in early May 2014 while playing for Auckland’s Sacred Heart College First XV, when he became an {{internet}} sensation for his 3 tries against Kelston Boys High School. In August 2014, Taniela was given a deadline by the New Zealand Rugby Union to sign a <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreement</b> with the NZRU and therefore be eligible for its Schoolboys team. However, he did not sign the agreement, despite NZRU officials making special dispensation for Tupou to be named in the squad after initially being blocked because he only carried a Tongan passport.|$|E
50|$|The 1998-99 rebel {{season in}} rugby union {{occurred}} when two clubs affiliated to the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), Cardiff RFC and Swansea RFC, refused {{to play in}} the WRU-sanctioned Welsh Premier Division that season and instead opted to play friendly matches against clubs from the English Premiership. The two clubs' position came about after the WRU rejected requests by the club to pursue changes to the league structure in Welsh club rugby and in particular to set up a cross-border league involving other clubs in Britain, and the two clubs refused to sign up to a <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreement</b> with the WRU committing them to the current league setup.|$|E
50|$|Against this backdrop, the WRU {{wished to}} have {{clubs in the}} Premier Division sign 10-year loyalty {{agreements}}. These four page agreements would see the clubs assured of their places in the top-flight of the league system {{for the duration of}} the agreement, in exchange for their commitment to remain playing in the league system. However, both Swansea and Cardiff saw insufficient returns available from the Welsh league, and refused to sign up to the loyalty agreements, instead suggesting the setup of a British league involving four clubs from Wales, the clubs that comprised the top division in England and two Scottish regional sides; Edinburgh and Glasgow. This proposal was supported by both the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the clubs that comprised the top two divisions in England, but was rejected by the WRU, owing to ongoing legal action between the RFU and English clubs over commercial rights, and the ongoing legal action taken by Cardiff. The WRU reiterated their requirement that Cardiff and Swansea sign up to the <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreement</b> in order to continue participating in the Premier Division and the European Cup.|$|E
50|$|Swansea {{went on to}} beat Llanelli 37-10 in the cup final, but {{the rebels}} were still forced to sign <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreements</b> and return to Welsh {{domestic}} setup, now including Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|The Premiership Policy Committee {{decided to}} push {{forward with a}} plan {{to reduce the number of}} Sydney teams before any player, coach or club had moved to Super League. The ARL had handed out <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreements</b> for the clubs to sign, then {{immediately}} went about a plan to get rid of clubs.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, {{a meeting}} {{of the board of the}} ARL, held on 20 February 1995, {{received}} a report from the League's solicitor, Colin Love, that all clubs, except Brisbane and Canberra, had signed <b>Loyalty</b> <b>Agreements.</b> The board agreed to accept the amendments proposed by Canberra and to have Mr Love continue to negotiate with the Brisbane Broncos on outstanding issues. Agreement appears to have been reached shortly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Both the RFU and the English clubs {{had agreed}} to this, but the WRU refused due to an ongoing legal battle with the English clubs over the {{negotiation}} of commercial rights (which {{would lead to the}} English clubs not participating in the 1998-99 Heineken Cup). Instead, the WRU demanded all top-flight clubs sign 10-year <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreements,</b> where they were guaranteed top-flight status and committed themselves to staying within the Welsh league structure.|$|R
50|$|A British league wasn't {{set up for}} the 2000-01 season, however neither Cardiff nor Swansea {{entered the}} English Premiership. The two Scottish District sides joined the Welsh sides in forming a Welsh-Scottish League from the 1999 - 2000 season. For the 2001-02 season, the Celtic League ran {{alongside}} the 2001-02 Welsh-Scottish League, involving sides from Wales, Scotland and Ireland in a pool/knockout format competition. The 10 year <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreements,</b> which was scheduled to run through to August 2007 were torn up by the WRU in 2003 to allow introduction of regional rugby. With the creation of the five regional teams from Wales, the Celtic League was changed into a traditional double round-robin league.|$|R
50|$|An {{emergency}} meeting {{was held by}} the WRU in May 1999, at which the two sides came to an agreement that would see Cardiff and Swansea return to the Welsh Premier Division for the 1999-2000 season, with an agreement that both sides could join the English Premiership for the 2000-01 season {{in the event that}} a British league had not been set up. Also as part of the agreement, Cardiff and Swansea signed <b>loyalty</b> <b>agreements</b> with the WRU scheduled to run for the remaining eight years and were also nominated as two of the Welsh representatives in the 1999-2000 European Cup, despite the positions usually being awarded based upon Welsh Premier Division league positions. Cardiff and Swansea's inclusion came at the expense of Ebbw Vale RFC, who would normally have been nominated based on their 1998-99 league position.|$|R
40|$|A {{wide variety}} of sources, {{including}} the Huntington literature and popular mass media, show that Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” idea actually has very little value in understanding the current global political context. The central assumption of Huntington’s view, that cultural kinship ties influence <b>loyalties</b> and <b>agreements</b> on a global scale, {{has little to do}} with the daily lives of American citizens and little to do with the decisions made by the current presidential administration. The mass media evidence from the United States shows that the most important “kinship” ties are not religious or cultural, but economic. The argument involves a deeper analysis of the current trend towards religious programs on American television, a timeline of events relating to the Halliburton – Cheney relationship, and views expressed by members of the United States military in Stars and Stripes...|$|R
50|$|Bothwell was {{formally}} attainted by Act of Parliament, dated 21 July 1593. However, on Tuesday, 24 July, the Earl had been smuggled into Holyroodhouse and forced himself at last into the King's presence, in his bedchamber. Soon numerous Bothwell supporters also entered the room. The king accepted Bothwell's protestations of <b>loyalty</b> and an <b>agreement</b> for his pardon was reached. (It received the Royal, and other signatures on 14 August). So, just {{five days after}} his forfeiture, Bothwell and his accomplices received a blanket Act of Remission and Condonation.|$|R
40|$|The study {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the formation of customer loyalty in the market of high-tech products. It examines existing approaches to defining the determinants that influence the formation of loyalty in the consumer market. On the basis of generalization of existing approaches it is proposed to divide the determinants of such groups: behavioral, perceptual, marketing and individual determinants of customers loyalty. Marketing research was conducted to identify the features of the market behavior of Ukrainian consumers of high-tech products. As the result, the main tends of consumers behavior, external and individual factors of actualization and influence on the consumers motivation were determined. Ukrainian consumers' loyalty was sorted depending on the reasons to buying high-tech products and consumer involvement in this process. Each type of market behavior of consumers corresponds to a certain type of consumer <b>loyalty.</b> Cognitive, <b>agreement,</b> demonstrative <b>loyalty</b> are formed in the case of high consumer involvement in the buying process. Active, perceptual loyalty and loyalty of convenience are observed in the case of low involvement...|$|R
40|$|The <b>loyalty</b> and {{commitment}} <b>agreements</b> {{drawn up by}} the ARL {{in an attempt to}} stave off the threat of Super League, and the 14 team term incorporated into documents that accompanied the later merger, were held by the Full Federal Court to be exclusionary provisions under s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). There is an argument, however, that authorisation under s 88 of the Act could have been sought, and this raises the broader question as to whether sporting organisations should be given, if not a blanket exemption to restrictive trade practices legislation, then at least exemptions on a case by case basis...|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to voting in parliament, party group unity is the rule rather than the {{exception}} in most (European) parliamentary democracies. But how do individual MPs come to their decision to vote according to the party group line? This book introduces a theoretical model of MP decision making in which the main decision-making mechanisms, derived from the existing literature on the pathways to party group unity – cue-taking, <b>agreement,</b> <b>loyalty</b> and obedience –, are placed in a particular sequential order. The three empirical studies in this book assess the relative role of each of the mechanisms, both independent and when possible {{as a part of the}} sequential model, in getting MPs to toe the party group line and contribute to party group unity, and explore whether this varies not only between parliaments (chapter 4), but also by levels of government (chapter 5), and through time (chapter 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Liner {{shipping}} is {{the business}} of offering common carrier ocean shipping services in international trade. Since it became an important industry in the 1870 s, it has been characterized by various agreements between firms. Historically, since the formation in 1875 of the Calcutta Conference, the conference system was the primary form of agreement in liner shipping. Variously called liner conferences, shipping conferences, and ocean shipping conferences, they are formal agreements between liner shipping lines on a route, always setting (possibly discriminatory) prices, and sometimes pooling profits or revenues, managing capacity, allocating routes, and offering <b>loyalty</b> discounts. Conferences <b>agreements</b> were quite successful {{and in many cases}} have lasted for years. In the last two decades, conferences have begun to be supplanted by alliances (particularly in the American and European trades, where legislative changes have been unfavourable to them), which are less complete (they do not, for example, set prices) but encompass more broadly defined trade routes...|$|R
50|$|Therefore, it befits {{not a man}} {{of sound}} mind to bestow his person promiscuously, or have random {{intercourse}} with women; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children, and his wife will be robbed of her honor due, and shame be attached to his sons. And it is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor, full of self-restraint and awe; and in his conversation with her, should use only {{the words of a}} right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable. Aristotle's thought that a wife was best honored when she saw that her husband was faithful to her, and that he had no preference for another woman; but before all others loves, trusts her and holds her as his own. Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the <b>agreement,</b> <b>loyalty,</b> and devotion of his wife, so that whether he himself is present or not, there may be no difference in her attitude towards him, since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests; and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband.|$|R
