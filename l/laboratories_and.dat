40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the semen quality among honey bee populations, emergent honey bee drones were maintained to sexual maturity for 20  days under <b>laboratory,</b> semi-field, <b>and</b> field conditions. The drones were successfully maintained in laboratory conditions. Drones under <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> field conditions presented a lower spermatozoa concentration and lower protein content than those under semi-field conditions. The viability of spermatozoa was higher under <b>laboratory</b> conditions, <b>and</b> the ATP content and the superoxide dismutase activity were higher both under <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> field conditions compared to drones kept under semi-field conditions. Hence, our data indicate that the semen quality was similar in drones maintained under <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> field conditions...|$|R

5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board <b>laboratories,</b> <b>and</b> two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, <b>laboratories,</b> <b>and</b> zoos is illegal.|$|E
5|$|Both the Grammar School and High School co-existed as {{voluntary}} aided schools until 1970 {{when they}} merged to become co-educational, with the Grammar School {{moving into the}} North Brink High School site under headmaster Dr. D.S.

5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government <b>laboratories</b> <b>and</b> research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{shared a}} love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who {{after graduating from high}} school had the {{intention}} of directing a film version of Homer's The Iliad. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, The March of Time, Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, <b>laboratories,</b> <b>and</b> equipment rental houses.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses offer many {{possibilities}} in biological research, including {{their ability to}} regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in <b>laboratories</b> <b>and</b> public aquariums.|$|E

5|$|Poisonous {{sausages}} containing toad meat {{are being}} trialled in the Kimberley (Western Australia) {{to try to}} protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation has been working with the University of Sydney to develop baits to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals {{to stay away from the}} amphibians. Researcher David Pearson says trials run in <b>laboratories</b> <b>and</b> in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits will not solve the cane toad problem altogether.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was {{important}} because the human species had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project.

Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning <b>laboratories</b> <b>and</b> had hired a team of six scientists.
