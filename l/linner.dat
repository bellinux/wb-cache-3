40|$|When {{masculine}} {{forms are}} {{used to refer to}} men and women, this causes male-biased cognitive representations and behavioral consequences, as numerous studies have shown. This effect can be avoided or reduced with the help of gender-fair language. In this talk, we will present different approaches that aim at influencing people’s use of and attitudes towards gender-fair language. Firstly, we tested the influence of gender-fair input on people’s own use of gender-fair language. Based on Irmen and <b>Linner’s</b> (2005) adaptation of the scenario mapping and focus approach (Sanford & Garrod, 1998), we found that after reading a text with gender-fair forms women produced more gender-fair forms than women who read gender-neutral texts or texts containing masculine generics. Men were not affected. Secondly, we examined reactions to arguments which followed the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty &Cacioppo, 1986). We assumed that strong pros and cons would be more effective than weak arguments or control statements. The results indicated that strong pros could convince some, but not all participants, suggesting a complex interplay of diverse factors in reaction to attempts at persuasion. The influence of people’s initial characteristics will be discussed. Currently, we are investigating how self-generated refutations, in addition to arguments, may influence initial attitudes. Based on the resistance appraisal hypothesis (Tormala, 2008), we assume that individuals are encouraged in their initial attitude if they manage to refute strong counter-arguments. The results of our studies will be discussed regarding their practical implications...|$|R

5000|$|From 1555 {{mathematician}} {{and physician}} Valentin Naboth taught mathematics at the University of Cologne, first privately, and from 1557 to 1564 as the holder of a [...] "City" [...] Professorship of mathematics. He succeeded Justus Velsius, who in 1556, {{on account of}} teachings deemed heretical by the Church, was obliged to leave Cologne. Dutch mathematician Rudolph Snellius {{was one of his}} students in Cologne. In 1556 he published the first book of Euclid, and then his own mathematical commentary on the Arab astrologer Alchabitius, 1560, in which he opposed magic and superstition. In his mathematical work he followed Regiomontanus; but further on he preferred Ptolemy - in agreement with Cardanus. He prepared an edition of Ptolemy’s Quadripartitus, but that was never published. In his commentary, he thanked the City that they had him remunerated in the early years, when mathematics was the only discipline not yet integrated into the general University curriculum. If this remark is true - and that can hardly be questioned - then the official Professorship of Mathematics had in fact only now been established. However, in 1563 Laurentianer Petrus <b>Linner</b> requested that Naboth’s lecture be moved to another time, since he himself taught mathematics at his Gymnasium at the very same time. With that he opened up the discussion about competition from the Faculty and College curriculum. Furthermore, he argued that Naboth didn’t have a Magister degree from Cologne, but from somewhere else. And indeed, the Dean decided that henceforth no one could teach a course in the Schola Artium when simultaneously a lecture took place in one of three Gymnasiums. The basic problem with the Arts studies in Cologne could not have been made any clearer than that. Right away, Naboth took the consequences: he left Cologne and later taught in Padua.|$|E
