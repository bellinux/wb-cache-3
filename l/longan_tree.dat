It was caught suspended, head downwards, on a cluster of {{the fruit of the}} <b>longan</b> <b>tree</b> (Nephelium longanum). Now this tree is an evergreen, and all the year round some portion of its foliage is undergoing decay, the particular leaves being, in such a stage, partially orange and black. This bat can, therefore, at all seasons suspend from its branches and elude its enemies by its resemblance to the leaves of the tree."[68] ...|$|E

50|$|Its {{earliest}} {{record of}} existence draws {{back to the}} Han Dynasty in 200 BC. The emperor had demanded lychee and <b>longan</b> <b>trees</b> to be planted in his palace gardens in Shaanxi, but the plants failed. Fortunately, four hundred years later, <b>longan</b> <b>trees</b> flourished {{in other parts of}} China like Fujian and Guangdong, where longan production soon became an industry.|$|R
40|$|Thailand is the world’s number-one {{producer}} of longan fruit. In general, longan production takes {{place during the}} dry season under irrigation. Recently, more attention has been given to water-efficient irrigation. Water stress detection by thermal imaging, which is a non-invasive and rapid assessment method, may be an interesting tool for improved irrigation planning. In this study, four potted <b>longan</b> <b>trees</b> were subjected to water stress. Stress responses in terms of stomatal resistance (rs) and leaf water potential (LWP) were monitored and compared with a non-stressed control. Based on thermal imaging, the crop water stress index (CWSI) was determined throughout the experiment for all trees and correlations with classical parameters were investigated. A field experiment was also carried out with 20 field-grown <b>longan</b> <b>trees,</b> either subjected to water stress treatment or serving as controls; trees were monitored for rs, LWP and CWSI. Under controlled conditions there was a high correlation between CWSI and both rs and LWP during the entire experimental period. In the field experiment it was found that CWSI was best correlated with rs when images were taken from the shaded side of the leaves. A threshold value of 0. 7 for CWSI is proposed to distinguish between stressed and non-stressed <b>longan</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
50|$|During harvest, pickers must climb ladders to {{carefully}} remove branches of fruit from <b>longan</b> <b>trees.</b> It {{has been found}} that longan fruit remain fresher when still attached to the branch, so efforts are made to prevent the fruit from detaching too early. Mechanical picking would damage the delicate skin of the fruit, so the preferred method is to harvest by hand. Knives and scissors are the most commonly used tools.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Longan</b> <b>tree</b> is {{somewhat}} sensitive to frost. Longan trees prefer sandy soil. While the species prefers temperatures {{that do not}} typically fall below 4.5 C, it can withstand brief temperature drops to about -2 C. Longans usually bear fruit slightly later than lychees.|$|E

50|$|Later on, due to {{immigration}} {{and the growing}} demand for nostalgic foods, the <b>longan</b> <b>tree</b> was officially introduced to Australia in the mid-1800s, Thailand in the late-1800s, and Hawaii and Florida in the 1900s. The warm, sandy-soiled conditions allowed for the easy growth of longan trees. This jump-started the longan industry in these locations.|$|E

40|$|This study verifies the {{influence}} of water regimes and potassium chlorate (KC 1 O 3) on photosynthetic rate, flower emergence and media moisture content of <b>longan</b> <b>trees.</b> The trees were grown in 150 liters lysimeter tanks filled with fine sand. The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial in completely randomized design (CRD) with 2 factors; 1) two levels of water regimes (well-watered and water deficit) and 2) two levels of KClO 3 at 10 and 0 g. The results revealed that the well-watered treatment produced faster days of terminal bud break {{than that of the}} water deficit treatment. The 10 g KClO 3 treatment induced 91 % flower emergence at 35 days after commencing the treatment, while the 0 g KClO 3 treatment had 82 % leaf flushing and had no flower emergence. Water deficit or KClO 3 treatments reduced the net carbondioxide (CO 2) exchange, transpiration and stomatal conductance rates. Moreover, the combination of well-watered and 0 g KClO 3 treatments gave the greatest values of the parameters.

50|$|The wild longan {{population}} {{have been}} decimated considerably by large-scale loggings in the past, and the species {{used to be}} listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. If left alone, <b>longan</b> <b>tree</b> stumps will resprout and the listing was upgraded to Near Threatened in 1998. Recent field data are inadequate for a contemporary IUCN assessment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Longan</b> <b>tree</b> {{produces}} light-yellow inflorescences {{located at}} the end of branches. The inflorescence is commonly called a panicle and are 4 - 18 in long, and widely-branched. The small flowers have 5 to 6 sepals and petals that are brownish-yellow. The flower has a two-lobed pistil and 8 stamen. There are three flower types, distributed throughout the panicle; staminate (functionally male), pistillate (functionally female), and hermaphroditic flowers. Flowering occurs as a progression.The fruit hangs in drooping clusters that are circular and about 1 in wide. The peel is tan, thin, and leathery with tiny hairs. The flesh is translucent, and the seed is large and black with a circular white spot at the base. This gives the illusion of an eye. The flesh has a musky, sweet taste, which can be compared to the flavor of lychee fruit.|$|E
50|$|Legend {{has it that}} a {{fisherman}} named Pan lived in Wenchang county, Hainan Island. One day while fishing out at sea, he caught a block of wood which he threw back into the sea, but he caught it again the next day. This happened repeatedly for a few days. As a result, Pan decided to bring the block of wood back to his home. He felt that the block of wood had a magical power and thus prayed to it, asking to be blessed with a great catch the next day. He promised that he would build a temple to enshrine the wood if his prayer were to be granted. Pan's prayer was actually granted. He came back from his fishing trip with a huge catch. However, Pan {{did not have enough}} money to build a temple, so he left the wood outside his house by the pig sty and forgot all about the promise he made. The next day, his pigs went ill and his neighbors saw a woman sitting on the branch of the <b>longan</b> <b>tree</b> near his house. It made him remember his promise to the block of wood. He informed his neighbours of the incident and they all raised funds for the construction of the temple and prayed to ask where they should build the new temple. Suddenly a child came by and showed them the location of where the temple should be built. That temple would then be the first temple for Goddess Shui Wei.|$|E

A general survey of the natural enemies of Kerria lacca (Kerr) was conducted in Taipei, Taichung, Changhua, Nantou, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung from August 1978 until July 1979. A total of 5 parasitoids, Eupelmus tachardiae (Eupelmidae), Tachardiaephagus sp., T. tachardiae (Encyrtidae), Tetrastichus purpureus (Eulophidae) and Physcus sp. (Aphelinidae); and 6 predators, Chrysopa sp. (Chrysopidae), Eithlemma roseonivea, E. conspersa (Noctuidae), Jauravia limbata, Telsimia chujoi, Scymnus (Pullus) sp. (Coccinellidae) were found. Two parasitoids, Brachycyrtus nawaii (Ichneumonidae) and Conostigmus sp. (Ceraphronidae) were reared from the predator, Chrysopa sp. of K. lacca. Besides, 38 hymenopterous parasitoids associated with the lac sticks are still unknown to the authors. It is apparently that further studies on the natural enemies of the lac insect are still needed.

40|$|Abstract Plant Growth Regulator Sprays and Girdling: Potential Horticultural Techniques to Increase Fruit Retention and Yield of Longan (Dimocarpus <b>longan</b> Lour.) <b>Trees</b> in California Leila Graves June 2009 The longan is a {{subtropical}} {{fruit tree}} whose popularity is growing quickly among American consumers, and thus, {{could become a}} lucrative niche market for California growers. Trees planted {{as part of an}} initial variety trial conducted in commercial California orchards are beginning to bear fruit. However, fruit retention and yields are low due to excessive abscission during early fruit set. Horticultural techniques, such as plant growth regulator (PGR) sprays and girdling, often increase fruit retention and yield of fruit tree crops, though effects are typically dependent on treatment timing and PGR concentration. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify PGR and girdling techniques that result in increased longan fruit retention. The experiment was conducted in a commercial orchard using a randomized complete block design with whole-tree experimental units and five replications per treatment. Treatments included foliar applications of two synthetic auxins, 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at 20, 60, or 100 ppm or 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) at 5, 25, or 45 ppm, each applied during early or late fruit set. Girdling was also conducted at early or late fruit set, for a total of 15 treatments, including an untreated control. Factors examined at harvest included fruit number and mass per inflorescence and individual fruit mass and diameter. During the on-crop year, a significant increase in the number and mass of fruit per inflorescence was observed in response to 25 ppm 2, 4 -D applied at late fruit set, as compared to the control. Despite this increase in fruit number, 25 ppm 2, 4 -D applied at late fruit set did not result in decreased diameter and mass of individual fruit. Late fruit set applications of 25 ppm 2, 4 -D appear to mitigate the effects of alternate bearing in the off-crop year. Fruit abscission during early and/or late fruit set decreased in response to 5 ppm 2, 4 -D at early fruit set, 25 or 45 ppm 2, 4 -D at early or late fruit set, or 100 ppm NAA at early fruit set. Fruit loss occurred as a result of Santa Ana winds during both growing seasons. Neither leaf nor fruit nutrient concentrations of treated trees were significantly different from that of untreated controls. Results indicate that properly-timed PGR applications have the potential to be used commercially to increase yield and profit to longan growers in California...|$|R
