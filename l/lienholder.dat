2500|$|In a Chapter 7 {{liquidation}} case, {{an individual}} debtor may redeem certain [...] "tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family, or household use" [...] that is encumbered by a lien. To qualify, the property generally either (A) must be exempt under section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (B) {{must have been}} abandoned by the trustee under section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code. To redeem the property, the debtor must pay the <b>lienholder</b> the full amount of the applicable allowed secured claim against the property.|$|E
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, the <b>lienholder</b> {{must agree}} to pay {{subsequent}} unpaid property taxes during the redemption period {{in order to protect}} his/her interest. If the <b>lienholder</b> does not pay such taxes, a subsequent <b>lienholder</b> would [...] "buy out" [...] (redeem) the prior lienholder's interest. Other jurisdictions allow the <b>lienholder</b> first right to pay subsequent taxes, but if the <b>lienholder</b> chooses not to do so, a separate lien is offered for sale. Still other jurisdictions do not offer subsequent tax payment priority; each lien is sold separately (and can result in multiple liens on a property held by different lienholders).|$|E

50|$|One {{example is}} {{in the case of}} a bank, finance company or other <b>lienholder</b> {{performing}} a repossession of an automobile from the registered owner for non-payment, the <b>lienholder</b> has a non-delegable duty not to cause a breach of the peace in performing the repossession, or it will be liable for damages even if the repossession is performed by an agent. This requirement means that whether a repossession is performed by the <b>lienholder</b> or by an agent, the repossessor must not cause a breach of the peace or the <b>lienholder</b> will be held responsible.|$|E

"non-self-executing": {{after the}} {{expiration}} of the redemption period the entity {{will conduct a}} tax deed sale of the property; the payments made by the <b>lienholder</b> constitute the opening bid and, if no other bids are received, the <b>lienholder</b> will acquire title to the property (the <b>lienholder</b> may choose {{to participate in the}} sale beyond the opening bid and make additional bids on the property if so desired).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lienholder</b> {{could give}} up the right of {{maritime}} lien either by expressed or implied intention. The intention to waive the lien should be shown clearly required by the court and the credit of the <b>lienholder</b> will be considered.|$|E
50|$|A home {{foreclosure}} {{is often}} linked with liens held by banks or governmental agencies. Multiple liens {{from various sources}} may be held against a property in foreclosure. If a home is sold at a foreclosure auction, the proceeds are divided and paid to <b>lienholders</b> in order of filing until all proceeds are expended.|$|R
40|$|In most US states, {{mortgage}} seniority follows time priority: older mortgages {{are paid}} first. This impedes the refinancing of senior mortgages, because replacement mortgages are junior unless the existing junior <b>lienholders</b> sign subordination agreements. We identify the resulting impact on refinancing by contrasting {{states that do}} and do not require this consent. We find a significant negative impact of time priority on smaller mortgages. Among larger mortgages, the significant impact {{is driven by the}} conforming loan limit. We exploit legal variation to instrument for a borrowerâ€™s ability to refinance, and show that successful refinancing reduces future mortgage delinquency...|$|R
5000|$|Lis pendens is Latin for [...] "suit pending". This may {{refer to}} any pending lawsuit or to a {{specific}} situation with a public notice of litigation that has been recorded in the same location where the title of real property has been recorded. This notice secures a plaintiff's claim on the property so that a sale, mortgage, or encumbrance of the property will not diminish plaintiff's rights to the property, should the plaintiff prevail in its case. In some jurisdictions, when the notice is properly recorded, lis pendens is considered constructive notice to other litigants or other unrecorded or subordinate <b>lienholders.</b>|$|R

50|$|The lien is said {{to attach}} to the title when the {{mortgage}} is signed by the mortgagor and delivered to the mortgagee and the mortgagor receives the funds whose repayment the mortgage secures. Subject {{to the requirements of}} the recording laws of the state in which the mortgaged property is located, this attachment establishes the priority of the mortgage lien with respect to most other liens on the property's title. Liens that have attached to the title before the mortgage lien are said to be senior to, or prior to, the mortgage lien. Those attaching afterward are said to be junior or subordinate. The purpose of this priority is to establish the order in which <b>lienholders</b> are entitled to foreclose their liens in order to recover their debts. If a property's title has multiple mortgage liens and the loan secured by a first mortgage is paid off, the second mortgage lien will move up in priority and become the new first mortgage lien on the title. Documenting this new priority arrangement will require the release of the mortgage securing the paid-off loan.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to discuss in detail privileged marithne claims, Maritime Liensfocusing on their {{existence}} in Enghsh Law, {{and deal with the}} aspects of their enforcement, whilst also considering the problems which can -and in practice usually do- arise while the entitied claimants attempt to enforce their Maritime Liens. The points covered by this thesis include the principle of Maritime Liens as recognised under English Law, and the way that these can be enforced against the offending maritime property in order to satisfy the existing claims. Also, discussed are the-various problems with which maritime <b>lienholders</b> aire often faced, such as the conflict'of laws existing between the numerous maritime nations-as well as the various Conventions that have been createdin order to eliminate the existing problems relating to Maritime lines arid the Arrest of Ships!. Additionally, a brief discussion about the need for the creation of uniform rules regarding Maritime Liens wiU be made, followed by an outline of the practice of forum shopping. To give a more specific preview of this thesis, the stmcture of the chapters presented is this: In the first -introductory- chapter Maritime Liens are defined and historically reviewed; the concept of Maritime Liens is closely examined by discussing their fundamental characteristics and properties, and, finally, their worth as a privileged maritime claim is evaluated. At the same time, a brief introduction to the problems that claimants may face while trying to enforce them, as weU as the attempts that have been made to unify the Intemational law regarding Maritime Liens, is given. The second chapter deals with Maritime Liens recognised in English Law, discussing those claims which give the claimant the right to proceed in rem against maritime property. In the third chapter, the enforcement of Maritime Liens is discussed. The whole procedure of enforcing a claim is dealt with in detail, startmg from the action in rem, and its nature, to the arrest of ships. The right to arrest a sister ship is also considered as well as the issue of arresting a ship chartered by demise charterers. The actual procedure of arrest is also mentioned, including the practicalities of arrest; further, the difficulties that claimants encounter in enforcing Maritime Liens are discussed -such as the extinction of Maritime Liens, the provisions of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and the Caveat Against Arrest. The fourth chapter introduces the issue of the conflict of laws relating to Maritime Liens; it concentrates into the numerous forms the problem can take, extensively discussing the matter of priority of Maritime Liens. The priority given under the English, American and the 1926 Maritime Liens and Mortgages Convention are briefly mentioned. Finally, the attempts that have so far been, made to settie and unify the existing Maritime Liens conflicts are reviewed, considering the various Conventions relating to both Maritime Liens and Mortgages and the Arrest of ships. In the fifth Chapter, aspects such as the uniformity that could be achieved through the ratification of international conventions and the practice of forum shopping are dealt with. Finally, in the sbcth Chapter, a brief summary of the project and its scope is made and conclusions are drawn...|$|R
5000|$|A {{business}} buys {{a vehicle}} and obtains financing. The company purchasing the vehicle becomes the registered owner and has both possession and right of possession. The financial organization providing financing {{would become the}} <b>lienholder</b> and have a security interest that, upon default, would ripen into a right of retention (ius retentionis). If the business that bought the vehicle then rented it to someone, that individual would then have possession but would not have right of possession. The company renting the vehicle to them could repossess the vehicle, for example, if they hold the vehicle past the contract period. Also, if the rental company missed payments to the <b>lienholder,</b> the <b>lienholder</b> could repossess the vehicle from the person having possession as well.|$|E

50|$|The term {{registered}} owner is usually used in instances of {{title of a}} vehicle (such as an automobile) {{to refer to the}} person who has right of possession of the vehicle, as opposed to the party that has right of property. The party that has right of property is referred to as a <b>lienholder,</b> and in the event the {{registered owner}} fails to pay off the lien according to the agreed-to terms, the <b>lienholder</b> has the right to invoke repossession of the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Replevin is {{used when}} the party having {{the right of}} {{property}} cannot simply invoke self-help and take the property back. If the party {{has the ability to}} do so directly, the action is referred to as repossession. For example, in the states of Wisconsin and Louisiana, if a person who finances an automobile, becomes a registered owner of that vehicle and fails to make payments as agreed, the <b>lienholder</b> cannot simply repossess the vehicle. The <b>lienholder</b> must go to court and obtain an order of replevin.|$|E
50|$|Where farm {{machinery}} and farm equipment have been purchased from a dealer in the province, the Farm Machinery and Equipment Act provides that it cannot be repossessed by a <b>lienholder</b> without {{the approval of}} the Manitoba Farm Industry Board. Following repossession, the <b>lienholder</b> must give notice to the farmer of his action, and must hold the assets for 10 working days, in order for the purchaser to be able to settle the amount of the payments in default, together with accrued interest and other related costs.|$|E
50|$|A lien, {{also known}} as a right of retention, may be a real {{security}} right which arises by operation of law, or it may be a personal right. Its purpose is to secure the repayment of money or labour that the <b>lienholder</b> has expended on the lienorâ€™s movable or immovable property. It operates as a defence to the lienorâ€™s rei vindicatio and entitles the <b>lienholder</b> to retain possession of the property until compensated for the expenditure incurred. It does not include the right to have the property sold in execution. In Singh v Santam, the court held that the <b>lienholder</b> must have been in physical possession of the property at the time he incurred the expense. (A lien differs from a tacit hypothec most obviously in this respect.) As soon as the lienholderâ€™s claim has been paid, the lien terminates automatically; it is accessory to the principal debt.|$|E

50|$|The sale, {{depending}} on the jurisdiction, may be a tax deed sale (whereby the actual property is sold) or a tax lien sale (whereby a lien on the property is sold) Under the tax lien sale process, {{depending on}} the jurisdiction, after a specified period of time if the lien is not redeemed, the <b>lienholder</b> may seek legal action which {{will result in the}} <b>lienholder</b> either automatically obtaining the property, or forcing a future tax deed sale of the property and possibly obtaining the property as a result.|$|E
50|$|Formally, a {{mortgage}} lender (mortgagee), or other <b>lienholder,</b> obtains a termination of {{a mortgage}} borrower (mortgagor)'s equitable right of redemption, either by court order or by {{operation of law}} (after following a specific statutory procedure).|$|E
5000|$|Enrichment liens, {{based on}} the {{principle}} of unjustified enrichment, arise in those cases where the <b>lienholder</b> has incurred expenses on the lienorâ€™s property without that lienorâ€™s consent, or without a legal obligation to do so.|$|E
5000|$|A tax deed sale {{may also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a tax lien sale process, whereby the <b>lienholder</b> (instead of a governmental agency) starts the process toward forcing a public sale of the property. [...] In those instances the lienholder's investment (the price of the lien plus any additional costs necessary to start the tax deed sale process, such as required fees and payment of any still-unpaid taxes or buyout of other certificate holders' interests) constitutes the minimum bid; if no other bids are received at the sale then the <b>lienholder</b> will take title to the property subject to redemption periods (if applicable) or any lawsuit to overturn the sale.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{significant}} differences between maritime liens, which only exist in admiralty law, {{and the right to}} keep that exist in general civil law are (1) that in general civil law, [...] "Prior in time is prior in right", i.e., the rights of the <b>lienholder</b> with the earliest lien are superior to those of later lienholders, whereas in maritime law the rights of the most recent <b>lienholder</b> are superior, and (2) all maritime liens are superior to all non-maritime liens. For instance, in the United States, a federal tax lien, which is a non-maritime lien, is subordinate to every lien for supplies, fuel, repairs, etc., which are all maritime liens.|$|E
