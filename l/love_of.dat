5|$|Scholars {{generally}} compare Romeo's short-lived <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Rosaline {{with his}} later <b>love</b> <b>of</b> Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker {{than that for}} Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of Romeo and Juliet have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.|$|E

In The Strange <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself.

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence.
