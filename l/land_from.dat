5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire <b>land</b> <b>from</b> the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire <b>land</b> <b>from</b> the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring <b>land</b> <b>from</b> adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already spread over the border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build new housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E

5|$|After the Qing {{government}} {{defeated the}} Ming loyalist forces {{maintained by the}} Zheng family in 1683, parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued social unrest, the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of <b>land</b> <b>from</b> the aborigines to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining <b>land</b> <b>from</b> Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E
5|$|As the Jurassic (201–145 Ma) started, Pangaea {{began to}} break up into two continents, Gondwana and Laurasia, marking the {{beginning}} of the separation of Scotland and North America. Sea levels rose, as Britain and Ireland drifted on the Eurasian Plate to between 30° and 40° north. Most of northern and eastern Scotland including Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides remained above the advancing seas, but the south and south-west were inundated. There are only isolated sedimentary rocks remaining on <b>land</b> <b>from</b> this period, on the Sutherland coast near Golspie and, forming the Great Estuarine Group, on Skye, Mull, Raasay and Eigg. This period does however have considerable significance.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by <b>land</b> <b>from</b> the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey.

5|$|Considerable {{work was}} also {{involved}} in building the roadway up the three-percent grade at {{the east end of}} Allegheny Mountain, the steepest grade the turnpike traversed. The base of Evitts Mountain was blasted to carry the turnpike across Bedford Narrows along with US30, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and a Pennsylvania Railroad branch line. In New Baltimore, the turnpike commission had to purchase <b>land</b> <b>from</b> St. John's Church (which contained a cemetery); as part of the agreement, stairways were built {{on either side of the}} turnpike to provide access to the church.|$|E
5|$|Don Calò further {{established}} his fortune in 1922 {{when he led}} disgruntled peasants who grabbed <b>land</b> <b>from</b> the aristocratic absentee landlords. Vizzini bought three estates in the Villalba region; he divided them up and handed them over – allegedly without making a penny, according to some – to a cooperative he had founded. According to a local villager, although every peasant got a plot, Don Calò kept more than 12,000 acres (49km²) for himself.|$|E

5|$|During the 13th century, {{agricultural}} land {{around the town}} was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of <b>land</b> <b>from</b> Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale. Keswick was at {{the hub of the}} monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of Jewish settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of <b>land</b> <b>from</b> Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
