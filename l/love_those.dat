[...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I <b>love</b> <b>those</b> characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E

Lutz (John Lutz)—the staff writers of the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)—were going to be seen more in the upcoming season, to which he replied, [...] "One {{of the great things}} about this show and the blessing and the curse is that we have so many characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well. [...] And so, yeah, absolutely because we <b>love</b> <b>those</b> guys".

500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, [...] "I still <b>love</b> <b>those</b> guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on." ...|$|E

And, “…In mosque {{there are men}} who love to be clean and pure. Allah <b>loves</b> <b>those</b> who make themselves clean and pure” (9:108).|$|R
5000|$|And {{they ask}} you about menstruation.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN on September 7, 2012, where she was honored by Broadcast Music, Inc. for her songwriting, Carey declared [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] {{as one of her}} most [...] favorite and revealing songs that she has written. She stated that it is not always her number one or signature songs which are her [...] favorite, rather, they are [...] "lesser-known cuts from more obscure records." [...] When asked about how she felt about some of her number-one singles, including [...] "Hero" [...] (Music Box, 1993), [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (The Emancipation of Mimi, 2005) and [...] "Touch My Body" [...] (E=MC², 2008), the singer revealed [...] "I still <b>love</b> <b>those</b> songs, [...] I love the obscure songs because they're very close to my heart. Especially a song called 'Close My Eyes,' that's like my life story." [...] In addition to [...] "Close My Eyes," [...] Carey cited [...] "Looking In," [...] "I Am Free," [...] and [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] (Daydream, 1995) as some of her [...] favorites.|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I <b>love</b> <b>those</b> scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Veronica Mars has {{attracted}} a loyal and dedicated fan base. A group of fans calling themselves the [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading [...] "Renew Veronica Mars". The group hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series' return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. The [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] raised $50,000 in donations and through the sale of Veronica Mars clothing and tchotchkes. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars Bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>those</b> people {{and they have been}} so good to me, but it's not going to happen." [...] A feature film continuation was made possible in 2013 through a Kickstarter fund, in which 91,585 fans donated $5,702,153 to get the film made. Fans have also come to refer to themselves and be referred to as [...] "Marshmallows" [...] by media as well as the cast and crew of the series after a line delivered by Wallace (Percy Daggs III) in the pilot episode: [...] "You're a marshmallow, Veronica Mars. A Twinkie." [...] At the end of the same episode, Veronica in voiceover remarks [...] "Well, you know what they say: 'Veronica Mars, she's a marshmallow.'"

2500|$|He took up {{this theme}} {{in his first}} {{encyclical}} Deus caritas est. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: [...] "If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to <b>love</b> <b>those</b> whom God loves and who {{are in need of}} us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them." [...] Thus, he said that prayer is [...] "urgently needed... It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer {{in the face of the}} activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Overall, {{this book}} works to {{shed some light}} on what hooks sees as the modern day {{abandonment}} of love and what it means for people of today to experience love. One strong argument she proposes is how love cannot exist {{in the middle of a}} power struggle. Hooks goes as far as to present a number of problems she finds with our modern ideals of love and proposes their possible solutions. She includes the propositions of full reconstruction and transformation of modern-day love based on [...] "affection, respect, recognition, commitment, trust and care" [...] (Nonfiction Book Review). Hooks also points out what she sees to be the roots of the problems regarding modern day <b>love,</b> <b>those</b> being gender stereotypes, domination, control, ego, and aggression (Nonfiction Book Review).|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of his second novel's release Merezhkovsky was in a {{different}} cultural camp – that of Dyagilev and his close friends – Alexandre Benois, Leon Bakst, Nikolay Minsky and Valentin Serov. Their own brand new Mir Iskusstva (World of Art) magazine, with Dmitry Filosofov as a literary editor, accepted Merezhkovsky wholeheartedly. It was here that his most famous essay, L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky [...] was published in 1900–1901, coinciding with the escalation of Tolstoy's conflict with the Russian Orthodox church. Tolstoy invited the couple to his Yasnaya Polyana estate in 1904 and, to both parties' delight, the visit proved to be friendly. Behind the facade, there was little love lost between them; the old man confessed in his diary that, he just couldn't [...] "force himself to <b>love</b> <b>those</b> two," [...] and Merezhkovsky's critique of what he saw as [...] "Tolstoy's nihilism" [...] continued.|$|E
5000|$|PIJ {{called it}} [...] "البنيان المرصوص", {{also from the}} Quran, Surat 61.4, [...] "Verily, God <b>loves</b> <b>those</b> who fight in His cause in rows {{as if they were}} a solid structure" ...|$|R

2500|$|Still more {{influences}} {{include the}} novels of Thai humorist Por Intharapalit and an old Thai pop ballad, [...] "Fon Sang Fah" [...] ("When the Rain Bids the Sky Farewell"). [...] "I do <b>love</b> <b>those</b> 'rain' songs. I kept picturing a beautiful frame of two guys shooting {{each other in the}} rain. And that sparked it all", Wisit said in an interview for the film's production notes. Initially Fon Sang Fah was to be the title of the film, but eventually Fah talai jone (literally [...] "the heavens strike the thief") was chosen because the name has different meanings depending on the context. In addition to being the Thai name for an herb, Andrographis paniculata, Fah talai jone [...] "can convey either a sense of obsoleteness or the feel of great chic", the director said. [...] "In terms of the film it refers to predestination, in which most Thais believe. To put it frankly, the main reason is simply because I liked the name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baker {{described}} {{working with}} Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) and Eakes as a fun but somewhat intimidating experience. [...] "They are naturals at it!" [...] she stated. She said that Eakes helped her {{feel more comfortable}} during her first few weeks as Babe, {{and to get a}} better understanding of the character. [...] "She came up to me the first day we worked together and offered to go over lines together and help me with anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find something to keep entertained by. [...] "It seems like there is always something to do when you have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I <b>love</b> <b>those</b> ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "loving {{offenders}}" [...] in line 5 can have two meanings: that the offenders (the fair youth and the mistress) are in love; but it can also mean that they seem to enjoy their offense. This line, along with line 12, [...] "And both for my sake lay on me this cross," [...] hearken back to Sonnet 34, in which the speaker declares, [...] "The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief / To him that bears the strong offence's cross." [...] The biblical allusion of the cross ties the poet himself to Jesus in his suffering so that others might be happy, relieved of their sins. Hammond writes that he feels the author was projecting himself as a martyr, a Christ like figure bearing the cross. Hammond reads line 5, [...] "loving offenders" [...] to mean equally as a vocative or self description; saying, 'it is my nature to <b>love</b> <b>those</b> who offend against me'. [...] It appears that most critics agree that the author himself is accepting the 'cross' in this poem.|$|E
5000|$|Garry Lyon has {{commented on}} games in South Australia versus Victoria, that fans in Adelaide {{absolutely}} <b>loved</b> <b>those</b> games.

5000|$|At the lecture, {{she said}} that the underrepresentation of {{cultural}} differences may be dangerous: [...] "Now, I <b>loved</b> <b>those</b> American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>love</b> <b>those</b> little {{children}} of yours," [...] she said. [...] "And that trusting girl-wife.... Of course you love them. They're yours. Oh! they're so deeply--yours.... Yours...." ...|$|E

5000|$|And {{they ask}} thee {{concerning}} menstruation. Say, [...] "It is a harmful thing, so {{keep away from}} women during menstruation, and go not in unto them until they are clean.

50|$|The basic {{argument}} {{here is that}} if {{one only}} <b>loves</b> <b>those</b> who are close to you, you are {{no better than the}} most despised members of society, because they also show love to friends and family. Thus to be truly holy and above the sinful one must go the extra step and not only love friends, but also enemies.|$|R
5000|$|... (They like to) {{listen to}} falsehood, to devour {{anything}} forbidden. So {{if they come}} to you (O Muhammad), either judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot hurt you in the least. And if you judge, judge with justice between them. Verily, Allâh <b>loves</b> <b>those</b> who act justly. Sura Al-Maida:42 (5:42) ...|$|R
