5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} <b>light</b> <b>chain,</b> which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of <b>light</b> <b>chain,</b> κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
5|$|Myosin {{regulatory}} <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> 2, ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform (MLC-2) {{also known}} as the regulatory <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene. This cardiac ventricular RLC isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), smooth muscle (MYL12B) and cardiac atrial muscle (MYL7).|$|E
5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the <b>light</b> <b>chain).</b> As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{one of the}} myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> a {{component}} of the hexameric ATPase cellular motor protein myosin. Myosin is composed of two heavy chains, two nonphosphorylatable alkali <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> and two phosphorylatable regulatory <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> This gene product, one of the regulatory <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> is expressed in fetal muscle and in adult retina, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.|$|R
40|$|Amyloidoses are a {{group of}} {{disorders}} characterized by abnormal folding of proteins that impair organ function. We investigated the cellular response of primary cardiac fibroblasts to amyloidogenic <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and determined the corresponding change in proteoglycan expression and localization. The cellular response to 11 urinary immunoglobulin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> of κ 1, λ 6, and λ 3 subtypes was evaluated. The localization of the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was monitored by conjugating them to Oregon Green 488 and performing live cell confocal microscopy. Sulfation of the proteoglycans was determined after elution over Q 1 -columns with a single-step salt gradient (1. 5 mol/L NaCl) via dimethylmethylene blue. <b>Light</b> <b>chains</b> were detected inside cells within 4 hours and demonstrated perinuclear localization. Over 80 % of the cells showed intracellular localization of the amyloid <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> The <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> induced sulfation of the secreted glycosaminoglycans, but the cell fraction possessed only minimal sulfation. Furthermore, the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> caused a translocation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan to the nucleus. The conformation and thermal stability of <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was altered when they were incubated {{in the presence of}} heparan sulfate and destabilization of the amyloid <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was detected. These studies indicate that internalization of the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> mediates the expression and localization of heparan sulfate proteoglycans...|$|R
50|$|Despite this wide binding range, Protein L {{is not a}} {{universal}} antibody-binding protein. Protein L binding is restricted to those antibodies that contain kappa <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> In humans and mice, most antibody molecules contain kappa (κ) <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and the remainder have lambda (λ) <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> Protein L is only effective in binding certain subtypes of kappa <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> For example, it binds human VκI, VκIII and VκIV subtypes but does not bind the VκII subtype. Binding of mouse immunoglobulins is restricted to those having VκI <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{parts of}} an {{antibody}} {{have the same}} functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> of the antibody.|$|E
5|$|Ventricular myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2v) {{refers to}} the {{ventricular}} cardiac muscle form of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> 2 (Myl2). MLC-2v is a 19-KDa protein composed of 166 amino acids, that belongs to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding superfamily. MLC-2v interacts with the neck/tail region of the muscle thick filament protein myosin to regulate myosin motility and function.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the <b>light</b> <b>chain.</b> This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{isoelectric point}} (pI), sialic acid content, and {{polymerisation}} {{were made of}} 43 <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> isolated from the urine of patients with myelomatosis excreting large amounts of <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> The pIs ranged from 3. 5 - 9. 5, and 23 were greater than 7. 0. Sialylation was detected in 62 % of <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> and 69 % showed microheterogeneity of charge. There was no clear association between the pI, sialylation, or polymerisation {{and the presence of}} renal failure, as assessed by serum creatinine concentrations. <b>Light</b> <b>chains</b> with pI spectrotype in the basic range, however, were found to produce more proximal tubular dysfunction than acidic <b>light</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
50|$|Serum free light-chain {{measurement}} {{can detect}} free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in the blood. Monoclonal free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in the serum or urine are called Bence Jones proteins.|$|R
25|$|In normal individuals, free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> {{are rapidly}} cleared {{from the blood}} and catabolised by the kidneys. Monomeric free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> are cleared in 2–4 hours, and dimeric <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in 3–6 hours. Removal may be {{prolonged}} to 2–3 days in people with complete renal failure. Human kidneys are composed of approximately half a million nephrons. Each nephron contains a glomerulus with basement membrane pores that allow filtration of immunoglobulin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and other small molecules from the blood into the proximal tubule of the nephron.|$|R
5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{concentrated}} on characterizing {{the structures of}} the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by Gerald Edelman and Joseph Gally of the antibody <b>light</b> <b>chain,</b> and their realization that this protein {{is the same as}} the Bence-Jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones. Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of disulfide bond-linked heavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and antibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by Rodney Porter. Together, these scientists deduced the structure and complete amino acid sequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Fv fragment was prepared and characterized by David Givol. While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody (IgA); David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD; and Kimishige Ishizaka and Teruko Ishizaka discovered IgE and showed it was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions. In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976, Susumu Tonegawa showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab is a purified, {{recombinant}} DNA-derived chimeric human-mouse IgG {{monoclonal antibody}} {{that consists of}} mouse heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> variable regions combined with human heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> constant regions. It has a serum half-life of 9.5 days and can be detected in serum 8 weeks after infusion treatment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> {{labeled with}} {{rhodamine}} {{are incorporated into}} myosin-containing structures when microinjected into live muscle and nonmuscle cells. A mixture of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was prepared from chicken skeletal muscle, labeled with the fluorescent dye iodoacetamido rhodamine, and separated into individual labeled <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> LC- 1, LC- 2, and LC- 3. In isolated rabbit and insect myofibrils, the fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> bound in a doublet pattern in the A bands with no binding in the cross-bridge-free region {{in the center of}} the A bands. When injected into living embryonic chick myotubes and cardiac myocytes, the fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were also incorporated along the complete length of the A band with the exception of the pseudo-H zone. In young myotubes (3 - 4 d old) ...|$|R
25|$|If {{immunoglobulin}} <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> {{are produced}} in sufficient amounts {{to overwhelm the}} proximal tubules’ absorption mechanisms (usually due {{to the presence of}} a plasma cell tumour) the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> enter the distal tubules and can appear in the urine (Bence Jones protein). The passage of large amounts of immunoglobulin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> through the kidneys may cause inflammation or blockage of the kidney tubules.|$|R
50|$|Using two {{different}} species (mouse and rat) {{has the advantage}} that less mismatched antibodies are produced because rat <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> preferably pair with rat heavy <b>chains,</b> and mouse <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> with mouse heavy chains. Single species (mouse/mouse or rat/rat) quadromas, by contrast, produce up to ten different kinds of antibody, most of which have mismatched heavy or <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> or both.|$|R

25|$|There {{is also an}} {{overexpression}} of IgG-free kappa <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> {{protein in}} both CIS and RR-MS patients, compared with control subjects, together with an increased expression of an isoforms of apolipoprotein E in RR-MS. Expression of some specific proteins in circulating CD4+ T cells is {{a risk factor for}} conversion from CIS to clinically defined multiple sclerosis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo detect {{myocardial}} cell damage, serum {{samples of}} 42 consecutive patients with {{angina at rest}} were screened for cardiac myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> which were detected in 22 patients (52 %). In 17 of these patients there was a persistent release of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> lasting until the 4 th hospital day, whereas in 7 patients myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were only detectable during the initial 24 h after admission. The presence of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> correlated with signs of ischemia in the electrocardiogram (ECG) (p < 0. 05) and with the extent of coronary artery narrowing (p < 0. 05). Cardiac myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were elevated in serum only {{if there was a}} ≥ 75 % diameter narrowing in at least one major vessel. In all five patients who developed transmural myocardial infarction during the course of their hospital stay, myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were detectable ≥ 28 h before the diagnosis of myocardial infarction could be established by ECG criteria and conventional serum enzymes. Thus the detection of circulating cardiac myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> enables one to identify a subgroup of patients with angina at rest having more severe coronary artery disease with a worse outcome...|$|R
40|$|The IgD-immunoglobulin {{producing}} {{plasma cells}} of six human spleens have been localized with specific antisera {{and the type}} of the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> present in each of them has been determined by sequential staining with anti-K and anti-L antisera. About 87 per cent of IgD cells have L-type <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> This is in accord with the prevalence of L-type <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in IgD myeloma proteins...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 15 {{per cent}} of the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> from {{homogeneous}} immunoglobulins in patients with multiple myeloma contain an oligosaccharide group. Five human myeloma <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> that contained carbohydrate were studied. The sequence [Note: See the image of page 975 for this formatted text] Asn- _ -Ser/Thr was {{at the site of}} carbohydrate attachment in all <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> The carbohydrate group was attached to the asparagine residue of this triplet sequence which in all five <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was located in the variable region. The occasional occurrence of carbohydrate in myeloma <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> is seen as the consequence of a variable region mutation creating an [Note: See the image of page 975 for this formatted text] Asn- _ -Ser/Thr sequence to which carbohydrate is attached by an enzyme capable of recognizing the characteristic triplet sequence...|$|R
25|$|Perry {{continued}} his research at Birmingham, and spent considerable research on myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphorylation. Although {{he and his}} team were unable to establish the precise function of regulatory light chains in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac myosins, it laid the foundation for a whole new field of regulation of how phosphorylation regulates movement in smooth muscle and in non-muscle cells.|$|E
25|$|The NO {{produced}} by {{this process is}} a potent activator of guanylyl cyclase (GC) by heme-dependent mechanisms; this activation results in formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Among other roles, cGMP serves as a substrate for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that activates myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphatase. Thus, production of NO from exogenous sources such as GTN increases the level of cGMP within the cell, and stimultates dephosphorylation of myosin.|$|E
25|$|To reduce murine {{antibody}} immunogenicity (attacks by {{the immune}} system against the antibody), murine molecules were engineered to remove immunogenic content and to increase immunologic efficiency. This was initially achieved by the production of chimeric (suffix -ximab) and humanized antibodies (suffix -zumab). Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Taking human gene sequences from the kappa <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> and the IgG1 heavy chain results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces immunogenicity, and thus increases serum half-life.|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 38 {{patients}} with immunoglobulin free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> (kappa and/or lambda) in the cerebrospinal fluid was studied. Only {{five of them}} showed one band of kappa free <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> 36 of them showed one or more bands of lambda free <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> There were 33 multiple sclerosis patients among them and they were compared with 33 control multiple sclerosis patients {{who did not have}} free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> but only showed an oligoclonal pattern of immunoglobulins in their CSF. Of several clinical and pathological parameters, only three were statistically significant: (A) for all patients, {{as well as for the}} multiple sclerosis patients alone, elevated numbers of free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> of type lambda were associated with the elevated numbers of white blood cells in the CSF (p less than 0. 003), (B) for multiple sclerosis patients, elevated numbers of free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> of type lambda were associated with associated with shorter time intervals between the last relapse and the date of the lumbar puncture (p less than 0. 004) and (C) also with shorter duration of the disease (p less than 0. 01). The presence of lambda free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in the cerebrospinal fluid seems to indicate that recent antigenic stimulation has occurred within the central nervous system following exacerbation. The inverse association of the number of lambda free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> with the duration of the disease is suggestive of a pathological expression of the "burning out" phenomenon of the multiple sclerosis process...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Six {{immunological}} parameters, {{of which}} the most important are the quantitative distribution of the free <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> and the kappa-lambda ratios of both bound and free <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> were investigated in serum of patients affected with various neurological disorders and compared to controls. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and viral encephalitis, which are diseases characterized by hyperimmunisation against definite antigens, are accompanied by a considerable quantitative increase of free light chains; in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis serum there is an increase of both free kappa and lambda chains, whereas in viral encephalitis serum the increase of free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was restricted to lambda chains. There is a good correlation between the kappa-lambda ratio of, on the one hand, bound <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and, on the other hand, free <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> for controls and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; but in multiple sclerosis, amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis and viral encephalitis, the ratios for bound <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> are totally different from ratios for free ligjit chains. A general kappa increase, which we earlier reported for bound <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in 16 cases of multiple sclerosis, was not confirmed by the investigation of an additional 26 cases: kappa decrease was also noticed in {{a considerable number of}} cases.

40|$|The {{non-specific}} Ca 2 +-binding {{sites of}} skeletal-muscle myosin {{are located on}} the light chains; with the dissociation of <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> there is a corresponding {{decrease in the number}} of Ca 2 +-binding sites on light-chain-deficient myosin. The released <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> have a decreased binding affinity. Myosin heavy chains indirectly influence the Ca 2 +-binding properties of <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> by increasing the affinity of <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> for bivalent cations; this influence varies with pH. Because of light-chain dissociation at low Ca 2 + and/or Mg 2 + concentrations, anomalies may exist when analyses of non-specific Ca 2 +-binding properties of myosin are assessed by dialysis equilibrium...|$|R
25|$|A {{series of}} studies, principally from the Mayo Clinic, have {{indicated}} that patients with an abnormal free kappa / free lambda ratio have {{an increased risk of}} progression to active myeloma from precursor conditions including Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), Smoldering myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma of the bone. Abnormal free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> production has also been reported to be prognostic of a worse outcome in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. An abnormal light-chain ratio has been defined as a kappa/lambda chain ratio of less than 0.26 or more than 1.65.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of free immunoglobulin light chains in normal individuals is approximately 500mg/day from bone marrow and lymph node cells. There is approximately 40% excess immunoglobulin light-chain production over immunoglobulin heavy-chain synthesis. Possibly {{this is simply}} to allow proper conformation of the intact immunoglobulin molecules, but an immunological role for the free light chains has also been proposed. There are approximately twice as many kappa-producing plasma cells as lambda plasma cells. Kappa free-light chains are normally monomeric, while lambda free-light chains tend to be dimeric, joined by disulphide bonds. Polymeric forms of both types of free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> can also occur.|$|E
25|$|Immunoglobulin G (IgG) {{antibodies}} {{are large}} heterodimeric molecules, approximately 150 kDa and {{are composed of}} two kinds of polypeptide chain, called the heavy (~50kDa) and the <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> (~25kDa). The two types of light chains are kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). By cleavage with enzyme papain, the Fab (fragment-antigen binding) part can {{be separated from the}} Fc (fragment constant) part of the molecule. The Fab fragments contain the variable domains, which consist of three antibody hypervariable amino acid domains responsible for the antibody specificity embedded into constant regions. The four known IgG subclasses are involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.|$|E
40|$|Myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> {{labeled with}} {{rhodamine}} {{are incorporated into}} myosin- containing structures when microinjected into live muscle and nonmuscle cells. A mixture of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was prepared from chicken skeletal muscle, labeled with the fluorescent dye iodoacetamido rhodamine, and separated into individual labeled <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> LC- 1, LC- 2, and LC- 3. In isolated rabbit and insect myofibrils, the fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> bound in a doublet pattern in the A bands with no binding in the cross-bridge-free region {{in the center of}} the A bands. When injected into living embryonic chick myotubes and cardiac myocytes, the fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were also incorporated along the complete length of the A band with the exception of the pseudo-H zone. In young myotubes (3 - 4 d old), myosin was localized in aperiodic as well as periodic fibers. The doublet A band pattern first appeared in 5 -d-old myotubes, which also exhibited the first signs of contractility. In 6 -d and older myotubes, A bands became increasingly more aligned, their edges sharper, and the separation between them (I bands) wider. In nonmuscle cells, the microinjected fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were incorporated in a striated pattern in stress fibers and were absent from foci and attachment plaques. When the stress fibers of live injected cells were disrupted with DMSO, fluorescently labeled myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were present in the cytoplasm but did not enter the nucleus. Removal of the DMSO led to the reformation of banded, fluorescent stress fibers within 45 min. In dividing cells, myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were concentrated in the cleavage furrow and became reincorporated in stress fibers after cytokinesis. Thus, injected nonmuscle cells can disassemble and reassemble contractile fibers using hybrid myosin molecules that contain muscle <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and nonmuscle heavy chains. Our experiments demonstrate that fluorescently labeled myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> from muscle can be readily incorporated into muscle and nonmuscle myosins and then used to follow the dynamics of myosin distribution in living cells...|$|R
