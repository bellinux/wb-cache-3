All three subspecies of white lupin (subsp. graecus Franko et Silva, subsp. termis Ponert., subsp. albus) occur on the Balkans, and it is mainly in this region that wild forms with dotted dark-brown seeds and dark-blue flowers are found (subsp. graecus). Additional confirmation is the Greek name of white lupin: “thermos” (hot). The centers of diversity of cultivated white lupin also include the Apennines and Egypt where cultivated forms of white lupin originated in the ancient times. Moreover, in the ancient Egypt forms with pink-and-blue or light-pink flowers were spread (subsp. termis), and on the Apennines forms with grayish-and-light-blue or white flowers were distributed (subsp. albus.

The main effects of ws on chemical composition of different organs were a decrease in total oil and an increase in total soluble sugar content in leaves; an increase in both oil and soluble sugars in stems; and a decrease in total oil and total soluble sugar content in seeds.

The pathogen {{is a member}} of the C. acutatum species complex, and contrasts with other members of the latter by its host specificity and by its apparent low genetic variability. Primary seed infections as low as 0. 01 - 0. 1 % can cause very severe infections. Under this conditions, one the most effective management strategies is the development of a robust and sensitive seed detection assay to screen seed lots before planting. PCR-based detection systems exhibit higher levels of sensitivity than conventional techniques but when applied to seed tests they require the extraction of PCRquality DNA from target organisms in backgrounds of saprophytic organisms and inhibitory seed-derived compounds. To overcome these limitations a new detection protocol for C. lupini based on a biological enrichment step followed by a PCR assay was developed.
