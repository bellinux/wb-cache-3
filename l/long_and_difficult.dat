5|$|The {{development}} of Anachronox was <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult,</b> originally planned for a third-quarter 1998 release.

Ion Storm closed its Dallas offices {{one month after the}} game's release. In 2002, Anachronox cinematic director Jake Hughes spliced together gameplay footage and cutscenes to create a feature-length, award-winning machinima film.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{principal}} French squadrons departed Brest on 13 December, remaining {{together for the first}} two days before dividing in pursuit of separate British merchant convoys on 15 December. The squadron under Leissègues clashed with the convoy's escort, before breaking off and sailing south for the French Caribbean, where Leissègues was intending to land the 1,000 soldiers carried aboard as reinforcements for the garrison at Santo Domingo, via the Azores. The voyage was <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult,</b> Leissègues struggling through winter storms that divided his squadron and inflicted severe damage to his ships. Arriving at Santo Domingo on 20 January, Leissègues disembarked his troops and began extensive repairs to his ships in preparation for raiding cruises in the Caribbean.|$|E

5|$|In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland {{as well as}} Grand Duke of Lithuania {{and turned}} the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, {{including}} the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult,</b> and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Terra Nova {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} first squad-oriented games with {{three-dimensional}} (3D) graphics; the player is often assisted by artificially intelligent teammates who may be given tactical commands. Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game, , Terra Nova was subject to a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> development process, caused in part by the production of its full motion video cutscenes. The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such effects as procedural animation.|$|E

5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|Antichrist Superstar was {{recorded}} at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians, {{including members of}} Marilyn Manson (namely the band's eponymous vocalist, Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Daisy Berkowitz, and Ginger Fish) and Nine Inch Nails (guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner, and drummer Chris Vrenna). Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The process of creating the album was reputedly a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, with most of this directed toward founding member Daisy Berkowitz.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany {{maintained}} a relatively normal relationship {{as they were}} united by anti-Polish sentiment. In January 1928, after <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> negotiations, Germany and Lithuania signed a border treaty, which left Klaipėda on the Lithuanian side. However, tensions began rising in the 1930s after the Weimar Republic was replaced with Nazi Germany. An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of pro-Nazi activists. In response to these arrests and trials, Germany declared a boycott of Lithuanian agricultural imports. The boycott caused an economic crisis in Suvalkija (southern Lithuania), where farmers organized violent protests. However, after the plebiscite in Saar most of the pro-Nazi prisoners received amnesty. In {{the wake of the}} amnesties, Lithuanian prestige suffered both abroad and in Klaipėda, allowing Germany to strengthen its influence in the region.|$|E

5|$|India {{had been}} {{approached}} {{as a possible}} customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly {{on the grounds that}} it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service. India had already its Marut fighter-bomber, and tried to upgrade it with new engines, until the new project collapsed. A decade later IAF would become the largest single export customer, with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> evaluation process. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name Shamsher ("Sword of Justice").|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor {{condition of the}} roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult,</b> and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Moreno {{family was}} poor, but {{could afford a}} house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, {{was one of the}} few literate women in Buenos Aires. Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of {{fourteen}} children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money. The <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later. Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.|$|E

5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E
