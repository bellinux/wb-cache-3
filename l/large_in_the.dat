5|$|In the Fourth Circuit case of Saunders v Wilkins (1945), Saunders {{claimed that}} Virginia should have its Congressional {{representation}} reduced {{because of its}} use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions. The plaintiff sued {{for the right to}} run for Congress at <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was dismissed as a political question.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch-Mataram {{victory at}} Kediri {{weakened}} Trunajaya's rebellion. However, {{the war was}} not over. Trunajaya and his retinue was still at <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highlands of Malang around east Java; he was not captured until December 1679. His ally Raden Kajoran established a new base in Mlambang, Central Java, and engaged in successful operations there up to his death in September 1679. Amangkurat's brother Pangeran Puger still held Mataram's court at Plered where he maintained a rival claim to the throne until 1681. Amangkurat also faced difficulty in establishing his authority in Cirebon and Madura.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> view of the girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} diurnal {{variation}} of <b>the</b> air-pressure system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urban Tokyo. <b>In</b> summer, <b>the</b> pressure drop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban Tokyo, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downtown Tokyo. After sunset, firstly the pressure rise is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downtown Tokyo, thereafter is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban Tokyo. <b>In</b> winter, <b>the</b> diurnal variation is almost opposite. Commonly, while the area-averaged air-pressure drops, the pressure drop is firstly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downtown; while rises, the pressure rise is firstly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban. The development of local cyclones/anticyclones and semi-diurnal atmospheric tides {{also contribute to}} these diurnal variations...|$|R

5|$|Willaumez's {{squadron}} {{remained at}} <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic until July 1806, when a hurricane scattered the vessels along the American Seaboard where British patrols {{were waiting to}} intercept them. Of the 11 ships that set out in December 1805, just four eventually returned to France. The crews of the British squadron were decorated for their success, {{with the exception of}} Duckworth, who shared in the general thanks but was otherwise unrewarded. By leaving his post off Cadiz he had provoked the anger of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in the Mediterranean; only his victory enabled Duckworth to escape a court martial.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too <b>large.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Hastings was {{nominated}} to represent Iowa at <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States House of Representatives as a Democrat.

He served during the second session of the 29th United States Congress, which ended on March 3, 1847. Close to a year after his term ended {{as a member of}} the House of Representatives, Governor Ansel Briggs appointed him as the third Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court. He started his term on January 26, 1848, and resigned on January 14, 1849 to move to California, his family deciding to stay in Iowa.|$|E

25|$|The Sino-Soviet rift and the {{obsession}} with Khrushchev's revisionism looms <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{coming of the}} Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw revisionism and de-Stalinization as a threat not only to his own position {{but also to the}} very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang's role as a supporter of Mao's line in this period helps explain his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.|$|E
25|$|An icon is a {{religious}} work of art, most commonly a painting, from Orthodox Christianity. Christianity has used symbolism from its very beginnings.

25|$|Traditional {{folk music}} often {{includes}} sung words, although folk instrumental music occurs commonly in dance music traditions. Narrative verse looms <b>large</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional folk music of many cultures.

Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent in medias res plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of battles or describe tragedies or natural disasters.|$|E
