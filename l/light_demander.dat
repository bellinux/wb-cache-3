50|$|Tecomella undulata is a {{deciduous}} {{or nearly}} evergreen tree of arid and semi arid regions. It occurs on flat and undulating areas including gentle hill slopes and sometimes also in ravines. It is well adapted to drained loamy to sandy loam soil having pH 6.5-8.0. The species thrives very well on stabilized sand dunes, which experience extreme {{low and high}} temperatures. It grows in areas of scanty rainfall (annual 150-500mm) and high temperature (35 °C to 48 °C). It can withstand extreme low temperature (0 °C to &minus;2 °C) during winter and high temperature (48 °C to 50 °C) in summers. The tree is a strong <b>light</b> <b>demander.</b> It is drought, frost, fire and wind hardy. At the time of flowering (December-February) it produces beautiful showy flowers in yellow, orange and red colours. Three types of flower bearing trees can be observed near {{to each other in}} the same vicinity.|$|E
40|$|To develop {{silvicultural}} {{guidelines for}} high-value timber species of Central African moist forests, we assessed {{the performance of}} the pioneer Milicia excelsa (iroko, Moraceae), and of the non-pioneer <b>light</b> <b>demander</b> Pericopsis elata (assamela, Fabaceae) in logging gaps and in plantations in highly degraded areas in south-eastern Cameroon. The survival and size of each seedling was regularly monitored in the silvicultural experiments. Differences in performance and allometry were tested between species in logging gaps and in plantations. The two species performance in logging gaps was significantly different from plantations and concurred with the expectations of the performance trade-off hypothesis but not with the expectations of species light requirements. The pioneer M.  excelsa survived significantly better in logging gaps while the non-pioneer P. elata grew significantly faster in plantations. The high mortality and slow growth of M. excelsa in plantations is surprising for a pioneer species but could be explained by herbivory (attacks from a gall-making psyllid). Identifying high-value native timber species (i) with good performance in plantations such as P. elata is of importance to restore degraded areas; and (ii) with good performance in logging gaps such as M. excelsa is of importance to maintain timber resources and biodiversity in production forests...|$|E
40|$|Background Light is {{a driver}} of {{tropical}} forest dynamics and {{key to understanding}} the coexistence of dipterocarps, and how their key demographic rates and traits trade-off with acclimation to light. Aims Light is a driver of tropical forest dynamics and key to understanding the coexistence of dipterocarps, and how their key demographic rates and traits trade-off with acclimation to light. Methods We {{examined the relationship between}} size-specific growth rates (SGR), wood density and total non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration under experimental shade house conditions. Results Based on their functional response to light acclimation we grouped dipterocarps into <b>light</b> <b>demanders,</b> shade-tolerants and a generalist species. <b>Light</b> <b>demanders</b> respond to a simulated gap opening with increased growth, whereas shade-tolerants and the generalist show a higher relative change in wood density and NSC concentration, including starch and water soluble carbohydrates. Iditol–a hitherto unknown alditol in dipterocarps–was identified across all six species, and the generalist responded to a gap opening with a significantly reduced relative change in alditol concentration compared to <b>light</b> <b>demanders</b> and shade-tolerants. Conclusions Selected dipterocarps can be grouped into <b>light</b> <b>demanders</b> and shade-tolerants based on their acclimation to light, however, the generalist species did not follow the proposed growth-storage trade-off. </p...|$|R
40|$|The tree {{community}} (dbh > 5 cm) of {{a fragment}} of tropical montane semi-deciduous forest in South-east Brazil was repeatedly surveyed over a 19 -year period {{in order to assess}} spatial and temporal patterns of dynamics. The surveys took place in 1987, 1992, 1996, 2001, and 2006 in a grid of 126 20 × 20 m permanent plots covering almost the entire fragment (5. 8 ha). Overall patterns indicated that a self-thinning process has taken place in the fragment since 1992. Community dynamics varied in space and time, with most dynamics highly spatially clustered. With exception of mortality rates, there were no changes in the spatial patterns of community dynamics through time. No relation between edges and dynamics variables was found.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} in forestry in the tropics {{is the lack of}} information on the impact of canopy disturbance through logging. The degree of canopy opening that should be allowed during logging to enhance natural regeneration of timber tree species is not known. Information on the seedling ecology of individual species and ecological species groups on which to base management decisions are also lacking. Experiments to determine the ecophysiological responses of seedlings of timber tree species to different irradiances in two forest sites were carried out. The two forest reserves are Nkrabia and Tinte Bepo in the Moist Evergreen and Moist Semi-Deciduous Forest Types, respectively. Eight species, representing three Shade Bearers, four Non-Pioneer <b>Light</b> <b>Demanders</b> and one Pioneer species, were grown in a series of artificially-created gaps in two forest sites differing in annual rainfall. The forest shade received 1 - 2 % irradiance, while the artificial gaps received 5, 10, 15, 30 and 65 % irradiance. Seedling growth was greater at Nkrabia Forest Reserve (Moist Evergreen Forest Type) than at Tinte Bepo Forest Reserve (Moist Semi-Deciduous Forest Type). This is probably due to the lower soil moisture stress at Nkrabia as a result of more rainfall. Lower moisture stress at Nkrabia may also explain the greater leaf area and specific leaf area ratios, lower leaf turnover and lower number of smal...|$|R
40|$|Ecology and {{management}} of the multipurpose Erythrophleum species (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) in Africa. A review. Introduction. Widespread in Africa, the Erythrophleum genus includes four tropical tree species with a high economic and socio-cultural value: Erythrophleum ivorense, Erythrophleum suaveolens, Erythrophleum africanum and Erythrophleum lasianthum. Appropriate knowledge of the ecology and the distribution of these species is required for their sustainable management. This paper is based on an extensive literature review and summarizes the available information on the African Erythrophleum species in terms of botany, phylogeography, ecology, forestry and ethnobotany. Literature. Erythrophleum ivorense, E. suaveolens, E. africanum and E. lasianthum are morphologically different and occur in distinct climatic areas. They are non-pioneer <b>light</b> <b>demander</b> (E. ivorense and E. suaveolens) or pioneer species (E. africanum). Their primary mode of dispersal is via ballochore. The seeds have a dormancy period and can remain in the soil for several years. Their reproductive and foliar phenologies are regular and annual. Growth rate varies between species, ranging from 0. 65 cm per year for E. ivorense to 0. 16 cm per year for E. africanum. These trees are used in traditional medicine. Only E. ivorense and E. suaveolens (Tali) are mainly logged for timber. Conclusions. Erythrophleum species ecological data are better informed for E. ivorense and E. suaveolens because of their economic importance. This review highlights the existing lack of knowledge regarding the phenology (effects of climate, fructification periods), the minimum diameter of fructification and the mechanisms of natural seed dormancy breakage. Targeting such weaknesses is required to create or re-evaluate methods of conservation and/or enhancement of populations and logging practices...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the interaction between}} lianas and tree seedlings in contrasting canopy openness environments.   For this purpose tree and liana seedlings with distinct light requirements were planted in large and small gaps and in the forest understorey in a tropical moist semideciduous forest in Ghana.   The competition for above- and below-ground resources between liana and tree seedlings was also evaluated under two levels of irradiance (7 and 27 % PAR) in a shadehouse environment.   The rates of growth and photosynthetic response to changes in irradiance were also compared between liana and pioneer tree seedlings in a greenhouse. The data showed that canopy openness moderated the interaction between liana and tree seedlings.   The direction of the interaction was both liana and tree species specific.   Liana competition effects were stronger in the sites with greater canopy openness and on {{the growth of the}} non-pioneer <b>light</b> <b>demander</b> tree, while the pioneer and non-pioneer shade bearer trees were less affected.   By having differential effects on the trees, lianas could indirectly promote the regeneration of both the pioneers and the more shade tolerant species.   The competition for below-ground resources had the main effects on the interaction within the first year.   An increase in the effects of the above-ground competition could be expected in later years.   The photosynthetic response to the increase in irradiance was similar among pioneer trees and liana species.   The results indicated that lianas can limit the regeneration in big forest canopy gaps in tropical forests by outcompeting tree seedlings.   Lianas might affect the forest community by altering the competitive ability of tree species during regeneration.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was made on}} a young forest of naturally grown. Luchu pines (Pinus luchuensis Mayr) in Yona Forest of University of the Ryukyus which {{is located in the}} north of Okinawa Island. According to the density of trees, the forest was divided into seven (7) plots, and the trees in each plot were classified into four (4) hight classes in accordance with the height of the trees・・・・classes : 0 - 3 m, 3 - 4 m, 4 - 5 m, and 5 m up. As the result of measurements of the amount of leaves, volumes of stems and branches, and stem anylysis of every tree, the following were found : 1. The ages of the trees are between 7 and 12 years. The plots are narrow areas where the land conditions are similar. The number of trees per ha in each plot is between 8, 426 and 20, 899. The number of trees in each plot is vanous. 2. The average height of trees in the plots are between 3. 88 and 4. 31 m. The average height of trees of the tallest height class (over 5 m) which are not suppressed are between 5. 18 and 5. 66 m. The calculated average age of trees in each plot is between 7. 75 and 8. 75. 3. In each plot, the trees which belong to the height classes of 4 - 5 m (average trees) and 5 m up (dominant trees) are more numerous. One plot has 48 % of those classes of trees; another, 53 %; {{and the rest of the}} plots, between 60 and 75 %. 4. Since the Ryukyuan pine is <b>light</b> <b>demander,</b> the difference in height due to age and the growth rate while small is closely related to the differences in the growths of diameter, the volume of stem, the amount of leaves, the volume of branches, etc. 5. The growth in the first one and two years is relatively small, and the difference in height is small; but in the second to third year, the growth rate of trees is generally increased, and the difference among the trees becomes greater. From the fourth to fifth year on, the difference of the growth rate of the trees becomes much more greater, -there are some which show very great growth rate, and some which show smaller growth rate than when they were in the second and third years. 6. The diameters at the land level of 7 year old trees are between 1. 63 and 6. 30 cm, and those at the height of breast are between 0. 98 and 8. 08. There are great differences of diameters among the height classes. The trees of the Class 5 m up have especially greater diameters and those of Class 4 to 5 m have relatively large diameters, but those of the smaller height classes have much smaller diameters. 7. The stem volume of each tree of 7 years old is between 0. 0002025 and 0. 0049450 m^ 3 That of Class 5 m up is the largest, that of Class 4 - 5 m is relatively large, but those of the smaller height classes have much smaller volumes. The tree of Class 0 - 3 m has especially small volume. 8. The stem volume per ha of each plot is between 40, 880 and 26, 530 m^ 3, dry weight of leaves is between 4. 72 and 2. 32 tons, and the branch volume is between 7. 09 and 2. 79 m^ 3. In 1958, the previous year of the year the {{research was}} done, the growth of stem volume was between 2. 83 and 1. 27 m^ 3. 9. The quantity and increment of stem per ha are closely related to the distribution of the numbers of trees in the height classes. The plots which have 9, 927 to 11, 905 trees that belong to Class 4 m up are greater. The lesser the trees of Class 4 m up, the smaller. 10. The increments of stems of the four height classes in 1957 are ranged from 0. 0000443 to 0. 0016760 m^ 3, and in 1958 they are from 0. 0000548 to 0. 0017474 m^ 3. There are great differences among the height classes. It is greatest in Class 5 m up, and relatively great in Class 4 - 5 m, but it is much more smaller in the smaller height classes. Especially it is much smaller in Class 0 - 3 m, which indicates slow growth due to suppression. 11. The branch volume of a tree in each height class is from 14 to 1797 cc. It is especially greater in Class 5 m up; and the smaller the height classes, the smaller the volume. The branch volume per ha in each plot is from 2. 79 and 7. 09 m^ 3. 12. The dry weight of leaves per tree in the height classes ranges from 28 to 940 gr; the upper height classes are greater. 13. The increment of volume of stem per one gramme of dry weight of leaves in each height class in 1958 is between 0. 73 and 4. 14 cc. It is highest in Class 45 m, and is slightly smaller in Class 5 m up, and Class 3 - 4 m, but it is very small in Class 0 - 3 m. 14. The stem volume, quantity of leaves, stem increment per unit of leaves, etc. per ha in each plot are closely related to the number of trees belonging to Class 5 m up and Class 4 - 5 m that are of highest and average trees; the greater the number of these trees, the greater these quantities. Therefore, it is important in raising Ryukyuan pines to increase the number of trees evenly growing in height by sowing as many seeds as possible and making them germinate evenly...|$|E
40|$|In the Congo Basin {{where most}} timber species are light-demanding, the low logging intensities {{commonly}} implemented (1 - 2 trees harvested ha? 1) {{do not provide}} sufficient canopy gaps to ensure species regeneration. The regeneration of light-demanding timber species may therefore benefit from more intensive logging, or from post-harvest treatments such as thinning by poison girdling that increases light penetration. Little is known {{of the impact of}} post-harvest treatments on the floristic composition of tropical moist forests. This study therefore aimed to assess the effects of low and high selective logging (? 2. 33 and 4. 73 trees harvested ha? 1, and ? 4. 96 and 9. 16 m 2 ha? 1 of basal area removed (logging + damage), respectively) - followed or not by thinning (? 21. 14 trees thinned ha? 1, and ? 6. 57 m 2 ha? 1 of basal area removed) - on the floristic composition of a tropical moist forest in the Central African Republic, from 7 to 23 years after logging. We analyzed abundance data for 110 tree genera recorded every year for 14 years in 25 one-hectare permanent subplots. We used multivariate analysis to detect floristic variations between treatments and we assessed changes in floristic composition throughout the period. We compared floristic composition recovery between thinned and unthinned subplots, using unlogged subplots as a reference characterizing the pre-logging floristic composition. Logging and thinning had little impact on the floristic composition of the subplots as quantified 7 to 23 years later, though they did increase the proportion of pioneer species. Surprisingly, additional thinning at both logging levels failed to further distance floristic composition from that of the unlogged subplots, though it did increase disturbance intensity. Floristic composition recovery appeared to be facilitated when thinning was associated with logging. Thinning seemed to favor the growth and survival of non-pioneer species, to the detriment of pioneer species. These non-pioneer species could either be non-pioneer <b>light</b> <b>demanders</b> or shade-bearers. One explanation for this is that thinning by tree-poison girdling increased light availability without causing major damage to the forest, and thus increased the growth and survival of advance regeneration. The resulting enhanced competition then reduced the survival of pioneer species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Timber {{production}} {{is an important}} economic sector in most forested countries of Central Africa, where about 14 million hectares of lowland moist forests are now planned for management. This {{production is}} expected to be sustainable, but the actual impact of logging on biodiversity is still questioned. To answer this question, we used a unique long-term controlled experiment implemented more than 20 years ago in an old-growth semi-deciduous moist forest of the Central African Republic (CAR). We tested whether (i) anthropogenic disturbances associated with silvicultural operations had an effect on the composition and diversity of tree communities, and (ii) there is a relationship between diversity and disturbance intensity in those forests. For this, we botanically identified all trees ? 10 cm DBH in 28 1 -ha plots where no treatment (controls), logging and logging + thinning operations were implemented 24 years ago and created a strong gradient of disturbance. We investigated the relationships between five diversity indices and a disturbance index calculated for each 1 -ha plot, for all species and separately for three regeneration guilds. We found a strong positive monotonic relationship between the intensity of disturbance and the percentage of pioneer species in the tree communities, which proved to be equally detrimental, in terms of relative abundance, to the non-pioneer light-demanding and the shade-bearing species. Overall, disturbance appeared to have a weak monotonous negative effect on diversity, irrespective to the index considered. The diversity of shade-bearers slightly decreased along the disturbance gradient without significant decrease in species density; disturbance had no effect on non-pioneer <b>light</b> <b>demanders,</b> but a clear significant negative effect on the diversity of pioneers, with a significant decrease in species density. This negative effect was associated with the massive recruitment of the early-successional, fast-growing Musanga cecropioides R. Br. (Urticaceae), which rapidly preempted space and resources in the most disturbed plots. Despite this effect, disturbance did not significantly affect the local heterogeneity in species distribution. These results suggest that the semi-deciduous moist forests of CAR are locally resilient to small-scale disturbances associated with silvicultural operations. This may be a consequence of the past anthropogenic and/or climatic disturbances, which have been stronger and more long-lasting than elsewhere within the tropical forest biome, and would have removed the most vulnerable species. Because logging intensity in these forests is usually low, we do not expect any direct major impact on tree species diversity, at least after the first felling cycle. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
