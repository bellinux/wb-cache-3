40|$|The {{distribution}} of global photometric, spectroscopic, structural and morphological parameters for a well defined sample of 350 nearby galaxies has been examined. The usual trends were recovered demonstrating that E/S 0 galaxies are redder, more quiescent, more centrally concentrated and possess larger Sersic indices than later type galaxies. Multivariate statistical {{analyses were performed}} to examine the {{distribution of}} all parameters simultaneously. The main result of these analyses was the existence of only two classes of galaxies, corresponding closely to early and <b>late</b> <b>types.</b> Linear discriminant analysis was able to reproduce the classifications of early and <b>late</b> <b>types</b> galaxies with high success, but further refinement of galaxy types was not reproduced in the distribution of observed galaxy properties. A principal components analysis showed that the major variance of the parameter set corresponded to a distinction between early and <b>late</b> <b>types,</b> highlighting the importance of the distinction. A hierarchical clustering analysis revealed only two clear natural classes within the parameter set, closely corresponding to early and <b>late</b> <b>types.</b> Early and <b>late</b> <b>types</b> are clearly distinct and the distinction is of fundamental importance. In contrast, <b>late</b> <b>types</b> from Sa to Irr are smoothly distributed throughout the parameter space. A population of galaxies classified by eye as elliptical/lenticular, and exhibiting concentration indices similar to early-types were found to have a significant star-formation activity. These galaxies are preferentially faint, suggesting they are low-mass systems. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 17 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
50|$|De Vaucouleurs also {{assigned}} {{numerical values}} to each class of galaxy in his scheme. Values of the numerical Hubble stage T run from −6 to +10, with negative numbers corresponding to early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) and positive numbers to <b>late</b> <b>types</b> (spirals and irregulars). Elliptical galaxies {{are divided into}} three 'stages': compact ellipticals (cE), normal ellipticals (E) and <b>late</b> <b>types</b> (E+). Lenticulars are similarly subdivided into early (S−), intermediate (S0) and <b>late</b> (S+) <b>types.</b> Irregular galaxies can be of type magellanic irregulars (T = 10) or 'compact' (T = 11).|$|R

40|$|We {{identify}} a spectroscopic sequence of galaxies, {{analogous to the}} Hubble sequence of morphological types, based on the Automatic Spectroscopic K-means (ASK) classification. Considering galaxy spectra as multidimensional vectors, {{the majority of the}} spectral classes are distributed along a well defined curve going from the earliest to the <b>latest</b> <b>types,</b> suggesting that the optical spectra of normal galaxies can be described in terms of a single affine parameter. Optically-bright active galaxies, however, appear as an independent, roughly orthogonal branch that intersects the main sequence exactly at the transition between early and <b>late</b> <b>types.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
