Peak demand <b>limiting</b> <b>control,</b> which gained substantial attention recently, is {{an efficient way to}} reduce it. Most of previous studies either focus on the daily peak demand reduction without taking account the related energy rise, or explore the relationship between energy rise and demand reduction only on a daily basis. Unlike the previous studies, a new demand <b>limiting</b> <b>control</b> strategy is proposed in this paper in order to maximize the monthly cost saving. The new strategy is realized as follows. At first step, a proper monthly demand threshold is identified. At second step, a specific approach, named as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm, is implemented to restrain the daily peak demand to the given threshold by adjusting the indoor room temperature set-point. The extended pre-cooling duration is also estimated at this step based on the difference between the predicted daily peak demand and the identified threshold. The results of case studies show that the proposed strategy can substantially reduce the monthly electricity cost. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the online optimal control strategies for multiple-chiller plants in large buildings with enhanced robustness and cost efficiency, including optimization of chilled water supply temperature set-point, chiller sequencing control, optimal start control and electrical demand <b>limiting</b> <b>control.</b> The chilled water supply temperature set-point optimization aims {{to minimize the}} total energy consumption of chillers and chilled water distribution pumps. In the chiller sequencing control, three schemes are used to enhance its control robustness, including a data fusion scheme for improved reliability of building cooling load measurement, a simplified adaptive model of maximum chiller cooling capacity, and an online sensor fault detection and diagnosis(FDD). In the chiller optimal start control, a model-based strategy is proposed for minimizing the energy consumption in the morning start period. The model-based optimal start control strategy considers both the recovery ability and the pre-cooling lead time as its optimizing variables. The peak demand <b>limiting</b> <b>control</b> strategy minimizes the monthly electricity bill by predicting a suitable monthly peak demand threshold and restraining the daily peak demand to the threshold. These control strategies are validated using the dynamic simulation of the central chiller plant in a high-rising building in Hong Kong. © All Rights Reserved...|$|E

40|$|Peak demand cost usually {{contributes}} a {{large proportion}} of the total electricity bills in buildings. Using existing building facilities for power demand limiting has been verified as effective measures to reduce monthly peak demands and associated costs. Fire service water tanks exist in most commercial buildings. This paper presents a comprehensive study on how to effectively retrofit existing building fire service water tanks as chilled water storage for power demand limiting. Important technical and economic factors that may affect the implementation of the proposed retrofitting are addressed. Two retrofitting schemes, i. e. a small δT (storage temperature difference) scheme and a large δT scheme are proposed for integrating the chilled water storage system into an existing all-air system and an existing air-water air conditioning system, respectively. Two optimal demand <b>limiting</b> <b>control</b> strategies, i. e. time-based control and demand-based control, are proposed for maximizing the monthly peak demand reduction of buildings with regular and variable peak occurring time, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of different retrofitting schemes in three real buildings in Hong Kong is analysed. Results show that substantial cost savings can be achieved with short payback periods (0. 7 - 2. 6 years) for the retrofits in these three buildings. Practical application: This paper presents a techno-economic analysis on retrofitting existing building fire service water tanks as chilled water storage for power demand limiting and operational cost saving. The proposed retrofitting schemes and demand <b>limiting</b> <b>control</b> strategies enable chilled water storage systems to be readily applied to most existing buildings. Building owners can benefit from the peak demand cost saving as the monthly peak demand can be significantly reduced by using chilled water storage. The extra costs involved in tank retrofits and system integrations can be paid back within three years. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

We present a flexible architecture for networked control using multiple nodes connected in series over analog erasure channels without acknowledgments. The control architecture proposed adapts to changes in network conditions, by allowing the role played by individual nodes to depend upon transmission outcomes. We adopt stochastic models for transmission outcomes and characterize the distribution of controller location and the covariance of system states. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed architecture has the potential to give better performance than <b>limiting</b> <b>control</b> calculations to be carried out at a fixed node. I...|$|E
