40|$|Optimizing water usage is {{the primary}} {{objective}} of intelligent and eco-friendly agricultural irrigation systems. In irrigation systems, the flow and pressure of water is usually regulated by controlling {{the position of the}} valve. The proportioning electronic actuator accepts a signal from the control system and moves the valve to allow the valve to partially open or close. Varying speed of pump motor can also control the usage of water. The integration of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) into irrigation management promises to overcome the excessive watering problem while providing additional functionality. This paper presents a case study on the use of WSAN for irrigation activities and investigates the application of fuzzy <b>logic</b> based <b>valve</b> aperture control.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} a {{fuzzy logic}} control {{system designed to}} determine, regulate and maintain the amount of suction needed by a robotic gripper system to perform reliable limp material manipulation. A neuro-fuzzy approach is followed to {{determine the amount of}} desired suction (depending on experimentally derived data and plant characteristics). A knowledge-based valve controller is then designed to generate, regulate and maintain the amount of suction calculated by the neuro-fuzzy suction module. The performance of the overall suction control system is compared with actual experimental results obtained when using a prototype gripper system to handle limp material. Further, performance of the fuzzy <b>logic</b> based <b>valve</b> controller is compared to conventional PD and PID controllers. The proposed control scheme is found to enhance the overall functionality of the prototype robotic gripper system.

50|$|To build a {{functionally}} complete <b>logic</b> system, relays, <b>valves</b> (vacuum tubes), or transistors can be used. The simplest {{family of}} logic gates using bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which {{do not have}} a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode-transistor logic (DTL). Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL. As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.|$|R
40|$|TRUST project / IWA Cities of the Future conference, MÃ¼lheim an der Ruhr, Germany, 28 - 30 April 2015 This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} application of a new methodology for leakage reduction via integrated energy and pressure management in Water Distribution Systems (WDS) {{with the aim of}} saving both water and energy. This new methodology approaches the management problem by means of a single, integrated multi-objective optimization task, rather than two separate problems (as is currently done) by considering the simultaneous use of flow/time modulated and/or fixed-setting pressure reducing valves (PRV) /throttle valves on one hand and improved pump and source water scheduling on the other. The optimization seeks to minimize the total costs of network operation and minimizing leakage whilst ensuring that minimum network performance constraints continue to be met. Constituent costs that can be considered include those of energy consumption in pumping and pump and valve actuation costs. The minimization of valve and pump state changes can also be specified as a secondary objective with a view to an associated reduction in maintenance costs This new methodology has been implemented as a stand-alone software application, the Pump and <b>Valve</b> <b>Logic</b> Optimal Scheduling (PaVLOS) software, which employs a pressure-driven WDS hydraulic model. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-life case study of Langhirano WDS in Reggio Emilia, Ital...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. In {{industries}} {{around the}} world control valves are commonly used to control integrated systems. The operational range of a control valve may therefore extend over large excursions of pressure and fluid or gas density. These valves {{should be able to}} exert strict control over pressurised gasses or heated fluids in order to keep systems safe and manageable. However, the desired operational range and accuracy guaranteeing peak performance is often not available in a single valve, and therefore a combination of valves may be considered to achieve this. The purpose of this project is to develop an optimised algorithm that will control such a hybrid control valve system. The algorithm should optimise the coordination of two separate valves, of which the maximum flow coefficients differ by a large degree. This should be done {{in such a way that}} the two valves essentially function as a single valve with new characteristics. The new valve should subsequently be able to accurately function over both small and large ranges of mass flow. Two different hybrid valve controllers are discussed. The first is a linear, PID based controller that is designed for simple inputs. The controller's main task is to assist in developing a better comprehension of the main challenges that will be faced in coordinating the operation of two separate valves. Although the controller provides stable control for step inputs with a low frequency of change, it is seen that it fails to deliver satisfactory results when faced with complex request signals. It is consequently concluded that more complex control will be required. The second hybrid valve controller is therefore designed with the purpose of controlling more sophisticated input request signals. The controller's design is based on Fuzzy Logic which provides an effective platform for complex control. The complete control system consists of four main elements: The low pass filter, which filters out unachievable high frequencies from the input request, the Neural Network based signal predictors, which increases the efficiency of the controller, the Fuzzy Inference System, which is responsible for all the control decisions, and the crisp controller, which aids the Fuzzy Inference System with control executions that cannot be fuzzified. The final optimisation to the Fuzzy <b>Logic</b> based hybrid <b>valve</b> controller is done by Genetic Algorithms. The membership functions that lend itself to optimisation are identified, and their parameters are optimised in order to further minimise the controller's mean control error. Master...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Process {{industries}} today enjoy significant {{benefits from}} advances {{made in the}} field of simulation as well as technologies that model normal plant operation. Plants however continue to suffer during abnormal operation such as start-up, shutdown and equipment failures leading to production losses or personal injury. One of the key elements that determines the operational safety of any plant is the training and technical knowledge of its personnel regarding plant behaviour. Simulators {{play a vital role in}} training personnel, preparing them for normal plant operation, abnormal plant operation as well as emergency and accident situations. This would not only enhance plant safety, but also decrease total downtime. In order to create such a simulator, mathematical models are required for each of the numerous components within the plant. This dissertation focuses on the development of a mathematical model for a control valve; a component commonly found in various industries to control and manipulate processes. Different modelling methods are compared, taking into account applicable modelling criteria such as training data, algorithm complexity, oscillations near endpoints, degree of system integration and model limitations. Based on these criteria, fuzzy logic with the nearest neighbourhood clustering algorithm is chosen as an appropriate modelling technique especially due to its ability to deal with large quantities of data. In order to meaningfully train the fuzzy logic system (FLS), a comprehensive set of physical operational data is required, covering all the different operational characteristics. To capture physical data, the development of a data acquisition (DAQ) system is introduced using two common DAQ systems to create a hybrid solution. Transducer signals are converted tom mA to V, using custom developed signal conversion hardware. This will allow data to be sampled by a standard DAQ card and processed by accompanying software. Two post- processing software applications are created. The first application solves the governing equations (mass rate of flow, Reynolds number, expansibility factor and choke status) and the second application is used to graphically display the acquired and calculated data. A set of experiments are conducted, covering all relevant working areas, to capture the behaviour of the control valve. This is achieved using five initial pressures ranging from 200 kPa to 400 kPa in increments of 50 kPa. At each initial pressure a set of unit step responses with valve command signals ranging from 0 % to 100 % in increments of 5 % is acquired. 24 data files at each initial pressure set (200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 kPa) are acquired. Before training the FLS, the optimal fuzzy logic parameters need to be determined e. g. radius (r), sigma (Ï) the number of time delays, the time delay increments and the impact of the input signals. Determining these parameters is an iterative process. Only a single data set, with initial pressure of 300 kPa, is used to derive the optimal fuzzy logic parameters. Four performance criteria namely maximum error average (MEA), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of the error residuals (CVRE) are used as benchmarks to obtain the optimal fuzzy parameters. During both the search for the optimal fuzzy parameters and the training of the fuzzy models using these optimal fuzzy parameters, 70 % of the data are used for training and verification while the remaining 30 % of the data are used for validation. Once the optimal fuzzy parameters are obtained using only the single data set, it is used to derive a number of fuzzy control valve models based on all the available data sets. All derived fuzzy models use the same parameters, except for a unique random file sequence associated with each of the models. The only prerequisite for the fuzzy models is that the generated file sequence be truly random. Irrespective of the random file sequence, fuzzy models with the same parameters, produce models with more or less the same performance. Therefore the performance criteria (MEA, MSE, RMSE and CVRE), for each data file, in the respective initial pressure sets, remains more or less the same. This method is found to be very useful in deriving a dynamic fuzzy <b>logic</b> control <b>valve</b> model. Averaging the performance criteria of these five models, an overall modelling accuracy of 90 % is achieved. It is recommended that a flow meter be installed to measure the mass rate of flow through the pipe network. This eliminates the need for an orifice, differential pressure transducer and the use of the first principle governing equation for the mass rate of flow. If a flow meter cannot be installed, a differential pressure transmitter with large range should be considered accompanied by a single orifice. Master...|$|R
