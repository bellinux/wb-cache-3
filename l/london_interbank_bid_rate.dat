40|$|Using {{data from}} the Treasury versus <b>London</b> <b>Interbank</b> Offer Swap Rates (LIBOR) for October 1987 to June 1998, this paper {{examines}} the determinants of swap spreads in the Treasury-LIBOR interest rate swap market. This study hypothesizes Treasury-LIBOR swap spreads {{as a function of}} the Treasury rate of comparable maturity, the slope of the yield curve, the volatility of short-term interest rates, a proxy for default risk, and liquidity in the swap market. The study finds that, in the long-run, swap spreads are negatively related to the yield curve slope and liquidity in the swap market. We also find that swap spreads are positively related to the short-term interest rate volatility. In the short-run, swap market's response to higher default risk seems to be higher spread between the <b>bid</b> and offer <b>rates.</b> Interest rate swaps, basis swaps, Treasury-LIBOR swaps...|$|R
