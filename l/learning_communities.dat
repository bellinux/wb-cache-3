40|$|The study {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} the possibility of increasing student engagement in traditional college classrooms by designing, creating, implementing, and maintaining a virtual <b>learning</b> <b>community</b> as an added resource for students. Because “students’ active involvement with learning positively influences their academic achievement” (Ullah 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, 2007, p. 1192) and because “students learn by becoming involved” (Astin, 1984, p. 305), increasing student engagement requires reaching students with a variety of active and collaborative learning methods (Ullah 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, 2007). In this the 21 st century, almost all students are engaged in online activities; being connected has become essential to young people (Oblinger 2 ̆ 6 Oblinger, 2006). Thus, seeking a way to engage students through their affinity for the virtual world using a virtual <b>learning</b> <b>community</b> was the underlying frame for this exploratory study. ^ A two-phase, mixed methods approach was used. Two focus groups of undergraduates (N = 10, N = 11) were conducted to gather information about student attitudes toward a virtual community as an academic tool and to solicit suggestions for improving the initial version; the virtual <b>learning</b> <b>community</b> was revised accordingly. The updated virtual <b>learning</b> <b>community</b> was activated and data collected to assess student participation and engagement in the virtual <b>learning</b> <b>community</b> and in the classroom (N = 81).
