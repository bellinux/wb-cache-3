6000|$|... "Never {{fear for}} that, my young blade," [...] <b>laughed</b> the <b>king.</b> [...] "Knowst {{not that the}} wiseacres thought me too dull for {{teaching}} till I was past ten years? And what is thy double about? Drawing on wood? How now! An able draughtsman, my young knight?" ...|$|R
50|$|The king asks who he is, and Coquín {{explains}} that he is someone who makes people <b>laugh.</b> The <b>king</b> makes a wager with him: if Coquín makes him <b>laugh,</b> the <b>king</b> will pay him 100 gold coins, but if he can’t, the king will have his teeth pulled. Coquín accepts the wager, mostly {{out of fear of}} the king’s wrath should he refuse. He leaves and the court, including Don Gutierre, Don Diego, Don Arias, and Infante Enrique, enters. Gutierre approaches the king, who asks about what Leonor told him earlier. Gutierre denies having actually promised marriage and the judge’s favoritism during the lawsuit. He hints that there is more to the story, and the king insists that he tell him, so that Leonor will hear {{what he has to say}} and can respond to it later.|$|R
60|$|Then the <b>king</b> <b>laughed,</b> {{and clapped}} his hands, saying that at length his dream was answered; and he killed no more that day nor ever again--save once only.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here we are!" [...] {{cried the}} <b>king,</b> <b>laughing</b> at his acute {{discovery}} of the coincidence; [...] "eight to a fraction--I and my seven ministers. Come! what is the diversion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{first the}} <b>king</b> <b>laughed,</b> and his long nose began to sway {{from side to}} side. Then, seeing the prince was in earnest, his Majesty frowned and grew disturbed. Finally he said: ...|$|R
60|$|Hereupon {{the dwarf}} <b>laughed</b> (the <b>king</b> was too {{confirmed}} a joker {{to object to}} any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into {{the plans for the}} masquerade.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were grown}} so tall, Sir, and so hand and glove with the Longshanks, that Nick Dustifoot and I knew not an {{if it were}} yourself--but now your name is out, and the wind is in another quarter"--he grinned, then seeing Richard {{impatient}} of the approach to familiarity, [...] "You did not know Nick Dustifoot? He was one of young Sir Simon's men-at-arms, you see, and took to the woods, like other folk, after Kenilworth was given up, till stout men were awanting for this Crusade. And he knew Sir Guy {{when he came to}} the camp yon by Tunis, and spake with him; moreover, he went in the train of him of Almayne to Viterbo, and had speech again with Sir Simon, who gave him this scroll. And if you will meet him at the Syren's Rock to-night, my Lord Richard, he will bring you to those who will conduct you to Sir Guy's brave castle, where he <b>laughs</b> <b>kings</b> and counts to scorn! We have the guard, and will see you safe past the gates of the camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|The <b>king</b> <b>laughed.</b> 'No, no, {{that will}} never do. Do you suppose my son would compete with that crazy tailor as to which could make the best clothes? Oh, dear, no, that won't do at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems so!" [...] {{said the}} <b>king,</b> <b>laughing</b> aloud. [...] "I {{remember}} now: speak on, Masilo the Thin, who wast Masilo the Fat; what of this Slaughterer? Does he come with {{his people to}} lay the axe Groan-Maker in my hands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are you doing?' {{asked the}} king at last, and the hermit {{replied that he}} was reading the fates of men; every one's fate, he said, was settled from the beginning, and, {{whatever}} it were, there was no escape from it. The <b>king</b> <b>laughed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The <b>king</b> <b>laughed</b> and laughed. He {{laid his}} arm over Beppo's shoulder, {{and again he}} whispered in his ear: [...] "A word, a word, only a few words; if they be spoken ill, they are ill; if they be spoken well, they are more {{precious}} than gold and jewels." ...|$|R
60|$|All the courtiers {{were amazed}} and confounded, and Sir Oliver {{the most of}} all. But the <b>king</b> <b>laughed</b> heartily, saying that little Noll had a {{stubborn}} English spirit, {{and that it was}} well for his son to learn betimes what sort of a people he was to rule over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha! do {{you think}} me so?" [...] cried the <b>king,</b> <b>laughing</b> in his cruel way. [...] "To-morrow, at breakfast time, you shall have an {{opportunity}} of judging which is the greater monster, the Minotaur or the king! Take them away, guards; and let this free-spoken youth be the Minotaur's first morsel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it," [...] the <b>king</b> <b>laughed.</b> [...] "Highland lassies are {{accustomed}} to sudden wooing, and I doubt not that when she freed you last autumn from Dunstaffnage her mind was just as much made up as yours is as {{to the state of}} her heart. Come along, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the early}} missionaries {{approached}} the King of Burma to ask permission {{to teach the}} Kachin, the <b>king</b> <b>laughed</b> and pointed to his dog {{and said that they}} would have more success teaching his dog than teaching the Kachins. They were the wild men of Burma, illiterate animists, who sacrificed cows and chickens to appease the spirits.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{said the}} <b>king,</b> <b>laughing</b> good-naturedly, as {{he raised his}} {{faithful}} servant from the ground, [...] "that is what ye all say when I do any thing to please ye. There--there, take the sign-manual, and away with you and this young fellow. I wonder Steenie and Babie Charles have not broken in on us before now." ...|$|R
5000|$|The next scene shows Old King Cole (Hugh Herbert) {{excited when}} his fiddlers arrive (The Marx Brothers). The trio starts playing their violins, but then break them over their knees. The king enjoys this very much, but his court jester (Ned Sparks) {{obviously}} does not. The king commands [...] "off with their heads." [...] Then Joe Penner brings the king a bowl and, {{in reference to}} his famous catch phrase, asks [...] "wanna buy a duck?" [...] Donald Duck appears {{out of the water}} in the bowl, repeats Penner's catchphrase and starts <b>laughing.</b> The <b>king</b> then replaces the lid on the bowl, much to the chagrin of Donald.|$|R
5000|$|... "Comedy - A Serious Business" [...] - Hollywood learned {{very early}} {{how to make}} people <b>laugh.</b> Comedy was <b>king,</b> and battling for the throne were stars like Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon and Charlie Chaplin. In a purely visual medium, their comedy was a work of genius. Interviews include Hal Roach, Sr., Jackie Coogan, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountains}} {{are part of}} the Bunya Mountains and Yarraman Important Bird Area which contains what is thought to be the largest population of the black-breasted button-quail.

Significant species include the wedge-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, grey goshawk, brown cuckoo-dove, rose robin, eastern yellow robin, large-billed gerygone, and Australian golden whistler. [...] The Bunya Mountains support the most westerly populations of many rainforest dwelling species, including green catbirds, regent bowerbirds, paradise riflebirds, eastern whipbirds, noisy pittas and the Australian logrunner.

60|$|Now Zinita tasted {{of the cup}} {{which she}} had brewed for other lips, and grew distraught in her misery, and wrung her hands, crying that she repented her of the evil and would warn Umslopogaas and the Lily of that which awaited them. And she turned to run towards the gates. But the <b>king</b> <b>laughed</b> and nodded, and they brought her back, and {{presently}} she was dead also.|$|R
5000|$|Having broken {{an order}} from Francis I forbidding Triboulet from making jokes on the queen and courtesans, the king ordered {{that he should be}} put to death. Having served {{particularly}} well the king for many years, Francis I granted Triboulet the right to choose the way he would die. Triboulet, with his sharp mind, said the following: [...] "Bon sire, par sainte Nitouche et saint Pansard, patrons de la folie, je demande à mourir de vieillesse." [...] which translates to: [...] "Sir, for Saint Nitouche's and Saint Pansard's sake, patrons of insanity, I choose to die from old age." [...] Having no other choice than to <b>laugh,</b> the <b>king</b> ordered that Triboulet must not be executed, but rather instead be banished from the realm.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} meddled in politics, eh?" [...] the <b>king</b> <b>laughed,</b> {{when he heard}} a brief account of Captain Jervoise's reason for leaving home. [...] "Your quarrels, in England and Scotland, have added many a {{thousand}} good soldiers to the armies of France and Sweden, and, I may say, of every country in Europe. I believe there are some of your compatriots, or at any rate Scotchmen, in the czar's camp. I suppose that, at William's death, these troubles will cease." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} {{introduced}} by a jester - the worst jester ever: A fictional medieval kingdom is {{ruled by a}} cold-hearted queen and a gruff and imperious king (King Heironymous). They have arranged for their daughter - the most beautiful (and incredibly spoiled) princess to marry a handsome - but dumb as a bucket of rocks - prince on Christmas Day.The Jester has {{failed to make the}} <b>king</b> <b>laugh</b> - and the King has given him an ultimatum - to make him laugh by Christmas Day or be banished to a dungeon.|$|R
5000|$|After Brownlow {{was arrested}} in December 1861, the Register demanded he either be hanged or jailed. [...] When Confederate {{authorities}} ordered his release, the Register blasted the decision as foolish, stating [...] "that Brownlow is now <b>laughing,</b> like the <b>king's</b> fool, in his sleeve, we doubt not for a moment." [...] In February 1862, the Register issued a call {{for the formation of}} a Knoxville home-guard to help defend against a Union invasion, and supported the continued application of martial law in the region to root out Union loyalists.|$|R
5000|$|Together {{the group}} {{comes up with}} a skit mocking some members of the royal court, {{including}} the king and his new concubine Jang Nok-su. Though they {{make a lot of money}} from the performance, they are eventually arrested for treason and flogged severely. Jangsaeng makes a deal with Choseon, one of the king's consultants, either to make the <b>king</b> <b>laugh</b> at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jangsaeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the <b>king,</b> who <b>laughs</b> and then makes them all a part of his court.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>king</b> <b>laughed.</b> [...] "It is well. In {{our land}} {{there is a}} proverb which runs, 'Women's eyes are always bright, {{whatever}} the colour,' and another that says, 'Love her who is present, for be sure she who is absent is false to thee;' but perhaps these things are not so in the Stars. In a land where men are white all things are possible. So be it, white men; the girls will not go begging! Welcome again; and welcome, too, thou black one; if Gagool here had won her way, thou wouldst have been stiff and cold by now. It is lucky for thee that thou too camest from the Stars; ha! ha!" ...|$|R
50|$|In his {{historical}} play Bāḡ-e šabnamā-ye mā (Our shining garden, Tehran, 1999), Radi {{exposes the}} dictatorial {{nature of the}} government {{in the guise of a}} semi-documentary, and incarnates the concept of unrestrained political power in the grotesque figure of a king who repeatedly contradicts himself. In the second act, Radi introduces Baqqāl-bāzi dar ḥożur (baqqāl-bāzi in the presence the king), an offshoot of the traditional, improvised popular comedy known as Baqqāl-bāzi, which is performed as a play within the play. In weaving this traditional dramatic piece into the heart of his drama, Radi employs the method of alienation by making the <b>king</b> <b>laugh</b> at what he himself does along with the audience.|$|R
60|$|Henry's {{capital was}} at the time garrisoned by the troops of the pope and Spain. The great nobles of France, who had long {{maintained}} a sort of semi independence of the crown, were all against him, and were calculating on founding independent kingdoms. He himself was excommunicated. The League were masters of almost the whole of France, and were well supplied with funds by the pope and the Catholic powers while Henry was entirely dependent for money upon what he could borrow from Queen Elizabeth and the States of Holland. But no one who listened to the merry <b>laugh</b> of the <b>king</b> as he chatted with the little group of English gentlemen would have thought that he was engaged in a desperate and well nigh hopeless struggle, and that the following day was to be a decisive one as to his future fortunes.|$|R
2500|$|Stanisław Kozłowski {{notes that}} the good-natured and light-hearted {{portrayal}} of Zagłoba is used by Sienkiewicz to counterbalance the dark setting of the stories, set {{during the time of}} war and devastation. He is the symbol of undying optimism and hope, and a strategist who can find his way out of trouble. He is often considered both a comic figure as well as the patriotic hero, even if the latter more often comes from the necessity of the moment. He is respected for his ideas, intelligence and sharp tongue. For example, when Swedish king Charles X Gustav [...] wanted to give Jan Zamoyski Lublin Voivodeship in hereditary possession for opening the gates of Zamość he asked Jan to reply that he will give Swedish king province of Netherlands in exchange which Jan has passed in Latin to Swedish deputy. Everyone who heard that were <b>laughing</b> from Swedish <b>king.</b>|$|R
500|$|This {{story is}} about a king who wants to keep all magic to himself. To do this he needs to solve two problems: he must capture and imprison all of the sorcerers in the kingdom {{and he has to}} learn magic. He creates a [...] "Brigade of Witch Hunters" [...] and calls for an {{instructor}} in magic. Only a [...] "cunning charlatan" [...] with no magical ability responds. The charlatan proves himself with a few simple tricks and begins to ask for jewellery and money to continue teaching. However, Babbitty, the <b>king's</b> washerwoman, <b>laughs</b> at the <b>king</b> one day as he attempts to do magic with an ordinary twig. This causes the king to demand the charlatan join him in a public demonstration of magic and warns that the charlatan will be beheaded if anyone laughs. The charlatan later witnesses Babbitty performing magic in her house. He threatens to expose her if she does not assist him. She agrees to hide and help the demonstration.|$|R
50|$|Vyndktvx was {{originally}} the court magician for the King-thing Brpxz, {{of the fifth}} dimension world of Zrfff, until Mxyzptlk came along. Mxy outshone {{the other in the}} king's eyes because Mxy could make the <b>king</b> <b>laugh,</b> which Vyndktvx was unable to do. When Mxy declared his love for the king's daughter, Vyndktvx was outraged and took three weapons - the nothingcoat, the imaginator and the multispear. Planning on killing Mxyzptlk, he instead killed the king, who was at the time trying on Mxy's hat. Mistaking the king's shadow for Mxy's, he struck, and in the process killed 331 worlds across time and space, as well as almost killing Earth and Krypton. That feedback hurt Vyndktvx enough to where he wanted revenge on Superman for this and then began to target Superman's life, hoping to just as well clear his name and blame the entire massacre on Mxy and take Zrfff as his own.|$|R
5000|$|Hiranya-Kashayap was fed up {{with this}} kid Prahllad. Once he {{took him to the}} palace and wanted to check his faith and belief.

[...] Prahllad replied, [...] "He is {{everywhere}} and is omnipresent." [...] The <b>king</b> <b>laughed</b> at the poor child and wanted to embarrass him so he asked the child whether [...] "your Lord Narayana is present in the pillar." [...] "Yes," [...] came the reply. The king took his Gadha (a weapon shaped like a dome in the top which can be held at the bottom with two hands) and banged on the pillar. The pillar broke and the Lord Narayana, incarnated as [...] "Lord Narasimha" [...] (Lion Faced God), tore Hiranaya-Kashyap apart with his nails and killed the demon.|$|R

50|$|When King Pratap Malla {{lost his}} son, his wife, the queen, {{remained}} grief-stricken. The king was very {{sad to see}} the condition of his beloved queen. The king, in spite of several efforts, could not lessen the grief of his wife. He desperately {{wanted to see a}} little smile on her lips; so he announced that anyone who made the queen laugh would be rewarded adequately. During the festival of Gai jatra, the cow procession was brought before the grief-stricken queen. Then the participants began ridiculing and mocking the important people of the society. Finally, when the social injustices and other evils were highlighted and attacked mercilessly, the queen could not help but smile. The queen <b>laughed</b> and the <b>king</b> instituted a tradition of including jokes, satire, mockery and lampoon into the Gaijatra celebration. As per the traditions, every family who has lost a relative during that past year participates in a procession through the streets leading a cow. If a cow is unavailable, a young boy dressed as a cow is substituted.|$|R

Graham's tower is neither strong nor safe, and the sooner this Mistress Marjory of yours is safely in your stronghold of Aberfilly the better for both of you, and for me also, for I know that you will be of no more good to me so long as your brain is running on her. Look you now, she is no longer under your protection, and your scruples on that head are {{therefore}} removed; best go in at once and ask her if she will have you. If she says, 'Yes,' we will ride to Glasgow tomorrow or next day. The bishop shall marry you, and I myself will give you your bonny bride.
