A stimulus tape was created including a control conducting condition (<b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> no change) and five experimental conducting conditions: (a) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> fisted gesture; (b) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm up; (c) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm down; (d) <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> stabbing gesture; and (e) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> sideways, phrase-shaping gesture...|$|R
50|$|The Block 0 CIWS mounts (hydraulic driven) {{fired at}} a rate of 3,000 rounds per minute and held 989 rounds in the <b>magazine</b> <b>drum.</b> The Block 1 CIWS mounts (hydraulic) also fired at 3,000 rounds per minute with an {{extended}} <b>magazine</b> <b>drum</b> holding 1,550 rounds. The Block 1A and newer (pneumatic driven) CIWS mounts fire {{at a rate}} of 4,500 rounds per minute with a 1,550-round magazine. The velocity of the rounds fired is approximately 3600 ft/s. The rounds are armor-piercing tungsten penetrator rounds or depleted uranium with discarding sabots. The Phalanx CIWS 20 mm rounds are designed to destroy a missile's airframe and make it unaerodynamic, thus keeping shrapnel from the exploding projectile to a minimum, effectively keeping collateral damage to a minimum. The ammunition handling system has two conveyor belt systems. The first takes the rounds out of the <b>magazine</b> <b>drum</b> to the gun; the second takes empty shells or non-fired rounds to {{the opposite end of the}} drum.|$|R

50|$|In the laboratory, {{a patient}} was given two {{different}} fabrics: a wire screen in his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> {{and a piece}} of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”. Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.|$|R
