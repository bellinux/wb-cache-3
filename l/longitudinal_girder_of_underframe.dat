40|$|Abstract—An {{innovative}} three dimensional {{finite element}} model is developed and tested under two point loading system to examine the structural behavior <b>of</b> the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> <b>of</b> a reinforced concrete T-beam bridge, reinforcing with steel and shape memory alloy bars respectively. 25 % of steel bars are replaced with superelastic S. M. A bars in the second girder. Finite element analysis is performed using ANSYS 11. 0 program. Experimentally a model <b>of</b> steel reinforced <b>girder</b> has been casted and its load deflection responses are checked with ANSYS prediction. A comparison of load carrying capacity for the model between steel reinforced concrete girder and the girder reinforced with S. M. A and steel are also performed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{floating}} system cable-stayed bridge, the <b>longitudinal</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>girder</b> {{and moments}} <b>of</b> towers are very large when strong earthquake happens. The dampers installed between girder and towers in longitudinal direction can reduce efficiently displacement <b>of</b> the <b>girder</b> and moments <b>of</b> the towers induced by longitudinal seismic waves. Using spatial {{finite element model}} and time history analysis method, the influences of design parameters of viscous damper on seismic responses of cable-stayed bridge are studied in detail. The results of study show that, with the damping constant increasing, the <b>longitudinal</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>girder</b> and moment <b>of</b> tower decrease, and the forces of damper increase. With velocity exponent increasing, the <b>longitudinal</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>girder</b> and moment <b>of</b> tower increase, and the force of damper decrease. So, when determining the design parameters of damper, the cost of dampers, difficulty of construction and seismic reduction effects should be considered together. ...|$|R
50|$|On 24 June 2005, {{a private}} cargo vessel M V Mani, {{belonging}} to the Ganges Water Transport Pvt. Ltd, while trying to pass under the bridge during high tide, had its funnel stuck underneath for three hours, causing substantial damage worth about 15 million to the stringer and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> <b>of</b> the bridge. Some of the 40 cross-girders were also broken. Two of four trolley guides, bolted and welded with the girders, were extensively damaged. Nearly 350 m of 700 m of the track were twisted beyond repair. The damage was so severe that KoPT requested help from Rendall-Palmer & Tritton Limited, the original consultant on the bridge from UK. KoPT also contacted SAIL to provide 'matching steel' used during its construction in 1943, for the repairs. For the repair costing around , about 8 tonnes of steel was used. The repairs were completed in early 2006.|$|R
50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided transverse frames, all but the rear three and front two frames made up <b>of</b> kingpost-braced <b>girders.</b> These were spaced 10 m (32 ft 9 in) apart, with an intermediate frame in the middle of each bay, and were attached to a triangular section ventral keel, the apex of which was braced {{to the ends of the}} outer ends of the lower transverse frame girders on each side. The transverse frames were connected by 13 principal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders,</b> <b>of</b> which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the transverse bracing of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag. This feature was the subject of a Schütte Lanz patent, and had not previously been used by Zeppelin.|$|R

Alternatives considered were {{very similar to the}} 1972 report, and were similarly decided. [...] Structural modifications included an upgrade from four <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> to six <b>of</b> the same shape and replacement of a stairway with a handicapped pedestrian ramp on the Boston end of the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Isherwood {{was born}} in Hartlepool, {{the son of a}} grocer. He was educated at Luggs School on the Headland, near St Hilda's church, and at the age of fifteen entered the drawing office of the Hartlepool shipbuilders Edward Withy & Co. He served in several {{departments}} in that firm and in 1896 left to become a ship surveyor with Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Here he developed the Isherwood System, a new stronger, safer, and cheaper <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> form <b>of</b> ship construction designed to replace the traditional traverse construction method (ribs placed at regular intervals along the keel), which he patented in 1906.|$|R
50|$|The Zeppelin NT is a {{semi-rigid}} airship. It {{is unlike}} both the original Zeppelins {{that had a}} rigid skeleton and non-rigid blimps. It has an internal triangular truss made of graphite-reinforced plastic and three <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> made <b>of</b> welded aluminium which connect the triangular elements {{along the length of}} the frame. Additionally, the structure is tightened with aramid cords to provide for extra rigidity. All major components, such as the engines, control cabin and the steering fins, are mounted upon the structure; this allows maneuverability to be maintained even in the event of envelope pressure being lost. The whole structure weighs only about 1000 kg.|$|R
50|$|Barnes Wallis {{created the}} frame of the airship using only 11 {{standardized}} components. The 16 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> were formed <b>of</b> three tubes each, formed from strips of Duralumin wound into a helix and riveted together. These connected 15 polygonal transverse frames, which were held in shape by wire bracing connected to a central <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> running the length of the ship. A further consequence of the new rules for airframe stress design was that a new way of harnessing the lifting force of the gasbags had to be found. Wallis's solution to this problem later led to his innovative geodesic airframe fuselage and wing design for the Wellesley, Wellington and Windsor bombers.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the pier {{foundations}} was further affected {{by the fact that}} the valley is a high quality agricultural area that had to be preserved as much as possible. The height of the reinforced concrete piers ranges from 13.45 m to 40.03 m and each of the piers is topped by a cap beam. The piers comprise an I-cross section with the webs aligned with the bridge axis. Peripheral piers (P1, P2, P20, P21) are executed on shallow foundations, while the remaining piers are executed on driven piles. The superstructure consists <b>of</b> two <b>longitudinal</b> prefabricated <b>girders</b> <b>of</b> constant depth set 550 cm apart made composite with the deck slab and cross-girders. Structurally, the superstructure is a 1354.86 m long continuous girder across 22 spans, tracing a horizontal and a vertical curve. The cross section of the superstructure consists of two solid I-section steel <b>girders</b> <b>of</b> constant depth.|$|R
40|$|The European project SUREBridge (Sustainable Refurbishment of Existing Bridges) is develop-ing a {{new concept}} for the {{refurbishment}} of road bridges. The proposed technique takes ad-vantage of the peculiarities of fibre-reinforced materials to perform upgrading, repair, and strengthening in an effective and efficient way in terms of resource consumption, waste produc-tion, construction time, and traffic disruption. The technique applies to bridges with reinforced concrete slab and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> made <b>of</b> either reinforced concrete or steel. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> are strengthened by bonding carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates to their bottom surfaces. Higher structural perfor-mances are achieved by pre-stressing the CFRP laminates. The existing concrete slab is not demolished, with savings in both construction time and waste production. Instead, tailor-made glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) panels {{are connected to the}} deck to increase its overall bending strength. Furthermore, GFRP panels enable the widening of the road section, if neces-sary to upgrade the bridge to increased traffic demand. This paper presents the application of the SUREBridge technique to a real bridge located in San Miniato, Tuscany, Italy. The designed intervention includes both the widening of the road section and the structural strengthening of the deck to comply with current traffic loads...|$|R
50|$|The viaduct is {{executed}} as {{two parallel}} structures, each 10.5 m wide. Their superstructures are continuous structures with spans of 35 m to 70 m m above Kupa River. The carriageway {{of each of}} the bridges consists of two traffic lanes 3.75 m wide and two marginal strips 1 m wide. There are no sidewalks and no emergency lanes on the bridge itself. The superstructure is executed in I-section prefabricated reinforced concrete girders, made monolithic with in situ executed transverse beams and the deck slab. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> are mostly <b>of</b> a uniform length (traversing 35 m spans), except for those spanning the river and the longest, 70 m long span. Foundations of the viaduct are executed on piles.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the project is the {{development}} and implementation of (small-) series production FRP-bridges based on strand laid CFRP structures. The plan is to implement a defined prestressed pedestrian- and cycle - tied-arch bridge in the vicinity of Rostock with a 50 m clear span. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> consists <b>of</b> a deck system, which is a hybrid solution of GFRP ribs with connected CFRP strands, and two steel pipe arches (D = 200 mm), assisted by CFRP strand laid lattice structures. An increase of 50 % for the flexural properties of such plane lattice structures is possible, if a specific prestress of the strand laid deck will be adjusted. The principle of prestressing the entire arch bridge system is comparable with the stretching of a sports bow. The load bearing capacity can be increased up to 30 %, because compressive stresses are constructive avoided in the kink risks CFRP strands. Thus, a complete utilization of the specific properties, especially high tensile stiffness of CFRP with a minimum use of material, is possible. That achieves a load of 50 tones at a selfweight of 10 tones...|$|R
50|$|The deck {{structure}} consists <b>of</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders,</b> cross-girders, and the deck. The abutments and the outermost piers support the structure through bearings while {{the remaining four}} piers are fixed to the {{deck structure}}. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> are executed as prefabricated, pretensioned girders and there are 10 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> comprising the cross-section of the bridge, i.e. five of them, with axes set 2.7 m apart, supporting each of the carriageways. Length <b>of</b> the prefabricated <b>girders</b> ranges from 38.6 m to 39 m in the peripheral spans and between 48.24 m and 48.66 m in the remaining spans. The girders are 240 cm high I-sections with 268 cm wide upper flange. The bottom flange <b>of</b> the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> is 68 cm wide. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> were manufactured in a special plant next to the bridge construction site {{and placed in the}} bridge structure using incremental launching.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to design a steel {{structure}} of the parking building {{in the center of}} Brno. The plan dimensions of the building are 29 x 77. 5 m including a missing corner of the dimensions 5 x 12. 5 m in the southeast part of the construction. The construction of the parking building has 4 above-ground floors with the same layout and the fifth floor situated only in the middle section of the construction. Each floor is 3. 5 m high.

The equivalent stress <b>of</b> main <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder,</b> soleplate and transverse bars of soleplate will increase when the soleplate’s thickness was reduced. The maximum of equivalent stress will increase 13 %~ 15 % with 1 mm reduction. When the thickness of side plate or the number of side plate’s strengthening ribs was reduced, the elastic displacement of side plate would increase. Scheme C fulfilled the requirement of structure strength, in which the elastic displacement increases in the allowable range and the lightening ratio was 12. 6 %.

40|$|The railway line in Kiruna is planed to {{be moved}} before year 2012 due to {{expected}} cracking in the underlying rock. The cracking is initiated by the mining in the Kirunavaara-mine.

For one of the bridges, The Mine Bridge (Gruvvägsviadukten), settlements are expected in the future. Initially at its west side and further eastwards towards the city. An early assessment of the bridge showed that the bridge has enough load-carrying capacity but that {{the length of the}} reinforcement close to the interior columns probably is a little bit too short to fully compensate the prestressing force in top <b>of</b> the concrete <b>girder.</b> A certain worry has been expressed that the ground movements may cause some existing cracks to propagate upwards to the girders top i. e. that the cracks goes through the whole girder which may reduce the shear capacity remarkable. Luleå University of Technology is asked to perform a more thoroughly study of the bridge's capacity to resist different scenarios of settlements. This thesis {{is a part of the}} work and deals with non-linear finite element modelling and analysis of the bridge's capacity to resist the settlements and to evaluate limits for certain expected scenarios of settlements. To confirm the correctness of the final model, the displacements from the model is compared to measured displacement for a known truck load. The comparison shows that the model is somewhat weaker than in the reality. This is believed to depend mainly on a generalization of the deck's geometry and a stiffer construction during the field measurement. However, the model is still judge to be usable for studying what limits can be used for allowed settlements and the reason for why some cracks already exists.
