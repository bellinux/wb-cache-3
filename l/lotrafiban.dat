40|$|BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet {{therapy is}} the {{mainstay}} of the treatment and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events. We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of <b>lotrafiban,</b> an oral platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, as a secondary prevention strategy in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Overall, 451 patients with a recent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular acute ischemic event were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of 5 dosing regimens for 12 weeks: placebo or 5, 20, 50, or 100 mg <b>lotrafiban,</b> both twice daily with 300 to 325 mg/d aspirin. The primary end point was the incidence and tolerability of major and minor bleeding during treatment. Secondary end points included inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical events. The placebo and <b>lotrafiban</b> 5 -mg groups had similarly low rates of minor and major bleeding, but the 100 -mg arm was terminated early because of excess major bleeding. Protocol-defined thrombocytopenia (< 100 000 platelets/microL) occurred in 5 lotrafiban-treated patients (1. 4 %, 95 % CI 0. 2 % to 2. 7 %) and 1 placebo patient (1. 1 %, 95 % CI 0 % to 3. 1 %). Three lotrafiban-treated patients had a nadir platelet count < 20 000 /microL (0. 9 %, 95 % CI 0 % to 1. 8 %). <b>Lotrafiban</b> produced dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation; 5 mg <b>lotrafiban</b> {{did not differ significantly}} from placebo, whereas 100 mg inhibited aggregation by nearly 100 %. CONCLUSIONS:-Lotrafiban provides dose-dependent platelet inhibition when administered to a range of patients with atherosclerosis. The level of platelet inhibition appears to correlate with bleeding risk and drug tolerability. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This is {{the primary}} report of the {{large-scale}} evaluation of <b>lotrafiban,</b> an orally administered IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, a unique trial {{with respect to the}} platelet antagonist, protocol design, and inclusion of cerebrovascular disease in a significant proportion of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with vascular disease were randomized to <b>lotrafiban</b> 30 or 50 mg BID on the basis of age and predicted creatinine clearance or placebo in addition to aspirin at a dose ranging from 75 to 325 mg/d at the discretion of the physician-investigator. Follow-up was for up to 2 years. The primary end point was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia requiring hospitalization, and urgent revascularization. Of 9190 patients enrolled from 23 countries and 690 hospitals, 41 % had cerebrovascular disease at the time of entry, and 59 % had coronary artery disease. Death occurred in 2. 3 % of placebo-assigned patients and 3. 0 % of lotrafiban-group patients (hazard ratio 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 72, P= 0. 026), and the cause of excess death was vascular related. There {{was no significant difference in}} the primary end point (17. 5 % compared with 16. 4 %, respectively; hazard ratio 0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 85 to 1. 03, P= 0. 19). Serious bleeding was more frequent in the <b>lotrafiban</b> group (8. 0 % compared with 2. 8 %; P 162 mg/d), with or without <b>lotrafiban.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lotrafiban,</b> an orally administered platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blocker, induced a 33 % increase in death rate, which was vascular in origin and not affected by the type of atherosclerotic involvement at entry to the trial. Although the dose of aspirin was not randomly assigned, the finding of increased bleeding with doses > 162 mg/d is noteworthy. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Platelets play a {{key role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and acute coronary and cerebrovascular syndromes. Inhibition of platelet function by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has been shown to reduce the incidence atherothrombotic events in patients with coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease. Thienopyridine agents, however, including ticlopidine and clopidogrel, inhibit the adenosine diphosphate receptor and have modestly superior effects compared with aspirin on reduction of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke among a broad group of patients with vascular disease. More effective antithrombotic agents are still required to treat patients at high risk for recurrent vascular events. METHODS: <b>Lotrafiban,</b> a selective, nonpeptide antagonist of the human platelet fibrinogen receptor (glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa [alphaIIb/beta 3 integrin]), blocks the binding of fibrinogen to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, which is the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. <b>Lotrafiban</b> at doses of up to 50 mg twice daily was well-tolerated in a 12 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or stroke when added to aspirin therapy. On the basis of these results, a dosing regimen was selected for the phase III Blockage of the Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor to Avoid Vascular Occlusion (BRAVO) trial based on pharmacodynamics and drug tolerability. In the pivotal BRAVO study, <b>lotrafiban</b> therapy is being evaluated in patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or ischemic stroke, or who present at any time after a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease combined with either cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: The efficacy evaluation will be based on a composite end point of clinical events (death by any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia requiring hospitalization, or urgent ischemia-driven revascularization). The target enrollment is 9200 patients worldwide. Approximately 700 centers will participate and will be distributed within 30 countries across North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of human}} {{platelets}} by thrombin is {{mediated by the}} proteolytic cleavage of two G-protein coupled protease-activated receptors, PAR- 1 and PAR- 4. However, thrombin also binds specifically to the platelet surface glycoprotein GPIb. It has been claimed that thrombin can induce aggregation of platelets via a novel GPIb-mediated pathway, which is independent of PAR activation and fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ 3 integrin, but dependent upon polymerizing fibrin and the generation of intracellular signals. In the presence of both fibrinogen and the αIIbβ 3 receptor antagonist <b>lotrafiban,</b> thrombin induced a biphasic platelet aggregation response. The initial primary response was small but consistent and associated {{with the release of}} platelet granules. The delayed secondary response was more substantial and was abolished by the fibrin polymerization blocking peptide GPRP. Cleavage of the extracellular portion of GPIb by mocarhagin partially inhibited thrombin-induced αIIbβ 3 -dependent aggregation and release, but had no effect on the secondary fibrin-dependent response. Fixing of the platelets abolished αIIbβ 3 -dependent aggregation and release of adenine nucleotides, whereas the fibrin-dependent response remained, indicating that platelet activation and intracellular signalling are not necessary for this secondary ‘aggregation'. In conclusion, the secondary fibrin-dependent ‘aggregation' response observed in the presence of fibrinogen and <b>lotrafiban</b> is a platelet trapping phenomenon dependent primarily on the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to polymerizing fibrin by thrombin...|$|E
40|$|Platelet {{accretion}} into arterial thrombus in stenotic arterial ves-sels involves shear-induced {{platelet activation}} and adhesion. The Cone and Plate(let) Analyzer (CPA) {{is designed to}} simulate such conditions in vitro under a rotating high shear rate in whole blood. In the present study, we evaluated various experimental conditions (including aspirin, temperature, and calcium con-centration) and investigated the effects of small molecules along with peptide glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on platelet adhesion using the CPA system. Concentration-dependent ef-fect of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on shear-induced plate-let adhesion showed marked differences in potencies: IC 50 34, 35, 91, 438, and 606 nM for DPC 802 (a specific glycopro-tein IIb/IIIa antagonist), roxifiban, sibrafiban, <b>lotrafiban,</b> and or-bofiban (free acid forms), respectively, and IC 50 values of 43...|$|E
