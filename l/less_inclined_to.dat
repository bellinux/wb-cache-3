5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{many factors}} were {{important}} in arranging royal marriages. One such factor was {{the amount of}} territory that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related factor was {{the stability of the}} control exerted over that territory: when there was territorial instability in a royal family, other royalty would be <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> marry into that family. Another factor was political alliance: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and their countries during peace and war and could justify many important political decisions.|$|E

This paper moves from the current theoretical debate to an empirical verification of amoral familism using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and EVS dataset (1999 - 2000). The findings suggest a paradox: amoral familists are <b>less</b> <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> collective action; however, amoral familism does not explain the lack of collective action among southern Italians. We conclude affirming the general validity of Banfield theory and explaining the incorrect association between amoral familism and southern Italian ethos...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Steeple Tree Hill, the Japanese were <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> engage the Australian forces, {{nevertheless}} the advance continued to be frustratingly slow for the Australian commanders. The terrain over which the final part of the advance was undertaken was particularly taxing on the troops involved. Many of the slopes up which {{they were required to}} advance had gradients of at least 45 degrees, which meant that even reasonably short distances took considerable time To make matters worse, near the junction of the Siki Creek, a landslide caused by the Allied bombing, coupled with a number of land mines that the Japanese had planted, blocked the main road to Sattelberg, meaning that the soldiers from the 2/48th would have to make the final attack on Sattelberg without armoured support. In an effort to counter this problem, Whitehead determined that the tanks would be re-allocated to the 2/23rd, in the hope that a new route would be opened up by the engineers.|$|E
5|$|With the {{approval}} of Diệm, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose {{a time when he}} knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting had returned to the United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire, to frame the regulars for the raids. Nhu's motive was to avoid responsibility for a violent operation— which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for the raids and become <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators off-balance and thwarted coup attempts. The raids were not unexpected, as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.|$|E

25|$|Cappadocian, {{also known}} as Cappadocian Greek or Asia Minor Greek, is a mixed {{language}} spoken in Cappadocia (Central Turkey). The language originally diverged from the Medieval Greek of the Byzantine Empire following the Seljuq Turk victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. As {{a result of the}} population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s, all Cappadocian Greeks were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily to Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians rapidly shifted to Standard Modern Greek and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, Mark Janse (Ghent University) and Dimitris Papazachariou (University of Patras) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to their parents and grandparents. The latter are much <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> speak Cappadocian and more often than not switch to Standard Modern Greek. A survey of Cappadocian speakers and language use is currently in preparation.|$|E
25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Temple of Jerusalem (and most of the city) in the first Jewish revolt, Hadrian rebuilt both in Greek style, dedicated the rebuilt Temple (in Dio's account) to Jupiter, renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina and sought a ban on circumcision as impious disfigurement. The ensuing Bar Kokhba revolt overwhelmed the Roman military occupation and destabilised much of the Empire. For almost three years, Judea was an independent state, led by the messianic commander Simon Bar Kokhba. Then it was obliterated by the Imperial armies and erased from the Roman map – Hadrian renamed it as Syria Palaestina. Christians described their persecution under Bar Kokhba. Jews described theirs in its aftermath. Jewish messianism retreated into abstraction, and a Jewish nation-state became an ideal. Christians were <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> identify with the Judaic roots of their religion: some actively repudiated them. Hadrian's restrictions on Judaism were later relaxed and Jewish exemption from the full obligations of Imperial cult proved a source of suspicion and resentment for Hellenists and Christians alike.|$|E

Cory retained the seat until 1910, the only substantial coal owner to keep a prominent political profile in the Rhondda during this period. Cory was also High Sheriff of Monmouthshire for 1905. He also served as a Justice of the Peace for Glamorgan and Monmouthshire and was a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Glamorgan.

40|$|One {{explanation}} for concurrent levels of high unemployment and inflation during the 1980 s and early 1990 s {{has been the}} high incidence of long-term unemploy ment. It has been argued that employers regard the long-term unemployed as de-skilled and accordingly not as viable alternatives to more experienced workers. Therefore they become more likely to grant tbe latter pay increases rather than hire more workers when under pressure from demand or supply. Labour market programs are recom mended as policies to reverse this de-skilling effect. If employers come to consider tbe unemployed as substitutes for their incumbent workforce they will be <b>less</b> <b>inclined</b> voluntarily <b>to</b> grant wage increases. This paper aims to test whether the suite of Working Nation labour market programs affected Australian wage inflation between 1989 and 1997, by estimating a general bargaining model using panel data tech niques. We find that a doubling of labour market program participants per employee lends, at most, to a 1 per cent reduction in nominal wages...|$|R
