A concern {{in the design and}} operation of the TPCT is evaluating working fluid <b>loading</b> <b>charge</b> to maximize performance while avoiding dryout in the evaporator section and geyser boiling phenomena. The model includes the heat transfer through the wall, the vapor core, the liquid pool and the falling condensate film. The complete two-dimensional conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy are solved using a finite volume scheme for the vapor flow and the pipe wall. The liquid film is modeled by using one-dimensional quasi-steady Nusselt type solution. An experimental facility has been also designed and operated to determine the operating condition and measure the maximum heat transfer rate and the overall thermal resistance of the TPCT. The total length and the diameter of pipe are 500  mm and 35  mm, respectively. The experiments have been performed in the heat transfer range of 30 – 700  W and filling ratios of 16, 35 and 135 %. The numerical predictions for the maximum heat transport rate due to the transient local dryout are shown to be in close agreement with the experimental results under normal operation.

40|$|International audienceCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) {{is a solid}} {{option for}} CO 2 {{mitigation}} in the atmosphere. One option is the CO 2 capture from industrial effluents followed by storage in secured sites. Capture processes are based on selective absorption/desorption cycles of gas in aqueous solutions of amines[1]. The cost of CO 2 treatment with classical alkanolamines is a limitation {{for the use of}} this technology. The development of breakthrough technologies is needed to optimize the separation process. One of the considered option is the use of a new class of amine : the demixing amines. Those amines are going through a liquid-liquid separation phase when increasing the temperature[2]. This very interesting property allows to treat only a part of the absorbent solution for the regeneration of the CO 2 in the absorption/desorption cycle. The use of such new system induced the perfect knowledge of the liquid-liquid equilibriums (LLE) in the binary mixtures water + amine, and the influence of the CO 2 on such equilibriums. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a method developed in the laboratory to study precisely the LLE in the binary solutions water + amines and the ternary mixtures water+amine+CO 2, as a function of the pressure and the CO 2 <b>loading</b> <b>charge.</b> This work is realized with the financial support of ANR and NSERC through an international collaborative project between France and Canada named DACOOTA...|$|E

40|$|The {{structures}} of pristine halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and ones functionalized by anionic surfactants (sodium dodecanoate and sodium dodecyl sulfate) were investigated by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). These experiments evidenced the structural {{organization of the}} surfactants adsorbed onto the HNT cavity {{and the importance of}} the surfactant headgroup. Contrast matching experiments were employed in order to mask the dominant scattering effect of the clay hollow nanotubes and to focus on the surfactant organization within the lumen. Further investigation on the mesoscopic structure of the investigated materials was carried out by electric birefringence (EBR), which allowed study of the rotational mobility of both pristine and functionalized HNTs. The gained structural insights were used to deduce some relevant properties of the hybrids, such as their surfactant <b>loading,</b> <b>charge,</b> and solubilization ability toward hydrophobic compounds. For the latter, the HNT lumen hydrophobization was straightforwardly demonstrated by both fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) using Nile Red as fluorescent probe. This paper correlates the structural properties of the hybrid material with micellar properties based on HNT and anionic surfactants, showing that for the dodecanoate a much more pronounced aggregation tendency within the HNT cavity prevails compared to the dodecyl sulfate. The attained knowledge is crucial for designing innovative sustainable nanostructures that are based on ecofriendly halloysite and anionic surfactants {{that can be used for}} the solubilization and delivery of hydrophobic compounds from such hybrid materials...|$|E
40|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) {{is a wide}} {{band-gap}} semiconductor that is {{of interest}} for application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because of similarity of its properties to TiO 2. Unlike TiO 2, ZnO can readily be grown {{in a wide variety}} of morphologies, using inexpensive, simple, and low temperature methods. Recent research on ZnO-based DSSCs focuses on modifying the ZnO layer morphology in order to maximize surface area, and enhance the electron collection by providing fast electron transport. It is expected that the improvement in cell performance by morphology modification is due to higher dye loading, increased electron lifetime and fast electron transport. However, ZnO properties may be affected by various synthesis methods. It is difficult to make a conclusion whether the change of performance are attributed to change of morphology or a change in the defect types and/ or defect concentrations. In this study, the influence of ZnO nanoparticle properties on cell performance has been investigated. Commercial ZnO nanoparticles with different sizes and optical properties were utilized. It was found that there is a complex relationship between native defects, dye <b>loading,</b> <b>charge</b> transport and photovoltaic performance. In particular, the presence of non-radiative defects was found to be detrimental to photovoltaic performance. In addition, with the similar defect emission intensities, sample exhibiting orange-red defect emission showed better performance than the samples emitting green defect emission.

40|$|Biofuel cells promise power {{generation}} with low cost and almost unlimited biocatalyst supply. This paper reports new {{perspectives on the}} characterization of immobilized thermostable (Pyrococcus,furiosus) hydrogenase electrodes in working configuration, {{using a combination of}} well defined electrochemical and spectrophotometric techniques. Electrodes based on porous pyrolytic carbon paper (PCP) and packed graphite columns (PGC) were fabricated for hydrogenase immobilization, which used a direct (hydrophilic adsorption) technique. Potentiostatic de polarization, dynamic potentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were combined with spectrophotometric detection of enzyme activity in order to characterize the electrodes and differentiate the relative contributions from enzyme <b>loading,</b> <b>charge</b> transfer, and mass transport to the limiting current density, which is a critical consideration for electrodes intended for fuel cell and bioelectrocatalytic application. Dynamic potentiometry proved useful as a rapid screening and characterization procedure for both blank electrodes and the presence of bound hydrogenase post-immobilization. Combining current density data determined via dc polarization (hydrogen oxidation currents of 30 muA cm(- 2) for PCP electrodes and 90 - 120 muA cm(- 2) PGC electrodes at 75 degreesC) with hydrogen mass transport limits determined via modeling and platinum electrode polarization (480 muA cm(- 2) at 75 degreesC), allowed determination that insufficient active enzyme was present to reach system mass transport limits to hydrogen supply for all electrodes. Additionally, spectrophotometric enzyme determination on the PCP electrode (0. 034 units cm(- 2)) was used to derive a theoretical maximum in hydrogen oxidation current (110 muA cm(- 2), assuming 100 % enzyme/support charge transfer efficiency), which when combined with current density data (30 muA cm(- 2)), allowed determination that actual charge transfer efficiency per unit total bound enzyme was significant (28 %). The EIS scans on immobilized PGC type electrodes suggest that mass transport might attribute the most to cell impedance at the low frequency regime. These combined results indicated that low bulk enzyme loading was the limiting factor to current density for thermostable hydrogenase electrodes fabricated for the study. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|TIMInternational audienceIn {{the context}} of the {{reduction}} of the greenhouse gases emissions, the CO 2 geological storage in aquifers seems inevitable today. The gas mixture, which is captured in the industrial effluents, contains CO 2 and a small quantity of annex gases such as SO 2, NO or O 2. It is fundamental then to understand the role of those gases on the geological behavior of the aquifers to ensure safety of the storage. This project is conducted order the hospice and the financial support of the French National Agency for Research (ANR SIGARRR). The main thrust of this project is to conduct geochemical and thermodynamic simulations to model the long-term behavior of co-injected gases within CO 2 storage sites. Our main goal in this global project is to understand the thermodynamic behavior of gases (CO 2, SO 2, NO and O 2) in aqueous salted solutions representative of the aquifers. We will determine experimentaly the enthalpies of solution and solubilities of gases in the aqueous solutions as function of the temperature, the pressure {{and the nature of the}} salts using calorimetric technic. The results will be used to validate and improve the equations of state developed by the other partners of the SIGARRR project. The calorimetric technique used in this work is similar to the one used previously to study the dissolution of CO 2 in aqueous solutions of amines or for the dissolution ofCO 2 and H 2 S in sodium chloride solutions. The heat of mixing of CO 2 in aqueous solutions are measured using a custom-made flow-mixing cell adapted to a Setaram C- 80 heat conduction differential calorimeter. This unit was housed in the calorimetric block, where the heat effect during the absorption of the gas into the aqueous solution of amine was detected by thermopiles.

40|$|With {{this article}} we want to {{identify}} the main scalability issues {{for the development of}} Massive Multi-Player Online Games. There is no generic architecture to achieve scalability for every problem. We must understand the nature of the problem in order to reach system scalability. Massive Multi-Player Online Games (MMOG) are conceived with the objective of massive use by a potentially geographically dispersed population. In their design we are faced with scalability challenges which are specific to the interactive modalities and the socio-technical scenarios we intend to enable [Fitch 2001]. The emergence of the Internet made possible the development of interactive distributed systems that can be accessed by thousands of users in virtually any part of the world. The scalability issues introduced by such a massive use must be considered in the system design. By scalability we mean the system fit capacity according to his <b>loading</b> <b>charge,</b> for example, accommodates increasing interaction volume, without significant degradation of quality service. It is commonly known that scalability can’t be secured if we only pay attention to some system parts. To achieve scalability in any kind of distributed system we must design all the components to achieve this goal. For example, a system that has high scalability in the simulation and low communication scalability may result in a poor scalable system, globally. To see the scalability problems in a MMOG we must understand the system dynamics and structure and what’s bound for. Looking at the existent types of MMOG – massive multi-player online role playing games, virtual environments, massive multiplayer real time strategy, massive multiplayer online first-person shooter – we can try to generalize some features that allow us to analyze their scalability requisites. Normally, in this kind of games the action takes place in a virtual 3 D environment, where thousands of players interact by controlling avatars, allowing real-time interaction between users in simulated virtual worlds. The action environment can be persistent {{in order to maintain the}} notion of space and time continuity [wikipedia 2004]. From an analysis of the characteristics of MMOG systems and their usage we can start to identify four main scalability issues: a) simulation capacity that allows for thousands of players to be online in the same virtual world; b) data storage capacity of all the information that is used to represent the virtual worlds and one efficient distribution method for guaranteeing availability when needed; c) reliable and efficient communications for experience coordination and smooth interaction; d) architectural integration enabling system expansibility through new computational, communication and storage resources. Next we will briefly discuss these issues. The simulation component role in MMOG is to process the events that are generated through the player’s interaction or by sub-systems that generate automatic environmental activities (e. g., atmospheric, AI bots). Besides the high event volume that must be processed, the simulation activity has other challenge: the size of the virtual universe data model. Virtual universe action area can have the size of a planet or even a galaxy, which becomes very complex to handle [Rosedale 2003]. As previously referred, the MMOG environments are commonly 3 D and very dynamic, being impossible for the clients to keep the virtual world state. So, when a player enters the virtual world must be given to him all the information necessary to animate that world. This information has two different types: data model that represents abstractly the virtual world; and the necessary multimedia elements needed to visual and sonorous animation. Nature and volume size of multimedia information become the main problem of the distribution system [Yu-Shen 1997]. Communication scalability is one of the essential issues in simulated real-time games through Internet. Scalability must be understood not only by the capacity to support communication between a high numbers of players, but also, as the capacity to maintain a communication performance level that doesn’t put at risk the game experience quality. This fact in the MMOG systems is paradigmatic, since there are possible thousand of players interacting with the world objects and moving in the same space. Objects state and players activity must be informed to all players in order to maintain the game integrity/consistency [Smed 2001]. Structural scalability is important to increase the system live span. In order to achieve this requisite the system structure must be designed to enable the addition of new resources. Architectural scalability, through the specification of clear system components that interact in a clear dynamics, through defined protocols, is a pre-requisite for system repairing, actualization and evolution; and must also have the capacity to integrate significantly contribute to the later incorporation of new technologies and devices. At first glance, we would think that to achieve scalability in MMOG implementations we would simply have to work on an architectural design to satisfy all the requisites that have been presented. But that would not be enough. System scalability also emerges from the balance and harmony of the system components. When we are trying to satisfy some requisite, the ideal solution may be in conflict with some other requisite. For example, the best solution for the distribution of static content (such as 3 D models, textures and sounds) can jeopardize communication scalability for more immediate real-time events, as their compete for the available bandwidth. The best solution may not be the optimal one for any system component, but the best overall solution for the integrated system, that guarantees an adequate level of quality to the interactive experience. In order to achieve such a balance we have to consider an adequate partitioning of responsibilities for the components and the internal and the external dynamics that are originated...|$|E

In recent years, the government regards promoting the development of electric vehicles (EVs) and construction of charging facilities as national strategic initiatives.

It is necessary to pre-evaluate the potential charging demand of a charging station (CS) before planning and the simulation of the <b>charging</b> <b>load</b> of the CS is the basis for this work. Similar to power load forecasting approximation, the scenario, neural network and other methods [2, 3] have been introduced to study <b>charging</b> <b>load.</b> However, the <b>charging</b> <b>load</b> depends on the behavior of the EV itself, in which the charging events primarily occur in the CS, where the movement and space-time characteristics need to be fully considered in order to achieve an accurate calculation.
