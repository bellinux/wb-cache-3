40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} enumerating all instances of a given pattern graph in a large data graph. Our focus is on determining the input/output (I/O) complexity of this problem. Let E be the number of edges in the data graph, k=O(1) be the number of vertices in the pattern graph, B be the block length, and M be the main memory size. The main results of the paper are two algorithms that enumerate all instances of the pattern graph. The first one is a deterministic algorithm that exploits a suitable independent set of the pattern graph of size 1 ≤ s ≤ k/ 2 and requires O(E^k-s/(BM^k-s- 1)) I/Os. The second algorithm is a randomized algorithm that enumerates all instances in O(E^k/ 2 /(BM^k/ 2 - 1)) expected I/Os; the same bound also applies with high probability under some assumptions. A lower bound shows that the deterministic algorithm is optimal for some pattern graphs with s=k/ 2 (e. g., paths and cycles <b>of</b> even <b>length,</b> <b>meshes</b> <b>of</b> even <b>side),</b> while the randomized algorithm is optimal for a wide class of pattern graphs, called Alon class (e. g., cliques, cycles and every graph with a perfect matching) ...|$|R

To overcome this disadvantage, a new way based on cross-section method is presented to calculate the deformation of helical tooth tip. First, the tooth is divided into copies of cross-section along face width and the moment of inertia for each section is calculated. Also, the load is distributed according to <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the contact line, {{and the effect of}} deflected load is taken into account as well. Based on these works, a general formula of helical tooth tip deformation is deduced. Then, this formula is applied to calculate the adden-dum modification width ac. In addition, considering that tooth tip modification will shorten the meshing line, three models used to control <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the remaining <b>meshing</b> line are proposed and addendum modification height hc is defined accordingly. Finally, an instance is given to verify the good agreement between results of this study and those of a finite element model. Apart from this, engineering application of this method is provided...|$|R

This ensures that our incremental crack-path approximation converges to its corresponding continuum solution. Our algorithm satisfies this requirement automatically because the <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> fracture-surface segments, generated either by edge division or repositioning, scale with element diameter. We demonstrated crack-path convergence with reducing adaptive tolerances in an example with stochastic nucleation disabled in [1]. Beyond its capabilities for accurately tracking {{fracture surface}} trajectories, our implementation properly handles fracture-surface extensions that intersect the domain boundary or another fracture surface; i.e., crack coalescence.|$|R
