5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was <b>Levee</b> 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. <b>Levee</b> 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and <b>Levee</b> 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a <b>levee</b> along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|However, the city's <b>levee</b> {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major <b>levee</b> breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal <b>levee,</b> the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal <b>levee</b> was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s {{the defence}} bases in Wagga Wagga again became an {{important}} part of the city. The Army camp at Kapooka was reopened as a recruit training centre from 1951, a role it maintains to this day. RAAF Base Wagga at Forest Hill also expanded, with training of defence force aircraft technicians there from 1969. After a series of major floods in the early 1950s, the City Council protected the city area on the south flood plain through construction of a <b>levee,</b> completed in 1962. The <b>levee</b> was designed to provide protection from floods at levels expected once every one hundred years. North Wagga Wagga was initially excluded from protection however by 1982 another <b>levee</b> was constructed to protect the village, although at a lower standard.|$|E
50|$|Internal <b>levees</b> are {{constructional}} features fed by flows that partially spilled out of channelised confinement, but were largely unable {{to escape the}} confinement of the channel-belt. The flows which build internal <b>levees</b> may interact with the main confining surface, i.e., the external <b>levees,</b> and/or the channel-belt erosion surface, and are liable to erosion by the migration or avulsions of channel thalwegs, and the overbank passage of large flows not confined by the internal <b>levees.</b> As a consequence of lateral migration, internal <b>levees</b> may be better preserved on inner bends (Schwarz and Arnott, 2007). Internal <b>levees</b> form only when confinement has been established, {{through the construction of}} external <b>levees</b> and/or the degradation and entrenchment of the composite erosion surface of the channel-belt, or within canyon confinement (Deptuck et al., 2003). Internal <b>levees</b> may form distinct wedges of sediment where enough space is available; where space is limited, i.e., where overspill from underfit channels interacts with external <b>levees</b> or erosional confinement, overspill deposits may appear superficially similar to terrace deposits, which are widely identified in the subsurface (Damuth et al., 1988; Babonneau et al., 2004).|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to clarify relationships between frogs abundance and environments such as arrangement, grass height, and grass coverage of <b>levees</b> around paddy fields in an alluvial fan. Target species ware Rana porosa porosa adults, yearlings, and Hyla japonica yearlings that were widely distributed in study region. Walking on the <b>levees,</b> frogs abundance and the condition of <b>levees</b> were recorded. When a ditch was adjacent to the <b>levees,</b> the environments of ditch were investigated. R. porosa porosa adults were abundant <b>levees</b> where the earth ditch was adjacent, whereas R. porosa porosa yearlings were abundant <b>levees</b> where plant height was low. On the other hand, H. japonica yearlings were abundant <b>levees</b> where a concrete ditch and the woods are adjacent or plant height was high. In the agricultural landscape, It is important to conserve the habitat for R. porosa porosa whose range of environmental preference is narrower than that of H. japonica. We should be conserved the good ditch environments such as the earth ditch with high grass coverage, and clarified the best management practices of <b>levees</b> for frogs...|$|R

5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the <b>Levée</b> en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the <b>Levée</b> en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E

50|$|Keeping floodwaters out of New Orleans {{motivated}} the region’s most influential landscape manipulation: the erection of artificial <b>levees</b> on {{the crown of}} natural <b>levees</b> to prevent overbank flooding.

40|$|Although natural <b>levees</b> {{and lower}} basins are typical geomorphic {{features}} along tidal marsh creeks, long-term sedimentation and elevation changes in tidal marshes were traditionally studied using 0 -dimensional point models without considering spatial variations. In this study, the long-term {{evolution of the}} surface elevation of tidal marsh <b>levees</b> and adjacent basins was studied by applying a 0 -dimensional, time-stepping model (MARSED) using spatially differentiated model parameter values for <b>levees</b> and basins. Firstly, the model was calibrated using field data on short-term (< 1 year) spatio-temporal variations in sedimentation rates measured along four levee-basin transects within tidal marshes along the Scheldt estuary (SW Netherlands-Belgium). Secondly, the long-term (10 - 100 years) elevation change of the <b>levees</b> and basins was simulated, starting from a historically known marsh elevation. Predicted elevations were successfully validated against the present-day observed topography along each of the studied levee-basin transects. The model simulations show that the elevation difference between <b>levees</b> and basins tends to an equilibrium. Once <b>levees</b> grow 20 to 30 cm higher than the adjacent basins, the positive influence of the proximity of a tidal creek on the sedimentation rate on the <b>levees</b> is compensated by the negative influence on the sedimentation rate of the higher surface elevation on the <b>levees.</b> Once this sedimentological, geomorphic equilibrium condition is attained, both <b>levees</b> and basins accumulate at the same rate, which is in equilibrium with the rate of mean high water level (MHWL) rise. Finally, additional simulations show that the equilibrium elevation difference between <b>levees</b> and basins is mainly determined by the rate of mean sea-level rise and the incoming sediment concentration. A faster sea-level rise will result not only in a lower equilibrium elevation of the marsh surface relative to MHWL but also in a more pronounced elevation difference between <b>levees</b> and adjacent basins. On the other hand, higher incoming sediment concentrations will result in higher equilibrium elevations. Significantly larger elevation differences between <b>levees</b> and basins are only obtained for increased differences in incoming sediment concentrations between <b>levees</b> and basins. This study demonstrates that the long-term response of tidal marsh surfaces to different scenarios of changing sea-level and incoming sediment concentrations is not uniform in space, but that spatial variability in tidal marsh morphodynamics is important and that natural <b>levees</b> and inner basins will react in different ways.

25|$|Because of its {{distance}} from {{areas where the}} <b>levees</b> were breached during Hurricane Katrina (2005) {{as well as the}} strength and height of the nearest river <b>levees</b> in contrast to other waterway <b>levees</b> or flood walls, Katrina flood damage was relatively light in the Quarter as compared with other areas {{of the city and the}} greater region.|$|R
5|$|Long before {{non-indigenous}} people {{explored the}} region, tribes of Native Americans fished and hunted along the slough. In the early 19thcentury fur trappers and explorers including Lewis and Clark visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east. The newcomers farmed, cut timber, built houses, {{and by the}} early 20thcentury established cities, shipping ports, roads, rail lines and industries near the slough. Increased investment in the floodplain led to larger losses during floods, and these losses prompted <b>levee</b> building that greatly altered the area. A flood pouring through a <b>levee</b> break in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, which was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|On the mainland, SR 160 {{once again}} runs atop the east <b>levee,</b> now 1–2 miles (1.5–3km) west of Interstate 5. The final {{bridge over the}} river is the Freeport Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west <b>levee,</b> where it turns south to return to SR 160 at {{the west end of}} the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5km) beyond the Freeport Bridge, SR 160 leaves the <b>levee,</b> enters the city of Sacramento (where state {{maintenance}} and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as Freeport Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. Freeport Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a one-way pair with 21st Street with Freeport heading one-way southbound and 21st heading one-way northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way streets for traffic calming purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the one-way pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.|$|E

5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, Hurricane Florence produced {{higher than}} normal tides, including a peak observation of 7.5feet (2.3m) {{above mean sea level}} on the Bayou Benvenue to the east of New Orleans. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1inch (25mm) to a maximum of 4.05inches (103mm) at Watson. Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64mph (103km/h) at an automatic Coast Guard Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish. Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of the <b>levee</b> system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, and Saint Tammany Parishes. On Grand Isle, strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40feet (12.2m) of beach. The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix. The passage of the hurricane broke a <b>levee</b> in Delacroix; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the <b>levee</b> being pumped to the gulf. Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000people without power for some period of time during the storm.
