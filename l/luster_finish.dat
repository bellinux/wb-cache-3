50|$|Decorative bright nickel {{is used in}} a {{wide range}} of applications. It offers a high <b>luster</b> <b>finish,</b> {{corrosion}} protection, and wear resistance. In the automotive industry bright nickel can be found on bumpers, rims, exhaust pipes and trim. It is also used for bright work on bicycles and motorcycles. Other applications include hand tools and household items such as lighting and plumbing fixtures, wire racks, firearms, and appliances.|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} {{in order to examine}} the relation between the <b>luster</b> of <b>finished</b> surface and the adhesion property of materials cut usually called as affinity. High speed steel tool and carbide tool are used for the comparison of performance. Brass, Al alloy, pure iron and pure titanium are used as materials cut. Adhesion tests in the vacuum furnace are carried out for each combination of the above tools and materials cut and their results are compared with the luster and roughness of the finished surface. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The <b>luster</b> of <b>finished</b> surface has a close relation to the roughness of finished surface. (2) The effect of diamond tool for the <b>luster</b> of <b>finished</b> surface is due to the less roughness of finished surface and affinity for materials cut. (3) Diamond tool shows an excellent <b>luster</b> in the <b>finishing</b> of brass and Al alloy in the correspondence with the less affinity for them. But, it shows a poor <b>luster</b> in the <b>finishing</b> of pure titanium and pure iron which have better affinity...|$|R
