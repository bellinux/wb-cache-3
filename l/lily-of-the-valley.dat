500|$|Scholar Judith Farr {{notes that}} Dickinson, during her lifetime, [...] "was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, {{than as a}} poet". Dickinson studied botany {{from the age of}} nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead. During her lifetime, she {{assembled}} a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound herbarium. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the Linnaean system. The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun. Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered [...] "carpets of <b>lily-of-the-valley</b> and pansies, platoons of sweetpeas, hyacinths, enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of peony hedges and drifts of daffodils in season, marigolds to distraction—a butterfly utopia". In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she [...] "could inhabit the Spice Isles merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but [...] "they valued the posy more than the poetry".|$|E

2500|$|The young bridesmaids wore dresses {{designed}} by Nicki Macfarlane, handmade {{with the help}} of Macfarlane's daughter Charlotte, in their homes at Wiltshire and Kent. The gowns echoed the bride's dress and were made with the same fabrics and button detail along the back. They were described as having a [...] "ballerina-length, full, box pleated skirt" [...] and were hand finished with English Cluny lace. Their ivy and <b>lily-of-the-valley</b> hair wreaths were influenced by Catherine's mother Carole's headdress at her 1981 wedding to Michael Middleton.|$|E

6000|$|He {{thought he}} had never seen any thing as pretty as his {{mistress}} when, an hour later, she {{came out of the house}} in her white shawl and bonnet, holding a book and a late <b>lily-of-the-valley</b> in the pearl-colored gloves, which he hardly dared to touch as he helped her into the carriage. He had seen a good many fine ladies in his life; and those he had known had been very gay in the colors of their hats and gowns, very fond of cheap jewelry, and much given to feathers, lace, and furbelows; so it rather puzzled him to discover why Miss Celia looked so sweet and elegant in such a simple suit. He did not then know that the charm was in the woman, not the clothes; or that merely living near such a person would do more to give him gentle manners, good principles, and pure thoughts, than almost any other training he could have had. But he was conscious that it was pleasant to be there, neatly dressed, in good company, and going to church like a respectable boy. Somehow, the lonely feeling got better as he rolled along between green fields, with the June sunshine brightening every thing, a restful quiet in the air, and a friend beside him who sat silently looking out at the lovely world with what he afterward learned to call her [...] "Sunday face,"--a soft, happy look, as if all the work and weariness of the past week were forgotten, and she was ready to begin afresh when this blessed day was over.|$|E
