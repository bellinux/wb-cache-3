5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

Twenty four dogs positive of mange regardless of sex and age {{were used in the}} study. They were distributed into four treatments and replicated thrice with two dogs per replicate following the Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). Dogs were also classified based on the severity of lesions. Skin scraping was conducted before the application of the different treatments to determine the number and species of mites present. Post-treatment mite count was done on each dog using the same site from the pre-treatment mite count. Extract from fresh <b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> leaves were used in making the ointment. The ointment was applied to the experimental animals twice a week for eight weeks using the different preparations such as the following: T 0 – Plain Ointment, T 1 – 20 % <b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> ointment, T 2 – 25 % <b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> ointment and T 3 – 30 % <b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> ointment The gathered data were tabulated using means and percentages.

40|$|Herbivory on the {{above-ground}} {{plant parts}} can induce {{the production of}} volatiles that attract carnivorous enemies of the herbivores. These volatiles may be induced systemically in the damaged plant. In a previous study, we had shown that a systemic elicitor that induces the production of predator-attracting volatiles in <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> plants can be collected from <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> leaves by placing spider-mite-infested leaves with their petiole in water. However, it remained unknown to what sites this elicitor was transported within the plant. Here, we show that exposing uninfested <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> leaves to this elicitor also results in a reduced rate of reproduction in spider mites (Tetranychus urticae). Furthermore, an elicitor can also be collected from whole <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> plants of which one primary leaf was infested with spider mites, by detaching the other primary leaf and inserting the petiole, that is still connected to the plant, in a vial with distilled water. When uninfested <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> leaves are incubated in this elicitor solution for three days, this results in the attraction of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis in an olfactometer. Finally, an elicitor of predator-attracting volatiles was collected from whole infested <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> plants by placing the plants with their roots in distilled water. Uninfested <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> plants that were subsequently placed with their roots in this water became attractive to the predatory mite P. persimilis relative to control plants that had been placed with their roots in water in which uninfested bean plants had been incubated previously. These data indicate that herbivore-infested plants may interact with undamaged neighbouring plants through chemical information that is exchanged in the soil. Important issues {{that need to be}} addressed next are discussed. The connection of above- and below-ground interactions of plants with other organisms will have important consequences for future ecological studies on multitrophic interactions...|$|R

The <b>Lima</b> <b>bean,</b> Phaseolus lunatus L., is a crop of regional importance on the Peruvian Coast. Within the framework of a collaborative project between the ""faculté universitaire des Sciences agronomiques'"" in Gembloux and the ""Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina"" in Lima, we carried out a diagnosis of this speculation in the Ica, Pisco and Casma valleys in order to define the constraints which limit crop yields and to suggest improvements within the reach of the smallholders. To achieve these objectives we carried out a formal survey, centred on the <b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> crop and smallholder relations with the agro-socio-economical environment, and an informal survey, centred on the studied farm systems. To complete these data we met some key informants belonging to all the sectors in contact with agriculture.
