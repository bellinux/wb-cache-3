[...] During the 1886 session, he {{became a member of}} the Council (upper house). [...] He chaired a joint committee on military and Indian affairs and served as the session's Spanish <b>language</b> <b>translator.</b> [...] Gass was elected President of the Council during the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature. [...] During the 5th Arizona Territorial Legislature, Gass represented both Mohave and Pah-Ute counties. [...] To reach the new territorial capital in Tucson, Gass and Andrew S. Gibbons rafted down the Colorado River. [...] The two men chose this route to avoid Indian attack but instead hazarded several sets of rapids in their [...] boat. [...] Upon reaching Yuma they were delayed because a stagecoach had been attacked by Indians, killing all aboard, and a replacement driver was not immediately available. [...] The pair arrived at the session a week late but were able to entertain other legislators with tales of their journey.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1981 Kraftwerk {{released}} Computer World (German: Computerwelt) on EMI records. It {{was recorded}} at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981. Much {{of this time}} was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour. [...] Some of the electronic vocals on Computer World were generated using a Texas Instruments <b>language</b> <b>translator.</b> [...] "Computer Love" [...] was released as a single backed with the Man-Machine track [...] "The Model". [...] Radio DJs {{were more interested in}} the B-side so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with [...] "The Model" [...] as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making [...] "The Model" [...] Kraftwerk's most successful song in that country. As a result, the Man-Machine album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the album chart in February 1982. The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording Computer World.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a computer assisted translation tool on the productivity and quality of translations that are undertaken in minority languages. The minority language translation environment is described, and a range of computer tools that can assist these translators is explained, with a focus on the Google Translator Toolkit. A small-scale study was undertaken where Māori <b>language</b> <b>translators</b> in New Zealand were asked to use the Google Translator Toolkit and then report back on its effectiveness. The responses were grouped into areas of cultural acceptability, translation productivity, quality, and community collaboration. Due to the small number of participants the results are somewhat anecdotal, but nevertheless suggest that such technology can increase the productivity and quality of minority language translations. It may also lead to more collaboration amongst community <b>language</b> <b>translators...</b>|$|R

The paper {{presents}} a synthesis of the educational evolution of Brazilian Sign <b>Language</b> <b>translators</b> and interpreters. In 2002, a law was passed recognizing Brazilian Sign Language as the official language used by the Brazilian Deaf community. Since this legislation, numerous actions {{have been developed to}} give deaf Brazilians the right to access society in their own language, one of these rights is the translation and interpreting of this language. The qualification of translators and interpreters in Brazil has always been linked to the deaf groups who have argued for the recognition of the Brazilian Sign Language as their mother tongue. Through a Brazilian policy that recognizes this <b>language,</b> <b>translators</b> and interpreters can now achieve undergraduate and graduate level qualifications. This paper presents this process of conquests and qualifications by these professionals in the country...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} who use pocket electronic dictionaries (ED), electronic spellers, grammar checkers and electronic <b>language</b> <b>translators</b> in ESL classrooms has increased over the past few years. However, very few studies investigated the role of electronic dictionaries, electronic spellers, grammar checkers and electronic <b>language</b> <b>translators</b> in ESL. Two studies by Tang (1997) and Aust (1993) investigated the use of pocket ED's by ESL students at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Tang's study examined ED features, uses, effectiveness as a tool for learning, and students’ perceptions of ED usefulness. Aust's study examined measures of consultation, study time, efficiency and comprehension, and use of bilingual and monolingual ED's. Another study by Zupanicic (1995) compared the use of an electronic speller and a personal spelling dictionary in increasing elementary students' awareness of standard spelling. Another study by Lamb (1991) investigated use of Webster's Dictionary on CD-ROM in large-group and library media skills instruction...|$|R
