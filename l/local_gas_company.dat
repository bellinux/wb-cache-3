The letters threatened Encana to cease its operations near {{the small town of}} Tomslake, B.C., just south of Dawson Creek, and close to Trickle Creek. Following these letters local pipelines were hit by six explosions. Because these explosions were similar to other acts of vandalism which had occurred around Ludwig's farm, police suspected his involvement. Following the bombings Encana offered a reward of up to a million dollars for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the bomber. In September 2009 Ludwig wrote an open letter to the bomber(s) supporting their cause but encouraging them to stop their bombings.|$|R

40|$|State {{statutes}} prohibit unjust or unreasonable {{natural gas}} utility rates.

40|$|In the mid- 1980 s, {{customers}} {{threatened to}} bypass <b>local</b> <b>gas</b> distribution <b>companies</b> {{in favor of}} other suppliers and cheaper fuels. In response, states began to reform their natural gas regulatory policies to lower delivered prices to potential bypassers. In this Article, Professor Kelly argues that the most promising means of reform is to unbundle traditional <b>local</b> <b>gas</b> utility services, that is, to make gas transportation services available to customers separately from gas retail sales services. This Article provides a thorough analysis of the unbundling policies adopted by state regulators across the nation. Through this systematic review of intrastate regulatory policies, Professor Kelly outlines the best method of maintaining open access to markets, of retaining sufficient regulatory control over local utility companies, and of maximizing competition and minimizing the adverse effects of cost-shifting and stranded investment. Professor Kelly asserts that regulatory bodies must recognize the competitive character of unbundled gas retailing service and the monopolistic nature of both unbundled gas transportation services and the services that remain bundled, {{in order to promote}} most effectively the primary goal of unbundling: prevention of uneconomic bypass by providing market-priced natural gas to end users...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new {{method of estimating}} the one-in-N low temperature threshold using a non-parametric statistical method called kernel density estimation applied to daily average wind-adjusted temperatures. We apply our One-in-N Algorithm to <b>local</b> <b>gas</b> distribution <b>companies</b> (LDCs), as they have to forecast the daily natural gas needs of their consumers. In winter, demand for natural gas is high. Extreme low temperature events are {{not directly related to}} an LDCs gas demand forecasting, but knowledge of extreme low temperatures is important to ensure that an LDC has enough capacity to meet customer demands when extreme low temperatures are experienced. We present a detailed explanation of our One-in-N Algorithm and compare it to the methods using the generalized extreme value distribution, the normal distribution, and the variance-weighted composite distribution. We show that our One-in-N Algorithm estimates the one-in-N low temperature threshold more accurately than the methods using the generalized extreme value distribution, the normal distribution, and the variance-weighted composite distribution according t...|$|R

50|$|Like almost {{everywhere}} in Minden-Ravensberg the textile industry initially emerged in proto-industrial form and, later, {{was supported by}} the Prussian state with the construction of the Cologne-Minden Railway and its branch line from Bünde to Rahden, opened in 1899. The cigar industry developed into an important economic factor in Bünde Land and the surrounding towns, including Lübbecke, from about 1860. In 1863 August Blase founded a cigar factory, which had 6,000 employees by 1938. This included employees in its many branches, because just as before in the proto-industrial textile sector, cigars were often cut, rolled and pressed in the home or in stalls. These two branches of the economy - the textile and tobacco industries - are still represented in Lübbecke today, even though their influence now lags behind that of engineering and other industries. In 1907, the last section of the Minden District Railway to Lübbecke opened (running from Minden via Hille to Eickhorst in 1903). In the 1950s, the narrow gauge railway was converted from metre gauge to standard gauge due to the transport of goods. Operations were discontinued in 1974 and the track dismantled between Hille and Lübbecke. In 1912, the first houses were connected to the electrical supply from the Lower Saxon Power Stations. In 1899 the Gasfabrik am Hahlerbaum, a <b>local</b> <b>gas</b> <b>company,</b> was founded; the precursor to today's public utilities. From 1934 Lübbecke had a central water supply.|$|E

The building that the gas leak occurred in was destroyed and contained Portland Bagel Works, Fetch Eyewear, and Artwork Rebels Tattoo Parlor. Other businesses also affected by the explosion include Pizzicato, Dosha Salon, FedEx Office, and Umpqua Bank. After this, hundreds of firefighters, police officers, and paramedics responded.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} and design of the multivariable time series prediction. It deals mainly with problems that are common for utility companies that distribute and control the transport of their applicable commodity. The basic motivation is to foresee potential problems that can cause harmful effects in the future and to maximize company objectives and customer's satisfaction. The developed predictive methodology is based on the designed data management structures that define basic data flow. The predictive methodology utilizes several prediction techniques, such as regression by means of singular value decomposition, support vector machines and neural networks. Data management structures are opened to other predictive algorithms as well. The methodology is implemented {{in the form of the}} software tool. It is verified on the real-life prediction task -prediction on the daily <b>gas</b> consumption of <b>local</b> <b>gas</b> utility <b>companies.</b> The methodology as well as the developed tool is prepared to be applied to the prediction of other distributed commodities such as water, electricity, sewage and others.
