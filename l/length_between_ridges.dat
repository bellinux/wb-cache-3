5000|$|Compared to its {{neighboring}} ridges, the Aden ridge is {{much more}} segmented. The Aden Ridge is broken up by seven transform faults with ridge segments of 10 - 40 km. In contrast, the Sheba Ridge is broken by only three transform faults and the Tadjoura Ridge continues essentially uninterrupted to the Afar Plume. [...] Sauter et al. (2001) proposed that variations in the spacing of spreading cells along ridges {{is a result of}} spreading rate; i.e., larger spacing results from slower spreading rates. However, the variation in spreading rates across the Gulf of Aden, 18 mm/yr in the east and 13 mm/yr in the west, is not great enough to explain the significant variation in spreading cell <b>length</b> <b>between</b> the Aden <b>ridge</b> and its neighboring ridges. [...] One likely cause for the segmentation of the Aden ridge is its distance from the Afar plume. The western most region of the Gulf, where the Tadjoura Ridge is located, has an anomalously high mantle temperature due to its proximity to the Afar plume. The result of this is higher degrees of melting and magmatism below the ridge, which allows for longer spreading segments without transform faults. [...] The difference in segmentation between the Aden and Sheba ridges can be explained by varying degrees of obliquity. The ocean-continent transition (OTC) of the Sheba ridge formed parallel to the syn-rift structure, whereas the OTC of the Aden ridge formed oblique to the syn-rift structure. The former scenario is more accommodating to oblique spreading and does not require as many transform faults for stability.|$|R
