25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} battle system a {{refreshing}} mix from other role-playing games. Fitch of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that [...] "it keeps getting better the <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> play". Joystiq's Kubba called the game's combat a [...] "triumph", praising {{its ability to}} blend different styles, and GameTrailers found it [...] "immensely satisfying". Kotaku's Schreier felt that the combat never feels unfair, although criticized {{the use of the}} artificial intelligence during the battle. Phil Iwaniuk of Official PlayStation Magazine found the game's consistent battle encounters irritating, but that combat is [...] "otherwise a pleasure". Polygons Kollar felt that the game's artificial intelligence resulted in a [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "frustrating" [...] combat system.|$|E
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month <b>longer,</b> <b>you</b> will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E

[...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more adventurous and rewarding release". The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- {{it becomes clear that}} these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world... ever? Could be..." [...] Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "The most common description of this much-discussed album {{over the past few months}} is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that." [...] Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi." [...] Q likewise gave it four stars and called it [...] "battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts" [...] and that it [...] "at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating." [...] Yahoo!

2500|$|After the {{announcement}} of the mobile game Super Mario Run in September 2016, Nintendo's stock soared to just under its recent high point after the release and success of Pokémon Go earlier in the year, something noted by journalists as even more significant than Pokémon Go, as Super Mario Run was developed in-house by Nintendo, which was not the case with Pokémon Go. In a December 2016 interview prior to the release of Super Mario Run, Miyamoto explained that the company believed that with some of their game franchises, [...] "the <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> continue to make a series, the more complex the gameplay becomes, and the harder it becomes for new players {{to be able to get}} into the series", and that the company sees mobile games with simplified controls, such as Super Mario Run, not only allows them to [...] "make a game that the broadest audience of people could play", but to also reintroduce these properties to newer audiences and draw them to their consoles.|$|E

2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax.

He knew he was in very serious trouble and he knew he was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed.

2500|$|National {{security}} reporter Spencer Ackerman {{said the}} film [...] "does not present torture as a silver bullet {{that led to}} bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet". Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us to ask ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> look at them the thornier they get".|$|E

Pearson signed a five-year contract and was introduced at the Grant Hockey Educational Center on Michigan Tech's campus on May10. At the press conference, Pearson posited that what separates him from the previous alumni who have returned to coach the Huskies is his 30years of experience. [...] "As you're in the game <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> get a bigger network of people who can help you recruit, so I think that's the biggest difference right now", Pearson said. Bill Muckalt, a veteran of five National Hockey League (NHL) seasons who was coached by Pearson at Michigan, was hired as an assistant coach in June; Damon Whitten was retained as the other assistant coach. [...] "Our coaching staff has done a lot of winning and we want to instill the attitude that we're going to win", Whitten said. Pearson spoke of changing the team's style of play to emphasize skill, speed and offensive creativity, and said his staff's efforts would be focused on recruiting for the next few months. He brought in Steve Shields, another former NHL player who played under Pearson at Michigan, as a volunteer goaltending coach in September.|$|E
