2500|$|Campbell {{was born}} in Panama City, Florida. He grew up there and in Jacksonville, Florida, where he {{graduated}} from Jean Ribault High School in 1968. At 16, he bought his first guitar, a cheap Harmony model, from a pawnshop. His first electric guitar was a $60 Guyatone. Like Tom Petty, Campbell drew his strongest influences from The Byrds and Bob Dylan, with additional inspiration coming from guitarists such as Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, George Harrison, Carl Wilson, Jerry Garcia, Roger McGuinn, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page, Mick Taylor, and Neil Young. The first song he learned to play was [...] "Baby <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down," [...] a song which appeared on Dylan's eponymous debut album.|$|E

[...] "My father {{might be willing to}} grace Sir Reginald by <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> him, but by his death I am my own man, and not to move at your beck and call, because the Prince laid his sword on your shoulder. Knave Jasper," [...] he called to one of the men-at-arms, [...] "bring my sword and cloak from the tent; I enter it no more." ...|$|R
60|$|CHAPTER I. THE HOUSE OF ASTORRE FIFANTI. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>follow</b> in {{too close}} detail the {{incidents}} of that journey lest I {{be in danger}} of becoming tedious. In themselves they contained laughable matter enough, but in the mere relation they may seem dull.|$|R
2500|$|There {{were several}} line-up changes over the years, with King and Madsen from the {{original}} Starfires along with vocalist Sonny Geraci forming {{the core of the}} band in the early years. [...] After drummer Ronnie Harkai left the band to join the Air Force, Denny Benson and then Ricky Baker (real name: Rick Biagiola) handled drumming duties for a period of time. With Ronnie Harkai having departed prior to sessions for the first album, former Starfire Jimmy Fox (who had left the earlier band to go to college) was brought in by King to be the drummer for the remaining tracks of Time Won't <b>Let</b> <b>Me.</b> <b>Following</b> these sessions, Fox decided to return to the music world and founded a band in 1966 called the James Gang that would enjoy considerable success over the coming decade. Ronnie Harkai returned to record cuts on the second album Album No.2, along with Ricky Baker.|$|R

6000|$|... "Enough said," [...] replied Dalgarno; [...] "you are perfect--mind {{that you}} {{continue}} so, {{as you would}} avoid my fury. I leave my page below--get porters, and <b>let</b> them <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> instantly with the gold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] {{answered}} the herald. [...] "Does a buck walk {{into an open}} pit? Were the prince to come here it might chance that your spears would talk with him. <b>Let</b> Nodwengo <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> to the camp yonder, where we promise him safe conduct." ...|$|R
5000|$|The key of {{the song}} was {{originally}} a step lower, but the duo changed {{it in order to}} better accommodate Daya's range. The third drop, which includes the saxophone, was created later in the process. The song has a double-time tempo of 80 beats per minute and a key of G♯ minor. [...] "Don't <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Down" [...] <b>follows</b> a chord progression of EBFGm, and Daya's vocals span from G3 to C5.|$|R

40|$|I am {{honored to}} deliver this illustrious lecture {{in the memory}} of Dean Richard Childress, an {{inspirational}} leader in both legal education and human rights, who left as his legacy a solemn conviction that justice should not only be taught, but also demonstrated. In this lecture, <b>let.</b> <b>me</b> try to <b>follow</b> his injunction by asking the question that has preoccupied my own thinking for much of the last decade, namely: what should U. S. human rights policy be for the twenty-first century...|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 the Outsiders {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album for Capitol, which {{was produced by}} Tom King, Time Won't <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> and named for the hit song. [...] It contained five original songs written by King and Kelley. [...] They {{proved to be a}} formidable songwriting team, and the band was also adept at handling covers of R&B songs. [...] Drummer Ronnie Harkai departed shortly after the recording of [...] "Time Won't Let Me" [...] to join the Air Force, and Jim Fox returned briefly to fill in, playing on most of the remaining cuts recorded for the Time Won't <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> album. [...] <b>Following</b> the recording of the album, Bennie Benson became the group's drummer, later to be replaced by Ricky Baker.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{my sister}} is fit to travel I am fit to travel" [...] said her ladyship, with more {{firmness}} than she had yet shown. [...] "I come to beg you will make allowances for my anxiety about Marian, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> her at once by the afternoon train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on, please, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> alone. I want {{to think}} over my {{pleasant}} day, and finish it with waking dreams, as I go through this enchanted wood," [...] said Rose, whose mind was full of sweet yet sober thoughts; for she had gathered herbs of grace while carelessly pulling wayside flowers, and from the simple adventures of the day had unconsciously received lessons that never were forgotten.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me strange afterwards, that of the {{immediate}} future neither of us spoke. I did not even ask her how long {{she was going to}} stay with Lady Dennisford; she did not speak to me of my plans. As she had come, so she went, silently and unexpectedly. She would not even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> her out onto the terrace; from the window I watched her mount her horse and ride away. Only just before she went she had looked back.|$|E
50|$|Verily, verily, I say unto you, еxcept a {{grain of}} wheat fall {{into the ground and}} die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

6000|$|... 2. As God in mercy will guide, so by {{the same}} he will uphold our goings in his paths. We are weak, {{wherefore}} though the path we go in were never so plain, yet we are apt to stumble and fall. But 'when I said my foot slippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up' (Psa 94:18). Wherefore we should always turn our hope into prayer, and say, Lord, 'hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not' (Psa 17:5). Be not moved; <b>let</b> mercy <b>follow</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|FENWICK. Mr. Austin, still {{bear with}} <b>me,</b> still <b>follow</b> <b>me.</b> O sir, will you not picture that dear lady's life? Her years how few, her error thus irreparable, what {{henceforth}} can be her portion but remorse, {{the consciousness of}} self-abasement, the shame of knowing that her trust was ill-bestowed? To think of it: this was a queen among women; and this--this is George Austin's work! Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> touch your heart: <b>let</b> <b>me</b> prevail with you to feel that 'tis impossible.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lorry did so, {{and they}} went down-stairs and out in the streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, {{and turned back to}} the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. [...] "She came out here," [...] he said, looking about him, [...] "turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> in her steps." ...|$|E
60|$|And now I {{will not}} say any more. I know {{that you will be}} {{inclined}} to cry, 'Print it in any case,' but I will entreat of your kindness, which I have so much right to trust in while entreating, not to say one such word. Be kind, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> my own way silently. I have not, indeed, like a spoilt child in a fret, thrown the poem up because I would not alter it, though you have done much to spoil me. I act advisedly, and have made up my mind as to what is the wisest and best thing to do, and personally the pleasantest to myself, after a good deal of serious reflection. 'Pan is dead,' and so best, for the present at least.|$|E
60|$|Edgar {{heard him}} frowningly, then ended the {{discussion}} by rising, and silence {{fell on the}} company, for all {{saw that he was}} offended. But he was not offended with them, since they knew nothing of his and Athelwold's secret, and what they thought and felt about his friend was nothing to him. But these fatal words about Elfrida's beauty had pierced him with a sudden suspicion of his friend's treachery. And Athelwold was the man he greatly loved--the companion of all his years since their boyhood together. Had he betrayed him in this monstrous way--wounding him in his tenderest part? The very thought that such a thing might be was like a madness in him. Then he reflected--then he remembered, and said to himself: Yes, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> his teaching in this matter too, as in the other, and exercise caution and look before I leap. I shall look and look well and see and judge for myself.|$|E

[...] "We're great pards now, Red and I. He doesn't say much, but his acts tell. He will not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone. He <b>follows</b> <b>me</b> everywhere. It's a joke among the men.... Well Allie, it seems {{unbelievable}} that we have crossed {{the mountains and the}} desert--grade ninety feet to the mile! The railroad can and will be built. I wish I could tell you how tremendously all this has worked upon me--upon all the engineers. But somehow I can't. It chokes me. The idea is big. But the work--what shall I call that?... Allie, if you can, imagine some spirit seizing hold of you and making you see difficulties as joys--impossible tasks as only things to strike fire from genius, perils of death as merely incidents of daring adventure to treasure in memory--well that's something like it. The idea of the U. P. has got me. I believe in it. I shall see it accomplished.... I'll live it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} a good day," [...] Arthur {{answered}} sulkily. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> detain you, or give you the trouble to <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> again. I am in a hurry, sir. Good evening." ...|$|R
60|$|The bell of Monastier {{was just}} {{striking}} nine as I got quit of these preliminary troubles and descended the hill through the common. As long as I was {{within sight of}} the windows, a secret shame and the fear of some laughable defeat withheld me from tampering with Modestine. She tripped along upon her four small hoofs with a sober daintiness of gait; from time to time she shook her ears or her tail; and she looked so small under the bundle that my mind misgave me. We got across the ford without difficulty--there was no doubt about the matter, she was docility itself--and once on the other bank, where the road begins to mount through pine woods, I took in my right hand the unhallowed staff, and with a quaking spirit applied it to the donkey. Modestine brisked up her pace for perhaps three steps, and then relapsed into her former minuet. Another application had the same effect, and so with the third. I am worthy the name of an Englishman, and it goes against my conscience to lay my hand rudely on a female. I desisted, and looked her all over from head to foot; the poor brute's knees were trembling and her breathing was distressed; it was plain that she could go no faster on a hill. God forbid, thought I, that I should brutalize this innocent creature; let her go at her own pace, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> patiently <b>follow.</b>|$|R
