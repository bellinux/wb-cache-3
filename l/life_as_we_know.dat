5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood {{is in the form}} of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

The episode features several notable guest appearances. Dan Castellaneta, {{best known as the}} voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons, appears as Dr. Kinny, a sociology professor. Rider Strong guest stars as a student who participates as a guard in the experiment. The episode features a guest appearance by Samm Levine, best known for his role on Freaks and Geeks. Levine had previously worked with series star Chris Lowell on <b>Life</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> It, a show that had been cancelled in 2005. Rachelle Lefevre, known for her later roles as Victoria in The Twilight Saga and in Under the Dome, guest stars as Marjorie, one of the sorority girls who becomes friends with Veronica.|$|E

The whole atmosphere was so different from Egypt and more'so from England and home. We had plenty of time around the dock area waiting whilst our effects were being unloaded, checked and assembled. The glimpses of the many civilians passing by, so different in dress and behaviour from what we were accustomed to was intriguing and in many cases intensely amusing; the happy-go-lucky attitude to the ordinary proprieties of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> them were blissfully absent.

25|$|There are {{two main}} {{drawbacks}} to the pulsar timing method: pulsars are relatively rare, and special circumstances are required for a planet to form around a pulsar.

25|$|However, the {{question}} of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, the radiation, and the host stars plasma environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated.

The events of September 11 have {{had an impact on the}} US office market. This paper will focus on changes to corporate real estate strategic planning and changes to urban high-rise office buildings that have emerged as a response to September 11. Corporate strategy changes that will be discussed will focus on decisions made with respect to the geographic location of human capital, new security measures taken, and business continuity strategies which focus on changes to data storage practices. Changes to physical characteristics of high-rise office buildings will be discussed, emphasizing the changes taking place in the future design and construction of buildings due to architectural, structural, and technological changes and changes in the management and operation of buildings. First we will take a look at the overall office market post September 11 and then will focus on the specific changes that have taken place since that time...|$|R

25|$|The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission {{landed the}} Curiosity rover that is {{currently}} in operation on Mars. It was launched 26 November 2011, and landed at Gale Crater on 6 August 2012. Mission objectives are to help assess Mars' habitability and in doing so, determine whether Mars is or has {{ever been able to}} support life, collect data for a future human mission, study Martian geology, its climate, and further assess the role that water, an essential ingredient for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it, played in forming minerals on Mars.|$|E
25|$|The {{observed}} {{values of}} the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction would bind the dineutron and the diproton, and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen {{in the early universe}} to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.|$|E

Rosetta and Philae will also search for organic molecules, nucleic acids (the building blocks of DNA and RNA) and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) by sampling and analysing the comet's nucleus and coma cloud of gas and dust, helping assess the contribution comets made to the beginnings of life on Earth.
