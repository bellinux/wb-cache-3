5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

As some of the White Witch's tired soldiers are trampled by ground shaking wave of Aslan's reinforcements, Mr. Tumnus knocks down a goblin with another lion running {{next to him and}} Rumblebuffin uses his club on two minotaurs. Peter and the White Witch continue to fight and the White Witch gains the upper hand, tripping Peter to the ground with her sword, pins his arm to the ground, and knocks his shield out of his hand. Just as she prepares to kill him, Aslan charges at the White Witch and knocks her back, as she barely has time to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him pounce at her. A moment of eerie peace ensues as the Witch accepts her doom and Aslan decapitates her. As the reinforcements charge past to scour the battlefield, Aslan tells Peter that [...] "It is finished." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{could not}} see her face. She watched it herself with dim half {{consciousness}} as it changed before her in the tawdry mirror above the mantelpiece, half longing that he might <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> it, half terrified lest he should.|$|E
60|$|So Unc' Billy crept {{along in}} the black shadows until he got where he could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> his own doorway. Then {{he sat down and}} watched a while. All was still. There wasn't a sound in the great hollow tree.|$|E

60|$|I would <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him {{standing}} so smooth and benevolent behind Mrs Monnerie's chair that {{he reminded me}} of my bishop, and I doubt if ever she crisply uttered his delightful name but it recalled the pleasant chime of a poem which my mother had taught me: The Nymph Complaining of the Death of her Fawn.

There is no other place, as you will see by the engraving, where light can come in.|$|E
