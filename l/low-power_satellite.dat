50|$|The station's {{signal is}} relayed {{throughout}} Puerto Rico through two <b>low-power</b> <b>satellite</b> stations: W31DL-D (channel 31) in Ponce and W51DJ-D (channel 51) in Mayaguez.|$|E
50|$|This station {{started out}} in 1986 as a <b>low-power</b> <b>satellite</b> station of Chicago's WCFC (Channel 38, now WCPX). However, when WCPX was sold to Paxson Communications in 1998, Rockford's Channel 51 became more of a {{full-fledged}} station of its own. It was later on that WCFC-CA opened its own studio facility in Rockford. In January 2001, WCFC-CA applied for and was granted a Class A broadcast license. That, in essence, upgraded the broadcasting signal, more than tripling its power.|$|E
40|$|The COxSwAIN project {{focuses on}} {{building}} an image and video compression scheme {{that can be}} implemented in a small or <b>low-power</b> <b>satellite.</b> To do this, we used Compressive Sensing, where the compression is performed by matrix multiplications on the satellite and reconstructed on the ground. Our paper explains our methodology and demonstrates {{the results of the}} scheme, being able to achieve high quality image compression that is robust to noise and corruption...|$|E

40|$|The National Oceanographic Partnership Program {{provided}} critical {{support to}} the development of Seaglider long-range autonomous underwater vehicles. This support enabled: (1) development and integration of chemical and biological sensors, (2) transition to <b>low-power,</b> bi-directional <b>satellite</b> communication, and (3) software upgrades to enhance capability and reliability. Sponsored improvements led to setting the mission endurance and range records for autonomous underwater vehicles, wide use by the oceanographic community, and licensing for commercialization...|$|R
40|$|Directly {{interfacing}} {{sensors that}} link sensors to micro-controllers without a signal conditioning circuit or an analogue-to-digital converter {{on the one}} side and energy harvesting systems on the other side are two key enabling technologies to create self-powered autonomous low-cost and low-maintenance sensor networks. In this reported work, both technologies are concurrently combined {{in such a way that}} the duty cycle of the pulsed power supply provided by the harvesting system itself yields in turn a temperature gradient sensor functionality. Originally conceived to power a <b>low-power</b> <b>satellite</b> beacon in a CubeSat project, it has found application, among other applications, in automatic air conditioning and heating systems aiming smart buildings.

40|$|A {{photovoltaic}} {{power system}} and a <b>low-power,</b> two-way <b>satellite</b> earth station have been installed at Wawotobi, Sulawesi, Indonesia to provide university classroom communications for audio teleconferencing and video graphics. This project {{is a part of}} the Agency for International Development's Rural Satellite Program. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of satellite communications for development assistance applications. The purpose of the {{photovoltaic power system}} is to demonstrate the suitability of a hybrid photovoltaic/engine-generator power system for a remote satellite earth station. This paper describes the design, installation and initial operation of the photovoltaic power system and the earth station...|$|R
40|$|New {{wireless}} communication devices comprehend {{more and more}} functionality. The number of existing and supported communication and RF standards is increasing. On the other hand the integration of analog and mixed-signal RF circuitry becomes more complex, as advanced deepsubmicrometer CMOS processes usually do not offer any analog extension. On the circuit level more digital intensive approaches become possible and are implemented instead of classical pure analog or mixed-signal topologies. In this work a digital PLL [1] in a 90 nm CMOS technology for a multimode shared RF <b>low-power</b> receiver for <b>satellite</b> based navigation [2] is presented. The receiver covers the open service frequency bands E 1, E 2, L 1 and G 1 of the three satellite navigation systems GPS, Galileo and Glonass. One of the main advantages of the architecture is that all local oscillator frequencies nd system clocks are derived from a single PLL...|$|R
