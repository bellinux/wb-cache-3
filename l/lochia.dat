25|$|Puerperal sepsis is an {{ascending}} {{infection of}} the genital tract. It may happen during or after labour. Signs {{to look out for}} include signs of infection (pyrexia or hypothermia, raised heart rate and respiratory rate, reduced blood pressure), and abdominal pain, offensive <b>lochia</b> (blood loss) increased <b>lochia,</b> clots, diarrhea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Some doctors {{believe that}} during a {{caesarean}} section, mechanical cervical dilation {{with a finger}} or forceps will prevent the obstruction of blood and <b>lochia</b> drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing risk of death.

25|$|For {{women who}} have a {{hospital}} birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman's observations, general well being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she {{has not had a}} caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing doesn't need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her <b>lochia,</b> ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{data regarding}} conservation biology of Chionodoxa <b>lochiae</b> and Scilla morrisii; two threatened endemic plants of Cyprus, which are included as priority species in Annex II of the Habitats Directive. The population size and geographical {{distribution of the}} species were monitored for three years. C. <b>lochiae</b> was recorded in ten locations and S. morrisii was recorded in five locations. C. <b>lochiae</b> occurs in Pinus forests with/without Quercus alnifolia understory or in forest margins and riparian vegetation with Platanus orientalis. Favorable habitat of S. morrisii is the understory of Quercus infectoria stands and the Pistacia terebinthus-Quercus coccifera-Styrax officinalis shrubs. The distribution pattern of the species seems to follow habitat availability. Fecundity and Relative Reproductive Success of C. <b>lochiae</b> were stable and low, while in S. morrisii were constantly high. The lack of pollinators {{seems to be the}} main cause of the low sexual reproduction of C. <b>lochiae.</b> The germination strategy for both species is dependent on temperature. Some of the seeds are dormant and dormancy is broken by nitrates. The investigation of certain aspects of the biology of the two species yielded the information needed to identify the critical aspects affecting their survival and to propose sound conservation measures...|$|R
50|$|This is the {{discharge}} that appears after birth consisting of three stages. These are <b>lochia</b> rubra, <b>lochia</b> serosa and <b>lochia</b> alba.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lochia</b> serosa is {{the term}} for <b>lochia</b> that has thinned and turned {{brownish}} or pink in color. It contains serous exudate, erythrocytes, leukocytes, cervical mucus and microorganisms. This stage continues until around the tenth day after delivery. <b>Lochia</b> serosa which persists to some weeks after birth can indicate late postpartum hemorrhaging, and should be reported to a physician.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of obstetrics, <b>lochia</b> is the vaginal {{discharge}} after giving birth (puerperium) containing blood, mucus, and uterine tissue. <b>Lochia</b> discharge typically continues for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth, which {{is known as the}} postpartum period.|$|E

It {{typically}} lasts from the second through the third to sixth weeks after delivery. It contains fewer red blood cells and is mainly made up of leukocytes, epithelial cells, cholesterol, fat, mucus and microorganisms. Continuation beyond a few weeks can indicate a genital lesion, which should be reported to a physician.|$|E

There are differentiations depending on permanence and studies of the personnel. In the land army, the insignia are colored differently depending on the command in which the personnel belongs, e.g., red-orange for infantry and green-blue for armoured cavalry.|$|R
50|$|In general, <b>lochia</b> has an odor {{similar to}} that of normal menstrual fluid. Any {{offensive}} odor or change to a greenish color indicates contamination by organisms such as chlamydia or saprophytic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lochia</b> rubra (or cruenta) is {{the first}} discharge, Composed of blood, shreds of fetal membranes, decidua, vernix caseosa, lanugo and membranes. It is red in color {{because of the large}} amount of blood it contains. It {{typically}} lasts no longer than 3 to 5 days after birth.|$|E
50|$|The {{custom of}} {{confinement}} advises new mothers to choose energy and protein-rich foods to recover energy levels, help shrink the uterus {{and for the}} perineum to heal.

50|$|Descriptions of {{the island}} were {{recorded}} in classical antiquity by Greek geographers and historians. Strabo described a royal house on Antirhodos in 27 BC and wrote that the island's name ("counter-Rhodes") derived from the island's rivalry with the island of Rhodes. Antirhodos was part of Alexandria's ancient royal port called the Portus Magnus, which also included parts of the <b>Lochias</b> peninsula in the East and the island of Pharos in the West. The Portus Magnus was abandoned and left as an open bay after an earthquake in the 8th century.|$|R

5000|$|Modern Greek {{military}} ranks {{are based}} on Ancient Greek & Byzantine terminology, even though the ranks correspond {{to those of other}} Western armies. For example, ancient hoplite unit of approximately 100 men, the lochos, is today the name for a company of soldiers; its commander, as in ancient times, is a lochagos, while his lieutenants are called ypolochagoi — literally, [...] "sub-captains" [...] — a modern neologism. A sergeant is known as a <b>lochias.</b> A tagmatarchis (major) commands a tagma (battalion) and so forth. Thus, every officer or non-commissioned officer is in the land and air forces is generally named after the type of unit he commands, with the suffix -agos (from agein, [...] "to lead") or -archos / arches (from archein, [...] "to rule").|$|R

50|$|A {{sanitary}} napkin, sanitary towel, sanitary pad, menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn {{by a woman}} {{while she}} is menstruating, while she is recovering from vaginal surgery, for <b>lochia</b> (post-birth bleeding), after an abortion, {{or in any other}} situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina.|$|E
50|$|After delivery, leukorrhea {{accompanied}} by backache and foul-smelling <b>lochia</b> (post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue) may suggest {{the failure of}} involution (the uterus returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection.

40|$|Abstract. The {{researches}} were caried {{out in a}} Mureş county private farm during December 2006 and June 2007 on 40 puerperial cows (HOLSTEIN), {{divided into}} 4 batchs. For the first batch we administrated Eucaliptus compositum product (150 ml, 20 % solution, 2 instilations at 48 hours), for the second one EucaComp product (20 % solution, 150 ml, 2 instilation at 48 hours), for the third batch the Plantistim product (20 % solution, 150 ml, 2 doses at 48 hours), batch IV being kept as a control sample. The individuals of the four batchs were supervised regarding the puerperium evolution observing {{the quantity and quality}} of <b>lochias</b> secretions, uterine involution, ovarian activity recommencement as well as the first ovarian cycle apparition. For in-uterine instillations the local puerperal infections were prevented, showing the efficiency of the products used. The use of these fitotherapeutical products for the puerperium control and supervision are in advantage as it regards the costs as well as the non-invasive activity and the lack of after-effect...|$|R
60|$|Here I {{might not}} abide. So again I hired myself {{out as a}} sailor, giving my labour in return for passage, and we passed up the Nile. And I learned from the talk of men that Cleopatra {{had come back to}} Alexandria, drawing Antony with her and that they lived {{together}} with royal state in the palace on the <b>Lochias.</b> Indeed, the boatmen already had a song thereon, which they sang as they laboured at the oar. Also I heard how the galley that was sent to search for the vessel which carried the Syrian merchant had foundered with all her crew, and the tale that the Queen's astronomer, Harmachis, had flown to Heaven from the roof of the house at Tarsus. And the sailors wondered because I sat and laboured and would not sing their ribald song of the loves of Cleopatra. For they, too, began to fear me, and mutter concerning me among themselves. Then I knew that I was a man accursed and set apart--a man whom none might love.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD is twofold: (a) to {{reconstruct}} the palaeoenvironmental setting where Hellenistic Alexandria was developed, (b) to detect the presence of any prehistorical andhistorical shipwrecks and evidence of human activity. In order to accomplish the above a geophysical survey was carried out, using a sidescan sonar and a subbottom profiler system, while thepositioning was provided by a GPS and DGPS. The geophysical {{data were analyzed using}} a Matlab and an ArcGIS software. New, user-friendly methodological schemes, referred to as PalaeogAn και TargAn,were developed using image analysis techniques, in order to analyse analogue geophysical data in a digital environment. The geophysical data analysis shows the presence of a Τ-shape kurkar ridge,which stands at a minimum water depth of 11 m below the seasurface {{at the north end of}} the Eastern Harbour of Alexandria. This kurkar formation is almost identical with that of the Pharosisland-Heptastadion-Alexandria Harbours. Sea level changes and geophysical data analysis suggest that Alexandria’s coastal zone is characterized by a series of parallel submerged palaeoshorelines, atwater depths of 16, 14, 12, 10 and 8 m, which represent the coastlines of 3300 BC (kingdom of Harpoon), 2700 BC, 2000 BC, 1400 BC (ancient Rachotis), and 300 BC (Ptolemaic Alexandria) respectively. The Τ-shape structure between 3300 - 2000 BC was above msl creating a safe anchorage for ancient ships. In 1400 BC and 300 BC it was 2 m and 4 m under msl respectively, acting as a natural breakwater andprotecting the coast from wave action. During the Hellenistic times (300 BC) the Eastern Harbour entrance was much smaller (600 m) than today. At the northeastern end of Cape <b>Lochias</b> and in the innerEastern Harbour dangerous shoals and reefs were scattered. Cape <b>Lochias</b> was much larger than it is today as the most of it (92 %) is at present submerged. The insonification revealed (a) the existenceof an ancient shipwreck, two areas with ship ballast, two structures which might have been used as buoys, two structures that were propably used as moles, (b) the presence of 57 acoustic anomalies,which were analyzed using the TargAn and multivariate statistical methods, (c) new areas of archaeological importance to be surrveyed in the near future. The results of the statistical analysisclassified the acoustic anomalies into groups showing their archaeological validity. ...|$|R
