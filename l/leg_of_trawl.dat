40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries on mud-bottoms, {{there is limited}} knowledge concerning the effects <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> induced disturbance on these habitats and their resident macrofaunal communities. I investigated the cumulative impacts of seasonal commercial shrimp trawling on infaunal habitat and macrofaunal community structure on two mud-bottom fishing grounds in the Gulf of Maine from June 2000 - December 2001.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Commercial {{bottom trawl}} fishing effort during 1990 - 2000 was {{summarized}} for the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands to determine {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of fishing effort. Attributes of the benthic community based on research bottom trawl surveys were compared between areas {{of high and low}} commercial bottom trawling effort. The total number <b>of</b> bottom <b>trawl</b> tows was estimated to be 133, 326 for the Gulf of Alaska, and 47, 483 for the Aleutian Islands.

Median recovery times posttrawling (from 50 to 95 % of unimpacted biomass) ranged between 1. 9 and 6. 4 y.

The methods applied include normative and empirical research. The normative research is done through legal materials. While the empirical one is conducted by interviewing a sample of purposively selected sample. The conflict in Lhok Meureubo is due to the use <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> gear, it has been happening since 2003.

Together with numerous environmental and biological processes, physical disturbance induced by trawlers can largely shape the benthic habitats and their associated assemblages. At the SW Portuguese Margin, crustacean bottom trawlers have exploited deep-sea habitats for a few decades, but its effects on the benthic biodiversity are practically unknown. During the spring-summer of 2013 and 2014, several Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video transects were used to investigate mega-epibenthic abundance, composition, and diversity in soft-sediment areas subjected to varying trawling pressures off Sines and Setúbal (200 – 800 m). Differences in mega-epibenthic assemblages were linked with environmental changes (depth, grain size, primary productivity) and trawling disturbance. The effect <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> was assessed between segments with similar habitat characteristics, i. e., muddy-sand bottoms between 300 and 500 m. Areas subjected to intensive trawling pressure showed a generally flattened seabed, with abundant recent trawl marks (up to 3 scars. 100 m− 1), indicating that the seabed physical integrity was compromised. Significant negative correlations were detected between various mega-epibenthic diversity indices [S, H′, and ET(20) ] and trawling pressure (h. cell− 1. y− 1). Furthermore, the distinct mega-epibenthic assemblages and absence of several sessile erect morphospecies at both low and highly disturbed locations by trawling off Sines, namely all seapen morphospecies found in non-trawled areas, demonstrates the negative influence <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> fisheries on the benthic component of the study area. Also, low dissimilarity between assemblages from the main fishing grounds and the adjacent low-disturbance locations, suggests that the potentially negative influence <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> can extend beyond the targeted areas (e. g., by the plumes of re-suspended sediments). The observed deleterious effects <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> on mega-epibenthic fauna together with the intensification <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> pressure in the study area, stress the need for adequate monitoring programs and regulatory measures to halt the long-term loss of biodiversity and allow the sustainability of fisheries at the SW Portuguese Margin...|$|R

The effects <b>of</b> chronic <b>trawling</b> disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> disturbance.

Most of the studies were focused on highly developed industrial fisheries, overlooking bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries. However, bycatch in small-scale fisheries might have negative effects similar to those of industrial fisheries when they overlap with hotspot areas of top predators. Moreover, different types of fishing gear coexist in the same oceanographic area, particularly in highly exploited marine ecosystems such as the western Mediterranean. We quantify for the first time the influence <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> regime on Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea bycatch in the western Mediterranean longline artisanal fishery. The availability <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> discards has substantial influence on the foraging and breeding ecology of many seabirds, and trawling inactivity may drive shearwaters to seek alternative food resources, such as baits used in longline fishing. Based on our previous knowledge of the system, we also tested other variables affecting bycatch over 8 yr (1998 to 2005). Within this 2 -fishery framework, we found that trawling regime, longline fishing time and breeding stage were key factors explaining shearwater attendance to longline vessels, but mainly trawling regime and fishing time increased the incidental capture of Cory’s shearwaters. More specifically, during the pre-breeding and chick-rearing periods, bycatch dramatically increased during sunrise sets in the absence <b>of</b> <b>trawling</b> activity.
