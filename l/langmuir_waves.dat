40|$|It {{is shown}} that partial incoherence, {{in the form}} of {{stochastic}} phase noise, of a <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> in an unmagnetized plasma gives rise to a Landau-type damping. Starting from the Zakharov equations, which describe the nonlinear interaction between <b>Langmuir</b> and ion-acoustic <b>waves,</b> a kinetic equation is derived for the plasmons by introducing the Wigner-Moyal transform of the complex <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> field. This equation is then used to analyze the stability properties of small perturbations on a stationary solution consisting of a constant amplitude wave with stochastic phase noise. The concomitant dispersion relation exhibits the phenomenon of Landau-like damping. However, this damping differs from the classical Landau damping in which a <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave,</b> interacting with the plasma electrons, loses energy. In the present process, the damping is non-dissipative and is caused by the resonant interaction 1 between an instantaneously-produced disturbance, due to the parametric interactions, and a partially incoherent <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave,</b> which can be considered as a quasi-particle composed of an ensemble of partially incoherent plasmons.

50|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the (one-dimensional) nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a nonlinear {{variation of}} the Schrödinger equation. It is a classical field equation whose principal applications are to the propagation of light in nonlinear optical fibers and planar waveguides and to Bose-Einstein condensates confined to highly anisotropic cigar-shaped traps, in the mean-field regime. Additionally, the equation appears in the studies of small-amplitude gravity waves onthe surface of deep inviscid (zero-viscosity) water; the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>waves</b> in hot plasmas; the propagation of plane-diffracted wave beams in the focusing regions of the ionosphere; the propagation of Davydov's alpha-helix solitons, which are responsiblefor energy transport along molecular chains; and many others. More generally, the NLSE appears as one of universal equations that describe the evolution of slowly varying packetsof quasi-monochromatic waves in weakly nonlinear media that have dispersion. Unlike the linear Schrödinger equation, the NLSE never describes the time evolution of a quantum state (except hypothetically, as in some early attempts, in the 1970s, to explain the quantum measurement process).

In electron-positron plasmas, similarly to the electron-ion plasmas, we find one spin-electron acoustic wave (SEAW) at propagation parallel or perpendicular to the external field and two spin-electron acoustic waves at the oblique propagation. At the parallel or perpendicular propagation of the longitudinal waves in electron-positron-ion plasmas we find four branches: the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave,</b> the positron-acoustic wave and pair of waves having spin nature, they are the SEAW and, as we called it, spin-electron-positron acoustic wave (SEPAW).

40|$|The BCS-type second-order phase {{transition}} of a classical <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> system is identified theoretically and numerically. The transition takes place between two states: <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence (LWT) and <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> supercontinuum (LWSC), {{the latter of}} which exhibits broad power spectra with significant spatiotemporal coherence when {{a certain number of}} plasmons (plasma wave quanta) are excited in the system. In the LWT-LWSC transition, the modulational instability and resulting creation of plasmon pairs are the classical counterparts of the Cooper instability and creation of Cooper pairs in superconducting states. The Bose-Einstein condensation of Cooper pairs in superconducting states is replaced by the Kuramoto oscillator-entrainment of plasmon pairs in a LWSC. The order parameter of the LWSC state, which is defined as the mean field of the plasmon pairs, takes on a significant value, which clearly indicates that a macroscopic number of plasmon pairs occupy a single momentum state with an identical phase in the LWSC. The emergence of spatiotemporal coherence and the decrease in the phase randomization are considered as development of long-range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking, respectively, indicating that the LWT-LWSC transition is a second order {{phase transition}} phenomenon. By this transition, U(1) symmetry of LWT is broken. The LWSC is, in terms of plasma physics, a so-called Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode characterized by its undamped nature.

The quantum Bohm potential is included either. The exchange interaction and quantum Bohm potential gives opposite contributions, but they do not compensate each other since they have different dependence on the wave vector. This competition creates a non-monotonical behavior of the Trivelpiece-Gould wave spectrum. The concavity changes in the monotonic spectra of the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>wave</b> and the SEAWs are found.
