5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a <b>linear</b> <b>track.</b> A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a <b>linear</b> <b>track,</b> and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E

40|$|The {{saturation}} of the actuator impairs {{the response}} {{performance of the}} near space interceptor control system. A control system based on the properties of <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> system is designed for this problem. The properties are that the maximum value of the pseudo-Lyapunov function of the <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> control system do not present at the initial state but at the steady state, based on which the bounded stability problem is converted into <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> problem. The pseudo-Lyapunov function of the <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> system contain the input variables; the amplitude and frequency of the input variables affect {{the stability of the}} nonlinear control system. Designate expected closed-loop poles area for different input commands and obtain a controller which is function of input variables. The coupling between variables and linear matrices make the control system design problem non-convex. The non-convex problem is converted into a convex LMI according to the Shur complement lemma and iterative algorithm. Finally the simulation shows that the designed optimal control system is quick and accurate; the rationality of the presented design techniques is validated...|$|R

The derivation of the performance index for optimal <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> systems is necessary to give a complete solution to the optimal <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> problem. A knowledge of the various cost terms in the performance index of suboptimal <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> systems means that the performance of existing or approximate designs, or of optimal designs either modified or having different noise inputs or performance indices, may be calculated.

40|$|Abstract—Code <b>{{tracking}}</b> <b>linear</b> {{range and}} the code phase tracking jitter {{have always been}} opposing ends of the design criteria of a code lock loop in direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication systems. New modulation techniques used in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) offer better code tracking jitter and multipath performance by sharpening the correlation triangle. However the <b>linear</b> <b>tracking</b> range is reduced which directly results in poor dynamics and low signal strength performance of the tracking loop. The problem is most severe in the sophisticated Alternate Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC) modulation. This paper proposes a method to extend a loop’s tracking range without affecting the jitter performance in the existing linear range of the code tracking loop.

50|$|In the {{original}} VHS specification, audio was recorded as baseband {{in a single}} <b>linear</b> <b>track,</b> at the upper edge of the tape, similar to how an audio compact cassette operates. The recorded frequency range was dependent on the linear tape speed.
