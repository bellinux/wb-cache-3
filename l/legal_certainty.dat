These 42 general rules, a mixture of common law and statutes, have formed the basis of Scandinavian legal traditions, particularly in Sweden and Finland. Although some aspects seem outdated (particularly overt religious references), Olaus' twin values of <b>legal</b> <b>certainty,</b> and equity and justice, remain important to Nordic legal scholarship and practice. Part of the problem in assessing his life, however, is that accounts of the trial which ended his legal career were also published long after his death, by Vasa's chronicler Erik Jöransson Tegel.|$|E

For example, Congress created the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as an exclusive federal court of appeals for patent cases. Congress noted that consolidating cases in a single court of appeals would [...] "strengthen the United States patent system {{in such a way}} as to foster technological growth and industrial innovation." [...] Because of its role as a specialist court, circuit splits rarely exist between the Federal Circuit and other circuit courts of appeal. In his opinion in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., Justice David Souter observed that avoiding conflicting rulings among circuit courts in patent law cases benefits the economy by providing <b>legal</b> <b>certainty</b> to businesses.|$|E

From a more narrowed and executive perspective, these regulatory bodies encompass an adaptation of the administrative oversight and other forms of intervention in the liberalized industries.

500|$|The Act {{completely}} {{abolished the}} [...] "Case Stated" [...] procedure {{and other forms}} of judicial interference, replacing it with a limited system of appeal to the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales; it also allowed for exclusion agreements limiting the rights of parties to arbitration to appeal to the courts, and gave arbitrators the ability to enforce interlocutory orders. Academics met the Act with a mixed response; while some praised it for bringing English law more into line with that of other nations, others criticised the wording used as unnecessarily complex and hazy. The Act did, in the eyes of some commentators, lead to a shift in judicial policy away from <b>legal</b> <b>certainty</b> and towards a system focused on speed and finality. Having been repealed in its entirety by Section 107(2) of the Arbitration Act 1996, the Act is no longer in force.|$|E
500|$|David Shenton and Gordon Toland {{concluded}} that the Act brought judicial oversight in English law into compliance with that of other nations, {{saying that it is}} [...] "broadly comparable to the provisions...to be found in Swedish, Swiss and French law". Smedresman, however, argued that it would do little to help attract new arbitration and would in fact drive it away, saying that [...] "the vagueness of the statutory language, combined with the rather hazy policy considerations behind the Act, make confusion and litigation likely". David Hacking, who helped promote the Act, says that it [...] "was not drafted with the elegance of the 1996 Arbitration Act. In the style of the Parliamentary Draftsmen of that time, many of its provisions were drafted with a complexity which was happily avoided in the 1996 Act", and criticises the failure to achieve more than minor reform of existing law. However, he does note that the Act led to a shift in judicial policy, with future judgments to be issued with regards [...] "to the need for finality...the striving for legal accuracy may be said to have been overtaken by commercial expediency". Jaffe agrees, writing in the journal Arbitration that [...] "t is clear that {{with the passage of the}} 1979 Act...there has been a distinct and noticeable shift of emphasis from <b>legal</b> <b>certainty</b> to finality for arbitral awards". The Act is no longer in force, having been repealed in its entirety by Section 107(2) of the Arbitration Act 1996.|$|E
500|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>certainty</b> and {{the orderly}} {{development}} of legal principles are {{promoted by the}} application of the doctrine of stare decisis, also known as the doctrine of binding precedent. According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level. Thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts generally do so as a matter of comity, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as [...] "normally binding" [...] and only departs from them [...] "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore". Only the ratio decidendi (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (obiter dicta) are only persuasive.|$|E

2500|$|At the Court of Final Appeal, the {{constitutionality}} of the entire statutory notification scheme was challenged. Chief Justice Li, Justice Chan PJ, Justice Ribeiro PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, having considered all the statutory restrictions on the freedom of assembly and the statutory safeguards listed above, held that the notification system was constitutional. However, they held that the norm of [...] "ordre public", which existed as a statutory legitimate purpose at that time, was too vague at a statutory level and hence could not be said to be prescribed by law. [...] "Ordre public" [...] was as a result severed, but the term [...] "public order" [...] was sufficiently precise to survive. They also remarked in dicta that the norm of [...] "protection of the rights and freedoms of others" [...] was too wide and did not satisfy the <b>legal</b> <b>certainty</b> requirement. They affirmed the convictions as the severance did not affect the conviction. Justice Bokhary PJ dissented, noting in his judgment that the whole statutory scheme should be struck down except the entitlement to notification.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond human rights, the Court of Justice has {{recognised}} {{at least}} five further 'general principles' of EU law. First, <b>legal</b> <b>certainty</b> requires that judgments should be prospective, open and clear. Second, when reviewing any discretionary act of a government or powerful body, decision-making must be [...] "proportionate" [...] toward a legitimate aim. For example, if a government wishes to change an employment law in a neutral way, yet this could have disproportionate negative impact on women rather than men, the government must show a legitimate aim, and that its measures are (1) appropriate or suitable for achieving it, (2) {{do no more than}} necessary, and (3) reasonable in balancing the conflicting rights of different parties. Third, equality is regarded as a fundamental principle: this matters particularly for labour rights, political rights, and access to public or private services. Fourth, the right to a fair hearing was declared a general principle, though admittedly this is amply reflected in most human rights instruments. Fifth, there is a general principle of professional privilege between lawyers and clients. The categories of general principle are not closed, and may develop according to the social expectations of people living in Europe.|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} {{and management of}} protected areas must be adapted {{to the effects of}} climate change. An important question is if the law on protected areas is capable of dealing with the required changes. In general, both international nature conventions and European Union nature conservation law do not contain any specific provisions on climate change and protected areas. Attention has been paid to this link in non-binding decisions and policy documents. In order to adapt the law to increased dynamics from climate change, more flexibility is needed. This flexibility should not be understood as "legal" flexibility, {{in the sense of the}} weakening nature conservation provisions. Scientific uncertainties on the effects of climate change might conflict with the need for <b>legal</b> <b>certainties.</b> In order to adapt to the effects of climate change, the two crucial elements are the strengthening of core protected areas and connectivity between the core areas. At the international level, both elements can be found in non-binding documents. International law enables the required adaptation; however, it often lacks concrete obligations. A stronger legal framework can be found at the level of the European Union. The Birds and Habitats Directives contain sufficient tools to deal with the effects of climate change. The Directives have been insufficiently implemented so far. Especially the central goals of reaching a favorable conservation status and connectivity measures need to be addressed much more in the future...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 54-56). The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and N2O. Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their additionality assessments. They compared establishing additionality to the balance of evidence in a <b>legal</b> system. <b>Certainty</b> in additionality is rare, and the higher the proof of additionality, the greater the risk of rejecting good projects to reduce emissions.|$|R

40|$|The Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment {{adopted in}} 2001 in Cape Town (CTC) is an ambitious project aiming to {{increase}} the <b>legal</b> <b>certainties</b> in asset-based financing and leasing and attract more private capital for the acquisition and use of high-value mobile equipment. The regulatory system of the CTC ensures universal recognition and enforcement of international interest vested to the chargee, the conditional seller, and the lessor in the respective category of contract, and it {{has proved to be}} successful as applied to the aviation industry. It took more than a decade to draft the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Space Assets (SAP). Adopted in March 2012, the instrument has aroused many controversies in the space industry. Most of the concerns focus on whether the SAP will promote or hinder space financing. However, the contributions and limitations of the SAP are never fully examined and clarified. So this study conducts an in-depth analysis on the regulatory system of the SAP, taking account of the proposals raised in the treaty-making process and the examples drawn from practice. Since there are few precedents on enforcing security interest in satellite and States refuse to make commitment to facilitate constructive repossession and control of space assets, the SAP subjects the realisation of asset-based remedies to national law so that the financiers have to assess the regulatory risks like what they used to do. The contribution of the SAP lies in the registration system that encompasses international interest in space assets and assignment of debtor’s rights related to the international interest. Financing space ventures has to address various risks; a security package that can be perfected and enforced at low cost will mitigate the default risk and enhance the creditor’s confidence in recouping its investment. Therefore, contrary to the position of many SAP supporters, this study finds that the SAP does not invent a new financing option, and it will not change the scenario in the acquisition of space assets. Financings backed by the Export Credit Agencies will remain an appealing option for the start-up companies and the developing countries. In view of the dilemma faced by the SAP, this study also looks into the consensus-building process of the SAP to find out which factors prolonged the negotiation process and undermined the integrity of the SAP. While empirical study and economic impact assessment could have played a more constructive role in the treaty-making process, they are still essential at this stage for the purpose of promoting acceptance of the SAP. published_or_final_versionLawMasterDoctor of Legal Studie...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} legal language, its basic elements and relations, {{in which they are}} entering. The introductory chapter defines the legal language in general as a discipline at the interface between linguistics and theory of law. In addition to the basic legal elements and their relations to the general official language, there are described the basic elements of the legal language out of whose structure some basic elements required on the legal language come out. The relation between and legal language is symbolised through Euler circles. The conclusion of this chapter describes the legal language in terms of functional style and presents its stylistic traits. The first two parts of the second chapter are focused on the meaning of the lexical element, that are evaluated according to the amount of autonomy as a autosemantic and synemenatic units, or according to the motivating factor of the word and according to the fact if they are composed of one or more lexical elements.

There seems to be a larger number of these refractory knots piled up in the subject of Damages than in other courses, and this is an attempt to reduce their number.
