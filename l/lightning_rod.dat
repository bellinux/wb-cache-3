5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E
5|$|The fourth edition, {{published}} in 1769, {{is the first}} complete edition in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that {{increased the number of}} pages from 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> invention, meteorological observations, human nature, worldwide population increase, waterspouts, experiments on amber, and information on his Pennsylvania fireplace invention. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was {{published in}} 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. The only new document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the Public Advertiser London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
50|$|Lightning {{protection}} {{is provided by}} bonding the multipoint ground grid {{to one or more}} grounding rods under or at the perimeter of the building, and then up to the <b>lightning</b> <b>rods.</b> If the building has significant metal framing elements, these should be bonded to the <b>lightning</b> <b>rods</b> and grounding rods as well.|$|R

5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the <b>lightning</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} main building {{is a combination of}} Southern German and local Arabic. The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter. A <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83kg) aluminum apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest single piece of aluminum cast at the time, when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce {{and the price of}} aluminum plummeted, making the once-valuable apex more ordinary, though it still provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex that served as the original <b>lightning</b> <b>rod.</b> The monument opened to the public on October 9, 1888.|$|E

5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E
5|$|George Herman Ruth Jr. {{was born}} in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in the Pigtown section of Baltimore, Maryland. Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. (1871–1918) and Katherine Schamberger, were both of German American ancestry. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His {{paternal}} grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> salesman and streetcar operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. George Ruth Jr. {{was born in}} the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist. Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E

5|$|William Watson, a {{scientist}} {{specializing in the}} study of electricity, theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed. Watson received in 1746 from Dr. John Mitchell a lengthy Franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity. He read part of the letter to fellow members of the Royal Society of London on November 9, 1749. A week later he finished the reading. On December 4 Watson received another similar Franklin letter dated April 29, 1749, from Collinson and read it to the Society on December 21, 1749. Over the next two years Collinson had transmitted to the Society more of Franklin's letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by Franklin and his team of experimenters. Many talked about the tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was grounded - the basics to his <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches.|$|E
25|$|The optimal {{shape for}} {{the tip of}} a <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> has been {{controversial}} since the 18th century.

25|$|In a {{lightning}} protection system, a <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> {{is a single}} component of the system. The <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods {{is that they are}} all made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in lightning protection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightning</b> <b>rods</b> use corona {{discharge}} to create conductive paths {{in the air}} that point towards the <b>rod,</b> deflecting potentially-damaging <b>lightning</b> away from buildings and other structures.|$|R
