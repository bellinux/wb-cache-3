5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology <b>lagged</b> <b>behind.</b> The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E

Also, males and females have comparable levels of education among Christians, but females <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> among Muslims.

5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} main boom and gaff breaking away, crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. The Unity crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet <b>lagged</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy's accomplishments {{paid off}} {{in the form of}} better funding, and it {{embarked}} on the construction of many new ships. However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they <b>lagged</b> <b>behind</b> the French and British in adopting the new technologies.|$|E
5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they <b>lagged</b> <b>behind</b> other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E

In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray.

After a media exposé and criticism from health sector professionals, two more {{hospitals were}} built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively. Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it was up to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better standard of living. Spending on social welfare <b>lagged</b> <b>behind</b> that in other states, and legislative reforms on this front were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon <b>lagged</b> <b>behind</b> Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
