40|$|A {{series of}} {{detailed}} Vialit Adhesion tests were performed at various temperatures {{on a number}} of binders to assess the suitability of the test for evaluating the low temperature performance of the binders. It is shown that the current limits specified in the Asphalt Academy Technical Guideline document (TG 1, 2001), are generally not achievable using the specified test. As the adhesion failure generally occurs between the test plate and the binder film, the surface of the plate was modified to improve aggregate retention. The tests show that aggregate retention is also improved if the chippings are precoated, whilst there is also a definite difference in adhesion between conventional and modified binders. Recommendations are made for possible future research that could be performed to verify the findings of this study. 1.

The Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) recently extended a regular research route to Dome Fuji. From the climatological point of view, this area has one of the sparsest meteorological data networks in Antarctica.

40|$|The European Commission Regulations No 692 / 2008 and No 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework for type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6).

40|$|The {{environmental}} temperature in many NASA missions, such as deep space probes and outer planetary exploration, is significantly below the range for which conventional commercial-off-the-shelf electronics is designed. Presently, spacecraft {{operating in the}} cold environment of such deep space missions carry {{a large number of}} radioisotope or other heating units {{in order to maintain the}} surrounding temperature of the on-board electronics at approximately 20 C. Electronic devices and circuits capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures will not only tolerate the harsh environment of deep space but also will reduce system size and weight by eliminating or reducing the heating units and their associate structures; thereby reducing system development cost as well as launch costs. In addition, power electronic circuits designed for operation at low temperatures are expected to result in more efficient systems than those at room temperature. This improvement results from better behavior in the electrical and thermal properties of some semiconductor and dielectric materials at low temperatures. An on-going research and development program on low temperature electronics at the NASA Glenn Research Center focuses on the development of efficient electrical systems and circuits capable of surviving and exploiting the advantages of low temperature environments.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A steady state, {{axial flow}} thermal {{conductivity}} test apparatus {{was designed and}} constructed to operate between room temperature and approximately 4 Kelvin, and to be compatible with existing electronic instrumentation and a continuous flow cryostat. The test design included a radiation shield that had its temperature profile matched {{to that of the}} sample to minimize radiation heat transfer losses. The cryostat was used to provide the controllable, <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>test</b> environment in which the test apparatus would operate. A special wiring bundle was constructed to ensure proper connection of the test device to the required electronic instrumentation, which was controlled from a computer by custom written software.

The test was performed a second time to check repeatability of the measurements over a range of temperature. Next, the thermal conductivity of a high purity niobium sample was measured and compared to literature recommended values. This test was also performed twice. When completed, these tests had demonstrated the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement of thermal conductivity by the test apparatus over the range of temperatures specified and over a range of conductivities.

40|$|Chromatography and {{extraction}} techniques, {{and also}} chemiluminescence have been utilized {{to develop new}} rapid and informative tools {{in the evaluation of}} long-term properties and environmental effects of polymeric materials. Methods were developed for classification of materials and for early and rapid degradation detection. Degradable polyethylene films were classified {{on the basis of their}} incorporated prooxidant systems using chromatographic fingerprinting of carboxylic acids, the dominating type of degradation product. The fingerprints were also shown to be useful for prediction of the degradation states and evaluation of the degradation mechanisms. Classification and prediction models were obtained by Multivariate Data Analysis, where the diacids were grouped according to both their type of prooxidant system and their state of degradation. The use of total luminescence intensity (TLI) measurements was also investigated as a means of classifying films and for the early detection of degradation. Comparisons were carried out with common techniques, e. g. FTIR and DSC, after both thermal and UV oxidation. TLI gave an earlier detection of degradation and was more sensitive than carbonyl index and crystallinity measurements to relative differences in degradation between the materials. It furthermore offered complementary information regarding changes in activation energies during the course of the degradation. The results were compared with the chromatographic fingerprints. A new way to evaluate the low temperature long-term stabilisation efficiency of antioxidants was investigated. A prooxidant was used to obtain catalytic oxidation, instead of using thermal acceleration, to evaluate the stabilisation efficiency of antioxidants at low temperatures but still during reasonably short aging times. Comparisons were made between polypropylene films stabilised with primary antioxidants (Irganox 1076, Irganox 1010 and α-tocopherol) with and without the prooxidant manganese stearate at different temperatures. The relative efficiencies of the antioxidants obtained under prooxidant acceleration test correlated better than thermal acceleration test with the results of a long-term <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>test.</b> Additives in plastic packaging materials may affect the environment after migration from the packaging to e. g. their contents, especially if they consist of organic aqueous solutions or oils.

Methods were developed and evaluated for extraction both with direct sampling and with headspace sampling. If the extraction method and temperature were selected to suit the concentration levels of the analytes, it was possible to quantify several degradation products simultaneously.

Forcing the electrons passage through an external circuit {{and thanks to the}} protons transport between both compartments, it is ensured the maintenance of the charge balance inside and the electric circuit is closed. The main purpose of this study has been to evaluate the performance, in terms of the power (P; mW/L, mW/ m 2) and the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV;V), of a laboratory scale MFC to vary the microorganisms type which have the task of extracting the electrons from the substrate and carry them to the anode. In addition, the effects of the use of a redox mediator have been evaluated, which would allow a reduction on the anode overpotential.  It was finally carried out the cell scale-up with the goal of identifying the parameters that mostly influence the performance of the system. The microorganisms used as biocatalysts in this study have been divided in three groups: - Brewer’s yeast, Saccharomyce cerevisiae - Acetogenic bacteria pretreated at pH 3 - Microorganisms present in seawater With the brewer’s yeast, the effect of varying its concentration on the MFC performance has been studied, noting that, with the growth of this parameter, the power density of the cell increases. In these tests it was used the methylene blue as an electronic carrier and has been verified that when the carrier/microorganism ratio is lower, the performance is better.  Regard to the microorganisms in seawater, some tests have been carried out to determine the influence on the MFC performance of several factors, such as; the storage of the samples at <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> (<b>test</b> A 2 and A 4), the change of the inoculum concentration on the anode chamber (test A 3), the use of inoculums enriched through successive growths (Test A 7 and A 8), the absence of electronic carrier on the electron transport to the anode and, as a consequence, on the power density obtained (Test A 5, A 6, A 7 and A 8).

40|$|The primary {{requirements}} {{for a modern}} industrial gas turbine consist of a continuous trend of an increasing efficiency combined with very low emissions in a robust, cost-effective manner. To fulfil these tasks a high turbine inlet temperature together with advanced dry low NOX combustion chambers are employed. These dry low NOX combustion chambers generate a rather flat temperature profile compared to previous generation gas turbines, which have a rather parabolic temperature profile before the nozzle guide vane. This means that the nozzle guide vane endwall heat load for modern gas turbines is much higher compared to previous generation gas turbines. Therefore the prediction of the nozzle guide vane flow field and endwall heat transfer is crucial for the engineering task of the design layout of the vane endwall cooling system. The present study is directed towards establishing new in-depth aerodynamic and endwall heat transfer knowledge for an advanced nozzle guide vane of a modern industrial gas turbine. To reach this objective the physical processes and effects which cause the different flow fields and the endwall heat transfer pattern in a baseline configuration, a combustion chamber variant, a heat shield variant without and with additional cooling air and a cavity variant without and with additional cooling air have been investigated. The variants, which differ from the simplified baseline configuration, apply design elements which are commonly used in real modern gas turbines. This research area is crucial for the nozzle guide vane endwall heat transfer, especially for the advanced design of the nozzle guide vane of a modern industrial gas turbine and has so far hardly been investigated in the open literature. For the experimental aerodynamic and endwall heat transfer research of the baseline configuration of the advanced nozzle guide vane geometry a new low pressure, <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>test</b> facility has been developed, designed and constructed, since no experimental heat transfer data exist in the open literature {{for this type of}} vane configuration. The new test rig consists of a linear cascade with the baseline configuration of the advanced nozzle guide vane geometry with four upscaled airfoils and three flow passages. For the aerodynamic tests the two middle airfoils and the hub and the tip endwall are instrumented with pressure taps to monitor the Mach number distribution. For the heat transfer tests the temperature distribution on the hub endwall is measured via thermography. The analysis of these measurements, including comparisons to research in the open literature shows that the new test rig generates accurate and reproducible results which give confidence that it is a reliable tool for the experimental aerodynamic and heat transfer research on the advanced nozzle guide vane of a modern industrial gas turbine. Previous own research work together with the numerical analysis performed {{in another part of the}} project as well as conclusions from a detailed literature study lead to the conclusion that advanced Navier-Stokes CFD tools with the v 2 -f turbulence model are most suitable for the calculation of the flow field and the endwall heat transfer of turbine vanes and blades. Therefore this numerical tool, validated against different vane and blade geometries and for different flow conditions, has been chosen for the numerical aerodynamic and endwall heat transfer research of the advanced nozzle guide vane of a modern industrial gas turbine. The evaluation of the numerical and experimental investigations of the baseline configuration of the advanced design of a nozzle guide vane shows the flow field of an advanced mid-loaded airfoil design with the features to reduce total airfoil losses. For the hub endwall of the baseline configuration of the advanced design of a nozzle guide vane the flow characteristics and heat transfer features of the classical vane endwall secondary flow model can be detected with a very weak intensity and geometric extension compared to the studies of less advanced vane geometries in the open literature. A detailed analysis of the numerical simulations and the experimental data showed very good qualitative and quantitative agreement for the three-dimensional flow field and the endwall heat transfer. These findings, together with the evaluations obtained from the open literature, lead to the conclusions that selected CFD software Fluent together with the applied v 2 -f turbulence model exhibits a high level of general applicability and is not tuned to a special vane or blade geometry. Therefore the CFD code Fluent with the v 2 -f turbulence model has been selected for the research of the influence of the several geometric variants of the baseline configuration on the flow field and the hub endwall heat transfer of the advanced nozzle guide vane of a modern industrial gas turbine. Most of the vane endwall heat transfer research in the open literature has been carried out only for baseline configurations of the flow path between combustion chamber and nozzle guide vane. Such a simplified geometry consists of a long, planar undisturbed approach length upstream of the nozzle guide vane. The design of real modern industrial gas turbines however requires often significant variations from this baseline configuration consisting of air-cooled heat shields and purged cavities between the combustion chamber and the nozzle guide vane. A detailed evaluation of the flow field and the endwall heat transfer shows major differences between the baseline and the heat shield configuration. The heat shield in front of the airfoil of the nozzle guide vane influences the secondary flow field and the endwall heat transfer pattern strongly. Additional cooling air, released under the heat shield has a distinctive influence as well. Also the cavity between the combustion chamber and the nozzle guide vane affects the secondary flow field and the endwall heat transfer pattern. Here the influence of additional cavity cooling air is more decisive. The results of the detailed studies of the geometric variants are applied to formulate guidelines for an optimized design of the flow path between the combustion chamber and the nozzle guide vane and the nozzle guide vane endwall cooling configuration of next-generation industrial gas turbines.

40|$|Abstract The {{thermophilic}} and halotolerant {{nature of}} Rubrobacter xylanophilus {{led us to}} investigate the accumulation of compatible solutes in this member of the deepest lineage of the Phylum Actinobacteria. Trehalose and mannosylglycerate (MG) were the major compounds accumulated under all conditions examined, including those for optimal growth. The addition of NaCl to a complex medium and a defined medium had a slight or negligible effect on the accumulation of these compatible solutes. Glycine betaine, di-myo-inositol-phosphate (DIP), a new phosphodiester compound, identified as di-N-acetyl-glucosamine phosphate and glutamate were also detected but in low or trace levels. DIP was always present, except at the highest salinity examined (5 % NaCl) and at the <b>lowest</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>tested</b> (43 °C). Nevertheless, the levels of DIP increased with the growth temperature.
