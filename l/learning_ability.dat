5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve <b>learning</b> <b>ability</b> in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and <b>learning</b> <b>ability</b> have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the importance and}} value of caffeinated products on <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> of general psychology students at Boise State University. Individuals (N = 70) received a survey questioning their personal opinions on if caffeinated products can improve the students’ <b>learning</b> <b>abilities,</b> increasing the GPA and the mentality. The students {{ranged in age from}} 17 through 42 (M = 20. 17, SD = 4. 74), both males and females. The products which students use are general coffee drinks, soda drinks, energy drinks and energy shots. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between genders’ ability for improving their <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> using caffeine products according a t test. However, percentages of students believe according to the results that caffeine helps to improve their <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> and have better GPA (total 30. 0 %). Also, a significant difference between males’ (M = 0. 42, SD = 0. 78) and females’ (M = 0. 88, SD = 0. 89) perceptions regarding caffeinated products which extent their studying hours exist, t (64) = 0. 04, p ≤ 0. 05. This suggests that males use caffeine to extent their studying hours differently than females. In this study, the more caffeine use from students before studying, the higher the value, satisfaction, and intimacy to extend the studying time. This research supports that caffeine products extend the studying time. According to the data, both of the predicted hypotheses did not state in this study, however the most important parts of the study is the percentages using the frequency scale for some items that caffeine products help students to improve <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> and mentality before a quiz, a test or an exam.

25|$|Late {{learners}} of L2 perform worse on grammaticality judgment tasks or tests than native speakers {{or early}} acquirers, in that L2 learners {{are more likely}} to accept a sentence that is ungrammatical as grammatical. After the critical period, age of acquisition is no longer supposed to have an effect, and native-like performance is no longer supposed to be achievable. However, {{the idea that there is}} a critical period for the acquisition of syntactic competence, which is reflected by the ability to assess the well-formedness of a sentence, is controversial. On one view, biological or language-specific mechanisms become non-functional after a certain age. On another view, decreased L2 <b>learning</b> <b>ability</b> with age is not inevitable, and can be explained by factors such as motivation, learning environment, pressure, and time commitment. Although there is evidence that supports the claim that speakers outside the L2 mastery age range are not capable of acquiring native-like mastery of a language, there is also evidence supporting the opposite, as well as evidence for young learners not mastering an L2.|$|E

Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, <b>learning</b> <b>ability,</b> concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic <b>learning</b> <b>ability</b> (described below).|$|E

However, {{in relation to the}} academic achievement the association between motor and cognitive performance still not well established. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the levels of motor and cognitive <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> and their independent and combined associations among German primary school-children. Methods: Participants were (n =  197) between the ages of six to eight. The German motor test (DMT), the cognitive abilities test (KFT), height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were measured. Results: ANOVA testing found that boys perform better in long jumping and in the six minutes running test while girls perform better in balancing backwards and in deductive thinking test (p <  0. 05). With maturation from ages six to eight the achievement level of both populations showed a higher performance in motor and cognitive <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> (p <  0. 001). Concerning the combined and independent associations between the tested abilities, a significant correlation was shown between total motor and total cognitive <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> (p <  0. 001, r =  0. 60) with higher contribution of balancing backwards, six minutes running and push-up levels (r =  0. 63, r =  0. 62, r =  0. 60, respectively) in the performance of the cognitive <b>learning</b> <b>abilities</b> (i. e. mathematical thinking, r =  0. 62 and language understanding, r =  0. 59).
