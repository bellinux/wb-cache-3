50|$|<b>Lintuzumab</b> {{had been}} in mid-stage {{clinical}} trial when the manufacturer pulled the drug in September 2010 after evidence showed {{that it did not}} lead to higher survival rates. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had granted <b>lintuzumab</b> orphan drug status for treatment of AML and myelodysplastic syndromes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lintuzumab</b> (SGN-33) is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody {{used in the}} treatment of cancer. The drug had been developed by Seattle Genetics as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a condition which results in the deaths of 9,000 people a year in the United States. <b>Lintuzumab</b> targets the CD33 protein, which is expressed in AML and other myeloproliferative diseases, but does not appear in abundance on normal cells.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010, Seattle Genetics was {{conducting}} Phase II trials of <b>lintuzumab</b> {{in conjunction with}} bortezomib (marketed as Velcade) {{as a treatment for}} those with myelodysplastic syndromes.|$|E
50|$|Seattle Genetics had {{licensed}} <b>lintuzumab</b> from PDL BioPharma, {{which had}} been unsuccessful in treating AML in clinical trials of its own in which they used lower doses. <b>Lintuzumab</b> {{would have been the}} first medication on the market for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, a condition that strikes 12,000 Americans each year, in which the body produces excessive numbers of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is {{the most common form of}} acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. More than half of those afflicted with AML are elderly and are unable to withstand the traditional chemotherapy approach.|$|E
50|$|The Phase IIb randomized, {{double-blind}} {{clinical trial}} studied 211 individuals ages 60 and over {{who had been}} enrolled by February 2009 and who were poor candidates for high-dose chemotherapy or had made the choice to reject the traditional chemotherapy treatment. The study participants typically had a projected four to five months to live, with half treated with <b>lintuzumab</b> and a low dose of the chemotheraputic agent cytarabine, while the other half were given cytarabine in combination with a placebo. No patients were harmed in the trial and patients in both groups lived longer than expected, with those being given <b>lintuzumab</b> having a lower death rate. However, {{the study found that}} there was no benefit to patients on a statistical basis, and that it did not reduce the risk of infection or the need for blood transfusions.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{therapeutic}} advances, {{the poor}} prognoses for {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) and intermediate and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) point {{to the need for}} better treatment options. AML and MDS cells express the myeloid marker CD 33, making it amenable to CD 33 -targeted therapy. <b>Lintuzumab</b> (SGN- 33), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD 33 antibody undergoing clinical evaluation, induced meaningful responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial and demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in preclinical models. Recently, it was reported that 5 -azacytidine (Vidaza™) prolonged the overall survival of a group of high risk MDS and AML patients. To determine whether the combination of <b>lintuzumab</b> and 5 -azacytidine would be beneficial, a mouse xenograft model of disseminated AML was used to evaluate the combination. There was a significant reduction in tumor burden and an increase in overall survival in mice treated with <b>lintuzumab</b> and 5 -azacytidine. The effects were greater than that obtained with either agent alone. As the in vivo anti-leukemic activity of <b>lintuzumab</b> was dependent upon the presence of mouse effector cells including macrophages and neutrophils, in vitro effector function assays were used {{to assess the impact of}} 5 -azacytidine on <b>lintuzumab</b> activity. The results show that 5 -azacytidine significantly enhanced the ability of <b>lintuzumab</b> to promote tumor cell killing through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytic (ADCP) activities. These results suggest that <b>lintuzumab</b> and 5 -azacytidine act in concert to promote tumor cell killing. Additionally, these findings provide the rationale to evaluate this combination in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{therapeutic}} advances, {{the long-term}} survival rates for {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) {{are estimated to be}} 10 % or less, pointing to the need for better treatment options. AML cells express the myeloid marker CD 33, making it amenable to CD 33 -targeted therapy. Thus, the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities of <b>lintuzumab</b> (SGN- 33), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD 33 antibody undergoing clinical evaluation, were investigated. In vitro assays were used to assess the ability of <b>lintuzumab</b> to mediate effector functions and to decrease the production of growth factors from AML cells. SCID mice models of disseminated AML with the multi-drug resistance (MDR) -negative HL 60 and the MDR+, HEL 9217 and TF 1 -α, cell lines were developed and applied to examine the in vivo antitumor activity. In vitro, <b>lintuzumab</b> significantly reduced the production of TNFα-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by AML cells. <b>Lintuzumab</b> promoted tumor cell killing through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) activities against MDR− and MDR+ AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples. At doses from 3 to 30 mg/kg, <b>lintuzumab</b> significantly enhanced survival and reduced tumor burden in vivo, regardless of MDR status. Survival of the mice was dependent upon the activity of resident macrophages and neutrophils. The results suggest that <b>lintuzumab</b> may exert its therapeutic effects by modulating the cytokine milieu in the tumor microenvironment and through effector mediated cell killing. Given that <b>lintuzumab</b> induced meaningful responses in a phase 1 clinical trial, the preclinical antitumor activities defined in this study may underlie its observed therapeutic efficacy in AML patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lintuzumab,</b> a humanized anti-CD 33 antibody, targets {{myeloid leukemia}} cells and has modest {{activity}} against AML. To increase the antibody’s potency yet avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity seen with β-emitting isotopes, the α-emitter 213 Bi was conjugated to <b>lintuzumab.</b> The safety, feasibility, and antileukemic activity of 213 Bi-lintuzumab was demonstrated in a phase I trial (Jurcic, Blood 2002).

The {{widespread use of}} 213 Bi, however, is limited by its 46 -min half-life. 225 Ac (t½= 10 d), a radiometal that generates four α-particles, can be conjugated to antibodies using DOTA-SCN. 225 Ac-labeled immunoconjugates can kill in vitro at doses at least 1, 000 times lower than 213 Bi analogs and prolong survival in mouse xenograft models of several cancers (McDevitt, Science 2001). We sought to determine the safety, pharmacology, and biological activity of 225 Ac-linutuzumab in patients with AML. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Lintuzumab</b> (HuM 195), a humanized anti-CD 33 antibody, targets {{myeloid leukemia}} cells and has modest single-agent {{activity}} against {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML). To increase the potency of the antibody without the nonspecific cytotoxicity associated with ß-emitters, the a-particle¿emitting radionuclide bismuth- 213 (213 Bi) was conjugated to <b>lintuzumab.</b> This phase I/II trial was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and antileukemic effects of 213 Bi-lintuzumab, the first targeted a-emitter, after partially cytoreductive chemotherapy. Experimental Design: Thirty-one patients with newly diagnosed (n = 13) or relapsed/refractory (n = 18) AML (median age, 67 years; range, 37 - 80) were treated with cytarabine (200 mg/m 2 /d) for 5 days followed by 213 Bi-lintuzumab (18. 5 - 46. 25 MBq/kg). Results: The MTD of 213 Bi-lintuzumab was 37 MB/kg; myelosuppression lasting > 35 days was dose limiting. Extramedullary toxicities were primarily limited to grade = 2 events, including infusion-related reactions. Transient grade 3 / 4 liver function abnormalities were seen in five patients (16 %). Treatment related deaths occurred in 2 of 21 (10 %) patients who received the MTD. Significant reductions in marrow blasts were seen at all dose levels. The median response duration was 6 months (range, 2 - 12). Biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies suggested that saturation of available CD 33 sites by 213 Bi-lintuzumab was achieved after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine. Conclusions: Sequential administration of cytarabine and 213 Bi-lintuzumab is tolerable and can produce remissions in patients with AMLJRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E
