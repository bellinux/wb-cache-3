25|$|There {{are several}} modes of play within ChuChu Rocket! {{including}} a single-player puzzle mode, a puzzle editing mode, a cooperative challenge mode, and competitive multiplayer modes. In the puzzle mode, the player is provided a limited set of arrows to {{place on the}} field to save all the ChuChus in play. The puzzle editing mode allows players {{to create their own}} puzzles <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> challenge mode, players are given 30 seconds to save the ChuChus in play without any arrow limitations as in puzzle mode. In the competition modes, each player has a rocket and must guide as many ChuChus as possible into their rocket in the time limit. This mode supports up to four players, either in free-for-all or team-based fashion.|$|E
500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a book <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E

This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for.

2500|$|Although Walt Disney {{had been}} highly {{involved}} in planning the Florida Project, Walt Disney Productions began construction on Magic Kingdom {{and the entire}} resort in 1967 after his death. The park was built as a larger, improved version of Disneyland Park in California. There are several anecdotes regarding some {{of the features of}} Walt Disney World, and Magic Kingdom specifically. According to one story, Walt Disney once saw a Frontierland cowboy walking through Tomorrowland at Disneyland. He disliked that the cowboy intruded on the futuristic setting of Tomorrowland and wanted to avoid situations <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new park. Therefore, Magic Kingdom was built over a series of tunnels called utilidors, a portmanteau of utility and corridor, allowing employees (called [...] "cast members") or VIP guests to move through the park out of sight from guests.|$|E

[...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fog of war, there's always going to be confusion.

2500|$|Transplant Priority for Willing Donors is a newer {{method and}} the first to {{incorporate}} a [...] "non-medical" [...] criteria into the priority system to encourage higher donation rates in the opt-in system. Initially implemented in Israel, it allows an individual in need of an organ to move up the recipient list. Moving up the list is contingent on the individual opting-in prior to their need for an organ donation. The policy applies nonmedical criteria when allowing the individual who has previously registered as an organ donor, or family has previously donated an organ, priority over another possible recipient. It must be determined that both recipients have identical medical needs prior to moving a recipient up the list. While incentives <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opt-in system do help raise donation rates, they are not as successful in doing so as the opt-out, presumed consent default policies for donation.|$|E
2500|$|The Skywhales design {{received}} a mixed reception after the balloon was unveiled on 9 May 2013. Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Katy Gallagher {{said that her}} eyes [...] "nearly fell out of her head" [...] when she first saw a diagram of The Skywhales design, but {{she had come to}} like it and believed that it would challenge the perception of Canberra as a boring city. She also stated that [...] "There will be people in the community who think it's a great achievement to have won a commission <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACT and have it as a symbol of our centenary and those who won't see it as value for money". The leader of the opposition in the ACT, Jeremy Hanson, was critical of The Skywhale stating that [...] "I really don't know whether to laugh or cry ... it's an embarrassing indulgence only a fourth term government would contemplate". Public views of the design, as expressed on social media and talkback radio, were also mixed. Much of the public criticism has been focused on the five breasts which hang from each side of the balloon, with a Twitter user calling it [...] "terrifyingly nipply". The director of the Canberra Museum and Gallery wrote an opinion article praising The Skywhale, arguing that the strength of the design [...] "arises from how it concentrates the wonder, awe and mystery we experience in nature, with an urgent insistence on social engagement". The Canberra Times' art critic Kerry-Anne Cousins complemented the boldness of the design, and stated that [...] "I think it's a mark of the sophistication of Canberra that we can have this kind of debate". In response to the criticism of the balloon's design, Piccinini has stated that it wasn't intended to be sexual and the breasts represent how female whales feed their calves. She also believes that The Skywhale is likely to win greater support once Canberrans see it in person.|$|E
2500|$|Leatherface was {{originally}} slated for a 2016 release, {{which it did}} not meet. Despite having reached completion, it was temporarily shelved by Lionsgate Films. Sherwood speculated that the studio might have been afraid that they wouldn't make back their investment after another film underperformed, but {{admitted that he had}} no concrete explanation for the delay: [...] "In a strange way, I started to romanticize the idea it became some legendary lost film. It would be coveted – something spoken about, something people would try to contrive some way of seeing, something that would show up on a tired unused media at a convention in 50 years." [...] A film titled Leatherface received a direct-to-video release from Lightning Pictures in the United Kingdom in January 2017, featuring a masked chainsaw-brandishing figure on the home video cover. However, this film was not the Texas Chain Saw Massacre prequel, but rather a re-packaging of the unrelated Playing With Dolls: Bloodlust. The release was criticised by members of the press for its misleading marketing, with William Bibbiani scrutising on Blumhouse.com that [...] "It's not uncommon for horror movies to pick up new titles in domestic or foreign markets in an attempt to capitalize on various trends, but this is a particularly egregious example. It goes beyond mockbusters, which try to trick you into thinking it's the real deal, and simply takes the title of an upcoming, anticipated horror movie and tries to pass itself off as that movie." [...] Playing With Dolls director Rene Perez apologised for the title change, [...] "I am [...] to this title change but I am powerless to stop it. The sales agency didn't even inform me that a sale was made to the UK. At the moment I am making a 3rd Playing with Dolls movie. I will be self releasing the new Playing with Dolls online to avoid any issues <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future." ...|$|E
