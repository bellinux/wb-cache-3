I wanted to document and try to explain their words, which struck me as often being extreme.|$|E

500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought {{it would be great to}} use a little person in a lead role.

[...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD.

500|$|Biden {{declared}} his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, {{although he had}} discussed running for months prior. It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials. Biden rejected the notion outright, saying [...] "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State". He stated that he was focused only on the presidency. At a campaign event, Biden commented, [...] "I know a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> opponents out there say I'd be a great secretary of state. Seriously, every one of them.

She explained its artistic qualities, and said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. We used a lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall-queen type." [...] The video premiered on February 10, 2010, via the high definition music video provider Vevo.|$|E

He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about."

Lavigne explained, [...] "Goodbye Lullaby was more mellow, [...] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know {{is going to be a}} single, I just need to re-record it!." [...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it's... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It's really different and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends I've played it for really like it. I'm having a lot of fun with that one." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way."

500|$|Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight {{because they}} [...] "didn't {{want to break}} [...] " [...] and Mike Scully took over as showrunner in 1997.

A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other... They're very human, I think that's their appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2009, Docter {{noticed his}} pre-teen daughter, Elie, exhibiting similar shyness. [...] "She started getting more quiet and reserved, and that, frankly, {{triggered}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own insecurities and fears," [...] he said. He imagined {{what happens in}} the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray [...] "strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities." [...] He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, {{a professor of psychology at}} the University of California, Berkeley. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and surprise. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around. Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude, ennui, pride, and hope. Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships. Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.|$|E
