50|$|Excess {{borrowing}} {{to acquire}} replacement property. Borrowing {{more money than}} is necessary to close on replacement property will not result in the taxpayer receiving tax-free money from the closing. The funds from the loan {{will be the first}} to be applied toward the purchase. If the addition of exchange funds creates a surplus at the closing, all unused exchange funds will be returned to the Qualified Intermediary, presumably to be used to acquire more replacement property. <b>Loan</b> <b>acquisition</b> costs (origination fees and other fees related to acquiring the loan) with respect to the replacement property should be brought to the closing from the taxpayer’s personal funds. Taxpayers usually take the position that <b>loan</b> <b>acquisition</b> costs are being paid out of the proceeds of the loan. However, the IRS may take the position that these costs are being paid with Exchange Funds. This position is usually the position of the financing institution also. Unfortunately, at the present time there is no guidance from the IRS on this issue which is helpful.|$|E

The team lost just twice in their opening 15 league fixtures, bringing them {{a place in the}} top 4 of the division. However, a lengthy hamstring injury to striker Nouha Dicko left the team lacking attacking options, with Leon Clarke having scored just once. The <b>loan</b> <b>acquisition</b> of Hull striker Yannick Sagbo failed to solve the issue as the player's lack of fitness became apparent and the deal was cut short.

40|$|In {{financial}} decision-making, {{a number}} of mathematical models {{have been developed for}} financial management in construction. However, optimizing both qualitative and quantitative factors and the semi-structured nature of construction finance optimization problems are key challenges in solving construction finance decisions. The selection of funding schemes by a modified construction <b>loan</b> <b>acquisition</b> model is solved by an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) approach. The basic objectives of the model are to optimize the loan and to minimize the interest payments for all projects. Multiple projects being undertaken by a medium-size construction firm in Hong Kong were used as a real case study to demonstrate the application of the model to the borrowing decision problems. A compromise monthly borrowing schedule was finally achieved. The results indicate that Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Loan Guarantee Scheme (SGS) was first identified as the source of external financing. Selection of sources of funding can then be made to avoid the possibility of financial problems in the firm by classifying qualitative factors into external, interactive and internal types and taking additional qualitative factors including sovereignty, credit ability and networking into consideration. Thus a more accurate, objective and reliable borrowing decision can be provided for the decision-maker to analyse the financial options.

A literature review approach and desk study using secondary data of net income (Profit after tax) during the period 2010 – 2014 of eight (8) building materials companies, publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) were used for the study.
