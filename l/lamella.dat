5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower <b>lamella</b> with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior <b>lamella.</b> The upper surface, or superior <b>lamella,</b> has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} {{is fully}} developed and particularly unique. Tarsiers, which are most {{closely related to}} monkeys and apes (collectively called simians), also have a well-developed but non-specialized sublingua. Simians, however, {{do not have a}} sublingua, although some, such as titis have a highly specialized frenal <b>lamella</b> (plica sublingualis). All primates have a plica sublingualis, and the fimbria linguae (plica fimbriata) found under the tongue of apes may be a vestigial version, although that is still disputed. The structure and appearance of the sublingua, frenal <b>lamella,</b> lingual frenulum, and other sublingual tissue vary greatly between primates, and as a result, their terminology is often confused.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions for the {{practice}} of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin. A <b>lamella</b> from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E

The melting {{behaviors of the}} <b>lamellae</b> were observed in real time at elevated temperatures using a hot-stage atomic force microscopy.

40|$|Damselfly larvae can autotomize their caudal <b>lamellae</b> {{to escape}} predation. Costs of caudal <b>lamellae</b> {{autotomy}} were investigated by directly manipulating <b>lamellae</b> condition of Lestes sponsa in laboratory experiments. Larvae without <b>lamellae</b> had higher predation mortality {{in the presence}} of Notonecta. Both <b>lamellae</b> loss and larval density increased the probability of being cannibalized. The results suggest that the increased vulnerability after <b>lamellae</b> loss resulted from a reduced escape performance. Larvae were less mobile after <b>lamellae</b> loss or {{in the presence of}} a predator, but the decrease was no longer significant when both factors were combined. This indicates that larvae compensate for the increased predation risk with a fixed response. Both <b>lamellae</b> loss and predator presence reduced hunting success, but the decrease after <b>lamellae</b> loss was only significant in the absence of a predator. The fitness consequences of these effects for both the larval and adult stages are discussed. In general, the data strongly suggest that <b>lamellae</b> autotomy plays a role in population regulation of damselflies. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The octopus uses gills as its {{respiratory}} surface. The gill {{is composed}} of branchial ganglia {{and a series of}} folded <b>lamellae.</b> Primary <b>lamellae</b> extend out to form demibranches and are further folded to form the secondary free folded <b>lamellae,</b> which are only attached at their tops and bottoms. The tertiary <b>lamellae</b> are formed by folding the secondary <b>lamellae</b> in a fan-like shape. Water moves slowly in one direction over the gills and <b>lamellae,</b> into the mantle cavity and out of the octopus’ funnel.|$|R
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The <b>lamella</b> structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E

40|$|Alpha {{isotactic}} poly(propylene) (α-iPP) {{exhibits a}} form of lamellar branching that is unique among semicrystalline polymers, where the branches have a distinct orientation relationship with the original crystalline <b>lamellae.</b> This is termed a parent–daughter relationship (PD). By allowing the structure to crystallize in an oriented form, a bimodal orientation of <b>lamellae</b> is developed and the individual contributions of PD <b>lamellae</b> can be observed using wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The present study investigated oriented PD <b>lamellae</b> during flow-induced crystallization and subsequent melting using time resolved rheo-WAXS. During crystallization the planes of the daughter <b>lamellae</b> were observed to curve towards the flow direction as they grew from their parent <b>lamellae.</b> This was explained by the influence of neighbouring daughter <b>lamellae</b> confining their growth direction.

50|$|In fish gills {{there are}} two types of <b>lamellae,</b> primary and secondary. The primary gill <b>lamellae</b> come out of the interbranchial septum at the fish gill {{filament}} to increase the contact area between the water and the blood capillaries that lie in the fish gill filaments. The secondary gill <b>lamellae</b> are small <b>lamellae</b> that come out of the primary ones and are used to further increase the contact area. Both types of <b>lamellae</b> are used to increase the amount of oxygen intake of the blood. Both types of <b>lamellae</b> contain huge amounts of capillaries and are the sites where the exchange of oxygen from the water and carbon dioxide from the blood occurs.|$|R

40|$|Annulate <b>lamellae</b> are {{cytoplasmic organelles}} {{containing}} stacked sheets of membranes embedded with pore complexes. These cytoplasmic pore complexes at annulate <b>lamellae</b> are morphologically similar to nuclear pore complexes at the nuclear envelope. Although annulate <b>lamellae</b> {{has been observed}} in nearly all types of cells, their biological functions are still largely unknown. Here we show that SUMO 1 -modification of the Ran GTPase-activating protein RanGAP 1 not only target RanGAP 1 to its known sites at nuclear pore complexes but also to annulate <b>lamellae</b> pore complexes through interactions with the Ran-binding protein RanBP 2 and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc 9 in mammalian cells. Fur-thermore, upregulation of annulate <b>lamellae,</b> which decreases the number of nuclear pore complexes and concurrently increases that of annulate <b>lamellae</b> pore complexes, causes a redistribution of nuclear transport receptors including importin α/β and the exportin CRM 1 from nuclear pore complexes to annulate <b>lamellae</b> pore complexes and also reduces the rates of nuclear import and export. Moreover, our results reveal that importin α/β-mediated import complexes initially accumulate at annulate <b>lamellae</b> pore complexes upon the activa...|$|R

25|$|The middle <b>lamella</b> is {{laid down}} first, formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis, {{and the primary}} cell wall is then {{deposited}} inside the middle <b>lamella.</b> The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model.

Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle <b>lamella,</b> which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid).
