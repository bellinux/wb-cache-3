5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its <b>limited</b> <b>distribution,</b> and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a <b>limited</b> <b>distribution</b> on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{renormalization}} approach, {{we study}} the asymptotic <b>limit</b> <b>distribution</b> {{of the maximum}} value {{in a set of}} independent and identically distributed random variables raised to a power q(n) that varies monotonically with the sample size n. Under these conditions, a non-standard class of max-stable <b>limit</b> <b>distributions,</b> which mirror the classical ones, emerges. Furthermore a transition mechanism between the classical and the non-standard <b>limit</b> <b>distributions</b> is brought to light.

5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a <b>limited</b> <b>distribution</b> and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E

Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Prey (known as Alien Prey in some markets) is a 1977 British {{independent}} {{science fiction}} horror film produced by Terry Marcel {{and directed by}} Norman J. Warren.

5|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} or Beckman DU, {{introduced in}} 1941, {{was the first}} commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of spectrophotometer enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its absorption spectrum, the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one <b>limited</b> <b>distribution</b> model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU.

5|$|Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by {{enthusiastic}} reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records and <b>limited</b> <b>distribution</b> stunted {{its commercial}} success. Frustration {{took its toll}} on band relations: Bell left {{not long after the}} first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the Fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was {{killed in a car accident}} at the age of 27.|$|E
5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a <b>limited</b> <b>distribution</b> in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet contain more than one species.|$|E

5|$|O. sydandersoni {{is known}} from the {{departments}} of Beni and Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia, including the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP), where the type locality is located.

5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a <b>limited</b> <b>distribution</b> across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E
