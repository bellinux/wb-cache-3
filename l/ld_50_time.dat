Twelve sheep in two groups of six were inoculated with Crotalus durissus terrificus venom. One group was inoculated with natural venom (NV) {{and the other with}} Cobalt 60 gamma-irradiated venom (IrV). Three antigen doses were given to the animals at monthly intervals for immunization. The toxic activity of the venom was assessed by <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> determination in mice. Blood samples were collected weekly analyses of serum neutralization capacity and potency. At the end of the experiment, the animals were challenged with a <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> for sheep showed no signs of envenoming.

According to the law, ther are assessed for their potential danger to {{human health and the}} environment, including alternative test objects. Evaluation has been carried out with regard to cytotoxic effect of pharmacological substances (loratadine and desloratadine) using the bull sperm suspension as test objects, standardized and highly sensitive to toxic substances. Sperm was divided into the control sample (dissolved by phosphate-buffered saline) and the investigated sample. Loratadine was added to phosphate-buffered saline in doses of 1 / 500 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> (12. 3 mg), 1 / 100  LD 50 (61. 5 mg) and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> (6150 mg).

Survival of spermatozoa was defined until termination of rectilinear forward movement in sperm intacted at + 2 …+ 5 °C. Respiratory activity (ex tempore) was defined in 1. 0 ml thermostated cell (temperature of 38. 5 °C) by polarography with the automatic registration of process flow by potentiometer; restorative activity was defined potentiometrically, using the open microelectrodes that were inserted in thermostated polarographic cell. Survival of spermatozoa in the sperm under the impact of loratadine in doses of 1 / 500 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> and 1 / 100 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> is respectively 136. 0 ± 26. 2 hours and 144. 0 ± 19. 6 hours.

40|$|Irregular paginationTwo {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the change over <b>time</b> in <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> values in an in vitro larval development assay. In each experiment, six field-reared Romney lambs were effectively treated with an anthelmintic and housed. In experiment I, six three month old lambs were given a single infection of 35000 infective larvae of T. colubriformis. From ten days post infection (DPI) three lambs (Group 1. 1) were treated twice weekly with 0. 5 mg/kg of dexamethasone trimethylacetate whilst the other three (Group 1. 2) served as controls and remained untreated. In experiment II, three lambs (Group 2. 2), six month old were infected with a single dose of 22000 infective larvae of T. colubriformis whilst the other three (Group 2. 1) {{of the same age}} were trickle-infected with 2000 infective larvae once weekly for 14 weeks. Larval development assays were conducted weekly for 14 weeks with ivermectin in Experiment I and ivermectin, avermectinB 2 and levamisole in Experiment II. In Experiment I and II for ivermectin, the <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> values rose to a 4 x increase between 50 - 70 DPIand fell again. The general pattern seen following a single infection with all anthelmintics was for the <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> values to be relatively constant from 21 - 35 DPI, then rose 2. 5 - 7 x increase to peak 49 - 56 DPI and declined at the same rate again to original starting values by 84 DPI where they remained {{until the end of the}} experiment.

40|$|Background: Bacteriophages {{specific}} for Yersinia pestis {{are routinely}} used for plague diagnostics {{and could be}} an alternative to antibiotics in case of drug-resistant plague. A major concern of bacteriophage therapy {{is the emergence of}} phageresistant mutants. The use of phage cocktails can overcome this problem but only if the phages exploit different receptors. Some phage-resistant mutants lose virulence and therefore should not complicate bacteriophage therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings: The purpose of this work was to identify Y. pestis phage receptors using site-directed mutagenesis and trans-complementation and to determine potential attenuation of phage-resistant mutants for mice. Six receptors for eight phages were found {{in different parts of the}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inner and outer core. The receptor for R phage was localized beyond the LPS core. Most spontaneous and defined phage-resistant mutants of Y. pestis were attenuated, showing increase in <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> and <b>time</b> to death. The loss of different LPS core biosynthesis enzymes resulted in the reduction of Y. pestis virulence and there was a correlation between the degree of core truncation and the impact on virulence. The yrbH and waaA mutants completely lost their virulence. Conclusions/Significance: We identified Y. pestis receptors for eight bacteriophages. Nine phages together use at least seven different Y. pestis receptors that makes some of them promising for formulation of plague therapeutic cocktails. Most phage-resistant Y. pestis mutants become attenuated and thus should not pose a serious problem for bacteriophag...|$|R

A crucial microbicidal mechanism is the production of oxidants including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by neutrophils to achieve efficient bacterial killing. To determine to what degrees various CF pathogens resist the oxidants relative to non-CF pathogens, we compared the susceptibility of PsA, SA, Burkholderia cepacia (BC), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and Escherichia coli (EC) to various concentrations of H 2 O 2 or HOCl, in vitro. The comparative oxidant-resistant profiles were established. Oxidant-induced damage to ATP production and cell membrane integrity of the microbes were quantitatively assessed. Correlation of membrane permeability and ATP levels with bacterial viability was statistically evaluated. Results: PsA was relatively resistant to both H 2 O 2 (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 1. 5 mM) and HOCl (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 0. 035 mM). SA was susceptible to H 2 O 2 (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 0. 1 mM) but resistant to HOCl (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 0. 035 mM). Interestingly, KP was extremely resistant to high doses of H 2 O 2 (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 2. 5 - 5. 0 mM) but was very sensitive to low doses of HOCl (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 0. 015 mM). BC was intermediate to resist both oxidants: H 2 O 2 (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 0. 3 - 0. 4 mM) and HOCl (<b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = 0. 025 mM). E...|$|R
40|$|Although {{prospective}} {{studies of}} defibrillator shock overdose cannot {{be performed in}} man, the therapeutic indices of various defibrillating current waveforms {{can be measured in}} animals. We determined the ratios TD 50 /ED <b>50</b> and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> / ED 50 (where TD 50 = median 2 ̆ 2 toxic 2 ̆ 2 or damageinducing dose, ED 50 = median effective or defibrillating dose, and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> = median lethal dose) as measures of the therapeutic index for damped sine wave defibrillator shocks in dogs. Death of an animal and/or any degree of cardiac damage found by gross or microscopic examination were defined as harmful effects of shock, analogous to drug toxicity. In terms of peak current, the ED 50, TD <b>50,</b> and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> were 1. 1, 5. 8, and 24 amperes/ kg; the therapeutic indices were TD 50 /ED 50 = 5 for morphologic damage and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> /ED 50 = 22 for death. In terms of delivered energy the ED 50, TD <b>50,</b> and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> were 1. 5, 30, and 470 joules/kg; the therapeutic indices were TD 50 /ED 50 = 20 for damage and <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> /ED 50 = 320 for death. These data indicate a reasonable margin of safety for damped sine wave defibrillator shocks in dogs, and are consistent with reported incidences of suspected shockinduced damage in humans...|$|R

40|$|Enhanced {{lethality}} for BALB/c mice {{has been}} observed after the administration of Salmonella typhosa endotoxin with either actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or nogalamycin. The dose of actinomycin D required to kill half of the mice (<b>LD</b> <b>50)</b> was 0. 8 mg/kg in normal animals, 0. 35 mg/kg in mice administered 0. 08 mg of endotoxin per kg, and 0. 28 mg/kg in mice administered 0. 2 mg of endotoxin per kg. The <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of endotoxin in normal mice was 12 mg/kg and in mice given 0. 4 mg of actinomycin D per kg was 0. 067 mg/kg. The <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of actinomycin D in mice administered 1. 8 × 108 live Escherichia coli cells per kg or 1. 8 × 109 heat-killed E. coli cells per kg was reduced to 0. 4 mg/kg.

40|$|Abstract: The role of type 2 T cell {{responses}} on the severity of post-infectious encephalitis was investigated in a mouse model of influenza virus infection. When mice were infected intracerebrally with 3. 0 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of A/NWS 33 strain of influenza virus, they all showed clinical signs of encephalitis, and 90 % of them died within 10 days of the infection. However, the post-infectious encephalitis was not demonstrated in mice exposed to 0. 5 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of the same virus. The mortality rates of mice infected with 0. 5 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of the virus were increased to levels observed in mice exposed to 3. 0 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of influenza virus infection, after the administration of a mixture of interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 10 (2 ng/mouse each; immediately, 1 and 2 days after the infection). In contrast, mortality rates of mice exposed to 3. 0 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of influenza virus were substantially decreased when these mice were treated {{with a mixture of}} monoclonal antibodies directed against IL- 4 and IL- 10. A predominance of type 2 T cell responses was demonstrated in splenic T cells of mice infected with 3. 0 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of influenza virus, although these responses were minimal in mice infected with 0. 5 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of the virus. After the treatment with the mixture of type 2 cytokines, an increase in the type 2 T cell responses in mice exposed to 0. 5 <b>LD</b> <b>50</b> of the virus was shown. These results indicate that type 2 T cell responses associated with the viral infection {{play an important role in}} the severity of post-infectious encephalitis induced in mice by the intracerebral infection of influenza A virus.
