He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only <b>lip</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
25|$|Descartes saw his Meditations as {{providing}} the metaphysical underpinning {{of his new}} physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn {{what he saw as}} two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the Meditations. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay <b>lip</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.|$|E

Wolfe was {{recruited}} into Section One {{against his will}} just before the fall of Saigon. A shrewd and driven man, Operations eventually topples the founder and head of Section One, Adrian, seizing control of the organization himself. While giving <b>lip</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aims of Section — the eradication of terrorists {{and the protection of}} the innocent — Operations uses Section One as his own power base, gaining considerable control over dictators in many regions of the globe. This lust for power brings him into direct conflict with George, head of Oversight, who on many levels despises him, and even Adrian returns from her forced retirement to mount an unsuccessful coup attempt against Operations. He is also distrustful of Nikita, and even attempts to kill her on a number of occasions, but is grudgingly forced to accept her success at completing Section missions. (The same is also true of Operations' relationship to Michael, when he discovers Michael's romantic involvement with Nikita.) Operations and Madeline make for an effective partnership, though it includes a brief romance that sometimes causes complications.|$|E

This fiction may be useful for relatively recent treaties but the question is whether it can hold water in situations where the treaties being interpreted are from the early 20 th, 19 th century or even earlier.

Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland, authorised by Hitler {{at the end of}} 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the Freikorps Danemark, Legion Niederlande and Legion Norwegen, supplemented by transfers from SS-Division Wiking, new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion Flandern was broken up and used as replacements in a number of Waffen-SS formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C.

ABSTRACT: The issue of serious food and nutrition problem is now commonly associated with less developed countries. Food is understood as involving interconnected domains with questions of agriculture, socio-political, market and distribution, employment, ecological, roles of women and just to mention a few. It is surprising {{that most of the}} problems which international institutions like the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, Economic Commission for Africa, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, International Fund for Agricultural Development and governments of developed countries have to deal with supporting the developing countries {{in the last two decades}} have revolved around the inability of agricultural sector to provide adequate food and nutrition for their populations. Nigeria government has only been paying <b>lips</b> <b>service</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> issue of food security as it is evident in weak policy making in the area of agriculture. For Nigeria to achieve food security, different challenges like political, social, ecological/climate change, institutional weakness, the role of women in food production among others must be taken seriously. It is recommended that all the stakeholders in agriculture: policy makers, scientists, extension workers and farmers be brought together <b>to</b> discuss <b>the</b> challenges confronting food production/security and forage the way forward.

6000|$|He {{felt about}} France what Pericles felt of Athens--unique value in her, nothing else mattering; but {{his theory of}} {{politics}} was Bismarck's. He had one illusion--France; and one disillusion--mankind, including Frenchmen, and his colleagues not least. His principles for the peace can be expressed simply. In the first place, he was a foremost believer {{in the view of}} German psychology that the German understands and can understand nothing but intimidation, that he is without generosity or remorse in negotiation, that there is no advantage be will not take of you, and no extent to which he will not demean himself for profit, that he is without honor, pride, or mercy. Therefore you must never negotiate with a German or conciliate him; you must dictate to him. On no other terms will he respect you, or will you prevent him from cheating you. But it is doubtful how far he thought these characteristics peculiar to Germany, or whether his candid view of some other nations was fundamentally different. His philosophy had, therefore, no place for [...] "sentimentality" [...] in international relations. Nations are real things, of whom you love one and feel for the rest indifference--or hatred. The glory of the nation you love is a desirable end,--but generally to be obtained at your neighbor's expense. The politics of power are inevitable, and there is nothing very new to learn about this war or the end it was fought for; England had destroyed, as in each preceding century, a trade rival; a mighty chapter had been closed in the secular struggle between the glories of Germany and of France.
