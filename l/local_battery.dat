25|$|Around 1874 Poul la Cour, a Danish inventor, {{experimented with}} audio {{telegraphs}} on a telegraph line between Copenhagen and Fredericia in Jutland. His experiment used a vibrating tuning-fork {{to interrupt the}} line current, which, after traversing the line passed through an electromagnet that acted upon the tines of another tuning-fork, making it resonate at the same pitch of the transmitting fork. Moreover, the hums were also recorded on paper by turning the electromagnetic receiver into a relay, which actuated a Morse code printer {{by means of a}} <b>local</b> <b>battery.</b> Again, la Cour made no claims of transmitting voice, only pure tones.|$|E

50|$|Twice weekly (Wednesday and Saturday), {{there is}} a large market in town (next to the soccer field), where local produce and goods are sold. In addition, there are several small stores that sell daily basic {{amenities}} (i.e. rice, milk powder, coffee, beans, biscuits, <b>local</b> <b>batteries,</b> cans of sardines, bottled water).|$|R
50|$|On {{top of the}} recitation {{classrooms}} signalmen {{were posted}} who would relay wig-wag messages to the <b>local</b> <b>batteries</b> onshore. Occasionally, when the guns opened up for combat engagement they would be short of officers and a message was sent down to the school to request some midshipmen to help out. Every midshipman was eager to volunteer, and so these details to the shore batteries were given as a reward from the classroom instructors.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{telephones}} were locally powered, using {{a dynamic}} transmitter or else powering the transmitter with a <b>local</b> <b>battery.</b> One {{of the jobs}} of outside plant personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery.

50|$|In the {{following}} years, systematic replacement of 25 million 300-type telephones commenced {{because of the}} much improved electrical and acoustic efficiency of the new model. This efficiency permitted the new model to be used on long rural loops, which previously required special sets with <b>local</b> <b>batteries</b> to power the transmitter, not just on urban short loops, because it contained a self-adjusting gain control. This also permitted the use of thinner loop wires and thus delivered cost-savings in the build-out of the network.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{increase}} in electric mobility, public and private charge facilities {{will be required to}} provide solutions adjusted to the actual needs and requirements. A new methodology for dimensioning charge stations for electric vehicles (EVs) is presented in this paper. Such proposal is based on the Markov chains, and uses as output rates, the capabilities of the charge station in providing energy from the sun through photovoltaic generation, stored energy in <b>local</b> <b>batteries</b> and also as a back-up the power grid. A numerical result is also presented for {{a better understanding of the}} process...|$|R

50|$|The early system {{consisted}} of <b>local</b> <b>battery</b> operated telephones {{connected to a}} magneto switchboard, {{a far cry from}} the sophisticated electronic system which is in operation today. Special cables called enamel cables were developed for use in this country, and it is reported that their use became worldwide because of their durability.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{telephones}} were locally powered, {{using either}} a dynamic transmitter {{or by the}} powering of a transmitter with a <b>local</b> <b>battery.</b> One of the jobs of outside plant personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery.

5000|$|A {{common battery}} {{is usually a}} string of {{electrolytic}} cells and is usually centrally located to the equipment that it serves. In many telecommunications applications, the common battery is at a nominal −48 VDC. A central office common battery in the battery room supplies power to operate all directly connected instruments. Common battery may include one or more power conversion devices to transform commercial power to direct current, with a rechargeable battery floating across the output. Common battery operation largely replaced <b>local</b> <b>batteries</b> in each telephone in the early 20th century. It consists of two ends that emit opposing positive and negative charges ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{composition}} of a battery charging station. The proposed charging station {{can be used for}} charging batteries of electric bicycles, using solar radiation as the main source of energy. The station contains 10 photovoltaic panels with total maximal power up to 2000 Watts. The harvested energy is accumulated in <b>local</b> <b>batteries</b> (24 V 300 Ah). During a regular summer day it is possible to charge up to 19 (12 Ah 36 V) electrical bicycle batteries. The key features of the proposed battery charging station are an adjustable photovoltaic panel angle for efficient use of solar energy and protection of parked bicycles against precipitation. The paper contains detailed information about the already built prototype of the proposed charging station. The constructed alternative energy battery charging station is completely autonomous...|$|R

50|$|What {{turned out}} to be the most popular and longest lasting {{physical}} style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's 202-type desk set. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use sat in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled. In <b>local</b> <b>battery</b> configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a <b>local</b> <b>battery</b> and inductively coupled, while the receiver was included in the local loop. The coupling transformer and the ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set. The dial switch in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1930s, {{the base}} of the {{telephone}} also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central office batteries instead of the user's <b>local</b> <b>battery</b> which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and after the rotary dial was added the instrument itself changed little until Touch-Tone signaling started replacing the rotary dial in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|The dogs of {{this time}} {{consisted}} of Vampire, who died in 1980 aged nine, this Plummer terrier was {{a veteran of the}} weekly rat hunts at the <b>local</b> <b>battery</b> hen farm. His brother Warlock, sister Beltane (who Brian regarded as the [...] "matron" [...] of his terrier team and indeed the prototype of the breed) and probably most famous Omega, bred by her sire Vampire to his own daughter Janey. Plummer dedicated a whole book to the hunting abilities of Omega.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{was not an}} easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and the distance between the church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or <b>local</b> <b>batteries,</b> San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 the Dutch company Nederlandse Kaiser-Frazer Fabrieken (NEKAF) {{was created}} {{with a new}} factory {{constructed}} in Rotterdam. NEKAF assembled 6,000 1949 Kaiser knock-down kits imported from the US using some <b>local</b> content (<b>batteries,</b> tires, interior, carpets, glass) and ignition and electrical system parts from France and Great Britain. Kaiser cars were assembled through 1954 with NEKAF exporting to Europe, South America and the Middle East.|$|R

5000|$|Many early manual {{telephones}} had an attached hand-cranked magneto {{that produced}} an alternating current (AC) at 50-100V for signaling {{to ring the}} bells of other telephones on the same (party) line and to alert an operator at the local telephone exchange. These were most common on long rural lines served by small manual exchanges which did not use a common battery circuit. The telephone instrument contained a <b>local</b> <b>battery,</b> consisting of two large [...] "N° 6" [...] zinc-carbon dry cells, to provide the necessary current for the transmitter. By around 1900, large racks of motor-generator sets in the telephone exchange could supply this ringing current remotely instead and the local magneto was often no longer required, [...] but their use continued into the mid-20th century.|$|E
50|$|On 2 March 1801, {{observers}} {{on shore}} in Southwold Bay observed a French vessel of 12 to 14 guns and 50 to 60 men working her way towards some coasters, and capturing a sloop. The Sea Fencibles were alerted, as was a detachment of dragoons, and a <b>local</b> shore <b>battery</b> fired {{a number of}} shots. The shots both drove off the privateer, and alerted other vessels in the area. Among the vessel the shots alerted were Cobourg and the hired lugger Speculator.|$|R
50|$|A <b>local</b> backup <b>battery</b> unit is {{necessary}} in some telephony and combined telephony/data applications built with use of digital passive optical networks. In such networks there are active units on telephone exchange side and on the user side, but nodes between them are all passive in the meaning of electrical power usage. So, if a building (such as an apartment house) loses power, the network continues to function. The user side must have standby power since operating power isn't transferred over data optical line.|$|R

5000|$|While the Tomcat {{was being}} used by Iran in combat against Iraq in its {{intended}} air superiority mission in the early 1980s, the U.S. Navy found itself flying regular daily combat missions over Lebanon to photograph activity in the Bekaa Valley. At the time, the Tomcat had been thought too large and vulnerable to be used over land, but the need for imagery {{was so great that}} Tomcat aircrews developed high-speed medium altitude tactics to deal with considerable AAA and SA-7 SAM threat in the Bekaa area. The first exposure of a Navy Tomcat to an SA-2 missile was over Somalia in April 1983 when a <b>local</b> <b>battery</b> was unaware of two Tomcats scheduled for a TARPS mission in a prelude to an upcoming international exercise in the vicinity of Berbera. An SA-2 was fired at the second Tomcat while conducting 10,000-ft mapping profile at max conserve setting. The Tomcat aircrews spotted the missile launch and dove for the deck thereby evading it without damage. The unexpected demand for combat TARPS laid the way for high altitude sensors such as the KA-93 Long Range Optics (LOROP) to be rapidly procured for the Tomcat as well as an Expanded Chaff Adapter (ECA) to be incorporated in an AIM-54 Phoenix Rail. Commercial [...] "Fuzz buster" [...] type radar detectors were also procured and mounted in pairs in the forward cockpit as a stop gap solution to detect SAM radars such as the SA-6. The ultimate solution was an upgrade to the ALR-67 then being developed, but it would not be ready until the advent of the F-14A+ later in the 1980s.|$|E
