5000|$|It {{seems likely}} that the stigmas {{bestowed}} upon the Mondial <b>line</b> <b>trace</b> to a few negative articles written about the early Mondial 8. Three top US automotive publications (MotorTrend, Car & Driver, and Road & Track) all published reviews of the Mondial 8 in the fall of 1981. Road & Track and Car & Driver reported comparatively disappointing performance results. Road & Track noted a faulty gear selector which {{may have contributed to the}} overall poor showing. Car & Driver received a pre-production model, which may have contributed to poor performance. MotorTrends review was much more favourable, and recorded performance on par with the 308 GTBi/GTSi and Porsche 928. There was never any definitive conclusion on these performance disparities; Automobile magazine has suggested that the vehicles engine being new (not [...] "broken-in") as the reason their observed 0-60 time was below expectations, since the sample vehicle tested by MotorTrend had an engine with significantly greater mileage.|$|E
50|$|I-185 begins {{just north}} of Fort Benning in the southwestern part of Columbus, which is {{consolidated}} with Muscogee County. It starts off as a northern extension of Lyndsey Creek Parkway. That highway enters the base. It travels to the northeast. Almost immediately, it has an interchange with US 27/US 280/SR 1/SR 520 (Victory Drive). The interstate curves to the north-northwest. It passes Benning Hills Park and the Calhoun Tract before curving to the north-northeast. It crosses over Cusseta Road and some railroad tracks of Georgia Southwestern Railroad. It curves to the north-northwest and has an interchange with St. Marys Road. It curves to a due north direction and has an interchange with Buena Vista Road. The highway curves to the northwest and crosses over Bull Creek. It then has an interchange with SR 22 Spur (Macon Road). Here, it passes the Cross Country Plaza shopping center. I-185 crosses over Lindsey Creek and then begins to parallel the creek. Upon crossing over College Drive, Lindsey Creek veers away from the interstate. The highway then travels between Hardaway High School and Columbus State University. After crossing over the Fall <b>Line</b> <b>Trace,</b> it has an interchange with US 27 Alt./SR 85 (Manchester Expressway). It then has an interchange with the Airport Thruway, which leads to Columbus Metropolitan Airport. After the highway begins to curve to the north, it travels under a bridge that carries US 27/SR 1. It crosses over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway. Almost immediately is an interchange with US 80/SR 22 (J.R. Allen Parkway), a limited-access bypass of Columbus to its north. Within this interchange, it crosses over Roaring Branch. It curves {{to the north and}} has an interchange with Williams Road. It curves to the north-northeast and has an interchange with Smith Road. Within this interchange, it crosses over Heiferhorn Creek. At the northern end of this interchange, the highway leaves the city limits of Columbus and enters Harris County.|$|E

40|$|When {{comparing}} two target elements {{placed on}} the same convoluted curve, response times are dependent on {{the distance between the}} targets along the curve, despite being separated by a constant Euclidean distance. The present study assessed whether such <b>line</b> <b>tracing</b> is obligatory across the whole of the line even when the task demands do not require it, or whether it is an optional strategy that can be disregarded when the circumstances favor a different method of attentional deployment. Three experiments were conducted to assess whether attention can select only a portion of a curve to trace when it is strategically sensible to do so. The results suggest that attention can indeed jump over portions of a line that are irrelevant to task performance before tracing has begun. However, the final experiment suggests that <b>line</b> <b>tracing</b> may continue beyond the task-relevant portion of the line. We conclude that <b>line</b> <b>tracing</b> is a strategy whose initial deployment can be influenced by top-down factors, rather than an obligatory response triggered by the stimuli - although, once engaged, <b>line</b> <b>tracing</b> may be hard to stop.

40|$|A semianalytical Sachs-type {{equation}} for {{the flow}} stress of magnesium-base alloys is developed using the Schmid law, power law hardening, and a sigmoidal {{increase in the}} twinning volume fraction with strain. Average Schmid factors were estimated from electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) data. With these, the equation provides a reasonable description of the flow curves obtained in compression and tension for samples of Mg- 3 Al- 1 Zn cut in different orientations from rolled plate. The model illustrates the general importance of basal slip and twinning in magnesium alloys. The significance of prismatic slip in room temperature tension testing is also highlighted. This is supported with EBSD slip <b>line</b> <b>trace</b> analysis and rationalized {{in terms of a}} possible sensitivity of the critical resolved shear stress for prismatic (cross) slip to the stress on the basal plane. <br /...|$|E

We processed single trace and multi-core ones inside the bulk material, the captured near field mode pattern confirmed that both structures perform good guiding properties. Beam shaping technique was adopted during fabrication {{of the single}} trace {{in order to obtain}} a relative symmetric waveguide cross section. Waveguide lasing was achieved in the single <b>line</b> <b>trace</b> with a linear cavity configuration. The maximum laser output of 11 mW was obtained under mono-directional of 980 nm space light pumping, with similar to 2 % corresponding slope efficiency. Guiding mode could be manipulated in the Expanded-core waveguide (ECW) by extra design freedom in the structure parameter, and ECW generally support larger effective mode area light transporting. </p...|$|E
40|$|Galaxies at high {{redshift}} with {{a strong}} Ly-Alpha emission <b>line</b> <b>trace</b> massive star formation {{in the absence of}} dust, and can therefore be regarded as a prime signature of the first major starburst in galaxies. We report results of the Ly-Alpha search within the Calar Alto Deep Imaging Survey (CADIS). With imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer CADIS can detect emission lines in three waveband windows free of night-sky emission lines at 700 nm, 820 nm, and 920 nm. The typical flux detection limit for Ly-Alpha emission redshifted into these windows, Flim > 3 X 10 ^(- 20) Wm^(- 2), corresponds to (unobscured) star formation rates of > 10 Msun/yr at z= 6. Candidate Ly-Alpha-emitting galaxies are selected from the total emission line sample, which contains more than 97 % of objects at z 5 than the assumption of a non-evolving population would predict. Therefore we conclude that the Ly-Alpha bright phase of primeval star formation episodes reached its peak at redshifts between 3 and 6...|$|E
