5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus bengalensis) is a tern in the family, Laridae.|$|E
50|$|In {{various parts}} of its range, the royal tern could be {{confused}} with the elegant tern, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (the other orange-billed terns), and the greater crested tern. It is paler above than <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> and the yellow-billed great crested tern. The elegant tern has a longer more curved bill and shows more white on the forehead in winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{royal tern}} {{is similar in}} size to this species, but has a heavier build, broader wings, a paler back and a blunter, more orange bill. The greater crested often {{associates}} with the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> but is 25% larger than the latter, with a proportionately longer bill, longer and heavier head, and bulkier body. <b>Lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> has an orange-tinted bill, and in immature plumage it is much less variegated than greater crested.|$|E

50|$|Juvenile <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> {{resemble}} same-age Sandwich terns, {{but with}} a yellow-orange bill, and paler overall, with only faint dark crescents on the mantle feathers.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} {{marginally}} paler above than the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> {{with a white}} (not grey) rump, with a slightly longer, more slender bill with a different curve. The black of the crest that comes down from the crown extends through the eye, creating a small black [...] "smudge" [...] {{in front of the}} eye. On Royal Tern, the black crest stops at the eye, and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> has a less shaggy crest ...|$|E
50|$|Birds {{found on}} the island include {{threatened}} species like the wedge-tailed shearwater, the bridled tern, the crested tern and the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hicks Island is {{also part}} of the Cape York to Cape Grenville Islands Important Bird Area. [...] The island is {{inhabited}} by species such as the pied imperial-pigeon, bridled tern, roseate tern and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{breeding}} on {{the islands}} include masked boobies, Australian pelicans, lesser frigatebirds, eastern reef egrets, silver gulls, <b>crested,</b> bridled and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns,</b> common noddies, and pied and sooty oystercatchers. Visiting waders include grey-tailed tattlers, ruddy turnstones, great knots and greater sand plovers.|$|R
50|$|The reef {{has been}} {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because its cays, with a collective land area of about a hectare, have supported over 1% of the world population of <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> (with up to 5000 nests recorded).|$|R
5000|$|The islands {{extend from}} Night Island, lying {{off the coast}} of the McIlwraith Range, southwards to Burkitt Island, north of Port Stewart. [...] They have been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because, collectively, they support over 1% of the world populations of nesting pied imperial-pigeons, brown boobies and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} sandbanks on the reefs, {{but little}} land is above the surface at high tide. The atoll is visited by pelagic birds, {{including}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Sterna bengalensis) and greater crested tern (Sterna bergii).|$|E
50|$|The Chinese crested tern (Thalasseus bernsteini) is a tern in {{the family}} Laridae, {{closely related to the}} Sandwich tern, T. sandvicensis, and the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> T. bengalensis. It is most similar to the former, differing only in the bill pattern, which is the reverse of the Sandwich tern's, being yellow with a black tip. From the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> which it {{overlaps}} in wintering distribution, it can be told by the white rump and paler grey mantle, as well as the black tip to the bill, which seen from up close also has a white point. The larger greater crested tern is also similar, differing in its stouter, all-yellow bill and darker grey mantle and rump, as well as in size.|$|E
50|$|The Sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) is a tern in {{the family}} Laridae. It is very {{closely related to the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (T. bengalensis), Chinese crested tern (T. bernsteini), Cabot's tern (T. acuflavidus), and elegant tern (T. elegans) and has been known to interbreed with the lesser crested.|$|E
5000|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world population of roseate terns, with up to 4000 breeding pairs using the site. [...] Other seabirds recorded as breeding in the IBA include <b>crested</b> and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns,</b> and pied cormorants.|$|R
50|$|Identification of orange-billed terns {{within their}} range is straightforward. <b>Crested</b> and Cayenne <b>terns</b> (which do not overlap in range) can be {{identified}} by their bill colour. Of the truly orange-billed species, the only geographical overlaps are between royal and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested,</b> and between royal and elegant Terns, and {{in both cases the}} larger size and strong bill of royal tern should prevent misidentifications (in addition, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> have a grey, not white, rump).|$|R
50|$|The greater <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus bergii), {{also called}} <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> or swift tern, is a tern {{in the family}} Laridae that nests in dense colonies on coastlines and islands in the {{tropical}} and subtropical Old World. Its five subspecies breed in the area from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific and Australia, all populations dispersing widely from the breeding range after nesting. This large tern {{is closely related to}} the royal and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns,</b> but can be distinguished by its size and bill colour.|$|R
50|$|This bird {{could be}} {{confused}} with the royal tern or Forster's tern, but the royal tern is larger and thicker-billed and shows more white on the forehead in winter. Out of range, it can also be easily confused with the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern.</b> See also orange-billed tern, and the external link below.|$|E
5000|$|All the cays, except Broomfield Cay, {{have been}} {{identified}} as significant seabird breeding islands. [...] In recent years, a colony of <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> Sterna bengalensis has used Broomfield Cay for breeding. Up to eight seabird species breed on Masthead Island, One Tree Island and Wreck Island, and seven species are recorded from Tryon Island, Erskine Island and Fairfax Islands.|$|E
50|$|The greater crested tern's closest {{relatives}} {{within its}} genus {{appear to be}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (T. bengalensis), and the royal tern (T. maximus). The DNA study did not include the critically endangered Chinese crested tern (T. bernsteini) but, as that bird was formerly considered to be conspecific with the greater crested tern as a synonym of the subspecies T. b. cristatus, it is presumably also very closely related.|$|E
5000|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they have supported over 1% of the world populations of <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> (with up to 1000 breeding pairs) and bridled terns (up to 10,000 breeding pairs). [...] Some 120 pairs of roseate terns bred in the IBA in 1985, and up to 1500 non-breeding black-naped terns have been recorded there.|$|R
5000|$|Michaelmas Cay is {{important}} as a breeding site for several species of terns. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b> [...] Sooty terns and common noddies also breed there. Other terns that have nested on the cay in the past include roseate and black-naped terns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported over 1% of the world populations of brown boobies (with up to 1000 nests) and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> (up to 9800 breeding pairs). [...] There have also been counts of up to 10,000 breeding pairs of both bridled and sooty terns, as well as breeding records of black-naped, <b>crested</b> and little <b>terns,</b> common noddies and Australian pelicans.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> {{and elegant}} tern differ {{in having a}}ll-orange bills; lesser crested also differs in having a grey rump and {{marginally}} stouter bill, and elegant in having a slightly longer, slenderer bill. Chinese crested tern is the most similar to Sandwich, but has {{a reversal of the}} bill colour, yellow with a black tip; it does not overlap in range with Sandwich tern so confusion is unlikely.|$|E
50|$|The western {{shore of}} the gulf is a {{protected}} area known as the Gulf of Salwah Protected Area, and is designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area. It is the main breeding ground of the Socotra cormorant in Saudi Arabia. Other birds that breed here include the Caspian tern, white-cheeked tern, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> and bridled tern. Migratory birds that overwinter here include the western reef heron, black-necked grebe, great crested grebe, Pallas's gull, slender-billed gull and Caspian gull.|$|E
5000|$|Inhaca is home {{to about}} 300 bird species, both {{resident}} and migratory. Species of conservation concern are the pink-backed pelican, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> crab plover, greater sand plover, Mongolian plover, Terek sandpiper, southern banded snake eagle, mangrove kingfisher, grey-rumped swallow and spotted ground-thrush. The southerly Nhaquene Swamp and Saco Bay are strongholds for the sooty falcon, while terns roost on northerly Portuguese Island [...] Bird species of limited distribution are Rudd's apalis, Neergaard's sunbird and pink-throated twinspot. House crows are present since the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Up to 60,000 pied imperial-pigeons breed on {{the islands}} during summer, {{providing}} a spectacle to onlookers as they return to their nests each evening after foraging for rainforest fruits in the mainland and Hinchinbrook Island. Following regular illegal shooting of the birds there during the early and mid 20th Century, the population using the islands was subject to a long protection campaign and monitoring program by conservation activists Margaret and Arthur Thorsborne. There are also breeding colonies of bridled, black-naped, little, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> and roseate <b>terns.</b> Beach stone-curlews breed on North Island beaches. [...] The islands have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because of the global importance of the site for pied imperial-pigeons and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b>|$|R
40|$|Defence of {{the nest}} by Black-naped, Roseate, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Crested</b> and <b>Crested</b> <b>Terns</b> and {{strategies}} of predation used by Silver Gulls were studied. Strategies used by Gulls differed as did the rate of success between individuals {{and only a few}} were responsible for most predation. Their behaviour was affected {{by the size of the}} defender of the eggs or chicks and by the size of an egg. Breeding success and causes of mortality of eggs and chicks of Black-naped, Roseate, Bridled and <b>Crested</b> <b>Terns</b> were determined. Mortality resulted mainly from predation (1. 6 to 83. 1 %), flooding of nesting areas (6. 6 to 50. 6 %) and starvation (< 82. 4 %) caused by a cyclone preventing adults foraging for at least three days. However, the importance of these causes of mortality differed among colonies over three successive breeding seasons. Although the breeding success of <b>Lesser</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Terns</b> was determined, the main causes of mortality were not. The generalizations that populations are limited by abundance of food or competition for it are discussed. Breeding success of Black-naped and Roseate Terns is too low to maintain the present size of their colonies at One Tree Island. In contrast, the colonies of the Bridled and <b>Crested</b> <b>Terns</b> can be maintained or possibly increased, depending on post-fledging mortality...|$|R
5000|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world population of roseate terns, {{as well as a}} large breeding colony of greater <b>crested</b> <b>terns,</b> with up to about 10,000 birds of each species recorded. [...] The greater <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> nest mainly on Sandy Island, with small numbers of silver gulls. As well as roseate terns, birds recorded as nesting on Low Rock include pied cormorants (150), and bridled (1000), black-naped (800) and <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> (440) <b>terns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dawlish Warren {{nature reserve}} {{provides}} a major roosting site for wading birds and migratory waterfowl, {{and serves as}} a habitat for the endangered petalwort plant. It is also one of only two sites in Britain where the sand crocus (Romulea columnae) grows. A large number of rare vagrant birds have been recorded at Dawlish Warren, including elegant tern, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> long-billed murrelet, greater sand plover, semipalmated plover, cream-coloured courser and great spotted cuckoo. Some sand lizards have also been spotted at the reserve, as a result of re-introductions.|$|E
50|$|It was {{suspected}} by wildlife conservationists in The Gambia that the West African birds were a separate species {{and analysis of}} DNA by scientists at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Montpellier have confirmed that the West African albididorsalis is a separate species. Feathers and other remains were collected from Mauritania and from islands off Tanji Bird Reserve, The Gambia and the DNA sequences shows the West African royal tern {{is closer to the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus bengalensis) then royal terns {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic.|$|E
5000|$|A longer-staying unusual visitor was [...] "Elsie" [...] the <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> {{who visited}} the Farnes every summer from 1984 to 1997; during that period (paired with a male Sandwich tern) she raised several hybrid chicks and {{attracted}} several thousand birders keen to see this species in Britain. Lesser crested terns normally nest on islands {{off the coast of}} Libya and migrate to West Africa for the winter; it is thought that [...] "Elsie" [...] took a wrong [...] "tern" [...] at the Straits of Gibraltar on spring migration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{archipelago}} {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of <b>crested</b> and bridled <b>terns.</b> [...] Other seabirds recorded as having bred on the islands include wedge-tailed shearwaters, pied cormorants, roseate, <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> and Caspian <b>terns,</b> and silver gulls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{inhabitants}} are wedge-tailed shearwaters, sooty terns and common and black noddies. Their numbers are usually quite high and bird cries continue {{day and night}} on the island. Several species of booby migrate through the Island including masked, brown and red-footed boobies, and also the <b>lesser</b> frigatebird. <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> are also seen to migrate, although not as often. [...] Other birds mentioned by John King Davis are the buff-banded rail as a resident, wood sandpiper, and sacred kingfisher and red-tailed tropicbird as occasional visitors.|$|R
50|$|The great <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> feeds {{mostly at}} sea by plunge diving {{to a depth}} of up to 1 m, or by dipping from the surface, and food is usually {{swallowed}} in mid-air. Birds may forage up to 10 km from land in the breeding season. Prey size ranges from 7 - 138 mm in length and up to 30 g in weight. Shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovy and sardine are typical prey, but bottom-living species are taken as discards from commercial fishing. This tern actively follows trawlers, including at night, and during the fishing season trawl discards can constitute 70% of its diet. Prawn fishing is particularly productive in providing extra food, since prawns usually represent only 10-20% of the catch, the remaining being bycatch, mainly fish such as cardinalfish and gobies.A study of an area of the Great Barrier Reef where the number of breeding great <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> has grown ten-fold, probably due to extra food from trawl by-catch, suggested that <b>lesser</b> <b>crested</b> and sooty <b>terns</b> have moved away and now breed on a part of the reef where fishing is banned. It is possible that the large {{increase in the number of}} greater <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> may have affected other species through competition for food and nesting sites.|$|R
