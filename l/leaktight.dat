40|$|Abstract. The value 1 {{problem is}} a {{decision}} problem for probabilistic automata over finite words: given a probabilistic automaton, are there words accepted with probability arbitrarily close to 1 ? This problem was proved undecidable recently; to overcome this, several classes of probabilistic automata of different nature were proposed, for which the value 1 problem has been shown decidable. In this paper, we introduce yet another class of probabilistic automata, called <b>leaktight</b> automata, which strictly subsumes all classes of probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem {{is known to be}} decidable. We prove that for <b>leaktight</b> automata, the value 1 problem is decidable (in fact, PSPACE-complete) by constructing a saturation algorithm based on the computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton. We rely on algebraic techniques developed by Simon to prove that this abstraction is complete. Furthermore, we adapt this saturation algorithm to decide whether an automaton is <b>leaktight.</b> Finally, we show a reduction allowing to extend our decidability results from finite words to infinite ones, implying that the value 1 problem for probabilistic <b>leaktight</b> parity automata is decidable...|$|E

The primary requirement of the closure weld is to provide <b>leaktight</b> confinement of the packaged material against release to the environment during interim storage (40 -year design term). Required weld quality, in this case, was established through up-front development and qualification, and then verification of parameter compliance during production welding.

In addition, pull testing with a weighted mockup, and thermal calculation/physical testing to identify the maximum temperature the packaged contents would be subject to during welding, was performed. Thirteen overpacks were successfully packaged and placed into interim storage.

Secondly, the quality of engineering and standards used are far more demanding than in conventional power engineering.
