We report a systematic study on many compounds in the Bi[subscript 2]Te[subscript 3]–Bi[subscript 2]Se[subscript 3]–Bi[subscript 2]S[subscript 3] system. All the samples were fabricated by {{high energy ball milling}} followed by hot pressing. Among the investigated compounds, Bi[subscript 2]Te[subscript 2]S[subscript 1] shows a peak ZT ~ 0. 8 at 300 °C and Bi[subscript 2]Se[subscript 1]S[subscript 2] ~ 0. 8 at 500 °C. The results show that these compounds can be used for mid-temperature power generation applications. The leg efficiency of thermoelectric conversion for segmented elements based on these n-type materials could potentially reach 12. 5 % with a cold side at 25 °C and a hot side at 500 °C if appropriate p-type legs are paired, which could compete well with the state-of-the-art n-type materials within the same temperature range, including <b>lead</b> tellurides, <b>lead</b> <b>selenides,</b> <b>lead</b> sulfides, filled-skutterudites, and half Heuslers.

5000|$|Colloidal {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals are synthesized from solutions, {{much like}} traditional chemical processes. The main {{difference is the}} product neither precipitates as a bulk solid nor remains dissolved. [...] Heating the solution at high temperature, the precursors decompose forming monomers which then nucleate and generate nanocrystals. Temperature is {{a critical factor in}} determining optimal conditions for the nanocrystal growth. It must be high enough to allow for rearrangement and annealing of atoms during the synthesis process while being low enough to promote crystal growth. The concentration of monomers is another critical factor that has to be stringently controlled during nanocrystal growth. The growth process of nanocrystals can occur in two different regimes, [...] "focusing" [...] and [...] "defocusing". At high monomer concentrations, the critical size (the size where nanocrystals neither grow nor shrink) is relatively small, resulting in growth of nearly all particles. In this regime, smaller particles grow faster than large ones (since larger crystals need more atoms to grow than small crystals) resulting in [...] "focusing" [...] of the size distribution to yield nearly monodisperse particles. The size focusing is optimal when the monomer concentration is kept such that the average nanocrystal size present is always slightly larger than the critical size. Over time, the monomer concentration diminishes, the critical size becomes larger than the average size present, and the distribution [...] "defocuses".There are colloidal methods to produce many different semiconductors.
