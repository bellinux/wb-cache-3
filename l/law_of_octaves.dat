A man may be quite alone in the desert and he can trace the enneagram in the sand and in it read the eternal <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the universe. And every time he can learn something new, something he did not know before." [...] The ray of creation is a diagram which represents the Earth's place in the Universe.

50|$|In 1863 John Newlands {{noticed that}} when ordered by weight, every eighth element seemed to share similar properties, such as carbon and silicon in the sequence: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sodium, {{magnesium}} and silicon. He called this a <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Octaves.</b>|$|E

50|$|Robert Hughes has {{remarked that}} where Le Testament explores a Webernesque pointillistic {{orchestration}} and derives its vitality from complex rhythms, Cavalcanti (1931) thrives on extensions of melody. Based on the lyric love poetry of Guido Cavalcanti, the opera's numbers {{are characterized by}} a challenging bel canto, into which Pound incorporates a number of tongue-in-cheek references to Verdi and a musical motive that gestures to Stravinsky's neo-classicism. By this time his relationship with Antheil had considerably cooled, and Pound, in his gradual acquisition of technical self-sufficiency, was free to emulate certain aspects of Stravinsky. Cavalcanti demands attention to its varying cadences, to a recurring leitmotif, and to a symbolic use <b>of</b> <b>octaves.</b> The play <b>of</b> <b>octaves</b> creates a surrealist straining against the limits <b>of</b> established <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> composition, history, physiology, reason, and love.|$|R

50|$|The Ray of Creation is an esoteric {{cosmology}} {{which was}} taught by G. I. Gurdjieff. It is a diagram which better represents the place which Earth occupies in the Universe.

50|$|There {{are many}} other {{properties}} which can be displayed on the Ray of Creation such as: {{the evolution of the}} substances in the Universe, relationship between the cosmoses and the human body, etc. In a word, many of the properties of the laws of octaves could be displayed using the Ray of Creation. Some of the subtler properties of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>octaves,</b> and their effects, require that one have a knowledge of the laws of vibrations, and of involution and evolution, which knowledge today we call physics, acoustics, and music.|$|E

50|$|In 1863 {{there were}} 56 known {{elements}} {{with a new}} element being discovered {{at a rate of}} approximately one per year. Other scientists had previously identified periodicity of elements. John Newlands described a <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Octaves,</b> noting their periodicity according to relative atomic weight in 1864, publishing it in 1865. His proposal identified the potential for new elements such as germanium. The concept was criticized and his innovation was not recognized by the Society of Chemists until 1887. Another person to propose a periodic table was Lothar Meyer, who published a paper in 1864 describing 28 elements classified by their valence, but with no prediction of new elements.|$|E
5000|$|The Law of Seven or <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>octaves,</b> {{according}} to which phenomena evolves in seven steps; and the Law of Three, {{according to}} which phenomena are produced by three forces, are presented by Gurdjieff as global laws appearing on all scales and essential to his cosmology. This cosmology offers a view of how the world operates said to derive from alchemy and more ancient sources, and to complement or complete modern experimental science rather than to contradict it. According to this cosmology everything is material, including consciousness and spirit, and all matter can be assigned a [...] "density"; consciousness and spirit for example having lower [...] "densities" [...] (and therefore higher [...] "vibrations") than for example water while for example rock has a higher [...] "density" [...] and lower [...] "vibration" [...] than water and so on.|$|E
50|$|At {{first the}} {{periodic}} system {{did not raise}} interest among chemists. However, {{with the discovery of}} the predicted elements, notably gallium in 1875, scandium in 1879, and germanium in 1886, it began to win wide acceptance. The subsequent proof of many of his predictions within his lifetime brought fame to Mendeleev as the founder of the periodic law. This organization surpassed earlier attempts at classification by Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois, who published the telluric helix, an early, three-dimensional version of the periodic table of the elements in 1862, John Newlands, who proposed the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>octaves</b> (a precursor to the periodic law) in 1864, and Lothar Meyer, who developed an early version of the periodic table with 28 elements organized by valence in 1864. Mendeleev's table did not include any of the noble gases, however, which had not yet been discovered. Gradually the periodic law and table became the framework for a great part of chemical theory. By the time Mendeleev died in 1907, he enjoyed international recognition and had received distinctions and awards from many countries.|$|E

50|$|While octaves {{commonly}} {{refer to}} the perfect octave (P8), the interval <b>of</b> an <b>octave</b> in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G (13 semitones higher) is an Augmented octave (A8), and G to G (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a preferable enharmonically-equivalent notation available (minor ninth and major seventh respectively), but these categories <b>of</b> <b>octaves</b> must be acknowledged in any full {{understanding of the role}} and meaning <b>of</b> <b>octaves</b> more generally in music.|$|R
