This brings the staff {{out of the game}} and back to the reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing that Phyllis's character was the murderer. Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin remarks that Savannah is a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>away,</b> but does so in character; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the [...] "date" [...] was just part of the game. Erin says she was also just playing, but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew she thought the date was real.|$|E

Most of the peoples along with the Franciscans sought to distance themselves from the Ottoman settlements, many times living in impoverished conditions.

All of the props, cards, and box were {{designed}} by the series' prop department. The producers tried to market the game as a real product, although that never came to fruition. Chun crafted the cold open after being inspired by the second season episode [...] "The Fight" [...] because he wanted to see more [...] "Karate Dwight". In the original version of the open, the scripted featured Dwight and Michael kicking each other in the groin. Jennifer Celotta, however, suggested that Dwight fight himself. The episode guest-stars Andy Buckley, who plays David Wallace. Buckley appears only via the telephone, and recorded his lines in the annex of the set, to give the illusion that he was calling from a <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R

The evil mystic betrayed her throwing the latter into her opposite number merging the two Orb wielders into one physical body with which Tapestry could draw near limitless quantities of power from. After Zannah broke her vow to never utilize the dark craft taught to her by said nemesis, Tapestry commented to her man servant that she's well aware the Troika may fail in their endeavor to capture her. But cackled expectingly as her prize gathered her ally's to face her one final time. during their final battle Tapestry engaged Zealot in a duel of mystic might with one turning the other's age backwards or forwards before manifesting esoteric avatars of their respective alien acolyte or counterpart, erstwhile both began siphoning energy from the conjoined entity of Void/Providence and their amalgamated Orbs of Power. To Break the Stalemate, Marinda Tai whom had taken a crystal shard from Savant; who'ed also been watching the battle take place, handed the fragment of the Kheran Orb of Power to her sister's acquaintance; Huntsmen.

40|$|Automatic speech {{recognition}} (ASR) systems have become hugely successful {{in recent years}} - we have become accustomed to speech interfaces across all kinds of devices. However, despite the huge impact ASR has had on the way we interact with technology, {{it is out of}} reach for {{a significant portion of the}} world's population. This is because these systems rely on a variety of manually-generated resources - like transcripts and pronunciation dictionaries - that can be both expensive and difficult to acquire. In this thesis, we explore techniques for learning about speech directly from speech, with no manually generated transcriptions. Such techniques have the potential to revolutionize speech technologies for the vast majority of the world's population. The cognitive science and computer science communities have both been investing increasing time and resources into exploring this problem. However, a full unsupervised {{speech recognition}} system is a hugely complicated undertaking and is still a <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>away.</b> As in previous work, we focus on the lower-level tasks which will underlie an eventual unsupervised speech recognizer. We specifically focus on two tasks: developing linguistically meaningful representations of speech and segmenting speech into phonetic units. This thesis approaches these tasks from a new direction: deep learning. While modern deep learning methods have their roots in ideas from the 1960 s and even earlier, deep learning techniques have recently seen a resurgence, thanks to huge increases in computational power and new efficient learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms have been instrumental in the recent progress of traditional supervised speech recognition; here, we extend that work to unsupervised learning from speech. by Jennifer Fox Drexler.

40|$|Additive Manufacturing {{technologies}} {{has been}} in continuous development for more than 35 years. Specifically, the later denominated Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEAM), was first developed by S. Scott Crump around 1988 and trademarked later as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Although all of these technologies {{have been around for}} a while, it was not until recently that they have been more accessible to everyone. Today, the market of 3 D printers covers all ranges of price, from very specialized, heavy and expensive machines, to desktop printers of only a few cubic inches in volume. Until recently, FDM technology had remained somewhat stagnant in terms of developments; however, with the new market boom, scholars and hobbyists have opened new doors for investigation in this area. The technology is now better understood from a software, mechanical, electrical and not less important, materials point of view. ^ The current availability of materials for MEAM is very broad: PLA (Polylactic Acid), ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PC (Polycarbonate), PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone), nylon, polyurethanes, and many others. Even so, these are all materials that were used before for other technologies, adapted but not specifically developed for MEAM. The processes that take place during the production of a part are currently not very well understood, and the final properties exhibited are <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>away</b> from reaching the potential of more traditional manufacturing techniques. Due {{to the nature of the}} process, all the material properties always display a certain level of anisotropy. ^ The research covered in these pages aims to shed some light on understanding the different mechanics taking place during the extrusion process of additive manufacturing. The development of new materials for MEAM has been explored. Several blends and composites have been developed, and their tensile properties and fracture mechanics evaluated. The blending of different combinations of ABS, UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene) and SEBS (Styrene Ethylene Butylene Styrene) were further examined due to the potential they demonstrated as low anisotropic materials in terms of strength. Also, the geometrical influence of different standard tensile specimens was studied. ^ The development of materials that lead to lowered anisotropy on the strength of 3 D printed parts has been successfully demonstrated, and alternative methodologies for the evaluation of anisotropic characteristics has been proposed as well. The present work shows the beginning to a better understanding of the mechanics taking place during the fusion of deposited material in MEAM. ...|$|R

40|$|Surface tension (S) {{is due to}} the inward force {{experienced}} by particles at the surface and usually gravitation does not {{play an important role in}} this force. But in compact stars the gravitational force on the particles is very large and S is found to depend not only on the interactions in the strange quark matter, but also on the structure of the star, i. e. on its mass and radius. Indeed, it has been claimed recently that 511 keV photons observed by the space probe INTEGRAL from the galactic bulge may be due to electron-positron annihilation, and their source may be the positron cloud outside of an antiquark star. Such stars, if they exist, may also go a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards explaining <b>away</b> the antibaryon deficit of the universe. For that to happen S must be high enough to allow for survival of quark/antiquark stars born in early stages of the formation of the universe. High value of S may also assist explanation of delayed gamma-ray burst after a supernova explosion, as conversion from normal matter to strange matter takes place. The possibility of some implications from formation of surface waves are also discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, uses aa-package. Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics Letter...|$|R
