5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

5|$|After Jefferson's {{retirement}} from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal.

5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E
5|$|The many <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel {{written by}} Lambert are {{also based on}} Balzac's life.

Lambert's letters to his uncle about life in Paris from 1817 to 1820, meanwhile, mirror Balzac's own sentiments while attending the Sorbonne at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E

5|$|While in Ferrara, Josquin wrote some of {{his most}} famous compositions, {{including}} the austere, Savonarola-influenced Miserere, which {{became one of the most}} widely distributed motets of the 16th century; the utterly contrasting, virtuoso motet Virgo salutiferi; and possibly the Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae, which is written on a cantus firmus derived from the musical <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Duke's name, a technique known as soggetto cavato.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, Martin Schanz noticed that isolated <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> margins of two dialogues formed an alphabetic series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He {{was able to}} show that other manuscripts had similar marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.|$|E
5|$|According to Glajar, this is {{the world}} of the narrator's mother, who writes of her sicknesses in her <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 Durham University named Josephine Butler College after her, {{reflecting}} her and George's {{connection to}} the area and the university. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds a number of collections related to Josephine.

In 2001 English Heritage placed a blue plaque on her former residence in Wimbledon; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site.|$|E
5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
