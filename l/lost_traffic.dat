25|$|Although {{the trading}} {{position}} was buoyant in the mid-1840s, as railways developed and improved their own services, the canal <b>lost</b> <b>traffic</b> heavily {{as the years}} passed. Thomson says that the Blackhill inclined plane was only used for about 37 years (i.e. until about 1831) but this is completely inconsistent with traffic volumes, and Hutton's statement that it worked until 1887 is more convincing. From that time the declining traffic volume did not require the continued use of the inclined plane, and after standing idle for some years it was finally scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Since 1850, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company (PRR) {{had enjoyed}} a lucrative {{partnership}} with the British Inman Line, which transported European immigrants from Liverpool direct to Philadelphia, thus ensuring the Railroad {{a steady stream of}} customers. In 1857, the Inman Line switched its destination to New York, depriving the Pennsylvania Railroad of this lucrative trade. The Railroad made its first attempt to compensate for the <b>lost</b> <b>traffic</b> by organizing its own steamship line in 1863, but the plan was dropped after the Philadelphia city council declined to provide financial support.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline of}} Amathous is often {{measured}} by the Ptolemaic gifts to Argos, where Amathous donated only 40 drachmas in 170-160 BC, but Kition and Salamis gave 208, Kourion 172, and Paphos 100. However, this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion, a bath, a gymnasium, as well as fortifications of the Acropolis, including a new tower. However, the port of Paphos <b>lost</b> <b>traffic</b> compared to Amathous in the Ptolemaic period, an indication that Paphos as {{the capital of the}} island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons, like Amathous.|$|E

The Ekeberg Line <b>lost</b> <b>traffic</b> because it did not operate to the city center, and with the 1960 decision in the city council was it not permissible to lay new tracks to Stortorvet. Therefore, locals suggested that the trams continue along the track from Jernbanetorget to Skøyen, {{on the west side of}} town. At first the proposal was rejected by Oslo Sporveier because it was [...] "technically impossible".|$|E
2500|$|The graph {{compares the}} freight traffic (in ton-km) of the USSR to the US. The USSR rebuilt its rail system and industrialized with five-year plans. [...] As a result, railway freight grew about 20 times from 20 to 400 billion tonne-km by 1941. But then {{disaster}} struck again: World War II in 1941 when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. [...] In {{the first year}} {{or so of the}} war, traffic plummeted to about half its prewar value. [...] But then the USSR started restoring and constructing railways during wartime so {{that by the end of}} the war about half of the <b>lost</b> <b>traffic</b> had been recovered. [...] After the war was over it took a few more years to restore the railways and get back to the pre-war level of traffic.|$|E

It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically {{for its use}} of glass staircases and cubes. The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have <b>lost</b> <b>traffic,</b> control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores. Apple's notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases. Due to {{the popularity of the}} brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers. Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts, there are limited or no paths of career advancement. A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers, intense internal criticism, and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1905–1906 King Edward was altered to add a {{cloakroom}} and a smokeroom on the main deck, under a new top deck extending aft over the saloon staircase but not forward to the bridge. The ship's boats were relocated at the after end of this new deck, so {{that they no longer}} obstructed the view of the funnels from each side. After a [...] "Grand Saturday afternoon opening cruise to Kilbrannan Sound" [...] on 12 May 1906, the ship resumed the run from Greenock to Inveraray. The route was changed so that instead of going via Fairlie and Garroch Head, the ship went through the Kyles of Bute and gave direct competition to the other steamers on the run. The timetable of Lord of the Isles was accelerated as much as it could, and the steerage fare cut to 3shillings and 6d (...) , against the turbine steamer fare of 5shillings (...) , but the paddle steamer still <b>lost</b> <b>traffic.</b> King Edward always reached Inveraray first, and refused to leave the berth to allow the paddler in. An attempt to get Inveraray Town Council to intervene failed as the vote was tied with 6 on each side, and the provost declined to settle the matter with a casting vote. By 1912 the battle was over, and Lord of the Isles (together with the paddler Edinburgh Castle which was also owned by an amalgamation of the Inveraray and Loch Goil companies) was taken over by Turbine Steamers Ltd.|$|E
