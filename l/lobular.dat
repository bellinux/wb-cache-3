5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as <b>lobular</b> ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E

25|$|Histopathology. Breast {{cancer is}} usually {{classified}} primarily by its histological appearance. Most breast cancers {{are derived from}} the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as ductal or <b>lobular</b> carcinoma. Carcinoma in situ is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, invasive carcinoma does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.|$|E
25|$|Mammographic density {{refers to}} the {{relative}} proportions of radiodense area compared to the radiolucent area on a mammogram, which is basically an x-ray of the breast. The radiodense area on a mammogram is white and is associated with ductal and <b>lobular</b> epithelium, connective tissue and fluid in the breast. The radiolucent area is dark gray or black and is associated with fat in the breast. High mammographic density {{is associated with a}} higher risk of developing breast cancer, but the reasons for this link are not certain and are being studied. Conversely, patients with very low mammographic breast density were found to hold a poorer prognosis irrespective of age, BMI and menopausal status.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{developing}} breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, {{hormone replacement therapy}} during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 5–10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as <b>lobular</b> carcinomas. In addition, {{there are more than}} 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to.|$|E
25|$|The breast is an {{apocrine gland}} that {{produces}} the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct <b>lobular</b> units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E

500|$|The {{subcutaneous}} tissue is {{a layer of}} fat between the dermis and underlying fascia. [...] This tissue may be further divided into two components, the actual fatty layer, or panniculus adiposus, and a deeper vestigial layer of muscle, the panniculus carnosus. [...] The main cellular component of this tissue is the adipocyte, or fat cell. [...] The structure of this tissue is composed of septal (i.e. linear strands) and <b>lobular</b> compartments, which differ in microscopic appearance. [...] Functionally, the subcutaneous fat insulates the body, absorbs trauma, {{and serves as a}} reserve energy source.|$|E
500|$|Primaries are {{connected}} to the manus (the bird's [...] "hand", composed of carpometacarpus and phalanges); these are the longest and narrowest of the remiges (particularly those attached to the phalanges), and they can be individually rotated. [...] These feathers are especially important for flapping flight, as they are the principal source of thrust, moving the bird forward through the air. [...] The mechanical properties of primaries are important in supporting flight. Most thrust is generated on the downstroke of flapping flight. [...] However, on the upstroke (when the bird often draws its wing in close to its body), the primaries are separated and rotated, reducing air resistance while still helping to provide some thrust. The flexibility of the remiges on the wingtips of large soaring birds also allows for the spreading of those feathers, which helps to reduce the creation of wingtip vortices, thereby reducing drag. The barbules on these feathers, friction barbules, are specialized with large <b>lobular</b> barbicels that help grip and prevent slippage of overlying feathers and are present in most of the flying birds.|$|E

Species vary in the number of primaries they possess. The number in non-passerines generally varies between 9 and 11, but grebes, storks and flamingos have 12 and ostriches have 16. While most modern passerines have ten primaries, some have only nine. Those with nine are missing the most distal primary, sometimes called the , which is typically very small and sometimes rudimentary in passerines.|$|E

[...] The nuclei are prominent and usually contain {{one or two}} large nucleoli, and have prominent nuclear membranes. [...] Foci of syncytiotrophoblastic cells may be present in varied amounts. [...] The adjacent testicular tissue commonly shows intratubular germ cell neoplasia, and may also show variable spermatocytic maturation arrest.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, the {{definition}} of breast cancer has expanded to include non-invasive, non-cancerous conditions like <b>lobular</b> carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and pre-cancerous or [...] "stage 0" [...] conditions like ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Despite the now-regretted decision {{to use the word}} carcinoma in these relatively common conditions (almost a quarter of [...] "breast cancer" [...] diagnoses in the USA), they are not life-threatening cancers. Women with these conditions are promoted as breast cancer survivors due to the fear they experienced before they became educated about their condition, rather than in respect of any real threat to their lives. This effectively increases the market size for breast cancer organizations, medical establishments, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and the makers of mammography equipment.|$|E
