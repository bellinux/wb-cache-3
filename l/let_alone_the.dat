5|$|No {{work was}} done to the ship over the {{following}} two years. On 18 January 1904, Ottoman negotiators began {{a new round of}} talks with Krupp, demanding a reduction in the cost of the modernization from 282,000lira to 65,000lira; this amount does not cover the preparatory work that had been initially carried out, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction. In return, the Ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still under negotiation, Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented.

The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.|$|E
5|$|The History of Ferdinand and Isabella was {{published}} on Christmas Day, 1837 by the American Stationery Company, Boston, with a print run of 500copies. It {{was dedicated to}} his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well—the original print run was insufficient to adequately supply Boston's bookshops, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> whole nation's. It {{was first published in}} London by Richard Bentley in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where Henry Vassall-Fox and Robert Southey expressed their admiration of the work. It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time. Prescott was adamant that his work should not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an abridgement of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella in June 1839, he produced an abridgement of the work himself, which resulted in the original project's cancellation. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in May 1839.|$|E

60|$|Tea {{made over}} night.--To prepare tea {{for a very}} early breakfast, make it over night, and pour {{it away from the}} tea-leaves, into another vessel.

25|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that very large stars, greater than ~100 solar masses, could have planetary systems consisting of hundreds of Mercury-sized planets within the habitable zone. Such systems could also contain brown dwarfs and low-mass stars (~0.1–0.3 solar masses). However the very short lifespans of stars {{of more than a}} few solar masses would scarcely allow time for a planet to cool, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> time needed for a stable biosphere to develop.

25|$|Interestingly, the Philippine creepers, {{a single}} genus of three species of treecreeper-like birds {{appear to be}} highly apomorphic members of the more initial {{radiation}} of the Sturnidae.

In addition, biogeography virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the Wallacea, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.|$|E

The line and the two stations ran west to east, were built by Brooklyn Elevated Railroad on May 13, 1885 and closed by Brooklyn Rapid Transit on April 11, 1904.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} 1936 ban on hijab in Iran, {{the rules of}} dress code were relaxed, and after Reza Shah's abdication in 1941 the {{compulsory}} element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned. According to Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, between 1941 and 1979, wearing hijab was no longer offensive, but still considered {{it to be a}} real hindrance to climbing the social ladder, a badge of backwardness and a marker of class.

25|$|Poe {{makes no}} attempt to {{describe}} accurately {{the operations of the}} Spanish Inquisition, and takes considerable dramatic license with the broader history premised in this story. The rescuers are led by Napoleon's General Lasalle (who was not, however, in command of the French occupation of Toledo) and this places the action during the Peninsular War (1808–14), centuries after the height of the Spanish Inquisition. The elaborate tortures of this story have no historic parallels in the activity of the Spanish Inquisition in any century, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth when under Charles III and Charles IV only four persons were condemned. The Inquisition was, however, abolished during the period of French intervention (1808–13).|$|E
25|$|Recent {{investigation}} of production records at Norsk Hydro {{and analysis of}} an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004 revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of pH14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of D2O. Despite the apparent size of the shipment, the total quantity of pure heavy water was quite small, most barrels only containing 0.5–1% pure heavy water.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Riina orchestrated {{the murders of}} a number of {{high-profile}} public officials, such as judges, prosecutors and members of the police and the carabinieri. As well as intimidating the state, these assassinations also helped to frame the Corleonesi's rivals. The Godfathers of many Mafia Families were often highly visible in their communities, rubbing shoulders with politicians and mayors, protecting themselves with bribes rather than violence. In contrast, Riina, Provenzano and other Corleonesi were fugitives, always in hiding and rarely seen by other mobsters, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> public. Consequently, when a policeman or judge was killed it was the more visible Mafia Families who were the subject of official investigations, especially as these assassinations were deliberately carried out in the territory (or 'turf') of the Corleonesi's rivals rather than anywhere near the town of Corleone itself.|$|E
25|$|The airline was {{assigned}} by law the monopoly of international operations from Argentina in 1971. This meant no other Argentine airline {{was able to}} operate international flights, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> already created Austral. The carrier therefore became the flag carrier of the country. The same law also assigned Aerolíneas Argentinas a 50% of the domestic market share. Following the acquisition of Austral by the Argentine government in 1980, both Aerolíneas Argentinas and Austral became government-owned, {{to the extent that}} some routes were simultaneously operated, even using similar equipment. However, there existed a state of continuous tension over salary differences between both companies that eventually led the Aerolíneas Argentinas' pilots to a three-week-long strike that started on 1 July 1986. During this strike, the government leased pilots from the Argentine Air Force to operate some aircraft. Other companies took advantage from this situation and gained the market share Aerolíneas Argentinas lost, as domestic routes were operated by Austral, LADE and LAPA, and the government temporarily authorised foreign carriers to exploit the company's international routes.|$|E
25|$|This {{tradition}} {{enjoyed a}} general acceptance {{until the early}} 20th century. The Jewish origin, <b>let</b> <b>alone</b> <b>the</b> biblical descent, of the Bagratids has been discounted by modern scholarship. Cyril Toumanoff's research concluded that the Georgian Bagratids branched out of the Armenian Bagratid dynasty {{in the person of}} Adarnase, whose father Vasak (son of Ashot III the Blind, presiding prince of Armenia from 732 to 748) passed to Kartli following an abortive uprising against Arab rule in 775. Adarnase’s son, Ashot I, acquired the principality of Kartli in 813 and thus founded the last royal house of Georgia. Accordingly, the legend of the Davidic origin of the Georgian Bagratids was a further development of the earlier claim entertained by the Armenian dynasty, as given {{in the work of the}} Armenian author Moses of Khorene. Once the Georgian branch, which had quickly acculturated in the new environment, assumed royal power, the myth of their biblical origin helped to assert their legitimacy and became a major ideological pillar of the millennium-long Bagrationi rule in Georgia.|$|E
