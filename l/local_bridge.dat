5|$|There {{are many}} myths {{regarding}} {{the construction of}} the Faidherbe Bridge which are present even today and are depicted in some tourist guides. The construction of the bridge is attributed to Gustave Eiffel. In general it says that the metallic parts of the bridge represents a gift from the French government and that the parts were originally designed for the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube River in Romania. Other sources say that the metallic parts were intended for a bridge in Austria–Hungary over the Danube River in Vienna or Budapest. Finally another myth regarding the beams of the bridge says that the parts were intended for an unspecified site but the vessel transporting mysteriously sunk and the authorities in Senegal took advantage of this situation and built a <b>local</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{settlements in}} Bulwell appeared circa 800 A.D, and {{were most likely}} built {{around the same time}} as the first <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> spanning across the River Leen. With the river being significantly narrower, shallower and slower-moving in Bulwell than in other potential locations along its length and the threat of highwaymen a very real danger on existing cross-country routes, a toll bridge was constructed in this outpost, allowing for a quicker and safer passage from north to south for travellers but providing an obstacle to less legitimate travellers.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, for Example B (Fig.  8), {{we observe}} that the Edge Gravity Algorithm {{identifies}} the <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> (I,L), (A,B), (F,Y), (Q,R), and (R,T) of Granovetter; the <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> enjoy {{the highest ranking}} and are included in a significantly larger number of total paths than the other edges, as evidenced by Figs.  11 and 12. The <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> identified by Granovetter {{in each of these}} examples are indeed the ties that bind the networks together, as demonstrated by the Edge Gravity Algorithm.|$|R

30|$|We were {{motivated}} by the remark of Granovetter that <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> earn their significance by creating more paths. We tested this hypothesis to see whether Edge Gravity could effectively identify and rank the <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> of Granovetter’s examples. Our results were positive; in fact, they indicate {{that it is very}} practical to use path enumeration to quantify and rank relative edge importance.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{local service}} {{ran through the}} Montague Street Tunnel and along the BMT Broadway Line local tracks; service instead crossed the Manhattan Bridge north tracks and ran express under Broadway during Broadway theatre hours (7:30 pm to midnight). Over the years, the <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> service was expanded, and the local tunnel service ended up only from 6 am to 7 pm. Express service over the bridge to the Broadway express tracks, {{initially}} during rush hours, was also expanded to 6 am to 7 pm. The three patterns were assigned latter designations in the early 1960s: Q express via bridge, QT local via tunnel, and QB local via bridge.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to nearby}} rivers, {{there are several}} major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most {{important}} bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during World War II. A third IJssel Bridge is the railway bridge (called Hanze boog) which carries the railway line from Zwolle to Amersfoort, and from 2012, to Lelystad. There are several bridges across the Zwarte Water River, including two 4-lane bridges, a 2-lane bridge, and a bus/bicycle bridge. There is also a bridge across the Vecht, which carries A28 motorway. Another <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> is adjacent to this bridge. A third bridge carries rail traffic to Leeuwarden and Groningen. Numerous local bridges exist around the historic city center.|$|E

30|$|For Example A (Fig.  7), we {{see that}} the edges with the highest Edge Gravity ranking are indeed the <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> (A,B) and (E,I) {{discussed}} by Granovetter. Notice in Figs.  9 and 10 that the <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> (A,B) and (E,I) are involved in significantly more paths than any other edges in the network. Indeed, edge (A,B) is included in 8664 paths (59 % of all paths) and edge (E,I) is included in 7884 paths (53 % of all paths). However, the edges ranked third and fourth in this example only appear in 5174 paths each (35 % of all paths). This observation supports the validity of Granovetter’s conjecture that <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> are important because of their involvement in many network paths.|$|R

30|$|Granovetter {{observed}} that <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> serve as important information pathways by reducing overall distances, yet their removal {{does not necessarily}} fragment the network. <b>Local</b> <b>bridges</b> provide shorter, more effective routes for information to be exchanged between actors in different portions of the network, {{but they are not}} the only possible way for information to travel. The Edge Gravity Algorithm quantifies Granovetter’s insight that <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> earn their significance from their inclusion in many paths. The edge that appears most often in any path in the network can thus be viewed as the most structurally important for information diffusion. Edge Gravity identifies the edges that appear in the most paths, and hence have maximum impact on dissemination in terms of reducing distances and enabling potential information flow along many possible alternate paths. Computing Edge Gravity systematically identifies and ranks the most structurally important edges in a social network, the removal of which maximally disrupts potential information flow without necessarily disconnecting the network.|$|R
2500|$|A second large strike hit {{the company}} in 1877. [...] The Long Depression began with the Panic of 1873 and did not end until 1896. By 1877, {{thousands}} of miners, steel workers, and railroad employees were {{out of work and}} wages had been slashed repeatedly. On July 23, 1877, workers in the iron and steel mills owned by the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Co. struck, seeking a 25 percent wage increase. The strike spread to rail workers the next day, and on July 25 the company's mine workers also walked out and demanded a similar wage increase. The company asked Scranton Mayor Robert McKune for police protection the same day, and McKune asked Governor John F. Hartranft for troops. On July 26, Governor Hartranft asked President Rutherford B. Hayes for federal troops, and (with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 already raging) Hayes agreed to send them at the governor's request. Violence broke out on July 29: The head house of the Penn Coal Co.'s short-line railroad was firebombed, a <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> was burned, and many of the coal mines owned by the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Co. were flooded. The next day McKune threatened to call out the federal troops, but also offered his own services as an arbitrator.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, federal, regional, {{and city}} {{transportation}} planners proposed an extension to I-695/Southeast Freeway {{to be called}} the [...] "Barney Circle Freeway" [...] to help alleviate the problems created by the failure to complete the Inner Loop. The freeway would extend I-695 past its existing terminus at Barney Circle and travel along the western bank of the Anacostia River (through Anacostia Park) to a new bridge over the Anacostia River at Burnham Barrier, providing vehicles easy access to the Anacostia Freeway. The Barney Circle Freeway would have delinked Barney Circle from I-695, and restricted the on- and off-ramps to Sousa Bridge so that the bridge returned to its traditional function as a <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> rather than a route for commuters to access the Anacostia Freeway and points east in the state of Maryland. The combined bridge and freeway project was ready for construction to begin in 1981, and its cost was estimated to be $93.5 million. But after protests from residents of Capitol Hill (who feared the Barney Circle Freeway would cause more traffic to flow into the area) as well as environmentalists, and legal and regulatory challenges, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) officials agreed in August 1994 to conduct an additional environmental impact assessment regarding the project, but later said the assessment's findings did not alter its earlier conclusion that construction of the roadway and bridge project was economically feasible, technologically appropriate, and environmentally sound. However, the D.C. City Council had the final say on whether to proceed with the project or not. [...] In December 1994, the City Council bowed to neighborhood opposition and voted overwhelmingly to reject the project.|$|E

It {{is shown}} that if G is 3 –connected modulo K {{then it is}} possible to replace branches of K by other branches joining same pairs of main vertices of K such that G has no <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> with respect to the new subgraph K. A linear time algorithm is presented that either performs such a task, or finds a Kuratowski subgraph K 5 or K 3, 3 in a subgraph of G formed by a branch e and <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> on e. This result is needed in linear time algorithms for embedding graphs in surfaces...|$|R
30|$|Additionally, Edge Gravity {{effectively}} identifies {{bridges to}} nowhere. In each case study, the bridges to nowhere were the lowest-ranking edges according to Edge Gravity. In fact, the Edge Gravity scores for bridges to nowhere were consistently {{significantly lower than}} the scores of other edges, as seen in Figs.  15 and 20. Moreover, the Granovetter B and Krebs examples reveal that Edge Gravity can distinguish structurally important <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> (ones that reduce distances in the network on their own) from <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> of lesser importance (ones that require the help of intermediary actors to span a particular gap).|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built about 1918, {{replacing}} an earlier wooden structure (probably an open wooden truss bridge).

This bridge is one of a shrinking number of structures to survive from that period.|$|R
30|$|Analysis of Granovetter’s Example A (Fig.  7) {{reveals that}} the <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> (A,B) and (E,I) of Example A rank highest for both edge betweenness and Edge Gravity metrics, {{although}} the order is reversed (see Fig.  9).

50|$|Strong Triadic Closure Property {{is that if}} a node {{has strong}} ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a weak tie between them. A <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> occurs, on the other hand, when a node is acting as a {{gatekeeper}} between two neighboring nodes who are not otherwise connected. In a network that follows the Strong Triadic Closure Property, one of the ties between nodes involved in a <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> needs to be a weak tie.|$|E
50|$|Local bridges are {{ties between}} two nodes {{in a social}} graph that are the {{shortest}} route by which information might travel from those connected to one to those connected to the other. Local bridges differ from regular bridges in that the end points of the <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> cannot have a tie directly between them and should not share any common neighbors. Also if the <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> is deleted the distance between these two nodes will be increased to a value strictly more than two.|$|E
50|$|Let node B be a <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> between nodes A and C {{such that}} there is no weak tie between the nodes involved. Therefore, B has a strong tie to both A and C. By the {{definition}} of Strong Triadic Closure, a weak tie would develop between nodes A and C. However, this contradicts the fact that B is a local gatekeeper. Thus {{at least one of the}} nodes involved in a <b>local</b> <b>bridge</b> needs to be a weak tie to prevent triadic closure from occurring.|$|E
30|$|Following the {{insights}} of Granovetter (1973), Davies (1966), and also Stephenson and Zelen (1989), we note that social information does not always follow a prescribed route or travel over shortest paths. Granovetter noted that <b>local</b> <b>bridges</b> earn their significance from their inclusion in many paths. The Edge Gravity metric uses all paths rather than just shortest paths, thus providing an opportunity for deeper analysis of this insight.|$|R
