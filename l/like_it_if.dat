500|$|Her {{books were}} very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the major}} criticism being its button arrangement. Amanda Yeo of the website Gizmodo {{said that if the}} reader liked the Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 is a definite upgrade. She noted that newer users might be thrown off by the button configuration. Marshall Honorof's biggest criticism of the mouse was that [...] "most people won't need one", though he continued to say that for those who do, it would work exactly as expected. He said that at first, the button arrangement threw him off. Michael Crider of Digital Trends said that once the user gets used to the button layout, the actions are [...] "quick and responsive." [...] Matthew Buzzi of PC Magazine also believed that the user would <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> they play MOBAs, but if not, another mouse might be a better option. He also asserted that the Naga Hex v2 is reliable and well made. Kane Fulton from Techradar listed the Naga Hex v2 as one of the ten best gaming mice.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, he {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} kill Arizona's anti-immigration law, SB 1070 and ones <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of the states. He backed his position, saying: [...] "States like Arizona and Alabama will {{no longer be able to}} get away with saying they are simply 'helping the federal government' to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws and knowingly deploying untrained officers with a mission of arresting anyone and everyone who might fit the preconceived profile of an illegal immigrant." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{how would}} you have <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> you had been a Roman girl, and Moses were Quintus Curtius? {{would you like to}} have him give himself up for the good of the country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't say,' {{observed}} Miss Podsnap, after hesitating considerably, {{and stealing}} several timid looks at Mrs Lammle's carefully arranged face, 'how I might have <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> I had been a--you won't mention it, WILL you?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} why I want to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|E
2500|$|Responses to the {{restriction}} and ban of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga were generally negative. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund requested that Dan Kanemitsu, a blogger, and a Japanese-to-English translator {{who has worked}} on translating many anime, weigh in on the situation. Kanemitsu criticized the government, saying, [...] "We should always be careful when start to entrust the government with discriminatory polices, be that against people, sexuality, or mediums of self-expression. How would you <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> someone told you homosexuality could be tolerated in only certain mediums, or that you may dance to waltz music but not to polka tunes?" [...] Kanemitsu concluded his interview, saying, [...] "If unchecked, the logic behind how Imouto Paradise 2 was designated harmful to minors can be employed by those in power to enforce their own brand of morality upon the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather {{walked off}} the set in anger just before a remote Evening News {{broadcast}} from Miami, where Pope John Paul II had begun a rare U.S. tour, when a U.S. Open tennis match was being broadcast into the time scheduled for the newscast. He was upset that the news was being cut into {{to make room for}} sports and discussed it with the sports department. The Steffi Graf–Lori McNeil tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32p.m., but Rather had disappeared. (CBS Sports had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) [...] Thus, over 100 affiliates were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air. The next day, Rather apologized for leaving the anchor desk. The following year, when Rather asked then Vice President Bush about his role in the Iran–Contra affair during a live interview, Bush responded by saying, [...] "Dan, how would you <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> I judged your entire career by those seven minutes when you {{walked off the}} set in New York?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{still hope}} to {{interfere}} to some purpose. Isn't it so? Yes? But how {{should you have}} <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> anybody had tried to interfere between you and Mr Fyne {{at the time when}} your understanding with each other could still have been described in vague terms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose you}} will quite understand, Bill. But {{when people do}} a thing to oblige somebody, {{and not as a}} piece of regular work, they don't expect to be paid. I shouldn't have <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> they had offered me money for such a thing." ...|$|R
25|$|Even {{those who}} were {{prepared}} to acquiesce in the change by no means <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> the Riksdag of 1778 had been docile, the Riksdag of 1786 was mutinous. The consequence was that nearly all the royal propositions were either rejected outright or so modified that Gustav himself withdrew them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Troublesome. Well; yes; it is troublesome. Nothing good {{is to be}} had without trouble. But I should <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> {{you would}} not mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> he did. You are difficult, my dear." [...] Her husband pulled an open {{newspaper}} {{toward him}} from the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "The latter, by all means," [...] {{begged the}} Professor hastily. [...] "They wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> {{you told me}} first. They'd feel hurt, I'm sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to help}} grandma bat up cake, {{and rather}} <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> I {{remember}} right," [...] said Tom, letting Polly tie a checked apron on him, put a big bowl into his hands, and settle him near the table, where Maud was picking raisins, and she herself stirring busily about among spice-boxes, rolling-pins, and butter-pots.|$|R
6000|$|... "The d---- she is! There's always {{something}} of that kind when I gets home tired out, and wants to be comfortable. I mean to have my supper to myself, as I <b>likes</b> <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> all the Mother Smileys in London choose to come the way. What on earth is she coming here for this time of night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [264] In all {{the best}} {{arrangements}} of colour, the delight occasioned by their mode of succession is entirely inexplicable, nor can it be reasoned about; we <b>like</b> <b>it</b> just as we like an air in music, but cannot reason any refractory person into <b>liking</b> <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> they do not: {{and yet there is}} distinctly a right and a wrong in it, and a good taste and bad taste respecting it, as also in music.|$|R

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 stars out of 4. Ebert {{wrote that the}} film's target {{audience}} was primarily younger children, and that, while he as an adult disliked it, he [...] "might have" [...] <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>if</b> he were younger and would recommend it for children. The New York Timess Anita Gates reviewed The Rugrats Movie positively, calling it a [...] "delight".|$|R

6000|$|But I've {{written a}} nice little bit of [...] "Præterita" [...] before I went out, trying to {{describe}} the Rhone at Geneva. I think Susie will <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> nobody else.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to do}} it, I truly didn't! I thought I'd just 'give her a hint,' as you say.

60|$|John had not philosophized on {{the causes}} of this. He knew, in a general and unconfessed way, {{that he was not}} {{comfortable}} in his new arrangements; but he supposed it was his own fault. He had fallen into rusty, old-fashioned, bachelor ways; and, like other things that are not agreeable to the natural man, he supposed his trim, resplendent, genteel house was good for him, and that he ought to <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> and by grace should attain to <b>liking</b> <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> he only tried long enough.|$|R
