Range charts are presented which show the occurrence and distribution of all the species described in detail. On the basis of these results, five microfloral zones and two subzones are proposed. Each zone or subzone is characterised by an assemblage of species, and equates to part of the established Lower Ordovician graptolite zonation. The proposed biostratigraphical scheme is applied to microfloral assemblages from several localities in the English Lake District, most of which were either previously undated or doubtfully dated. Comparisons are made with Arenigian and <b>Llanvirnian</b> assemblages described from the European area, by other authors. Tentative conclusions are drawn as to the possible continuity of the British province with other European areas during Arenigian and <b>Llanvirnian</b> times.

40|$|Abstract. – Since the 1970 s Ordovician {{carbonate}} rocks from Kazakhstan {{have provided}} well-preserved radiolarian fau-nas {{and this country}} {{remains one of the}} most important areas in the world to learn about Lower Palaeozoic radiolarian taxonomy and biostratigraphy. Here we describe a new lower Arenigian radiolarian assemblage and discuss all currently available Ordovician radiolarian data from Kazakhstan. The newly discovered assemblage is curiously oligospecific, de-spite its good state of preservation. Four morphospecies are recognised, including a new genus and two new species: Inanihella bakanasensis (NAZAROV) and I. (?) akzhala n. sp, which characterise the assemblage, together with Triplococcus acanthicus n. gen n. sp. and Proventocitum sp. cf. P. procerulum. This is the oldest radiolarian assemblage from limestone lithologies of Kazakhstan and one of the very few Lower Ordovician assemblages discovered world-wide. We specify in this study the age range of the succeeding Haplentactinia armillata-Proventocitum procerulum as-semblage, defined earlier by Nazarov and Popov [1980], which now covers the middle Arenigian – lower <b>Llanvirnian</b> (lower Abereiddian) interval. The succeeding upper <b>Llanvirnian</b> (Llandeilian) Haplentactinia juncta – Inanigutta unica assemblage reported by Nazarov and Popov [1980] reflects a substantial increase in radiolarian diversity, due largely to the introduction of new members of the family Inaniguttidae.

40|$|Summary. In {{this paper}} we present palaeomagnetic data from 87 hand samples {{collected}} in a sequence of tuffs and shales (Suri Formation) of <b>Llanvirnian</b> age, exposed in north-western Argentina (27 " 47 'S, 68 " 06 'W). After cleaning, the majority of samples showed reversed polarity and yielded a palaeomagnetic pole at 5. 9 " E, 8. 5 " S (ag 5 = 5. 9 '). They also showed reversals of declination and inclination {{at the top of}} the sequence, which we have associated with geomagnetic excursions. Whole rock K-Ar age de-terminations suggest an age older than 416 2 25 Myr for the Suri rocks. The predominant reversed stable remanence of these rocks is consistent with the reversed polarity reported for Early <b>Llanvirnian</b> rocks from USSR. The palaeomagnetic pole for the Suri Formation is consistent with the interpreta-tion that Gondwana was a single unit in Early Palaeozoic times. Palaeomagnetic data from 27 hand samples collected from 10 igneous units of Late Silurian-Early Devonian age (fluzorco Formation), exposed in the same area, are also given. The majority of the igneous units showed reversed polarity after cleaning. The positions of VGP's for the fiuEorco igneous units are scattered and they are not used for geodynamic interpreta-tions. Whole rock K-Ar age determinations suggest ages of 416 k 25 and 360 k 10 Myr for two igneous units of the fiuGorco Formation. ...|$|E

It is evident that the graptolite faunas span the Arenigian/Llanvirnian boundary interval. Thirteen species of graptolites including seven graptoloid species were found.

The steepest chemical gradient can be expected close to the openings of the burrows. Therefore, these parts of burrows may have had the highest fossilization potential.

40|$|Nautiloids of {{the order}} Tarphycerida are a {{characteristic}} component of warm-water Ordovician faunas of Baltica and Laurentia but are usually absent from the cooler high latitude marine environments. The presence of the tarphycerid Trocholites, reported from the Middle Ordovician, Dobrotivian (late Darriwilian) strata of the Iberian Chain and Armorican Massif (peri-Gondwanan Europe), provide an exception. Lituites primulus Barrande, 1865, represented by a single poorly-preserved individual was reported from coeval strata in the Prague Basin (Perunica) and doubtfully assigned to Curtoceras or Trocholites. New biostratigraphicaly well-constrained specimens of Trocholites described and discussed from the early Dobrotivian of the Prague Basin, are conspecific with Trocholites fugax previously described from the Iberian Chain and Armorican Massif. The contemporaneous presence of Trocholites fugax in Perunica and peri-Gondwanan terranes is additional evidence for faunal connections between these microcontinents during the Dobrotivian. By comparison with the preceding <b>Llanvirnian</b> (early Darriwilian) fauna, the low diversity Dobrotivian cephalopod fauna of the Prague Basin suggests an increasing faunal separation between Perunica and Baltica. The occurrence of Trocholites in early Dobrotivian strata of Perunica, the Iberian Chain and Armorican Massif reflects an unusual dispersion event of tarphycerids into lower latitude seas coinciding with a distinct climate perturbation during the Ordovician...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that trends in global marine biodiversity calibrated for the Phanerozoic may be affected by sampling problems. However, this possibility has not been evaluated definitively, and raw diversity trends are generally accepted at face value in macroevolutionary investigations. Here, we analyze a global-scale sample of fossil occurrences {{that allows us to}} determine directly the effects of sample size on the calibration of what is generally thought to be among the most significant global biodiversity increases in the history of life: the Ordovician Radiation. Utilizing a composite database that includes trilobites, brachiopods, and three classes of molluscs, we conduct rarefaction analyses to demonstrate that the diversification trajectory for the Radiation was considerably different than suggested by raw diversity time-series. Our analyses suggest that {{a substantial portion of the}} increase recognized in raw diversity depictions for the last three Ordovician epochs (the Llandeilian, Caradocian, and Ashgillian) is a consequence of increased sample size of the preserved and catalogued fossil record. We also use biometric data for a global sample of Ordovician trilobites, along with methods of measuring morphological diversity that are not biased by sample size, to show that morphological diversification in this major clade had leveled off by the <b>Llanvirnian.</b> The discordance between raw diversity depictions and more robust taxonomic and morphological diversity metrics suggests that sampling effects may strongly influence our perception of biodiversity trends throughout the Phanerozoic...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} paper is to provide a provenance study of the Falda Ciénaga Formation and a paleotectonic scenario for the Middle Ordovician combining new data with published information from Ordovician sedimentary successions of the Puna, a highland in the northwestern part of Argentina. The Falda Ciénaga Formation oucrops between the Salar de Pocitos (24 ° 24 ' 59. 5 ''S 66 ° 55 ' 18. 0 ''W) and the Sierra Calalaste (26 ° 11 ' 52. 5 ''S 67 ° 41 ' 02 ''W). The abundance of black shales containing pyrite, the absence of shallow water sedimentary structures and the lack of debris flows suggest that the Falda Ciénaga Formation was deposited in a relatively deep basin. The material was deposited by turbidity currents in a depositional lobe, lobe fringe and basin plain environment (Göttert, 1997; Zimmermann et al., 1997). Deposits in the northern region (Salar de Pocitos; Fig. 1 b) show different lithofacies to those to the south of Salar de Hombre Muerto (Fig. 1 c). Voluminous sandstones and greywackes outcrop in the northern area, while shale dominate in the southern outcrop region. Furthermore, the succession in the north contains Phyllograptus sp. (Zimmermann et al., 1998) indicating a time lapse between Upper Arenigian and <b>Llanvirnian,</b> whereas Glossograptus sp. and Glossograptus hieckinsis found in the southern outcrops (Aceñolaza y Toselli, 1971; this paper) suggests a <b>Llanvirnian</b> age. Further to the south, between Salar de Hombre Muerto and Antofagasta de la Sierra (Fig. 1 b), the Falda Ciénaga Formation is composed of massive turbidites and shales, rare siltstones and subordinate coarse-grained greywackes. The latter are interpreted as submarine channel deposits, as observed to the east of Los Nacimientos locality (Fig. 1 c). Feldspathic to quartzitic arenites, medium to very-coarse grained greywackes and fine layers of pelites occur as lithotypes of the Falda Ciénaga Formation. The composition of the sandstones changes between 65 - 78 % Qt, 3 - 19 % F and 0 - 22 % L. The sedimentary rocks do not contain volcanic lithoclasts or synsedimentary volcanics. The detrital material was transported from southern sources (SW to SE) to northern depositional areas. This coincides with the pronounced axis of the Ordovician Puna basin for the Lower Ordovician (Bahlburg, 1990; Göttert, 1997; Zimmermann y Bahlburg, 1998, Zimermann, 1999). Whole rock geochemistry was focussed on trace elements, because a significant major element mobility occurs in abundance in Ordovician sedimentary rocks of the Puna, illustrated by element relations (K-Rb), spider diagrams of LILE as well as provenance discrimination diagrams after Bhatia (1983) and Roser y Korsch (1988) (Bahlburg, 1998; Zimmermann y Bahlburg, 1998; subm.; Zimmermann, 1999, 2000). Furthermore, isotope analysis of K-Ar and Rb- Sr systems indicate similar major element mobility for the entire Ordovician sedimentary record of the southern Puna (Zimmermann, 1999). INAA trace element and rare earth element (REE) analysis show typical concentrations of an evolved upper continental crustal composition (UCC) as Th/Sc 0, 75 - 2, 81 (average 1, 8); Th/U 3 - 5, 9 (average 4, 15) and LaN/YbN 4, 69 - 8, 57 (average 6, 75). A negative Ta anomaly in some samples could reflect an influence of volcanic arc material of unknown age in the detritus. This source is not visible in the petrographic data (see Table 1). The concentrations and relations of Hf, Co, Th, Sc and La show compositional ranges typical for passive or rifted margin environments and support the petrographic data. Interestingly, slightly enriched concentrations of Cr (2 - 6 x composition of UCC, Upper Continental Crust) do not coincide with negative anomalies of other compatible elements such as Ni and Sc, that show depleted UCC concentrations. Cr enrichment may be due to the introduction of detrital material from a less fractionated source that delivered heavy minerals like chromite, for example and reflect the loss, during mechanical sorting, of Ni and Sc bearing minerals. Nd-isotope data for the Formation Falda Ciénaga indicates eNdt= 450 Ma between - 6 y - 4, 5 and T DM of 1, 4 - 1, 6 Ga. These data are similar to those of the Tollilar Formation (Fig. 2; Zimmermann et al., 1999 a), the Puncoviscana Formation (Fig. 2; Bock et al., 2000), the Sierras Pampeanas (Rapela et al., 1998) and the magmatites of the Ordovician Sierra Famatina (Fig. 1; Pankhurst et al., 1998). Mixing models after DePaolo et al. (1991) show that the input of volcaniclastic material available in the region (Diablo Formation or Volcanic Successions; Fig. 2, Table 4) or mafic to ultra-mafic sources (Salar de Pocitos, Sierra Calalaste, Sierra Quebrada Honda, Fig. 1 b) is not realistic. Furthermore, an input of mafic material could be excluded by petrographic data (Table 1, Figs. 6 and 9). Ordovician volcanics of the Puna have isotopic compositions that could not be mixed with any other exposed source to model a provenance according to the petrographic data for the Falda Ciénaga Formation. Mixing model using higher fractionated end members (e. g. Tolar Chico Formation (Fig. 2), Puncoviscana Formation) and as less fractionated end member magmatites of the Sierra Famatina give results according to the petrographic and geochemical data. Detrital material of the Puncoviscana Formation and metasedimentary as well as plutonic rocks of the Sierras Pampeanas are the most probable source areas for the Falda Ciénaga Formation. These sources could have been delivered the high amount of quartz grains as well as the sedimentary and metamorphic lithoclasts. Feldspar, especially plagioclase as well as less stable lithoclasts were lost by recycling and sorting processes that affected the petrographical composition. Recycling and sorting have changed the geochemical composition as shown by Hf-La- Co ratios (Fig. 10 b). Petrographical, geochemical and isotope geochemical comparisons with the Upper Turbidite System (UTS) of the Northern Puna, which holds the same stratigraphic position (Fig. 2), show similarities regarding the sedimentary facies and Nd-isotope systematics (this paper; Bock et al., 2000; Zimmermann y Bahlburg, subm.) but slight differences in the petrographic composition. The UTS is marked by an observable input of volcanic lithoclasts in contrast to the Falda Ciénaga Formation. The plutonic and volcanic rocks of the so-called "Faja Eruptiva de la Puna Occidental" (after Mendez et al., 1973) as well as the probable extinct Puna- Famatinian volcanic arc are regarded as a possible source for volcaniclastic debris in the UTS. Nevertheless, the petrographic data of the Upper Turbidite System points to a collisional orogen or a interior cratonic provenance (Bahlburg, 1990) in accordance to the Falda Ciénaga Formation. The data presented for the Falda Ciénaga Formation coincides with the proposed evolution for the Ordovician basin in the Puna (Bahlburg y Zimmermann, 1999, Zimmermann, 2000; Zimmermann y Bahlburg, subm.). The differences in the petrographic record may be explained by a heterogeneous basin morphology (Zimmermann, 1999), for example the so-called "Cobres High" (Moya, 1997), rather than different tectonic entities. Additionally, in a retro-arc setting such as the Ordovician Puna basin (Bahlburg, 1990, 1998; Zimmermann, 1999, Zimmermann y Bahlburg, 1998; Bock et al., 2000) variations in petrographical, geochemical and isotope geochemical signatures are common. These are due to lithologically heterogeneous source areas, combined with variable transportation and sedimentation processes (e. g. McLennan y Taylor, 1991; Einsele, 1992; Marsaglia, 1995; Pouclet et al., 1995; Pre-Piper et al., 1995). However, this case study shows that the geochemical and isotope geochemical data obtained can be explained by petrographic results. It further suggests that the Falda Ciénaga Formation marks the extinction of the volcanic arc in the Puna and that the plate tectonic setting could be interpreted as a retro-arc or foreland basin deposit...|$|E
