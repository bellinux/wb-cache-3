500|$|On 16 May 2011, Brodie {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town on loan for 2011–12 for a five-figure <b>loan</b> <b>fee.</b> Homesickness was {{cited as the}} reason for the transfer, with manager Evans saying [...] "Richard is a very talented lad but it is no secret he has failed to settle away from his family home". Brodie debuted as a 54th-minute {{substitute}} for Magno Vieira in Fleetwood's 2–0 away win over Grimsby on 13 August 2011. His first goal for Fleetwood was the team's fifth goal in a 5–2 home victory over Kidderminster on 20 September 2011. Brodie's sixth goal for Fleetwood came on 26 December 2011 against Southport, when he scored a late equaliser in the 88th minute to make the score 2–2 in front of 3,029 supporters, a record home league attendance for Fleetwood. He scored twice during the away league match against the same club on 1 January 2012, the first coming after just four minutes and the second coming in the 29th minute, which made the score 3–0 to Fleetwood. Two minutes after scoring his second goal Brodie was sent off after receiving a second yellow card, although his team {{went on to win the}} match 6–0. He made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals in 2011–12 and won his second Conference Premier winner's medal in as many seasons, as Fleetwood won the title and therefore promotion into League Two.|$|E

40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{research}} has investigated the effects of short sale constraints, very little is understood about the origin of these constraints in the one-trillion-dollar equity lending market. Using a unique database comprising data from twelve lenders, we find significant dispersion in share <b>loan</b> <b>fees</b> across lenders, and we find that the dispersion is increasing in share loan demand and various proxies for search costs, including a stock’s illiquidity and the number of small lenders making loans. These findings are consistent with the existence of search frictions between share borrowers and lenders, as Duffie, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2002) suggest. We further analyze the effect of search frictions by examining the response of shorting cost to exogenous shocks in demand. We find that for stocks with moderate demand, <b>loan</b> <b>fees</b> are largely insensitive to demand shocks. However, for stocks with high demand, an increase in demand triples the already higher abnormal <b>loan</b> <b>fees.</b> Our findings help reconcile seemingly conflicting findings in the literature regarding the existence of both small and large effects of shifts in demand on price.

40|$|This paper studies how {{characteristics}} of the equity lending markets affect price efficiency {{and the distribution of}} returns, using lending supply and <b>loan</b> <b>fees</b> as proxies for short-sale constraints. The data is collected from several custodians from January 2004 to December 2008, covering more than 10, 000 stocks from 26 countries. Our main findings are as follows. First, lending supply has a significant impact on efficiency and on the distribution of returns. Stocks with limited lending supply and high <b>loan</b> <b>fees</b> are associated with low price efficiency. Second, lending supply is also associated with more extreme price fluctuations. We find that an increase in lending supply leads to both a decrease in price efficiency and in skewness and a higher frequency of extreme negative returns...|$|R
40|$|Using {{proprietary}} data on equity lending supply, <b>loan</b> <b>fees</b> and quantities, {{we examine the}} link between institutional ownership structure and the market for equity lending and stock prices. We find that both total institutional ownership and ownership concentration (measured by the Herfindahl index, single largest holding and number of investors) are important determinants of equity lending supply and short sale constraints. More concentrated ownership structures increase short sale constraints (including <b>loan</b> <b>fees,</b> recall risk and arbitrage risk) and force arbitrageurs to decrease demand for equity borrowing and demand greater compensation for borrowing stock.

This result holds using proxies based on past <b>loan</b> <b>fees,</b> predicted <b>loan</b> <b>fees,</b> and past fails to deliver. Our results also indicate that high frequency short-sale strategies are only constrained for a small cross-section of stocks.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} case of a Zambian {{institution}} providing credit for smallholder agribusiness commercialization and compares this lender?s model with the major microfinance institutions, to identify specific mechanisms employed by the lender and how these have been adapted to suit seasonal agricultural production credit requirements. Econometric models are developed to examine the influence of key economic factors such as nominal and real interest rates, <b>loan</b> <b>fees,</b> and <b>loan</b> term on the supply of credit by the lender. Other important factors considered relevant in the lender?s market include availability of contract markets for financed production and the type of borrower (cooperative or investor-owned agribusinesses). The study uses loan-level and firm-level loan data aggregated from an electronic loan database of individual loan files kept by the lender. Cross sectional data over three years (2005 ? 2007) are used in the study. The study finds that <b>loan</b> <b>fees,</b> <b>loan</b> term and availability of contract markets to borrowers are the key determinants of credit supply. In addition, the study finds that interest rates do not significantly influence the lender?s credit supply decisions, a finding that is consistent with literature on credit rationing in markets with asymmetric information. The study finds no evidence of economies of scale benefit to the lender being passed along to borrowers through lower <b>loan</b> <b>fees.</b> The study contributes to the literature and development needs of agricultural lenders and smallholder agribusinesses in Zambia through the analysis of different factors that influence the lender?s credit supply decisions...|$|R

50|$|Most {{private loan}} {{programs}} {{are tied to}} one or more financial indexes, such as the Wall Street Journal Prime rate or the BBA LIBOR rate, plus an overhead charge. Because private loans are based on the credit history of the applicant, the overhead charge varies. Students and families with excellent credit generally receive lower rates and smaller <b>loan</b> origination <b>fees</b> than those with poorer credit histories. Money paid toward interest is now tax deductible. However, lenders rarely give complete details of the terms of the private student loan until after the student submits an application, in part because this helps prevent comparisons based on cost. For example, many lenders only advertise the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers). Borrowers with bad credit can expect interest rates that are as much as 6% higher, <b>loan</b> <b>fees</b> that are as much as 9% higher, and loan limits that are two-thirds lower than the advertised figures.|$|R
