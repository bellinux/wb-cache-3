Six large road wheels in three pairs of bogies gave a low ground pressure and good weight distribution. Each bogie is allowed a vertical movement in its entirety, sprung by an inverted leaf spring assembly located just below the upper track run, the three assemblies being placed between the four top rollers. The tracks are 22 cm wide. The drive sprockets are {{in the front and}} driven by a transmission in the nose of the vehicle. The two crew members, the driver on the left, sat in the forward compartment, the drive shaft between them.

50|$|The {{addition}} of ATP and GroES has a drastic {{effect on the}} conformation of the cis domain. This effect is caused by flexion and rotation at the two hinge points on the Hsp60 monomers. The intermediate domain folds down and inward about 25° on the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge.</b> This effect, multiplied through the cooperative flexing of all monomers, increases the equatorial diameter of the GroEL cage. But the apical domain rotates a full 60° up and out on the upper hinge, and also rotates 90° around the hinge axis. This motion opens the cage very widely {{at the top of}} the cis domain, but completely removes the substrate binding sites from the inside of the cage.|$|E

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the interactions of recombinant human IgG antibodies with Fc receptors to enable selection of a constant region giving minimal depletion of antigen-bearing cells. Eight variant constant regions were made by substituting motifs between human IgG subclasses in the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> region and/or a specially close loop of the CH 2 domain. Mutations in the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> region were shown to eliminate Fc�RI binding and monocyte activation [Eur. J. Immunol. 29 (1999) 2613]. Here, we detail interactions with Fc�RIIa of the 131 R and 131 H allotypes and Fc�RIIb. <b>Lower</b> <b>hinge</b> mutations caused large reductions in binding whereas modification of residues 327, 330 and 331 had less dramatic effects. However, like the wildtype IgG subclass binding hierarchies, {{the effect of the}} mutations varied between different receptors. We identified IgG 1 variants which react with the activating receptor, Fc�RIIa, at least 10 -fold less efficiently than wildtype IgG 1 but whose binding to the inhibitory receptor, Fc�RIIb, is only four-fold reduced. Manipulation of interactions with Fc�RIIb separately from those with activating receptors provides potential for designing antibodies with novel and effective combinations of attributes. In addition, insight is gained into the evolution of functional differences in human IgG subclasses...|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric bispecific {{antibodies}} are {{a rapidly}} expanding therapeutic antibody class, designed to recognize two different target epitopes concurrently to achieve novel functions not available with normal antibodies. Many therapeutic designs require antibodies with reduced or silenced effector function. Although many solutions {{have been described}} in the literature to knockout effector function, to date {{all of them have}} involved the use of a specific antibody subtype (e. g., IgG 2 or IgG 4), or symmetric mutations in the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> or CH 2 domain of traditional homodimeric monospecific antibodies. In the context of a heterodimeric Fc, we describe novel asymmetric Fc mutations with reduced or silenced effector function in this article. These heteromultimeric designs contain asymmetric charged mutations in the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> and the CH 2 domain of the Fc. Surface plasmon resonance showed that the designed mutations display much reduced binding to all of the Fc gamma receptors and C 1 q. Ex vivo ADCC and CDC assays showed a consistent reduction in activity. Differential scanning calorimetry showed increased thermal stability for some of the designs. Finally, the asymmetric nature of the introduced charged mutations allowed for separation of homodimeric impurities by ion exchange chromatography, providing, as an added benefit, a purification strategy for the production of bispecific antibodies with reduced or silenced effector function.

40|$|Natural IgG anti-F(ab') (2) Abs {{are part}} of the {{physiologic}} immune repertoire and have important immunoregulatory functions. Although previous work suggested that some of these Abs recognize epitopes located in the constant region of the F(ab') (2) molecule, an exact epitope mapping has not been performed. We found that the anti-F(ab') (2) Ab binds strongly to F(ab') (2) but only weakly to Fab fragments. Fab fragments are lacking the core and <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> region. In our experiments, we show that the IgG anti-F(ab') (2) Ab binds strongly to a synthetic double chain peptide (225 - 237 / 225 '- 237 ') comprising the core and <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> region of the human IgG 1 molecule. In contrast, it binds only weakly to the same peptide in monomeric form (225 - 237) or to a short double chain hinge peptide (225 - 232 / 225 '- 232 '). The double chain peptides comprise a cyclic region between the two cystine bridges and an exocyclic region. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance analyses showed that the cyclic portion of the short double chain hinge peptide adopts the same conformation as that found in the intact IgG 1 molecule. The dichroic properties of the short and long double chain hinge peptides indicate that they have identical conformations in their cyclic regions, but have different conformations in their exocyclic regions. The conformational differences in the exocyclic regions explain the binding of the Ab to the long double chain hinge peptide and the lack of binding to the short one. The circular dichroism spectrum of the monomeric hinge peptide, which is not recognized by the Ab, is consistent with the absence of an ordered peptide structure. These findings lead us to conclude that the IgG anti-F(ab') (2) Ab recognizes a conformational IgG 1 hinge epitope...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} {{have developed}} complex and diverse virulence mechanisms that weaken or disable the host immune defense system. IdeS (IgG-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes) is a secreted cysteine endopeptidase {{from the human}} pathogen S. pyogenes with an extraordinarily high degree of substrate specificity, catalyzing a single proteolytic cleavage at the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> of human IgG. This proteolytic degradation promotes inhibition of opsonophagocytosis and interferes with the killing of group A Streptococcus. We have determined the crystal structure of the catalytically inactive mutant IdeS-C 94 S by x-ray crystallography at 1. 9 -Å resolution. Despite negligible sequence homology to known proteinases, {{the core of the}} structure resembles the canonical papain fold although with major insertions and a distinct substrate-binding site. Therefore IdeS belongs to a unique family within the CA clan of cysteine proteinases. Based on analogy with inhibitor complexes of papain-like proteinases, we propose a model for substrate binding by IdeS...|$|E
30|$|The {{existing}} literature suggests several methods using available regional yields to price farm-level insurance. Botts and Boles (1958) assumed normal distribution of farm yields around the county average yield {{with a certain}} standard deviation. The method was challenged because of its normal distribution assumption (Nelson 1990) and constant deviation (Skees and Reed 1986). Also, the relationship between regional yield and individual farm yields is very complicated (Wang and Zhang 2003). There is some research on ratemaking with yield data {{of only a few}} years (Nelson 1990). However, short-term series data do not fully characterize crop yield risks (Coble et al. 2010). For example, farmers are required to report 4 – 10  years of individual yield records when buying actual production history (APH) products. However, the risk management agency (RMA) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) uses the reported yield records to estimate the expected yield, instead of the yield distribution of individual farms (Schnapp et al. 2000). Regional yields and short-term series of farm-level yields do not provide farm-level and long-term series information at the same time. So they cannot provide adequate input for ratemaking. Characteristic values carry more information than the same number of reported records by individual farms. For example, the extremes, the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>hinges</b> (quartiles), and the median of a set of data are conventionally used in the configuration of a box plot to convey the characteristics of a distribution of data values (Mcgill et al. 1978; Williamson et al. 1989).|$|R

40|$|Human anti-IgG hinge (HAH) autoantibodies {{constitute}} {{a class of}} immunoglobulins that recognize cryptic epitopes in the hinge region of antibodies exposed after proteolytic cleavage, but do not bind to the intact IgG counterpart. Detailed molecular characterizations of HAH autoantibodies suggest that they are, in some cases, distinct from natural autoantibodies that arise independent of antigenic challenge. Multiple studies have attempted to define the specificity of HAH autoantibodies, which were originally detected as binding to fragments possessing C-terminal amino acid residues exposed in either the upper or <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> regions of IgGs. Numerous investigators have provided information on the isotype profiles of the HAH autoantibodies, as well as correlations among protease cleavage patterns and HAH autoantibody reactivity. Several biological functions {{have been attributed to}} HAH autoantibodies, ranging from house-cleaning functions to an immunosuppressive role to restoring function to cleaved IgGs. In this review, we discuss both the historic and current literature regarding HAH autoantibodies in terms of their origins, specificity, and proposed biological relevance...|$|E
40|$|The endoglycosidase EndoS and the {{protease}} IdeS {{from the}} human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes are immunomodulating enzymes hydrolyzing human IgG. IdeS cleaves IgG in the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> region, while EndoS hydrolyzes the conserved N-linked glycan in the Fc region. Both enzymes are remarkably specific for human IgG that after hydrolysis loses most of its effector functions, such as binding to leukocytes and complement activation, all contributing to bacterial evasion of adaptive immunity. However, taken out of their infectious context, we and others have shown that IdeS and EndoS can alleviate autoimmune disease {{in a number of}} animal models of antibody-mediated disorders. In this chapter, we will briefly describe the discovery and characterization of these unique enzymes, present the findings from a number of animal models of autoimmunity where the enzymes have been tested, and outline the ongoing clinical testing of IdeS. Furthermore, we will discuss the rationale for further development of IdeS and EndoS into novel pharmaceuticals against diseases where IgG antibodies contribute to the pathology, including, but not restricted to, chronic and acute autoimmunity, transplant rejection, and antidrug antibody reactions...|$|E

30|$|Early studies {{defining}} key {{amino acid}} binding sites on IgGs for FcγRs were performed by mutational analyses, {{and it was}} determined that the <b>lower</b> <b>hinge</b> and proximal CH 2 regions were critical (Burton et al., 1988; Canfield and Morrison, 1991; Chappel et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1988; Hulett et al., 1994; Jefferis et al., 1990; Lund et al., 1991; Partridge et al., 1986; Shields et al., 2001; Tamm et al., 1996; Wines et al., 2000; Woof et al., 1986). Additionally, multiple co-crystal structures of human IgG 1 Fc with the low affinity FcγRs have allowed high resolution mapping of the binding interfaces. A recurrent finding among the low affinity FcγRs was that P 329 packs between two conserved tryptophan residues found in all of the FcγRs (Mimoto et al., 2013 b; Radaev et al., 2001; Ramsland et al., 2011; Sondermann et al., 2000)—an interaction termed the “proline sandwich”. More recently, there have been several reports of human IgG 1 Fc co-crystals with the high affinity FcγRI (Kiyoshi et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Oganesyan et al., 2015). A common feature among these structures was that a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of FcγRI well-accommodated L 235 on the Fc. Together, these mutational studies and crystal structures have resulted in a wealth of knowledge about how IgGs interact with their respective FcγRs.|$|E

40|$|Various {{native and}} hinge-modified forms of Ig with {{identical}} Ids were reacted with an anti-Id mAb, {{and the resultant}} immune complexes were analyzed by negative stain immunoelectron microscopy. Complexes were scored for their geometry (linear versus ring complexes) and size (dimer, trimer, etc.). Ring dimers are the thermodynamically most favorable configuration, unless inhibited by steric and/or flexibility constraints. We found ring dimerization to correlate with {{the length of the}} upper, but not middle or <b>lower,</b> <b>hinge.</b> In contrast, the geometry and size of complexes of those molecules lacking formal hinges were unpredictable. A hingeless IgG mutant and native IgE readily formed ring dimers. Remarkably, monomeric IgM formed more ring dimers {{than any of the other}} Igs tested, including IgG 3. We also tagged the Fab arms and measured the mean Fab-Fab angles and the degree of angular variation for each type of Ig. Surprisingly, IgM proved the most flexible by this assay. In hinged Igs, there was a correlation between length of the upper hinge and Fab-Fab flexibility. In contrast, we found no correlation between the mean Fab-Fab angle in uncomplexed Igs and their ability to dimerize with anti-Id mAb. These data suggest that the physicochemical methods typically used to evaluate molecular flexibility are often of low predictive value when tested in a functional assay.
