5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which <b>left</b> <b>more</b> {{than a dozen}} communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents.|$|E

Moderate damage was also reported on Palm Island and Carriacou and Petite Martinique. The winds <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than two-thirds of the island without power, and also damaged the island's banana crop. Damage in the country totaled $40million (2004USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|Between the hurricane's two landfalls, Dean {{affected}} {{an estimated}} 207,800people {{in the states}} of Quintana Roo, Campeche, Veracruz, Hildalgo, Puebla and Tabasco. The storm damaged 85miles (140km) of power lines and <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than 100,000people without electricity. Landslides, storm tides, and widespread structural damage combined to compromise water sources throughout the country. The extent of the damage was never calculated at a federal level, but hundreds of villages lost access to fresh water {{in the days following}} the storm. Hurricane Dean killed 12people in Mexico but none of the deaths occurred during its first and most powerful landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Between the two landfalls the storm caused a total of Mex$2billion (US$184million) of damages.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was also related to rough seas and occurred {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than 2,000without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25homes sustained damage, while portions of a few major roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008USD).|$|E
5|$|In late November, Typhoon Durian brought {{even greater}} devastation to the Philippines and {{prompted}} greater need for international assistance. On December11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1billion PHP (US$25.6million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000people and <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than US$1.6billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency {{assistance to the}} nation, {{in the form of}} US$46million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided €2million (US$1.9million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian. The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In pre-Columbian times, the Lees Ferry {{area was}} {{inhabited}} first by Paleo-Indians, who populated the region beginning about 11,500 years ago, {{followed by the}} Archaic culture, which appeared on the Colorado Plateau about 8,000 years ago. The Anasazi, Paiute and Navajo peoples, who <b>left</b> <b>more</b> evidence of habitation in the valley, arrived {{only in the last}} 1,000 years or so. Evidence, including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River, suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless, indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1528, Montejo left Conil {{for the city of}} Chauaca, which was {{abandoned}} by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness. The following morning the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, where they engaged in a major battle, which <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than 1,200 Maya dead. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo's party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party, and found that only 12 of his 40-strong garrison survived, while the entire garrison at Pole had been slaughtered.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 1970, some ethnic {{violence}} has persisted. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than 100people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to comments made by a newspaper reporter. Rioters in Kaduna killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.|$|E
5|$|The Mall was {{initially}} a huge success, but its popularity declined as new retail outlets in Little Rock drew customers away. Then {{the departure of}} its anchor stores, beginning with the bankruptcy of Montgomery Ward in 2001, <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than half the building empty. Throughout the 1990s, the mall steadily declined as retailers and customers left. Due to the waning popularity and litigation involving {{the deterioration of the}} building, the mall was sold in 2007 to Strode Property Company, and the remaining few tenants were told to vacate. Demolition began for the primary structure in early 2008. Prior to this, associated buildings were razed beginning in December 2007, starting with the former Montgomery Ward auto center, as well as the former JCPenney auto center, which had been used several years as an automotive maintenance facility for the City of Little Rock.|$|E

5|$|The Secret Speech, {{combined}} {{with the death of}} Polish communist leader Boleslaw Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances which <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than 50 dead in October 1956. When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw. While the Soviets were refused entry to the Polish Central Committee plenum where the election was taking place, they met with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} left 10,000people homeless across Puerto Rico, with 3,000 {{housed in}} emergency shelters in San Juan. At least 600 houses were destroyed and another 1,000 damaged. Damage was particularly severe in Barceloneta, Aibonito, and Coamo. Across the island, the depression affected at least 40state roads, with fifteen blocked by landslides, and eleven bridges destroyed. Flooding forced {{the closure of}} Puerto Rico Highway 2 between Manatí and Barceloneta. The depression <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than $40million (1970USD, $ USD) in crop damage, primarily to sugarcane and coffee, as reported by William R. Poage, {{the chair of the}} House Agricultural Committee. Throughout Puerto Rico, the depression caused damage estimated at $65million (1970USD, $ USD), as well as at least 18confirmed fatalities. A reported six months after the depression indicated there were 34people missing, although their status is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with record-breaking {{activity}} with four named storms, including two major hurricanes, developing {{by the end}} of June. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) values exceeded 300percent of the average for the month of June. Activity abruptly diminished thereafter, with July, August, and September seeing record low storm development. The Eastern Pacific season proper ended with Tropical Storm Georgette's dissipation on September23, a month before the climatological mean. The year's final cyclone, Omeka, developed in the off-season on December18, marking a record-late formation date in the satellite-era. Although there were relatively few storms, the season proved exceptionally deadly and destructive. Torrential rains associated with Agatha and Eleven-E killed well over 200people in Central America and Mexico and <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than $1.5billion in damage.|$|E

5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which <b>left</b> <b>more</b> than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E
