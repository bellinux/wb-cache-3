5|$|Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, fought Lance Hoyt in the following encounter. D'Amore interfered in the contest several times by distracting Hoyt, the referee, or aiding Roode in some way. Roode won the bout after performing his signature Northern <b>Lariat</b> maneuver at 7 minutes and 24 seconds. After the bout, Hoyt performed a backflip splash {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto a prone D'Amore in the ring.|$|E
5|$|Next, Tomohiro Ishii {{defended the}} NEVER Openweight Championship against Togi Makabe. Clotheslines, forearms, {{shoulder}} blocks, slaps, headbutts, sledgehammers, powerslams, powerbombs, and German suplexes were exchanged. Makabe won the match (and the title) with a running <b>lariat</b> and the King Kong Knee Drop {{from the top}} rope, followed by a pinfall at 12 minutes and 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Bobby Roode, who {{was accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, against Ron Killings. The duration of the match was 9 minutes and 53 seconds. Konnan interfered in the bout distracting Killings, which allowed Roode to sneak up behind Killings and {{hit him in the}} back of the head with Roode's signature Northern <b>Lariat</b> maneuver.|$|E

He would {{continue}} by teaming with Kensuke Sasaki against Kenta Kobashi {{and his own}} protégé Go Shiozaki in an inter-generation tag team match on November 5, 2005, with Sasaki pinning Shiozaki after a <b>lariat.</b> This match was rated 4 out of 5 stars by wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, one of only eight NOAH matches to receive that or a higher rating.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice <b>lariat</b> structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) next. Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting the referee. Around this time, Devon retrieved a table {{from under the}} ring which both teams used as a weapon, however the referee did not disqualify anyone for the usage. AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a <b>lariat</b> combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm. After this, Kim interfered trying to blow powder into Ray's eyes, only for Ray to stop her and blow it back into her and the referee's eyes. With the referee blinded, Team 3D performed their signature 3D maneuver on Harris and the referee counted the pin. Team Canada then attacked 3D, knocking out Ray in the process with a hockey stick. They placed Harris on top of Ray and left the ring. After the referee regained his vision, he declared AMW the victors at 12 minutes and 41 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis {{can be used to}} identify structural forms of RNA such as linear RNA, circular RNA, interlocked circles and <b>lariats.</b> The procedure is based upon the characteristic migration behaviour of the degradation products derived from the intact structures present already {{before the start of the}} experiment or formed during or after electrophoresis in the first dimension. After autoradiography to detect the positions of the radiolabeled RNA molecules, circles broken during electrophoresis of the first dimension give rise to horizontal lines touching the diagonal formed by linear RNAs at a point corresponding to the length of the RNA circle from which it was derived. Products derived from interlocked RNA circles by breakage after completion of the first dimension appear on a vertical line underneath the intact complex and consist of free RNA circles and their linear derivatives. Broken <b>lariats</b> give rise to two lines depending on the location of the break. <b>Lariats</b> with broken tails are present on a line to a position that corresponds to the length of their tail and that runs parallel to the diagonal formed by linear products. <b>Lariats</b> with a broken eye form a line running from the position of the intact product to the diagonal formed by the linear RNAs...|$|R
5|$|The Paul {{family moved}} to Lake Jackson, Texas, in 1968, where he was raised and where his father began a medical {{practice}} and for an extent of time was the only obstetrician in Brazoria County. When he was 13, his father {{was elected to the}} United States House of Representatives. That same year, Paul attended the 1976 Republican National Convention, where his father headed Ronald Reagan's Texas delegation. The younger Paul often spent summer vacations interning in his father's congressional office. In his teenage years, Paul studied the Austrian economists that his father respected, as well as the writings of Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand. Paul went to Brazoswood High School and was on the swimming team and played defensive back on the football team. Paul attended Baylor University from fall 1981to summer 1984 and was enrolled in the honors program. During the time he spent at Baylor, he was involved in the swim team and the Young Conservatives of Texas and {{was a member of a}} secret organization known as The NoZe Brotherhood. Paul also regularly contributed to The Baylor <b>Lariat</b> student newspaper. Paul dropped out of Baylor without completing his Bachelor's degree in either biology or English, when he was accepted into his father's alma mater, the Duke University School of Medicine. At the time, Duke did not require an undergraduate degree for admission to its graduate school. He earned an M.D. degree in 1988 and completed his residency in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a tag team match pitting Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon against WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart and The British Bulldog for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Hart and Furnas started the match as Furnas hit Owen with a <b>lariat</b> {{and a leg}} drop. Furnas tagged in with LaFon while Owen tagged in with Bulldog. He {{overpowered}} LaFon and then Owen and Bulldog took turns by tagging {{with each other and}} attacking LaFon. Smith did a pinfall attempt on LaFon but the referee was distracted by Owen. Owen continued to distract the referee as accidentally hit Bulldog with a <b>lariat.</b> Bulldog hit Owen with a <b>lariat</b> and the two argued as LaFon hit a splash on Owen from the top rope but Bulldog controlled LaFon. Despite that, LaFon tagged in with Furnas and then the challengers double-teamed Hart until Hart tagged in with Bulldog. Bulldog picked up LaFon and went for a running powerslam until Hart hit LaFon with his Slammy statuette. LaFon and Furnas won the match by disqualification, but the title does not change hands by DQ, so the titles remained with Hart and Bulldog.|$|E

25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to work long hours in the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a <b>lariat</b> (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse {{with one hand and}} use a <b>lariat</b> with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.|$|E

25|$|The modern Western saddle was {{developed}} from the Spanish saddles that were brought by the Spanish Conquistadors {{when they came to}} the Americas. These saddles were adapted to suit the needs of vaqueros and cowboys of Mexico, Texas and California, including the addition of a horn that allowed a <b>lariat</b> to be tied or dallied for the purpose of holding cattle and other livestock.|$|E
25|$|Roping {{includes}} {{a number of}} timed events {{that are based on}} the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult cattle for branding, medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or <b>lariat</b> is thrown over the head of a calf or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.|$|E

25|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature of western style riding {{is in the}} saddle, which has a substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a <b>lariat</b> after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to {{be attached to the}} saddle.|$|E
25|$|The U4,U5,U6 complex binds, and U6 {{replaces the}} U1 position. U1 and U4 leave. The {{remaining}} complex then performs two transesterification reactions. In the first transesterification, 5' {{end of the}} intron is cleaved from the upstream exon and joined to the branch site A by a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage. In the second transesterification, the 3' end of the intron is cleaved from the downstream exon, and the two exons are joined by a phosphodiester bond. The intron is then released in <b>lariat</b> form and degraded.|$|E

5000|$|Usually, intronic <b>lariats</b> (see above) are debranched {{and rapidly}} degraded. However, a {{debranching}} failure {{can lead to}} the formation of circular intronic long non-coding RNAs, also known as ciRNAs.
