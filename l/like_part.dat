40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze the {{correlation}} of the corporal “upper part” and “lowest part” as a cognitive basis of the Ukrainian substandard. This paper focuses on three major questions. First, how comparable structure “lowest <b>part</b> <b>like</b> upper part” constructs metaphor models of sexual slang and invective usage. The second goal was to consider the identification of “lowest part” and “upper part”. Our third aim was to define the comparable structure “upper <b>part</b> <b>like</b> lowest part”. Thus the famous theory of M. Bakhtin on the carnival nature of the corporal “upper part” and “lowest part” has been developed. The models “lowest <b>part</b> <b>like</b> upper part” and “lowest <b>part</b> <b>like</b> lowest part” are relevant for sexual slang. Three models “lowest <b>part</b> <b>like</b> upper part”, “upper <b>part</b> <b>like</b> lowest part”, “lowest <b>part</b> <b>like</b> lowest part” are relevant for invective usage and horse-play.

It was reoccupied by the military {{for the first time in}} over 400 years, with British and Canadian troops garrisoning it from May 1940, and Americans later.

The main and postern gates of the inner bailey were blocked by concrete and brick walls, and anti-tank cubes were installed along the areas where the Roman curtain wall had collapsed. The main concern was that an invader could have captured the castle and used its interior as a strongpoint.
