Following it, Rytas signed David Logan, who had been an EuroLeague star under the command of Tomas Pačėsas. On July 23, the front line was strengthened by athletic Kenny Kadji. On July 27, Adam Łapeta signed a new two-year contract. During the summer, team captain Kavaliauskas reportedly had disputes with the team management concerning pay.

On November 22, one of the Nigerian national team leaders Josh Akognon was signed as primary point guard. On December 9, Broadus was fired. On December 28, Clevin Hannah joined the team, along with Laimonas Kisielius. On January 21, Akognon left the team.|$|E

The newspaper writes that, [...] "according the spokesperson, the anonymous telephone voice also stated that the bomb would be transported from Helsinki to Frankfurt and onwards to New York on Pan-Am's flight to the US. The person transporting the bomb would not themselves be aware of it, with the explosives hidden in that person's luggage." [...] The same news article reports that the US Embassy in Moscow also received the same threat on 5 December, adding that Finland's foreign ministry has found no evidence in its investigations of any link to the Lockerbie crash.

The father, a grave, clerical person, with a white wig and black broadcloth suit; the son, with a cocked hat and laced clothes, drinking wine out of a glass, and caressing a woman in fashionable dress. At ------ a nice, comfortable boarding-house tavern, without a bar or any sort of wines or spirits. An old lady from Boston, with her three daughters, one of whom was teaching music, and the other two schoolmistresses. A frank, free, mirthful daughter of the landlady, about twenty-four years old, between whom and myself there immediately sprang up a flirtation, which made us both feel rather melancholy when we parted on Tuesday morning.

My aunt, as I say, was opposed to the venture. She holds the view that I am not a good man of business. In a sense, perhaps, she is right. Temperamentally, no doubt, I am more the artist.
