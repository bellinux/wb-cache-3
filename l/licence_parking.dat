40|$|This paper {{considers}} the second-best problem where not all links of a congested transportation network can be tolled. This paper builds on earlier work, {{in which the}} second-best tax rule for this problem was derived for general static networks, so that the solution presented is valid for any graph of the network, and for any set of tolling points available on that network. An algorithm is presented for finding second-best tolls, based on this general solution. A simulation model is used for studying its performance for various archetype pricing schemes: a toll-cordon, area <b>licences,</b> <b>parking</b> policies in the city centre, pricing of a single major highway, and pay-lanes and 'free-lanes' on major highways. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis is given of a method for selecting the optimal location of toll points when not all links can be tolled. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The Acquisition of Land Act 1967 (Qld) (‘the Act’) {{deals with}} the {{acquisition}} of land by the State for public purposes and provides for compensation. The issue that arose for determination in Sorrento Medical Service Pty Ltd v Chief Executive, Dept of Main Roads [2007] QCA 73 was whether the appellant was entitled to claim compensation under the Act in respect of land resumed by the Main Roads Department over which the appellant had an exclusive contractual <b>licence</b> for car <b>parking</b> spaces for use in association with a medical centre leased by the appellant. At first instance, it was held by the Land Court that the appellant was not entitled to compensation for the resumption of the car parking spaces. The basis for this decision by the Land Court was that a right to compensation only exists where resumption has taken some proprietary interest of the claimant in the land. Following {{an appeal to the}} Land Appeal Court being dismissed, the appellant instituted the present appeal to the Queensland Court of Appeal (McMurdo P, Holmes JA and Chesterman J) ...|$|R
50|$|Marks & Spencer, {{which was}} subleasing ‘The Point’ in Paddington Basin, W2 from BNP Paribas, claimed {{there should be}} an implied right to recover money that it had paid under its lease when it {{exercised}} the right to terminate. The basic rent was £919,800 a year, plus VAT, and a car <b>park</b> <b>licence</b> fee. The rent had to be paid by the quarter. The landlord could recover by rent a ‘fair proportion’ of building insurance costs and building service charges. Clause 8 allowed M&S to end the lease on 24 January 2012 with 6 months advance notice if there were no arrears in rent, and this meant the rent needed to be paid up {{to the end of the}} quarter, which was longer than the time M&S occupied the property. M&S did so, and then claimed it should get back the rent from 25 January to 24 March 2012. The default law on apportionability would have suggested the rent could not be recovered, under the Apportionment Act 1870, but it was argued that it was an implication of the contract that it should be.|$|R
