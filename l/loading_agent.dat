In order to investigate the influence of both PAA and DMAB on color formation, several concentrations of this water-soluble polymer (from 1 to 250 mM PAA) and reducing agent (from 0.033 to 6.66 mM DMAB) were prepared.

This yields a molar ratio between the protective and <b>loading</b> <b>agent</b> ([PAA]/[AgNO 3] ratio of 7.5 : 1. The final molar ratios between the reducing and loading agents ([DMAB]/[AgNO 3] ratio) were 1 : 100, 1 : 10 and 1 : 1.

Discoveries of Stone Age hafting adhesives at archaeological sites in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa have spurred experiments that sought to replicate or create models of such adhesives. Most of these studies, however, have been actualistic in design, focusing on replicating ancient applications of adhesive technology. In contrast, this study tested several glues based on Acacia resin within a materials science framework to better understand the effect of each adhesive ingredient on compound tool durability. Using an overlap joint as a model for a compound tool, adhesives formulated with loading agents from a range of particle sizes and mineral compositions were tested for toughness on smooth and rough substrates. Our results indicated that overlap joint toughness is significantly increased by using a roughened joint surface. Contrary to some previous studies, {{there was no evidence that}} particle size diversity in a <b>loading</b> <b>agent</b> improved adhesive effectiveness. Generally, glues containing quartz or ochre loading agents in the silt and clay-sized particle class yielded the toughest overlap joints, with the effect of particle size found to be more significant for rough rather than smooth substrate joints.

With this goal, an experimental matrix of results is generated by changing two parameters: the concentration of the protecting agent PAA (from 1 to 250 mM); and the different molar ratio between the reducing agent, dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) (concentration from 0.033 to 6.66 mM), and the <b>loading</b> <b>agent,</b> silver nitrate (AgNO 3) (at a fixed concentration of 3.33 mM). The experimental matrix is formed by 56 different combinations of protective agent concentration and ‘reducing agent/loading agent’ ratio. From these 56 combinations, a wide range of AgNPs can be obtained with different colors (yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, green, brown) and tunable shape and size. Henceforward, for the sake of simplicity, this experimental matrix will be named the multicolor silver map. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an experimental study based on the influence of both PAA and DMAB molar concentrations to obtain colored silver nanoparticles and clusters has been reported in the literature.|$|E

Mobile Ad-hoc network (MANET) has emerged as the self organized wireless interconnection for the various applications in random topology. However, achieving reliable multicast transmission in MANET is crucial due to the change in network topology caused by the node mobility. Wireless Networks are characterized by having specific requirements such as limited energy availability and reduced processing power. In this paper deals with the inability of the network to recover in case of failure networks, to reduce the maintenance overhead, increase the path stability, reducing the congestion in Mobile Ad-hoc network and with the inability of the network to recover in case of power problem in wireless network.

Among {{the variety of}} microgrid operations, the multi-agent system (MAS) has attracted considerable attention. In a microgrid with MAS, the agents installed on the microgrid components operate optimally by communicating with each other.
