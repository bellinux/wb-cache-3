5|$|In May 1940, the Directorate of Fortifications and Works (FW3) {{was set up}} at the War Office. Its {{purpose was}} to provide basic pillbox designs which could be {{constructed}} by soldiers and <b>local</b> <b>labour</b> at appropriate defensive locations. In the following June and July FW3 issued 6 basic designs for rifle and light machine gun pillboxes, designated Type 22 to Type 27. In addition, there were designs for gun emplacements suitable for either the Ordnance QF 2 pounder or the Hotchkiss 6 pounder gun (designated Type 28) and a design for a hardened medium machine gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the <b>local</b> <b>Labour</b> Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 Bessie and Jack {{moved to}} what would be their home for the {{remainder}} of their lives, a suburban semi-detached house in ZigZag Road, in Liverpool's West Derby district. They remained active members of Liverpool council, and in 1943 Jack became deputy leader of the Labour group. Two years later the Braddocks healed the rift with Hogan by proposing and seconding his appointment as the city's Lord Mayor for the year 1945–46; Jack succeeded him as leader of the Labour group on the council, a post he held until his death in 1963. Bessie became honorary president of the Liverpool Trades Council and Labour Party (LTCLP), the body that had been formed in 1921 when the Liverpool Trades Council merged with the newly formed <b>local</b> <b>Labour</b> Party to form a united labour front.|$|E
5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>labour</b> was {{supplied}} by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A {{week after the}} landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment {{found it difficult to}} lure the frightened local people in from the bush, but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began to walk in. ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed camps for the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|Students from Bristol University held {{a protest}} {{march to the}} bus station and the local {{headquarters}} of the TGWU on 1 May, which attracted heckling from bus crews as they passed through the city centre, according to the local press. Local MP Tony Benn contacted then Labour Opposition leader Harold Wilson, who spoke out against the colour bar at an Anti-Apartheid Movement rally in London. On 2 May <b>local</b> <b>Labour</b> Party Alderman Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the colour bar. On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the city council threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{construction}} industry in Malaysia has undergone many changes in order {{to compete in the}} age of globalization. High employment demand not only felt by the construction sector, but all sectors of the economy. Although the construction industry is facing the problem of lack of employment from the local, but the problem has been reduced by hiring foreign labour. In addition to lack of local employment, the construction sector is also facing problems related to <b>local</b> skill <b>labour.</b> Therefore, this study aims to look more closely at the problem of a shortage of <b>local</b> skilled <b>labour,</b> especially investigate the factors that may contribute to the shortage of <b>local</b> skilled <b>labour</b> in the Malaysian construction industry and also provide recommendation for increasing participation of <b>local</b> skilled <b>labour</b> in the Malaysian construction industry. The method of the study involved a literature review and also an interview with the respondent which consists of industry key player among Malaysian citizen that has been working in the construction industry involving engineers, contractors, project manager and others. In conclusion, the factors that may contribute to the shortage of <b>local</b> skilled <b>labour</b> are low assuredness of salary, poor career path, poor image of the industry and working environment and education level. On the other hand, the best ways to increase the participation of <b>local</b> skilled <b>labour</b> in the Malaysian construction industry are by commercialized the name of the skill training program, implement specific training, especially for local youth in enhancing their skill levels, the government gives support for smaller companies to train the local workforce, increasing the salary or wages of the local worker and last but not least minimizes the intake of foreign labor in the construction industry...|$|R
5|$|The Hamar-based {{newspaper}} Demokraten ("The Democrat") {{was started}} on 15 September 1909. The initiator and first editor was Olav Kringen, who had ample experience as {{the editor of}} Social-Demokraten from 1903 until 1906. Demokraten was the Labour Party organ for the Mjøsa Cities and Hedemarken, but in its first years it also covered Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen, two northern regions. The name Østoplandenes Socialistiske Partiblad was considered for the newspaper, but the historical name Demokraten prevailed. The name was suggested by <b>local</b> <b>Labour</b> MP Karl Amundsen. Demokratens coverage of Gudbrandsdalen soon ended, and in southern Østerdalen a new labour newspaper, Østerdalens Arbeiderblad, {{was set up in}} 1915. In northern Østerdalen, Arbeidets Rett was popular among the labour movement. According to reports in Demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of Gudbrandsdalen, namely the city Lillehammer, in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The main {{objection}} to this plan {{came from the}} independent traders who {{did not wish to}} relocate because they felt that the proposed new shopping area was 'off the beaten track'. This objection was not unreasonable, as in its pre-war topography Bristol had a long shopping axis that started at Stapleton Road to the east, passed through Old Market into Castle Street, Wine Street, and the City Markets, and then via The Centre and Park Street to Queens Road and Whiteladies Road. Moving the central shopping area would break this axis. There was also concern about the serious negative social and economic impacts of 'sterilising' such a large area in the centre of the city. However, when the Bristol Retail Traders Federation, representing the small traders, produced a poll showing that 13,000 people wished to retain the shopping centre on its current site whereas only 400 preferred to see it moved, the <b>local</b> <b>Labour</b> party dismissed the poll describing it as 'undemocratic' and comparing the Federation's methods to those of Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in other}} areas soon began to be felt. The method of {{government}} after the conquest {{can be described as}} a feudal system, in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance, called homage, they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour. Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support, and eventually the peasantry held land in return for <b>local</b> <b>labour</b> services, creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts. This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo-Saxon system of government. The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest, as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church. The more prosperous peasants, however, lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land more dependent on providing labour services to the local lord. They sank down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor or seek alternative employment.|$|E

25|$|The Kouilou, in {{addition}} to being a land of immigration, is also a land of emigration and expatriation during colonization.

25|$|The term harbour salvage {{refers to}} the salvage of vessels {{stranded}} or sunk in sheltered waters.

25|$|In those years, M'ba, {{a member}} of the Ligue, distanced himself from Roman Catholicism, but did not break {{completely}} with his faith. He instead became a follower of the Bwiti religious sect, which Fangs were particularly receptive to. He believed this would help revitalise a society which he felt had been damaged by the colonial administration. In 1931, the sect was accused of murdering a woman whose remains were discovered outside a market in Libreville. Accused of complicity, even though his involvement in the crime was not proven, M'ba was removed from power and sentenced to three years in prison and ten years of exile. Officially this was for embezzlement of tax revenues and his abusive treatment of the <b>local</b> <b>labour</b> force.|$|E
25|$|Hobart's {{first major}} {{problems}} {{came with the}} combination of a general economic downturn in the 1840s, followed by the Victorian gold rush of the early 1850s. Large-scale migration to the Victorian goldfields occurred, creating a shortfall in <b>local</b> <b>labour</b> resources. As a response, the once booming economy of Hobart began to decline. Despite the economic and population declines of the early 1850s, the decade proved to be one of social and cultural advancement for the young city. Transportation of convicts to Van Diemen's Land was abolished in 1853, and calls for responsible self-government were successful, with a new constitution drafted, and Van Diemen's Land became an independent British Colony in 1856. The new colony immediately changed its name to Tasmania, to disassociate itself with its past as a penal colony.|$|E
