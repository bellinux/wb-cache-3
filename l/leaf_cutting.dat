50|$|Most Sansevieria species seldom set seed, and {{commercial}} {{species such as}} Sansevieria trifasciata are typically grown using micropropagation. However, since S. pinguicula grows so slowly, micropropagation is unprofitable. Therefore, vegetative propagation by division or by <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> is the preferred method.|$|E
50|$|NAA is a {{synthetic}} plant hormone in the auxin family {{and is an}} ingredient in many commercial plant rooting horticultural products; it is a rooting agent and used for the vegetative propagation of plants from stem and <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting.</b> It is also used for plant tissue culture.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the asexual {{propagation}} of Psychotria viridis by <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings.</b> The treatments were: A - Whole <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings,</b> B - <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> with the top third cut off; C - with the lower third of the cuttings removed; D - with cuts on the primary vein of <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and E - poles with cuts on the leaf's secondary veins. The cuttings were immersed in distilled water {{for a period of}} 70 days. In all the treatments, the rooting was observed to occur in the region of the cut, or the place where the incision in the vein was. Current assay shows the feasibilities of Psychotria viridis leaf stalks and concludes that cuttings at the nerve ends highlight rooting in so far as the leaf stalks remain in permanent contact with the plant...|$|R

50|$|P. gigantea can be {{propagated}} by seed or by <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting.</b> The disadvantages to {{propagation by seed}} include {{slow growth}} {{and the use of}} a second flowering P. gigantea plant to obtain better seed set results.

50|$|Sansevieria can be {{propagated}} by seed, <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting,</b> and division. Seeds {{are rarely}} used, as plants can normally be grown much faster from cuttings or divisions. As many cultivars are periclinal chimeras they don't propagate true to type from leaf cuttings, and therefore must be propagated by rhizome division {{to retain the}} variegation.|$|E
50|$|Megachile rubi is {{a species}} of <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> bee in the family Megachilidae, found in the eastern United States. First {{described}} by Mitchell in 1924, it {{is placed in the}} subgenus Xeromegachile, members of which are most often found in sandy areas and have distinct preferences in the petals and leaves they use in their nests.|$|E
50|$|They can be {{propagated}} easily by separating offsets, {{but also}} by <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and by seed {{if they are not}} hybrids.|$|R
50|$|The plant rarely offsets, so most {{propagation}} is by seed, though <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{can also}} be rooted when larger leaves are used.|$|R
30|$|Begonia wuzhishanensis can {{be grown}} from seeds. Alternatively, they can be {{propagated}} by the elongate tubers or <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> with ease (FigureÂ  2 O).|$|R
50|$|Since {{the host}} plants contain {{poisonous}} latex, the caterpillar has evolved peculiar eating habits. It first chews the midrib of the <b>leaf,</b> <b>cutting</b> off the leaf's supply of latex {{and then goes}} on to nip a few of the secondary veins of the leaf, further blocking the flow of latex. Subsequently, the caterpillar feeds on the leaf but only where the leaf's natural defences have been turned off. The caterpillar is able to tolerate the plant toxins and stores it in its fatty tissue which helps make the adult distasteful to predators.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> is {{typically}} used once rosettes which have already flowered, {{in which case}} they and will no longer grow. Whole leaves can be cut from the rosette and set aside for several days to allow the cut to dry. At this point the leaf can be inserted cut-side down into moist porous potting medium to root. Over time, the leaf will produce roots and a stolon from the cut which will bear a new plant at its tip. Since variegation is produced through rare somatic mutations in the apical meristem, this is the preferred method for generating variegated specimens due to the volume of leaves which can be rooted simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} insect is {{probably}} the <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ant, but common sights are the termites with their innumerable termite hills covering the landscape, several species of spiders, wild bees, dung beetles, especially around the cattle ranches, enormous night moths, and the fireflies with their eerie nocturnal lights. One species of black spider lives in a compact group like a large ball during the daylight hours, their thick as fish line web stretching between large trees. At dusk the spiders scurry out from their cluster to take up positions on the long web and catch the nocturnal insects as they fly blindly to their fate.|$|E

50|$|Crassulas {{are usually}} {{propagated}} by stem or <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Most cultivated forms will tolerate some small degree of frost, but extremes of cold or heat will {{cause them to}} lose foliage and die.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} host of Melittoboa australica was Pison spinolae, however, the primary hosts are <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> bees Megachile spp, mason wasps and mud dauber wasps {{but it is}} catholic in its choice of hosts. There are no indigenous social wasps in Australia but in New Zealand and North America it has been recorded in the nests of Vespula species, as well as nests of Polistes, Bombus and honeybees Apis mellifera. The bombyliid fly Anthrax angularis and the ichneumonid Stenarella victoriae are parasites in the nests of Sceliphron spp and have been recorded as being viable hosts for M. australica. In addition, M. australica were found on dipteran puparia found in the nests of Sceliphron which {{are thought to be}} parasites on the spiders stocked in empty cells by the wasps.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Duroia species, and {{possibly}} all, {{are capable of}} biochemical interactions inhibiting the growth of neighbouring plants. Analysis of root extracts from Duroia hirsuta have yielded a strong plant growth inhibitor plumericin, a tetracyclic iridoid lactone. This process, common amongst plants, is termed allelopathy. In the case of Duroia hirsuta, the chemical inhibitor is aided by the leafcutter ant Myrmelachista schumanni resident on and in the tree, and playing {{an active role in}} suppressing and destroying plant growth in the vicinity of their host by injecting and spraying formic acid. The area around the understory species Duroia hirsuta is often devoid of all other plant types, leading to the local name 'Devil's garden'. The cost to the host plant for this protection is considerable, since the resident ants subject the tree to increased <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting.</b>|$|E
50|$|This process, common amongst plants, is termed allelopathy.

The area around this understory tree is often devoid of all other plant types, leading to the local name 'Devil's garden'. The cost to the host plant for this protection is considerable, since the resident ants subject the tree to increased <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting.</b> Trees that grow outside the cleared area often have the living tissues of their trunks excavated and galled for ant accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Crassula nudicaulis {{is easy to}} grow as a potplant in a gravelly medium. Mealy {{bugs and}} fungal {{diseases}} can cause problems, and over-watering should be avoided. Propagation is by division, offsets or <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most begonias {{are easily}} {{propagated}} by division or from stem cuttings. In addition, many can be propagated from <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> or even sections of leaves, particularly {{the members of}} the rhizomatous and rex groups.|$|R
50|$|Propagation {{is usually}} either by seed or <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Some species produce plantlets from the roots, {{which can be}} used to {{propagate}} the plant. Mature clumps of plants can also be divided up and repotted.|$|R
5000|$|In a wide sense, {{methods of}} {{vegetative}} propagation include cutting, vegetative apomixis, layering, division, budding, grafting and tissue culture. Cutting {{is the most}} common artificial vegetative propagation method, where pieces of the [...] "parent" [...] plant are removed and placed in a suitable environment so that they can grow into a whole new plant, the [...] "clone", which is genetically identical to the parent. Cutting exploits the ability of plants to grow adventitious roots (i.e. root material that can generate from a location other than the existing or primary root system, as in from a leaf or cut stem) under certain conditions.Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method. However, there are several cases where vegetatively propagated plants are not genetically identical. Root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny. Similarly, <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants, such as snake plant (Sansevieria trifasciata), will produce mainly nonvariegated plants.Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones.Apomixis (including apospory and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilisation. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are involved, or plantlets that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some citrus (Citrus) and many grasses such as Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.|$|E
5000|$|Social insects {{have evolved}} {{an array of}} {{sanitary}} behaviours to keep their nests clean, thereby reducing the probability of parasite establishment and spread within the colony. Such behaviours can be employed either prophylactically, or actively, upon demand. For example, social insects can incorporate materials with antimicrobial properties into their nest, such as conifer resin, or faecal pellets that contain symbiont derived antimicrobials. These materials reduce the growth and density of many detrimental bacteria and fungi. Antimicrobial substances can also be self-produced. Secretions from the metapleural glands of ants and volatile chemical components produced by termites {{have been shown to}} inhibit fungal germination and growth. Another important component of nest hygiene is waste management, which involves strict spatial separation of clean nest areas and waste dumps. Social insect colonies often deposit their waste outside of the nest, or in special compartments, including waste chambers for food leftovers, âtoiletsâ for defecation and âgraveyardsâ, where dead individuals are deposited, reducing the probability of parasite transmission from potentially infected cadavers. Where social insects place their waste is also important. For example, <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ants living in xeric conditions deposit their waste outside the nest, whilst species living in the tropics tend to keep it in special chambers within the nest. It has been proposed that this difference is related to the likelihood that the external environment reduces or enhances microbial growth. For xeric-living ants, placing waste outside will tend to inhibit infectious material, as microbes are usually killed under hot, dry conditions. On the other hand, placing waste into warm, humid environments will promote microbial growth and disease transmission, so it may be safer for ants living in the topics to contain their waste within the nest. Honeybees have evolved the ability to actively maintain a constant temperature within their hives to ensure optimal brood development. Upon exposure to Ascoshpaera apis, a heat sensitive fungal pathogen that causes chalk brood, honeybees increase the temperature of the brood combs, thereby creating conditions that disfavour the growth of the pathogen. This [...] "social fever" [...] is performed before symptoms of the disease are expressed and can therefore be viewed as a preventative measure to avoid chalk brood outbreaks in the colony.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of extent usage of rice for human and livestock simultaneously was studied. The experiment consisted of four varieties namely Latishail, BR 10, BR 11 and BRRIdhan 32 and four leaf cuttings viz., no leaf cutting(T 1), <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> at 21 DAT(T 2), <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> at 28 DAT(T 3), <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> at 35 DAT(T 4). The effect of <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> was significant on growth parameters namely plant height, {{total number of}} tillers and leaves hill 1 at different days after transplanting. In respect of all studied varieties, the highest plant height, total tillers hill 1, productive tillers hill 1, non bearing tillers hill 1, panicle length, grains panicle 1, sterile spikelets panicle 1,grain yield, straw yield, cumulative straw yield, biological yield and harvest index were obtained in no <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> (control). The yield and yield contributing characters decreased by <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> as compared to control. The results revealed that among the varieties and the different <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> treatments, Latishail <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> at 35 DAT gave the significantly higher forage yield. The highest grain yield was obtained in no <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> which was statistically identical to <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> at 21 and 28 DAT. It may be concluded that <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> at early stage of crop growth could produce almost similar grain or seed yield of control crops with the additional forage yield...|$|E

O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a propagaÃ§Ã£o assexuada de chacrona (Psychotria viridis) por meio de estacas foliares. Os tratamentos foram: A - estacas foliares inteiras; B - estacas foliares com o terÃ§o superior cortado; C â com o terÃ§o inferior das estacas retirado; D â com cortes sobre a nervura primÃ¡ria das estacas foliares; e E - estacas com cortes sobre as nervuras secundÃ¡rias das folhas. As estacas foram imersas em Ã¡gua destilada durante um perÃ­odo de 70 dias. Em todos os tratamentos foi observado que o enraizamento ocorreu na regiÃ£o do corte, ou no local onde ocorreu a incisÃ£o na nervura.

40|$|The {{effect of}} rice <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> on the {{production}} of green fodder, hay and seed yield of BR 10 rice was evaluated. Tallest plant, maximum number of non-effective tillers hill - 1, longest panicle, maximum seed panicle - 1 and highest seed yield were obtained from without <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> when the crop was transplanted using two seedlings hill 1 with plant spacing 25 x 15 cm 2. Whereas <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> treatment having two seedlings hill 1 with spacing 25 x 15 cm 2 produced {{the highest number of}} effective tillers hill - 1. Spacing 25 x 10 cm 2 also produced statistically identical seed yield ha 1 with no cutting treatment having two seedlings hill 1 with 25 x 15 cm 2. The highest forage yield and dry matter yield of forage were observed from <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> treatment of six seedlings hill 1 with spacing 25 x 10 cm 2. The highest cumulative hay yield was found in cutting treatment, two seedlings hill 1 with spacing 25 x 20 cm 2 which was statistically similar to six seedlings hill 1 with spacing 15 x 10 cm 2. Average forage yield was 2. 81 t ha - 1. It is possible to harvest rice forage from transplant aman rice like BR 10 without decreasing grain or seed yield and length of <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> may be up to 10 cm at vegetative growth stage...|$|E
40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ants are {{member of}} a multitrophic system. They are {{cultivating}} the garden fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, which serves them as major food source. This mutualistic symbiosis is threatened by several pathogens. The ants are therefore defending their colony by removing any suspicious material from the fungus garden into waste chambers and additionally by using chemical arms. Beside their own antimicrobial metabolites, symbiotic Actinomyces are supporting this survival conflict with their antibiotics. It became evident, that complex microbial communities {{are part of the}} whole live style of <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ants. Beside their mutualistic role, the involved microorganisms pursue selfish interests by using secondary metabolites to hinder other competing symbionts of the <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ants. A new method to easily identify microbial chemicals involved in <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> antsâ ecosystems has been established. Antimycins, actinomycins and valinomycins were identified. The potential of some of these antibiotics to shape the complex microbial communities present in the antsâ nest has been tested. Beside pathogens also Actinomyces-symbionts and the garden fungus were inhibited. For the first time it was possible to directly detect known antibiotics in the waste material and on the cuticle of Acromyrmex ants. A plasmid for future investigations on the uptake of Actinomyces by <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ants has been constructed. Feeding studies with labeled compounds helped to investigate the biosynthesis of the 3 -aminosalicylic acid-unit of the antimycins which apparently involves a shift of the carboxyl group of the anthranilic acid. Additionally it was shown that the antimycins already decompose under weak alkaline conditions, generating Î³-butyrolactones...|$|E
40|$|There {{is great}} {{difficulty}} to improve techniques of {{integrated pest management}} of <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ants, mainly when found outside of, but near to, forest plantations. This work aims to characterize aspects such as nest size and foraging distance from eucalypt plantations. Studies were performed near forest plantations in the counties of JoÃ£o Pinheiro and Buritizeiro, in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Six months before, all <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ant nests received chemical control with sulfluramid baits. Nine nests were located outside the eucalypt plantations. Nest area was 62. 5 Â± 11. 1 m 2 and nests were located 33. 94 Â± 8. 68 m from plantation boundary. Such characteristics {{may be useful to}} fix the boundary range used to control <b>leaf</b> <b>cutting</b> ant mounds outside the eucalypt plantation. Results show that boundary range should be 50 m wide. Acromyrmex sp. is a new occurrence for both Buritizeiro and JoÃ£o Pinheiro counties, but Atta laevigata, Atta sexdens rubropilosa and Trachymyrmex sp. are new occurrences for Buritizeiro only...|$|E

40|$|Single-node <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> from {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) cvs. Norland, Superior, Norchip, and Kennebec, {{were used}} to assess tuber induction in plants grown under 12, 16, and 20 h daily irradiation (400 micromol s- 1 m- 2 PPF). <b>Leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> were taken from plants at four, six and 15 weeks after planting and cultured for 14 d in sand trays in humid environments. Tuber induction was determined by visually rating the type of growth at the attached axillary bud, and by measuring the accumulation of the major tuber protein, patatin, in the base of the petioles. Axillary buds from <b>leaf</b> <b>cuttings</b> of plants grown under the 12 h photoperiod consistently formed round, sessile tubers at the axils for all four cultivars at all harvests. Buds from cuttings of plants grown under the 16 and 20 h photoperiods exhibited mixed tuber, stolon, and leafy shoot growth. Patatin accumulation was highest in petioles of cuttings taken from 12 h plants for all cultivars at all harvests, with levels in 16 and 20 h cuttings approx. one-half that of the 12 h cuttings.
