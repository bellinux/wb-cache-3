25|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Mayweather {{connected}} {{with a series of}} straight rights and lefts; when N'dou would not go down, Mayweather gave a <b>little</b> <b>smile</b> and continued the barrage. He dominated his opponent, before flooring him with a series of rights in the seventh round. N'dou got up on shaky legs, forcing a stoppage at 1:50. At times during the fight, Mayweather (in black trunks outlined with fur) seemed to toy with N'dou. By the end of 2003, Mayweather was still The Ring's lightweight champion and the #5-ranked best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.|$|E
500|$|Its humorous {{style and}} sexual innuendos {{influenced}} City Hunter, and Shinichirō Watanabe's works Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy owe their nostalgic appearance and the ironic tone, respectively, to Cobra. Cobra's [...] "provoking look", ironic style and capacity of changing from a <b>little</b> <b>smile</b> {{to a serious}} face also inspired video game designer Hideki Kamiya to create the character of Dante from the Devil May Cry series.|$|E
500|$|Billiards {{champion}} Tex Zimmerman (Cochran's {{partner in}} the 924 Club) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty {{had a hand in}} organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88 and 96pounds. and standing 5feet tall—just about the height of a standard cue stick. McGoorty later mused: [...] "Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a <b>little</b> <b>smile,</b> and everybody loved her." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ramones were {{inducted}} into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007. That October saw {{the release of a}} DVD set containing concert footage of the band: It's Alive 1974-1996 includes 118 songs from 33 performances over the span of the group's career. In February 2011 the group was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Drummers Tommy, Marky, and Richie attended the ceremony. Marky declared, [...] "This is amazing. I never expected this. I'm sure Johnny, Joey, and Dee Dee would never have expected this." [...] Richie noted that {{it was the first time}} ever that all three drummers were under the same roof, and mused that he couldn't [...] "help thinking that [...] is watching us right now with a <b>little</b> <b>smile</b> on his face behind his rose-colored glasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{associated}} with a motley group of people and began using heroin, to Kortchmar's dismay, and wrote the [...] "Paint It Black"–influenced [...] "Rainy Day Man" [...] to depict his drug experience. In a late 1966 hasty recording session, the group cut a single, Taylor's [...] "Night Owl," [...] backed with his [...] "Brighten Your Night with My Day". Released on Jay Gee Records, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, it received some radio airplay in the Northeast, but only charted at #102 nationally. Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined {{to go forward with}} an album. After a series of poorly-chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in Freeport, Bahamas for which they were never paid, the Flying Machine broke up. (A UK band with the same name emerged in 1969 with the hit song [...] "Smile a <b>Little</b> <b>Smile</b> for Me". The New York band's recordings were later released in 1971 as James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine.) ...|$|E
