5|$|The longer {{tank gun}} has been {{retrofitted}} into the <b>Leopard</b> 2, creating a model {{known as the}} <b>Leopard</b> 2A6. Both the Spanish <b>Leopard</b> 2E and the Greek <b>Leopard</b> 2HEL, as derivatives of the <b>Leopard</b> 2A6, use the 55 caliber-long tank gun.|$|E
5|$|This gun was {{retrofitted}} into German and Dutch <b>Leopard</b> 2s, and {{chosen as}} the main gun of the Spanish <b>Leopard</b> 2E and the Greek <b>Leopard</b> 2HEL. It was tested on the British Challenger 2 as a potential replacement for its current weapon, the rifled L30 120mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|After sailing {{for some}} hours, <b>Leopard,</b> {{commanded}} by Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, approached Chesapeake and hailed {{a request to}} deliver dispatches to England, a customary request of the time. When a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order, given by Vice-Admiral George Berkeley of the Royal Navy, which instructed the British ships to stop and board Chesapeake to search for deserters. Barron refused to allow this search, and as the lieutenant returned to <b>Leopard</b> Barron ordered the crew to general quarters. Shortly afterward <b>Leopard</b> hailed Chesapeake; Barron could not understand the message. <b>Leopard</b> fired a shot across the bow, followed by a broadside, at Chesapeake. For fifteen minutes, while Chesapeake attempted to arm herself, <b>Leopard</b> continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron struck his colors. Chesapeake only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on deck to ignite the cannon. The British boarded Chesapeake and carried off four crewmen, declining Barron's offer that Chesapeake {{be taken as a}} prize of war. Chesapeake had three sailors killed and Barron was among the 18wounded.|$|E
5000|$|While lions passant guardant (i.e. {{walking with}} head turned to full face) are often called <b>leopards</b> in heraldry, the heads and faces of natural <b>leopards</b> occur {{frequently}} in armory, as crests {{as well as}} charges. The key distinction being that a <b>leopard's</b> head shows the neck, the <b>leopard's</b> face (turned affronté and cut off cleanly behind the ears) occurs far more frequently. A curious development, unique to the <b>leopard's</b> face, is when it is run through with a fleur-de-lis, called a <b>leopard's</b> face jessant-de-lis. [...] When {{the face of a}} fox is shown (i.e. cabossed), it is termed a fox's mask.|$|R

50|$|As {{urban areas}} expanded, the natural {{habitats}} of <b>leopards</b> shrunk resulting in <b>leopards</b> venturing into urbanized areas due to easy access of domestic food sources.Karnataka {{has a high}} number of such conflicts.In recent years, <b>leopards</b> were sighted in Bangalore, and the forest department captured six <b>leopards</b> in the city's outskirts, relocated four of them to various other locations.|$|R
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German <b>Leopard</b> 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The <b>Leopard</b> was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight <b>Leopard</b> 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five <b>Leopard</b> 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the <b>Leopard</b> AS1, and were based on the <b>Leopard</b> 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5|$|<b>Leopard</b> is {{the only}} {{stallion}} imported prior to 1888 who left known purebred descendants in America. In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert-bred Arabian mare *Naomi, and bred her to <b>Leopard,</b> producing Leopard's only purebred Arabian son, Anazeh, who sired eight purebred Arabian foals, four of whom still appear in pedigrees today.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Leopard</b> 2E or <b>Leopard</b> 2A6E (E {{stands for}} España, Spanish for Spain) is {{a variant of}} the German <b>Leopard</b> 2 main battle tank, {{tailored}} to the requirements of the Spanish army, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named Programa Coraza, or Program Breastplate. The acquisition program for the Leopard2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 <b>Leopard</b> 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of the <b>Leopard</b> 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.|$|E

50|$|<b>Leopards</b> are {{generally}} most active between sunset and sunrise, and kill more prey at this time. In Kruger National Park, male <b>leopards</b> and female <b>leopards</b> with cubs were relatively more active at night than solitary females. The {{highest rates of}} daytime activity were recorded for <b>leopards</b> using thorn thickets during the wet season, when impala also used them.|$|R
50|$|This {{was not the}} end though, as in 2004 {{a merger}} took place between Ware Rebels and <b>Leopards</b> Alive (an {{organisation}} of supporters of the defunct Greater London <b>Leopards),</b> and renamed as the Essex & Herts <b>Leopards.</b> In 2006, the team was renamed again to London <b>Leopards,</b> and currently play in EBL Division 1, the league below the BBL.|$|R
5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, <b>leopard,</b> jaguar, snow <b>leopard,</b> and clouded <b>leopard</b> share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded <b>leopard</b> (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert tortoises, diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, Gila monsters, short-horned lizards, spiny lizards, and zebra-tailed lizards. Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland <b>leopard</b> frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the <b>leopard</b> frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona Game and Fish Department lists the lowland <b>leopard</b> frog as a species of special concern.|$|E
5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The Awful Truth. The tame <b>leopard</b> Baby and the escaped circus <b>leopard</b> were both {{played by a}} trained <b>leopard,</b> Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the <b>leopard,</b> but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy <b>leopard</b> through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live <b>leopard,</b> and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E

50|$|Essex <b>Leopards</b> is a British {{basketball}} team who competes in the English Basketball League Division 1. The team {{was established in}} 1997 as Ware Fire, but following the demise and eventual closure of the former British Basketball League franchise Essex <b>Leopards</b> in 2003, a supporters group known as 'Leopards Alive' merged with the Ware-based club and rebranded the team as Essex & Herts <b>Leopards</b> in 2004. The team was renamed again in 2006 to London <b>Leopards</b> and following a merge with Barking Abbey Basketball Academy in 2010, a BA prefix was added to reflect this. In 2012, the club was rebranded as Essex <b>Leopards.</b> From 2015 onward the Essex <b>Leopards</b> were rebranded as the Levett Essex <b>Leopards</b> after agreeing a long term sponsorship deal with Local Essex and London IT business Levett Consultancy Ltd.|$|R
50|$|In similar fashion, {{following}} {{the demise of}} the <b>Leopards</b> in 2003, fans set up a new club to replace and carry on the <b>Leopards</b> name. The reincarnated London <b>Leopards</b> today compete in the second-tier English Basketball League.|$|R
5|$|The tiger's closest living {{relatives}} were previously {{thought to be}} the lion, <b>leopard</b> and jaguar, all of which are classified under the genus Panthera. Genetic analysis indicates that the tiger and the snow <b>leopard</b> diverged from the other Panthera species about 2.88 million years ago, and that both species may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, <b>leopard</b> and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male <b>leopard</b> dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young <b>leopard</b> in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the <b>leopard.</b>|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the <b>leopard</b> shark has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small <b>leopard</b> sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a <b>leopard</b> shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E
5|$|Hawks {{obtained}} character actors Charlie Ruggles on {{loan from}} Paramount Pictures for Major Horace Applegate and Barry Fitzgerald {{on loan from}} The Mary Pickford Corporation to play gardener Aloysius Gogarty. Hawks cast Virginia Walker as Alice Swallow, David's fiancée; Walker was under contract to him and later married his brother William Hawks. As Hawks {{could not find a}} panther that would work for the film, Baby was changed to a <b>leopard</b> so they could cast the trained <b>leopard</b> Nissa, who had worked in films for eight years, making several B-movies.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The <b>leopard</b> seal {{is known}} to prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. <b>Leopard</b> seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed <b>leopard</b> seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic <b>leopard</b> complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and <b>leopard</b> patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|<b>Leopard</b> {{spent much}} of her career in the main Austro-Hungarian fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, and took part in an {{international}} naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 in an attempt to limit the Greco-Turkish War. From 1900, <b>Leopard</b> made two major overseas deployments, including a tour of the Pacific Ocean in 19001901, and a stint in the East Asia squadron in 19071909. Upon returning to Austria-Hungary, the ship was modernized in 1910 and then decommissioned in May 1914, shortly before the start of World War I in July. The ship was immediately reactivated and stationed in Pola as a guard ship, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} conflict. After Austria-Hungary's defeat, <b>Leopard</b> was ceded to Britain as a war prize and sold to ship breakers in Italy in 1920.|$|E
