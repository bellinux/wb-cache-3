5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other {{components of the}} vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital <b>language</b> <b>disorder</b> if affected by mutations.|$|E
25|$|Category {{specific}} impairments {{can result}} in widespread, patchy damage or localized damage. Category specific impairments {{can be broken down}} into four categories. Perceptual and functional features, topographic organization, informativeness and intercorrelations are areas of decreased functioning in disorders of semantic memory (Warrington and Shallice, 1984). Alzheimer's disease is a semantic memory disorder that results in errors describing and naming objects, though not necessarily category-specific. Semantic dementia is another disorder associated with semantic memory. Semantic dementia is a <b>language</b> <b>disorder</b> characterized by a deterioration in understanding and recognizing words. Impairments include difficulty in generating familiar words, difficulty naming objects and difficulties with visual recognition. Research suggests that the temporal lobe might be responsible for category specific impairments of semantic memory disorders. In addition to category specific impairments, modality specific impairments are included in disorders of semantic memory (Cohen et al. 2002).|$|E
25|$|In all {{of these}} ways, TSA {{is very similar to}} a more {{commonly}} known <b>language</b> <b>disorder,</b> receptive aphasia. However, transcortical sensory aphasia differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit echolalia, or the compulsive repetition of words. Transcortical sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that {{it is very difficult to}} perform systematic studies.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the motor profile of 125 children with developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> and to test for differences, if any, in motor profile among subgroups of children with developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders.</b> METHODS. The participants were 125 children with developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> aged 6 to 9 years from 2 special schools for children with communication problems in the northern Netherlands. They were tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. The children were classified by the schools' speech and language therapists into 3 subgroups on the basis of language tests, oral motor tests, and clinical examinations: children with speech disorders (n = 14), <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> (n = 46), or both (n = 65). RESULTS. Compared with the norms of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, children with developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> performed significantly less well. Results showed that 51 % of the children with developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> had borderline or definite motor problems. Children with <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> had significantly lower scores (ie, better performance) on the ball-skills subtest and the total test than children with speech disorders and children with both speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders.</b> Furthermore, children with <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> had significantly better performance on the balance subtest than children with both speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders.</b> CONCLUSIONS. The findings of this study support the idea that developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> are frequently associated with motor problems and that the kind of developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> affects motor performance differently. Speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> seem to have more impact on motor performance than only <b>language</b> <b>disorders,</b> and it seems that when speech production is affected, motor problems are more pronounced. The findings support the need to give early and more attention to the motor skills of children with developmental speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> in the educational and home setting, with special attention to children whose speech is affected...|$|R

40|$|Analogical {{reasoning}} {{is a human}} ability that maps systems of relations. It develops along with relational knowledge, working memory and executive functions such as inhibition. It also maintains a mutual influence on language development. Some authors have taken a greater interest in the analogical reasoning ability of children with <b>language</b> <b>disorders,</b> specifically those with specific language impairment (SLI). These children apparently have weaker analogical reasoning abilities than their aged-matched peers without <b>language</b> <b>disorders.</b> Following cognitive theories of language acquisition, this deficit {{could be one of}} the causes of <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> in SLI, especially those concerning productivity. To confirm this deficit and its link to <b>language</b> <b>disorders,</b> we use a scene analogy task to evaluate the analogical performance of SLI children and compare them to controls of the same age and linguistic abilities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, I {{share my}} {{thoughts}} concern-ing what children with developmental <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> should be called, {{how they should}} be defined, and how we might differentiate children with specific language impairment (SLI) from other children with developmental <b>language</b> <b>disorders.</b> Among other things, I attempt to show why a lack of congruence between clinical and research constructs should be expected. Researchers and clinicians use different identification criterion and procedures because clinical and educa-tional objectives are different from research objectives. While recognizing these differences, I suggest several possible ways to differentiate a subgroup of children with SLI {{from the general population}} of children with developmental <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> without using nonver-bal IQ. Even if researchers are able to identify this unique group of children, clinicians may never embrace the SLI construct. In {{the best of all possible}} worlds, clinicians would be familiar with how researchers define SLI and appreci-ate the value of research that attempts to identify distinct subgroups of children with developmental <b>language</b> <b>disorders.</b> Researchers, in this ideal world, would recognize and acknowledge the lack of congruence between the research populations of SLI and the larger clinical population of children with developmental <b>language</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> {{are among the}} most prevalent childhood disabilities in many countries. Identification and intervention for children with communication disorders are sought at an early stage, to avoid the consequences of untreated childhood speech and language problems that can lead to academic underachievement and even persist into adulthood. However, no study has been reported on the prevalence of speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> in the general population in Cameroon. Despite the published literature on the national burden of disease suggesting that a significant number of Cameroonian children might have limitations in their speech and language abilities. This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders,</b> specifically, articulation, expressive language, receptive language, fluency and voice disorders; in a representative sample of French-speaking preschool children in Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon. A total of 460 children aged 3 to 5 years were recruited from the seven communes of Yaoundé city using multi-stage random sampling method. As there was no validated speech and language test available for the population of French-speaking preschool aged children in Cameroon, this study has contributed in its first part, to provide norms on three subtests of a standardised French speech and language test, the 'Evaluation du Langage Oral' (ELO) for this population. These norms can be used for clinical practice and research purpose in Cameroon. In order to determine the prevalence of articulation, expressive and receptive <b>language</b> <b>disorders,</b> a cut-off of two Standard Deviations (SD) below the normative mean was applied. The identification of fluency and voice disorders among participants was based on clinical judgement. All the assessments were performed by the researcher who is a qualified speech-language therapist with experience of practice in Cameroon. The findings indicated that the prevalence of articulation disorders was 3. 6 %, expressive <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> was 1. 3 %, receptive <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> was 3 %, fluency disorders was 8. 4 % and voice disorders was 3. 6 %. The overall prevalence of speech disorders was 14. 7 %, <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> 4. 3 % and speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> 17. 1 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> according to gender. The prevalence of speech and <b>language</b> <b>disorders</b> in the present study was higher than that of many previous investigations conducted in other countries. The findings of this research reveals and emphasises the urgent need to build a strategy to develop speech and language services to serve the Cameroonian population...|$|R
