5000|$|If the dataset is unblocked, that is, the <b>logical</b> <b>record</b> <b>length</b> (LRECL) {{is equal}} to the {{physical}} block size (BLKSIZE), BSAM may be utilized to simulate a directly accessed dataset using [...] and [...] on any supported direct access device type (DEVD=DA), and some primitive applications were designed in this way.|$|E
50|$|DLGs are {{available}} in two different formats: optional format, a simple-to-use format that incorporates an 80-byte <b>logical</b> <b>record</b> <b>length,</b> the UTM ground coordinate system, and topology linkages contained in line, node and area elements; and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) format, a format that facilitates transferring of spatial data between different computer systems.|$|E
50|$|Data on CMS is {{structured}} in <b>logical</b> <b>records</b> {{rather than a}} stream of bytes. For textual data a line of text corresponds to a <b>logical</b> <b>record.</b> In CMS Pipelines the data is passed between the stages as <b>logical</b> <b>records.</b>|$|R
50|$|IBM {{refers to}} the data records programmers work with as <b>logical</b> <b>records,</b> and the format on disc as blocks or {{physical}} records. One block might contain several <b>logical</b> (or user) <b>records</b> or, in some schemes, partial <b>logical</b> <b>records.</b>|$|R
50|$|QSAM is—as {{its name}} says—queued, in this {{specific}} context meaning buffered with deblocking of reads and blocking of writes. It allows programs {{to read and}} write <b>logical</b> <b>records</b> within physical blocks of data, as opposed to the less advanced basic sequential access method (BSAM) which allows programs to access physical blocks of data, but provides no support for accessing <b>logical</b> <b>records</b> within blocks.|$|R
50|$|An {{example is}} the BLKSIZE= variable, which may be (and usually is) {{specified}} in the DCB as zero. In the DD statement, the BLKSIZE is specified as a non-zero value and this, then, results in a program-specified LRECL (<b>logical</b> <b>record</b> <b>length)</b> and a JCL-specified BLKSIZE (physical block size), with the merge of the two becoming the permanent definition of the dataset.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Time-multiplexing of a single-shot {{interferometric}} measurement technique using frequency-to-time mapping and digital coherent detection characterizes the amplitude and phase of 350 -GHz bandwidth waveforms with a 3 -µs <b>record</b> <b>length</b> in only 113 µs. OCIS codes: (320. 7100) Ultrafast measurements; (070. 6020) Continuous optical signal processing. Amplitude and phase (i. e., full-field) measurements of complex ultrafast optical waveforms with long <b>record</b> <b>lengths</b> (> 0. 1 µs) and picosecond resolution {{is necessary for}} many applications including telecommunications, physics, and chemistry. Wide-bandwidth measurement techniques, such as spectral interferometry (SI) and frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), have sub-ns <b>record</b> <b>lengths</b> due to the direct relationship to the spectral domain resolution [1 - 4]. <b>Record</b> <b>lengths</b> have been increased into the ns regime by applying temporal multiplexing to SI waveform characterization [2]. Recently, Asghari et al. [1] demonstrated an all-fiber, full-field measurement technique that records the spectral interference in the time domain using a fast digitizer and an optical Fourier transform (OFT). The OFT exploits strong chromatic dispersion in a linearly-chirped fiber Bragg grating (LC-FBG) to perform frequency-to-time mapping. As an extension to this technique, our group developed single-shot frequency-to-time assisted interferometry (SS-FTI) that includes four-quadrature coherent detection (FQCD) and an exact retrieval algorithm which fully characterized waveforms with 560 -GHz bandwidths and 700 -ps <b>record</b> <b>length...</b>|$|R
