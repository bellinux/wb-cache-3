40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} and {{cycle times}} in a large-scale medical waste incinerator installed in a re-ferral hospital {{were used to assess}} the performance and functionality of incinerator. The study was conducted using data collected from 8 cycles per days for 67 days. For proper combustion and destruction of toxic components in the primary chamber and destruction of pollutants and toxic components in the flue gas, it is desired to reach the maximum temperature in the chambers faster and maintain this maximum temperature for an extended time interval. The primary and secon-dary temperatures T 1 and T 2, respectively, were recorded at an interval of one minute for different cycles. Different amounts of wastes with varying proportions of sharps and other wastes were loaded into the incinerator and temperature profiles recorded. The analysis shows that the incin-erator works at primary temperature less than the required recommended by manufacturer while the secondary chamber operates between 600 and above 950 ˚C, although higher temperatures up to 1020 ˚C were observed. The average <b>load</b> <b>preparation</b> time was observed to be 14. 6 minutes, while the chamber preheating time before daily initial loading was 25. 45 minutes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to describe animal-based, facility design and management practices measures of cow welfare. Observations were made once in 73 Galician farms while feeding management practices were collected from one year software records in 26 California dairies. In Galician farms, inadequate BCS to the lactation stage had a prevalence [median (range) ] of 52 % (13 - 90 %), 40 % (7 - 100 %) for hock injuries, 9 % (0 - 60 %) for clinical lameness, and 73 % (38 - 100 %) for dirtiness of cows’ coat. These results may be {{a reflection of the}} located critical points at stocking density of the stalls and headlocks, the small front lunge space of the stalls, poor natural ventilation, and poor design of the milking area. In California farms, loading accuracy and precision was adequate on 5 farms; however, it was poor on 4 farms. At least 50 % of the ingredients had a deviation allowed by the tolerance level above 2 % (n= 11).

40|$|Modern {{space flight}} mission {{operations}} and associated ground data systems are increasingly dependent upon reliable, quality software. Critical {{functions such as}} command <b>load</b> <b>preparation,</b> health and status monitoring, communications link scheduling and conflict resolution, and transparent gateway protocol conversion are routinely performed by software. Given budget constraints and the ever increasing capabilities of processor technology, {{the next generation of}} control centers and data systems will be even more dependent upon software across all aspects of performance. A key challenge now is to implement improved engineering, management, and assurance processes for the development and maintenance of that software; processes that cost less, yield higher quality products, and that self-correct for continual improvement evolution. The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has a unique experience base that can be readily tapped to help solve the software challenge. Over the past eighteen years, the Software Engineering Laboratory within the code 500 Flight Dynamics Division has evolved a software development and maintenance methodology that accommodates the unique characteristics of an organization while optimizing and continually improving the organization's software capabilities. This methodology relies upon measurement, analysis, and feedback much analogous to that of control loop systems. It is an approach with a time-tested track record proven through repeated applications across a broad range of operational software development and maintenance projects. This paper describes the software improvement methodology employed by the Software Engineering Laboratory, and how it has been exploited within the Flight Dynamics Division with GSFC Code 500. Examples of specific improvement in the software itself and its processes are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Finally, the initial findings are given when this methodology was applied across the mission operations and ground data systems software domains throughout Code 500...|$|E

30|$|Molybdenum-based {{catalysts}} {{are employed}} in many reactions [16] {{in part due to}} the numerous different molecular structures and oxidation states, which supported molybdenum species can take. Mo structures and oxidation states are determined by preparation parameters such as <b>loading,</b> <b>preparation</b> method, calcination temperature, reduction temperature and reaction temperature [17]. One area of interest is in their ability to form carbides through the insertion of carbon into the lattices of Mo. The carbon donates its valence electron into the outer d band of Mo resulting in the appearance of a narrower metallic type band with a density of states at the Fermi level similar to that of a noble metal [18, 19]. As a consequence, this permits their use {{in a wide variety of}} reactions including: dehydrogenation [20, 21], hydrogenation [16], methane dehydroaromatisation [22], methane reforming [23, 24], methane capturing [25], methanol oxidation [26], alcohol synthesis [27, 28], alkyne metathesis [29], CO hydrogenation [30], water–gas shift [31, 32], hydroisomerisation [6, 33, 34, 35] and hydrotreating [36].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to prepare {{chitosan}} nanoparticles (CS NP) for controlled protein delivery. Two techniques, simple ionotropic gelation (method [I]) and w/o/w emulsion solvent evaporation containing ionotropic gelation (method [II]), were used to prepare CS NP. Tripolyphosphate (TPP) and Eudragit L 100 - 55 (Eud) were used as anionic agents to form complex with cationic chitosan. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was encapsulated into NP. The morphological characteristics, particle size and size distribution, protein entrapment efficiency, zeta potential, in vitro release, protein secondary structure and its integrity were investigated. The results showed that CS NP could be prepared by appropriate cationic and anionic ratios in both methods. Excess anionic agents resulted in particle aggregation of micron size. The median sizes of particles were between 0. 127 - 0. 273 mcm with method [I] provided the smallest size. The 0. 02 - 0. 10 % BSA <b>loaded</b> <b>preparations</b> showed the same particle sizes and size distributions as blank preparations. SEM photomicrographs revealed that the obtained NP were spherical. Protein entrapment efficiency was between 47 - 84 % and increased when decreasing the percentage of drug loading.

30|$|The LSP’s {{delivery}} operation is executed via medium-sized diesel vans with an assumed maximum capacity of about 300 parcels. A typical delivery {{day of a}} driver starts around 6 : 00  am at the distribution centre at {{the fringe of the}} city of Antwerp. He loads the parcels and plans the route, before driving into the city and starting the distribution. Each driver performs a distribution tour alone and visits 99 customers on average. For each customer on the tour, the driver gets at close proximity, parks, fetches the parcel from the van and delivers it at the customer’s door. If the customer or any neighbours are not at home, the respective parcel is delivered to a nearby DP, from where the customer can pick it up. We computed from the dataset that the average duration per stop, including parking, fetching and delivering the parcel, amounts to 2.5  min. The delivery routes are planned by the driver, without any computer assistance. After all parcels have been delivered, the driver returns to the distribution centre for a debriefing. We estimated from the dataset that a driver typically spends 6  h for delivering activities in the city, and two hours for the remaining activities before and after each tour (<b>loading,</b> <b>preparation,</b> driving into the city and returning to the distribution centre, debriefing). Note that we cannot derive the actual delivery routes nor the specific durations of tours from the data, and we will derive those values by simulating the distribution process {{on the basis of the}} above observations.|$|R
40|$|Interstitial {{cells of}} Cajal-like cells (ICC-LCs) in the urethra may act as {{electrical}} pacemakers of spontaneous contractions. However, their properties in situ and their interaction with neighbouring urethral smooth muscle cells (USMCs) {{remain to be}} elucidated. To further explore the physiological role of ICC-LCs, spontaneous changes in [Ca 2 +]i (Ca 2 + transients) were visualized in fluo- 4 <b>loaded</b> <b>preparations</b> of rabbit urethral smooth muscle. ICC-LCs were sparsely distributed, rather than forming an extensive network. Ca 2 + transients in ICC-LCs had a lower frequency and a longer half-width than those of USMCs. ICC-LCs often exhibited Ca 2 + transients synchronously with each other, but did not often show a close temporal relationship with Ca 2 + transients in USMCs. Nicardipine (1 μm) suppressed Ca 2 + transients in USMCs but not in ICC-LCs. Ca 2 + transients in ICC-LCs were abolished by cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm), ryanodine (50 μm) and caffeine (10 mm) or by removing extracellular Ca 2 +, and inhibited by 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (50 μm) and 3 -morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN- 1; 10 μm), but facilitated by increasing extracellular Ca 2 + or phenylephrine (1 – 10 μm). These results indicated that Ca 2 + transients in urethral ICC-LCs in situ rely on both Ca 2 + release from intracellular Ca 2 + stores and Ca 2 + influx through non-L-type Ca 2 + channel pathways. ICC-LCs may not act as a coordinated pacemaker electrical network as do ICC in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Rather they may randomly increase excitability of USMCs to maintain the tone of urethral smooth muscles...|$|R

40|$|A {{parallel}} {{reactor cell}} for catalytic in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements was developed. The cell facilitates the simultaneous catalytic and structural investigation of six catalysts under different feed gas conditions. A two-dimensional X-ray sensor {{was used for}} spectra collection. Gas compositions were measured by on-line mass spectrometry. The potential and limitations of the high throughput XAS cell are discussed. The heterogeneously catalyzed partial oxidation of methane (CPO) was chosen as a test reaction. Alumina-supported Rh and Au/Rh catalysts with different metal loadings (0. 5 – 2. 5 wt%) were applied and prepared via different preparation routes using flame spray pyrolysis (fsp) and colloid adsorption (col). For comparison the same catalysts were also investigated in a fixed-bed capillary reactor heated by a gas blower (also for XAS measurements) and in an eight-fold parallel gas phase reactor using similar reaction conditions (6 % CH$_ 4 $– 3 % O$_ 2 $–He, 250 – 500 °C). Similar catalytic results were obtained in all three reactor types, confirming the suitability of the parallel reactor XAS cell for catalytic measurements. The catalysts showed different activity, selectivity and reducibility depending on metal <b>loading,</b> <b>preparation</b> route and Au/Rh ratio. The analysis of the catalytic data, STEM images and the in situ XANES experiments of the various catalysts indicated the following characteristics for the CPO reaction: sufficient heat production by combustion of methane, total conversion of oxygen, and reduction of a certain fraction of the catalyst. The overall catalytic behavior was in line with a two-zone model of the catalyst bed where catalytic combustion dominates in the front zone and reforming reactions become favored {{in the second part}} of the catalyst bed...|$|R

Prepared samples, with a nominal vanadia content in the range 0. 5 – 2 monolayers, were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and infrared spectroscopy, and were used in toluene oxidation. XRD did not reveal formation of any vanadia phase. XPS spectra showed deposited vanadium to be present mainly as V 5 + on all the supports. A plot of the V:(support metal) ratio determined by XPS showed agglomeration of vanadia on TiO 2, ZrO 2, HfO 2, and Nb 2 O 5 to occur at loadings above 0. 5 monolayer, while for Ta 2 O 5 the dispersion seemed independent of the <b>loading.</b> <b>Preparations</b> from vanadyl acetylacetonate gave superior dispersion.
