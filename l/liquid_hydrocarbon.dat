Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until new {{information from the}} Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004, including the discovery of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the Fischer-Tropsch process where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels.

25|$|In steam cracking, a gaseous or <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> feed like naphtha, LPG or ethane is diluted with {{steam and}} briefly heated in a furnace without the {{presence}} of oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the residence time is reduced to milliseconds to improve yield, resulting in gas velocities up to the speed of sound. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger or inside a quenching header using quench oil.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, two {{separate}} reports described a white solid with a pungent odor {{derived from the}} distillation of coal tar. In 1821, John Kidd cited these two disclosures and then described many of this substance's properties and the means of its production. He proposed the name naphthaline, {{as it had been}} derived from a kind of naphtha (a broad term encompassing any volatile, flammable <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mixture, including coal tar). Naphthalene's chemical formula was determined by Michael Faraday in 1826. The structure of two fused benzene rings was proposed by Emil Erlenmeyer in 1866, and confirmed by Carl Gräbe three years later.|$|E

25|$|There are {{synthetic}} pathways {{for using}} electricity to reduce {{carbon dioxide and}} water to <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> or alcohol fuels. These pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen, and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse water gas shift reaction. Non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include fermentation plants and sewage treatment plants. Converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment, without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic energy carrier. These synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve energy security in nations that rely on imported petroleum, but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity, {{as well as to}} deal with possible future declines in the amount of petroleum available to import.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the area}} of {{greatest}} success for current energy storage technologies. [...] Single-use and rechargeable batteries are ubiquitous, and provide power for devices with demands as varied as digital watches and cars. [...] Advances in battery technology have generally been slow, however, {{with much of the}} advance in battery life that consumers see being attributable to efficient power management rather than increased storage capacity. Portable consumer electronics have benefited greatly from size and power reductions associated with Moore's law. Unfortunately, Moore's law does not apply to hauling people and freight; the underlying energy requirements for transportation remain much higher than for information and entertainment applications. Battery capacity has become an issue as pressure grows for alternatives to internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships, and aeroplanes. [...] These uses require far more energy density (the amount of energy stored in a given volume or weight) than current battery technology can deliver. <b>Liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuel (such as gasoline/petrol and diesel), as well as alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and lipids (straight vegetable oil, biodiesel) have much higher energy densities.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the landing}} site there were {{indications}} of pebbles of water ice scattered over an orange surface, {{the majority of}} which is covered by a thin haze of methane. Early aerial imaging of Titan from Huygens {{was consistent with the}} presence of large bodies of liquid on the surface. The initial photos of Titan before landing showed what appeared to be large drainage channels crossing the lighter colored mainland into a dark sea. Some of the photos suggested islands and mist shrouded coastline. Subsequent analysis of the probe's trajectory indicated that, in fact, Huygens had landed within the dark 'sea' region in the photos. The photos from the surface of a dry lakebed like landscape suggest that while there is evidence of liquid acting on the surface recently, hydrocarbon lakes and/or seas might not currently exist at the Huygens landing site. Further data from the Cassini Mission, however, definitely confirmed the existence of permanent <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> lakes in the polar regions of Titan (see Lakes of Titan). Long-standing tropical hydrocarbon lakes were also discovered in 2012 (including one not far from the Huygens landing site in the Shangri-La region which is about half the size of Utah's Great Salt Lake, with a depth of at least 1 meter). The likely supplier in dry desert areas is probably underground aquifers; in other words, the arid equatorial regions of Titan contain [...] "oases".|$|E
