This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can bump into, touch or squeeze. As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all used to enjoy.|$|E

Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
500|$|On 6 November 2015, Apple Records {{released}} a new deluxe {{version of the}} 1 album in different editions and variations (known as 1+). Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin. Giles Martin, with Jeff Lynne also remixed [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] to accompany the music video for the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The remix of [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] cleans up Lennon's vocal further, and uses a different take of Harrison's vocal phrase, replacing the lyric [...] "whatever happened to the <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> once knew" [...] with [...] "whatever happened to love that we once knew". Towards {{the end of the}} track, this version also contains a clip of Lennon stating the phrase [...] "turned out nice again" [...] played forward—which was played backwards in the original mix of the song. McCartney's lead vocal, buried in the original mix to serve as a double-track for Lennon's own vocal, can now [...] be heard more prominently in the second verse.|$|E
500|$|He {{wanted to}} make a more linear film than Toto le héros, one which {{explored}} the world {{through the eyes of a}} man with Down syndrome. Van Dormael's next film, Le huitieme jour (The Eighth Day), accomplishes this with the chance meeting and friendship between Georges, played by Pascal Duquenne, and Harry, an unhappy divorced businessman portrayed by Daniel Auteuil. Van Dormael's interest in people with mental and physical disabilities stems from an interest in their [...] "talent for life, for loving <b>life,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> often lack." [...] He sought to explore the concept of two worlds (that of Georges and that of Harry) existing simultaneously and yet separately. Le huitième jour premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or. It did win the Best Actor award at the festival, which was given to both Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil. This was the first time in the festival's history that two actors had shared the award. The film received four Joseph Plateau Awards and was nominated for a César Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Le huitième jour grossed $33 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million, making it Van Dormael's highest-grossing film to that point.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} what would become Annie Hall was {{developed}} as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project on alternate days, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on {{a man in his}} forties, someone whose life consisted [...] "of several strands. One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that [...] "advancing age" [...] and [...] "worries about death" [...] had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his [...] "commercial side". Allen made the conscious decision to [...] "sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings". He recognized {{that for the first time}} he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's 1963 comedy-drama 8½, created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's psychoanalysis.|$|E

There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox. Walters also said that [...] "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam." [...] A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that [...] "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career". He also found the album premature, commenting, [...] "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the more happier for it. Now grow up, girl. Quick!" [...] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic felt that, [...] "with the exception of the terrific title track, ...Baby One More Time is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E

60|$|What {{words are}} these, my friends? what rash words are these, which men thrust into Scripture {{out of their}} own carnal conceits, as if they could improve upon the speech of the Son of Man Himself? He says, not that to know God is the way to eternal life: but rather <b>that</b> eternal <b>life</b> is the way to know God. He does not say, This is to know God and Jesus Christ, in order that they may have eternal life. Whatever He says, He does not say that. Nay, more, if we are to be very exact (and can we be too exact?) with the Lord's words, He says, that 'This is eternal <b>life,</b> in order <b>that</b> they may know God and Jesus Christ.' Not <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are to know God <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may obtain eternal <b>life,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must have eternal <b>life</b> in order <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may know God; <b>that</b> eternal <b>life</b> is the means, and the {{knowledge}} of God the end and purpose for which eternal life is given us.
