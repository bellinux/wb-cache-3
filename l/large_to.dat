5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually <b>large</b> <b>to</b> accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E

40|$|Aim : The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine acute muscle damage after {{different}} sequences of an upper-body resistance exercise session. Methods : Twelve untrained men completed two sessions (three sets; 80 % one repetition maximum; two min passive rest between sets) of the same exercises in opposite sequences (<b>larger</b> <b>to</b> smaller vs. smaller <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> muscle group exercises). For each session, serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations were measured before exercise (pre) and 24, 48 hours after each sequence (24 P, 48 P). Results: Within sequence (<b>larger</b> <b>to</b> smaller muscle-group exercises), significant differences in CK concentrations were demonstrated between most time points (P 0. 05). Conclusion: These results suggest that muscle damage was similar between sequences (<b>larger</b> <b>to</b> smaller vs. smaller <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> muscle-group exercises) ...|$|R
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from}} the ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E

Four of Coffin's eight pallbearers were free blacks who had worked with him on the Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave.

5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion was much too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E

5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> get rid of all the excess heat through their skin.|$|E

5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land {{around the tree}} was {{eventually}} acquired by the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake. The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where the tree was located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky {{commented on}} the Manning team's study, stating that small, {{primitive}} dromaeosaurids (such as Microraptor) were {{likely to have been}} tree-climbers, but that climbing did not explain why later, gigantic dromaeosaurids such as Achillobator retained highly curved claws when they were too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> have climbed trees. Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may have adapted the claw to be used exclusively for latching on to prey.|$|E

5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were too <b>large</b> <b>to</b> easily stabilize.
