25|$|SOFC {{systems can}} run on fuels other than pure {{hydrogen}} gas. However, since hydrogen {{is necessary for}} the reactions listed above, the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms. For the fuel cell to operate, the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas.

25|$|The {{other popular}} {{approach}} to improving catalyst performance {{is to reduce}} its sensitivity to impurities in the fuel source, especially carbon monoxide (CO). Presently, pure hydrogen gas is becoming economical to mass-produce by electrolysis. However, at the moment hydrogen gas is produced by steam reforming <b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> a process which produces a mixture of gases that also contains CO (1–3%), CO2 (19–25%), and N2 (25%). Even tens of parts per million of CO can poison a pure platinum catalyst, so increasing platinum’s resistance to CO is an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|During their {{survey of}} the Fugløy reef, Hovland and Mortensen also found seabed pockmark craters near the reef. Since then, {{hundreds}} of large deep-water coral reefs have been mapped and studied. About 60 percent of the reefs occur next to or inside seabed pockmarks. Because these craters are formed by the expulsion of liquids and gases (including methane), several scientists hypothesize {{that there may be}} a link between the existence of the deep-water coral reefs and nutrients seepage (<b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> such as methane, ethane, and propane) through the seafloor. This hypothesis is called the 'hydraulic theory' for deep-water coral reefs.|$|E
25|$|In petrochemistry, {{petroleum}} geology and organic chemistry, cracking {{is the process}} whereby complex organic molecules such as kerogens or long-chain hydrocarbons are broken down into simpler molecules such as <b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> by the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds in the precursors. The rate of cracking and the end products are strongly dependent on the temperature and presence of catalysts. Cracking is the breakdown of a large alkane into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes. Simply put, hydrocarbon cracking {{is the process of}} breaking a long-chain of hydrocarbons into short ones. This process might require high temperatures and high pressure.|$|E

30|$|Heavy {{hydrocarbons}} usually reduce in {{the process}} of gas migration. The C 1 /C 2 + 3 value of methane rich secondary gas might exceed 280, and its carbon isotope compositions and <b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> compositions {{are similar to those of}} mature oil-type gas. Secondary biodegradation gas is featured by heavy carbon isotope ratios of δ 13 C 1 or δ 13 C 3, and <b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> isotope ratios arrange in the order of δ 13 C 1  < δ 13 C 2  < δ 13 C 3  > δ 13 C 4. Influenced by biodegradation, the normal paraffin hydrocarbon content is low. The triangular template of C 7 and 2, 4 -DMC 5 /nC 6 —heptane index template can be used to distinguish the secondary biodegradation gas from other natural gases.|$|R
25|$|For NGLs {{to become}} a major business, however, took the efforts of large and imaginative players, plus the {{development}} of a much larger gas supply from which to extract these <b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Conditions were right in the 1960s, and the two companies that took advantage of the opportunity were Amoco Corporation and Dome Petroleum, neither of which is any longer in existence. Amoco took over Dome after the company essentially went bankrupt in 1988, and BP took over Amoco in a friendly merger ten years later. Here is the story of how those two companies developed key components of the infrastructure for this vital niche industry.|$|E

2500|$|Acetylene is not {{especially}} toxic but, when generated from calcium carbide, it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine, which {{give it a}} distinct garlic-like smell [...] It is also highly flammable, as most <b>light</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an exothermic addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically benzene and/or vinylacetylene, possibly in addition to carbon and hydrogen [...] Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about [...] Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report gauge pressure and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPagage or 15 psig. It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in acetone or dimethylformamide (DMF), contained in a gas cylinder with a porous filling (Agamassan), which renders it safe to transport and use, given proper handling. Acetylene cylinders {{should be used in}} the upright position to avoid withdrawing acetone during use.|$|E
