5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call is {{clearer and}} <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> the similar {{vocalisation}} of the jackdaw, and always {{very different from}} that of its yellow-billed congener, which has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls. Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not. Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call {{is similar}} in {{character}} {{to that of other}} corvids, particularly the jackdaw, although it is clearer and <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> the call of that species. In contrast, the Alpine chough has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls quite unlike the crows. Small subspecies of both choughs have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
25|$|The A320neo is half as <b>loud</b> <b>than</b> an A320 at {{take-off}} with a 85 decibel noise footprint. The LEAP powered A321neo is even quieter at 83.3dB for flyover noise, substantially {{lower than}} the older CFM56 and V2500.|$|R

5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, {{who joined the}} group in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album was recorded {{in the spring of}} 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had a good relationship with him {{and did not want to}} go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E
5|$|Soundgarden {{was formed}} in Seattle, Washington in 1984 by vocalist Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. The drummer {{position}} was originally filled by Cornell until 1986 when Matt Cameron became the band's permanent drummer. The band signed with the independent label Sub Pop and released the Screaming Life EP in 1987 and the Fopp EP in 1988. In 1988, the band signed with legendary punk record label SST Records and released its debut full-length album, Ultramega OK. The band subsequently signed with A Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign with a major label. In 1989, the band released its first album for a major label, <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> Love.|$|E
5|$|When the US ban on JFK Concorde {{operations}} {{was lifted}} in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban {{came to an}} end on 17 October 1977 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to overturn a lower court's ruling rejecting efforts by the Port Authority and a grass-roots campaign led by Carol Berman to continue the ban. In spite of complaints about noise, the noise report noted that Air Force One, at the time a Boeing VC-137, was <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> Concorde at subsonic speeds and during take-off and landing. Scheduled service from Paris and London to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport began on 22 November 1977.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E

6000|$|The {{mistress}} and maid {{had been}} in full feud the whole day, {{on the subject of}} preserving certain black cherries, hard as marbles, sour as sloes. Sarah held that sugar was the only orthodox condiment to be used in that process; mademoiselle maintained--and proved it by the practice and experience of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother--that treacle, [...] "mélasse," [...] was infinitely preferable. She had committed an imprudence in leaving Sarah in charge of the preserving-pan, for her want of sympathy in the nature of its contents had induced a degree of carelessness in watching their confection, whereof the result was--dark and cindery ruin. Hubbub followed; high upbraiding, and sobs rather <b>loud</b> <b>than</b> deep or real.|$|R
25|$|Soundgarden {{signed to}} Sub Pop, {{releasing}} the Screaming Life EP in 1987 and the Fopp EP in 1988 (a {{combination of the}} two was issued as Screaming Life/Fopp in 1990). Though the band was being courted by major labels, they signed to independent label SST Records in 1988 to release their debut album, Ultramega OK, for which they earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The band subsequently signed with A Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign to a major label. In 1989, the band released their second effort and their first for a major label, <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> Love. Following the album's release, Yamamoto left the band to finish his master's degree in physical chemistry at Western Washington University. He was replaced by former Nirvana guitarist Jason Everman. Everman was fired following Soundgarden's tour supporting <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> Love. In 1990, the band was joined by a new bassist, Ben Shepherd.|$|E
25|$|Since then, his ever-more-relaxed {{schedule}} {{has kept}} his recording and live work to a minimum. He {{broke the silence}} in 1996 with <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> Words, on which he resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted soul music, which {{in the intervening years}} has become known as contemporary R.|$|E
25|$|Richie's albums in the 1990s such as <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> Words and Time {{failed to}} match the {{commercial}} success of his earlier work.

Since 2004, he has produced {{a total of six}} Top 40 singles in the UK.|$|E
