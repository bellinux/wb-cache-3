5|$|In June 1853 Bennett {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} as a soloist with orchestra {{in his own}} Fourth Piano Concerto. This performance was given with a new organization, the Orchestral Union, and followed a snub from Costa, who had refused to conduct the pianist Arabella Goddard (Davison's wife) in Bennett's Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society. In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it his duty to remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner conducted, Bennett was elected {{to take over the}} conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years. At his first concert, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven's Emperor Concerto was Clara Schumann, wife of his old friend. It was her first appearance in England.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire {{stayed in}} Northampton for the Twenty20 game, and lost again. Two home wins followed, though, over Glamorgan and Worcestershire, {{and they looked}} very solid after their initial setback - after two no-results and yet another win over Worcestershire had ensured that they had grabbed eight points from six games. However, their bowling <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> {{in the last two}} games, first {{allowing}} whipping boys Glamorgan to take a thumping ten-wicket victory at Cardiff, and then handing Somerset the highest team score in Twenty20 Cup history, with 228 for 5 - which sent Somerset through and Gloucestershire out.|$|E
25|$|A first innings lead of 248 placed great {{pressure}} on the English batsmen, but their combined experience counted when it was required, and their captain David Gower led the fight-back with a well made 106. Robin Smith was unluckily dismissed for 96. However it was again Terry Alderman's turn with 6 for 128, 4 of them LBWs achieved through either dead straight balls or - his speciality - the late swing from leg stump making them virtually straight balls that the batsmen played across. England had made a solid 359, but their first innings had <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> and it left Australia with a comfortable target of 117 runs for victory on the last day.|$|E

25|$|On 20 August 2010 Graeme Smith {{announced}} that he was to surrender the captaincy in T20 Internationals but continue playing in the format. Cricket South Africa subsequently handed over the captaincy to his deputy Botha. Botha also took the One-Day International captaincy after the 2011 Cricket World Cup when Smith gave up his ODI captaincy. The deciding factor was that Botha had led South Africa to a series win against Australia earlier in 2010 when Smith was absent with injury. Botha's first match as permanent captain was on 7 October 2010 against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe scored what looked like a competitive 168 however Zimbabwe's bowling attack severely <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> and it was easily chased by the South Africans with seven-wickets and five-overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|Rahab {{promptly}} {{went up to}} the spies on {{the roof}} and told them that she knew that God had given the Israelites the land, and that the people lived in terror of the Israelites, having heard how God dried up the Red Sea before them and how the Israelites had destroyed the forces of Sihon and Og. So Rahab asked the spies to swear by God, since she had dealt kindly with them, that they would also deal kindly with her father's house and give her a token to save her family from the coming invasion. The spies told her that if she would not tell of their doings, then when God gave the Israelites the land, they would deal kindly with her. She <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> by a cord through her window, as her house was on the city wall. She told them to hide in the mountain for three days. They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which she let the spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die. She agreed, sent them on their way, and bound the scarlet line in her window.|$|E

I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart.

500|$|Their {{next game}} {{was an open}} affair at home to Crewe Alexandra, in which the {{accuracy}} of Crewe's shooting <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> Despite playing against the wind, Small Heath led 2–0 by half-time, a lead extended to 6–0 by the close in a one-sided second half. Each goal was scored by a different player: Billy Walton, Hallam, Ted Devey, Wheldon, Hands and Mobley, of whom the Birmingham Daily Post suggested he had [...] "the making of an excellent centre forward". Against division leaders Ardwick at Manchester, the home club took a two-goal lead by the interval, aided by some poor shooting by the visitors. Wheldon scored in the second half, and then a heavy rain- and hailstorm began, blowing into {{the faces of the}} Ardwick players. Wheldon scored again and Small Heath pressed hard, but their shooting failed to improve, and they were fortunate not to lose the game when a shot from William Lambie hit the crossbar.|$|E

[...] He further expressed that David Yates [...] "transmutes [...] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle." [...] Another review was released {{on the same day}} from Evening Standard, who rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated [...] "Millions of children, parents, and those who should know better won't need reminding what a Horcrux is– and director David Yates does not <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> In fact, in some ways, he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book." [...] The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases [...] "a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E

500|$|After Climbié's death, {{commentators}} {{discussed the}} history of child protection and the various abuse and death cases, noting {{that there have been}} 70 public inquiries into child abuse since 1945, and comparing Climbié's case with that of many others, especially that of Maria Colwell in 1973. They pointed to the many children abused and killed by their guardians over the years and how the agencies involved in their care <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> They noted similarly that their deaths also led to inquiries and reform policies—reforms that have not saved the many children killed following them. They pointed out that, [...] "an average of 78 children are killed by parents or minders every year; a figure unaltered in the 30 years since Maria Colwell's death provoked the first criticism of 'communications failure'". They expressed cynicism towards the possibility that these reforms would be different. Dr. Chris Harvey, director of operations at Barnardo's, for example, said, [...] "Victoria's tragic case {{is the latest in a}} sad roll-call of child deaths, each leading to fresh inquiries and a new but recurring set of recommendations". Ian Willmore, former deputy leader of Haringey council, said, [...] "the 'script' for this kind of Iinquiry is now almost traditional. The Minister goes on TV to insist that: 'this must never happen again'. Responsibility is pinned on a few expendable front-line staff, all conveniently sacked in advance. Criticisms are made about poor communication, with earnest recommendations about better co-ordination and possible restructuring. Council officers—all new appointments—go on TV to say that everything has changed since the case began. Everyone looks very earnest. Voices crack with compassion. Nothing essential changes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pullar {{became the}} first Lancashire player to hit a century in an Old Trafford Test, and MJK Smith made 100 as well. With 87 from Barrington and 67 from Cowdrey, England made the highest total of the series. Surendranath took five for 115 in 47.1 overs. India's batting again <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> though Borde made 75 and guided the tail {{to a total of}} more than 200. Cowdrey, captaining England as Peter May was ill (he {{underwent}} an operation during the match), did not enforce the follow-on, but England batted with little urgency. Parkhouse, Barrington, Ted Dexter and Ray Illingworth each passed 40, but none of them reached 50. The declaration set India 547 to win. A second wicket stand of 109 between Contractor, who made 56, and Baig, who was making his debut, was India's best of the series. Baig reached 85 when he was struck on the head by a bouncer from Rhodes and had to retire. He was able to resume the next morning and, in partnership with Umrigar, threatened to save or even win the match. Both reached centuries [...] Baig in his first Test, Umrigar's the only one he ever made in England [...] but once Baig had been run out for 112, the innings quickly folded, Umrigar being eighth out for 118.|$|E
