25|$|<b>Legionellosis</b> or Legionnaire's Disease {{is caused}} by a {{waterborne}} bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of <b>Legionellosis.</b> More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.|$|E
25|$|In a 2002 {{outbreak}} of <b>legionellosis</b> in the town, 172 people {{were reported to}} have caught the disease, of whom seven died. This made it the fourth worst outbreak in {{the world in terms of}} number of cases and sixth worst in terms of deaths. The source of the bacteria was later found to be steam from a badly maintained air conditioning unit in the council-run arts centre Forum 28.|$|E
25|$|Another very {{important}} reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of Legionella, including species that cause <b>legionellosis</b> or Legionnaires' disease, most notably L. pneumophila, or Mycobacterium avium. The various Legionella species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of Legionella include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply. Natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks.|$|E

2500|$|The CDC {{does not}} {{recommend}} that health-care facilities regularly {{test for the}} Legionella pneumophila bacteria. Scheduled microbiologic monitoring for Legionella remains controversial because its presence is not necessarily evidence of a potential for causing disease. The CDC recommends aggressive disinfection measures for cleaning and maintaining devices known to transmit Legionella, but does not recommend regularly-scheduled microbiologic assays for the bacteria. However, scheduled monitoring of potable water within a hospital might be considered in certain settings where persons are highly susceptible to illness and mortality from Legionella infection (e.g. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation units, or solid organ transplant units). [...] Also, after an outbreak of <b>legionellosis,</b> health officials agree that monitoring is necessary to identify the source and to evaluate the efficacy of biocides or other prevention measures.|$|E
50|$|The Bovenkarspel <b>legionellosis</b> {{outbreak}} (Legionellaramp; Legionella disaster) {{began on}} 25 February 1999 in Bovenkarspel, the Netherlands, {{and was one}} of the largest outbreaks of <b>legionellosis</b> in history. With at least 32 dead and 206 severe infections, it was the deadliest <b>legionellosis</b> outbreak since the original 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia, USA.|$|E

50|$|Poorly santised hot-tubs {{have been}} linked to a number of diseases, principally caused by facultative aerobic bacteria. Such {{incidents}} include Hot tub folliculitis and <b>Legionellosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} under-reporting problem {{occurs with}} <b>legionellosis.</b> Even {{in countries with}} effective health services and readily available diagnostic testing, about 90 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease are missed. This {{is partly due to}} Legionnaires' disease being a relatively rare form of pneumonia, which many clinicians may not have encountered before and thus may misdiagnose. A further issue is that people with <b>legionellosis</b> can present {{with a wide range of}} symptoms, some of which (such as diarrhea) may distract clinicians from making a correct diagnosis.|$|E

The book recaps and expounds on some episodes, explains how the show is produced, and details why some proposed episodes were turned down. In it, the show's Executive Producer/Writer Paul Dowling says he was inspired to create the show {{because he had been}} present in Philadelphia during the outbreak of <b>Legionellosis</b> in 1976, {{as well as by the}} murder of Helle Crafts. The CDC's <b>legionellosis</b> investigation eventually became an episode of Medical Detectives, while the Crafts case was filmed as the series' pilot episode.|$|E

50|$|In 2008 {{there was}} a new <b>legionellosis</b> {{outbreak}} in Fredrikstad/Sarpsborg area. This time it was concluded that the biological treatment plant was connected with both outbreacks.

50|$|In 1976, an {{outbreak}} of bacterial pneumonia occurred in a convention of The American Legion at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. This pneumonia killed 34 people at the convention and later became known as Legionnaires' disease (<b>Legionellosis).</b> The bacterium that causes the illness was later named Legionella.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Dr. Joseph McDade {{discovered}} a new bacterium, which was identified as the causative organism. It thrives in hot, damp places like {{the water of the}} cooling towers for the Bellevue-Stratford's air-conditioning system, which spread the disease throughout the hotel. The bacterium was named Legionella and the disease, <b>legionellosis,</b> after the first victims.|$|E
50|$|In March 1999 an {{outbreak}} of Legionnaires' disease occurred during a flower exhibition in Bovenkarspel. Many people were hospitalized in Hoorn. 318 people became ill and at least 32 died. Probably more victims died and were buried before the <b>legionellosis</b> infection was recognized. The source of the bacteria was probably a whirlpool and a humidifier in the exhibition area.|$|E
50|$|More recent issues {{affecting}} broader society are, {{for example in}} 1976, legionnaires' disease or <b>legionellosis.</b> More recently again in the 1990s radon and in the 2000s the effects of mold from indoor air quality situations {{in the home and}} at work.

50|$|Copper-silver {{ionization}} disperses {{positively charged}} copper and silver ions {{into the water}} system. The ions bond electrostatically with negative sites on bacterial cell walls and denature proteins. Over the long term, the presence of copper and silver ions destroy biofilms and slimes that can harbor Legionella, the bacteria responsible for Legionnaires' disease (<b>legionellosis).</b> It can take 30 to 45 days for the copper and silver ions to penetrate a biofilm.|$|E

Vaccination studies using heat-killed or acetone-killed cells {{have been carried out}} in guinea pigs, which were then given Legionella intraperitoneally or by aerosol. Both vaccines were shown to give moderately high levels of protection. Protection was dose-dependent and correlated with antibody levels as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to an outer membrane antigen and by indirect immunofluorescence to heat-killed cells. However, a licensed vaccine for people in the US is most probably still many years away.|$|E
5000|$|APMV was {{discovered}} accidentally in 1992 within the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga, after {{which it is}} named, during research into <b>Legionellosis</b> by researchers from Marseille and Leeds.

As a consequence it was named Bradfordcoccus, after the district the amoeba was sourced from in Bradford, England. In 2003, researchers at the Université de la Méditerranée in Marseille, France published a paper in Science identifying the micro-organism as a virus. It was given the name [...] "Mimivirus" [...] (for [...] "Mimicking microbe") as it resembles a bacterium on Gram staining.|$|E
