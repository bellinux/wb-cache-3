40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>and</b> {{water are}} the two main drivers of {{agricultural}} production. Pressure on farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water resources is increasing in China due to rising food demand. Domestic trade affects China's regional farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water use by distributing resources associated with the production of goods and services. This study constructs a multiregional input-output model to simultaneously analyze China's farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water uses embodied in consumption and interregional trade. Results show a great similarity for both China's farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water endowments. Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, and Yunnan {{are the most important}} drivers of farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water consumption in China, even though they have relatively few <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water resource endowments. Significant net transfers of embodied farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water flows are identified from the central and western areas to the eastern area via interregional trade. Heilongjiang is the largest farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water supplier, in contrast to Shanghai as the largest receiver. The results help policy makers to comprehensively understand embodied farm <b>land</b> <b>and</b> water flows in a complex economy network. Improving resource utilization efficiency and reshaping the embodied resource trade nexus should be addressed by considering the transfer of regional responsibilities.
