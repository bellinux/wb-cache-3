50|$|In 2014, Fuertes and Schiavon {{developed}} {{the first study}} that analyzes plug loads using LEED documented data from certified projects. The study compared plug <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> made by 92 energy modeling practitioners against ASHRAE and Title 24 requirements, as well as, {{the evaluation of the}} plug loads calculation methodology used by 660 LEED-CI and 429 LEED-NC certified projects. In general, energy modelers considered the energy consumption of plug loads of equipment that are constantly running (such as refrigerators) as well as monitors and computes predictable. Overall the results suggested a disconnection between energy modelers assumptions and the actual performance of buildings. The study also shows that there was no consistency on the method used by LEED-CI and NC projects, while one is based on the power and percentage of ENERGY STAR equipment installed in the building the other one is based on a whole-building-design energy model. In conclusion, the study suggests LEED or ASHRAE to develop guidelines for plug loads calculations.|$|E

The simulation model which is used within this thesis is based on an elastic multibody system (EMBS) of a bogie. The solution and therefore also the <b>load</b> <b>assumption</b> is carried out in the frequency domain. For the <b>load</b> <b>assumption</b> several frequency response functions (FRF) are calculated which represent the system behavior.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model was used to analyze runway pavement responses under moving aircraft tire loading. The analysis modeled an instrumented runway at Cagliari Elmas airport in Sardinia, Italy, with a 350 -mm asphalt layer, a 400 -mm granular base layer, and subgrade. The {{finite element model}} characterized the asphalt layer as a linear viscoelastic material, and two interface bonding conditions between asphalt layers (full bonding and partial debonding) {{were used in the}} analysis. The aircraft tire loading was simulated with a nontraditional <b>loading</b> <b>assumption</b> that represented the nonuniform distribution of tire contact stresses along contact length and width under five ribs of an aircraft tire. Analysis results showed that a traditional <b>loading</b> <b>assumption</b> that assumed uniform contact stresses at the tire-pavement interface underestimated the critical tensile and shear strains in the asphalt layer. In particular, the relatively high contact stresses at tire edge ribs under heavy aircraft loading caused significant shear stresses at the pavement near-surface. The pavement responses under various loading conditions (aircraft type, wheel load, and speed) were calculated, and the critical responses were identified. Good agreements were achieved when the calculated pavement responses (vertical pressure and horizontal strain) at various locations were compared with the measured responses from field instrumentation. The model results showed that partial debonding between asphalt layers caused much greater tensile strains {{at the bottom of the}} whole asphalt layer...|$|R

Based on the previous work on the inelastic and large deflection analysis, the tangent modulus method is coded in a computer program.

The object of the present investigation is to show how the strength of airplane parts can best be tested with respect to dynamic stresses with and without superposed static loading, and to what extent the dynamic strength of the parts depends on their structural design. Experimental apparatus and evaluation methods were developed and tried for the execution of vibration-strength tests with entire structural parts both with and without superposed static loading.

The presentations will be made available to all participants so that discussions can be carried out in more detail during the seminar with the aim of reaching a possible decision on which measuring techniques are most suitable. Wind power plants are old proven systems for producting mechanical energy. Wind mills, known to us to-day, have been developed with many faults over centuries. But even in the case of windmills which have often been built, faults are not rare, as insufficient planning, building deflciencies, Operating mistakes and inadequate maintenance-were not forestalled either then or now. To-day nothing can be deduced directly from the old windmill technology as electricity will be produced with modern rotors. The long development phase consisting of tests and continual modifications will be shortened as wind energy is to provide a contribution towards electricity production in our country as soon as possible. Today we have many aids at our disposal for calculating the dimensions of wind power plants. However, basic data for the calculation are still generally unknown. The <b>load</b> <b>assumptions,</b> on which a calculation can only be based, have not been investigated sufficiently. Various estimates are indeed available but a confirmation by measured results is still missing. Therefore one aim of the analysis of wind power plants must be to determine reliable <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> with which a calculation can be carried out. These data do not only depend on the wind but also on the type of plant. For this reason both high speed and low-speed plants must be calculated and sssessed with cmd wi thout pi tch control.

Criteria like driving behavior and braking performance, influenced by the global stiffness as well as the fatigue life under operational conditions, i. e. customer usage, were taken into account. Theoretical and experimental stress analysis were tools, which were incorporated into the optimization procedure, the latter primarily for the verification of <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> and determination of local stresses in service.

40|$|AbstractFatigue {{designing}} of high-stressed {{engine components}} {{is a key}} factor for reliable power train systems in automotive industry. In this context <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> are very important since this is attended with a pre-designing of important machine elements. Load analyses are done usually by experimental methods since the accuracy of load simulations are often not precise enough. For example concerning VHCF problems, modern high pressure pumps for gasoline direct injection systems have load spectra with {{a large amount of}} cycles up to 109 including a very powerful shape of the load spectra. At the same time it is necessary to consider the properties of fuels in service since they might affect the fatigue strength significantly. For example ethanol-based gasoline fuels are used in a lot of countries worldwide and may lead to significant corrosion fatigue effects. In addition {{it is well known that}} material inclusions play an important role for the VHCF behaviour especially for high-strength steels. Both effects are superimposing at the surface of high loaded components. This paper deals with possibilities to avoid VHCF problems of components in service to maintain reliable systems...|$|E

Network-on-Chip(NoC) has been proposed as a promising solution to complex SoC communication problems and has been widely accepted by academe and industry. Focusing on decreasing node degrees, reducing links and reusing router nodes, a regular NoC architecture, named Double-Loop(DL(2 m)) interconnection network, is proposed. The topology of DL(2 m) is simple, symmetric and scalable in architecture, and it is 3 -regular plane graph with 4 m nodes. The nodes of DL(2 m) adopt Johnson coding scheme that can {{make the design of}} routing algorithms simple and efficient. The DL(2 m) was compared with Ring and 2 D Mesh by simulating and analysing, both under uniform load and under more realistic <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> in the several network size scenarios.

40|$|The {{development}} of fault detection schemes and optimized condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategies for gear transmission systems has received considerable attention in recent years. Most models considered the gear systems operating under constant load. Constant <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> imply {{that changes in}} condition monitoring data are caused only by deterioration of the gear systems. However, most real gear systems operate under varying loads and speeds which affect the condition monitoring data signature of the system. This typically {{makes it difficult to}} recognize the occurrence of an impending fault and to optimize a CBM strategy. This thesis first presents a novel approach to detect and localize the gear failure occurrence for a gear system operating under varying load conditions. An autoregressive model with exogenous variables is fitted to the time-synchronously averaged (TSA) condition monitoring data when the gear transmission system operated under various load conditions in good state. The fault detection and localization indicator is calculated by applying F-test to the residual signals of the ARX model. Then, the gear deteriorating process is modeled as a three state hidden continuous Markov model with partial information, and the model parameters are estimated using AR...|$|E

Almost unique {{in the history of}} modern wind energy, these blades were in operation for 18 years next to a weather station and were investigated afterward. Therefore, the loads experienced in the operational life could be post-processed accurately with the measured data of the weather station and the turbine. The blades are made of materials that are similar with today's wind turbines. Furthermore, intensive laboratory tests and free field tests have been carried out, and all <b>load</b> <b>assumptions</b> and data and results are still available today. The results include experimental investigations on the moisture content of the load-carrying material, static and fatigue behavior of the material, the relaxation of the coupling joints, the natural frequencies of the blade and a full scale static blade test.

Although some damage was found by visual inspection, the service blade of the DEBRA- 25 showed excellent mechanical behavior in the full scale blade test.
