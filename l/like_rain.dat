25|$|If the wet/dry filter {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} aquarium, water is pumped over a number of {{perforated}} trays containing filter wool or some other filter material. The water trickles through the trays, keeping the filter wool wet but not completely submerged, allowing aerobic bacteria to grow and aiding biological filtration. The water returns to the aquarium <b>like</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along {{with much}} of the central and {{northern}} California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. The summer fog and summer drought have the same underlying cause: a massive, stable seasonal high pressure system that forms over the north Pacific Ocean. The high pressure cell inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly air flow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder sub surface water. The water vapor in the air contacting this cold water condenses into fog. The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day. Fog is an essential summer water source for many Big Sur coastal plants. While few plants can take water directly out of the air, water condensation on leaf surfaces slowly precipitates into the ground <b>like</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E

500|$|No Doubt {{embarked}} on the Tragic Kingdom Tour {{after the release}} of the album. It chose Project X, headed by Luc Lafortune and Michael Keeling, to design the stage. No Doubt suggested decorating the stage as a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges. The show included clear and mylar confetti designed to look <b>like</b> <b>rain.</b> Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as [...] "a very kinetic performance". The band expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>rain</b> on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
500|$|Lamashtu is a {{historically}} older image that left {{a mark on}} the figure of Lilith. Many incantations invoke her as a malicious [...] "Daughter of Heaven" [...] or of Anu, and she is often depicted as a terrifying blood-sucking creature with a lion's head and {{the body of a}} donkey. Akin to Lilitu, Lamashtu primarily preyed on newborns and their mothers. She was said to watch pregnant women vigilantly, particularly when they went into labor. Afterwards, she would snatch the newborn from the mother to drink its blood and eat its flesh. In the Labartu texts she is described; [...] "Wherever she comes, wherever she appears, she brings evil and destruction. Men, beasts, trees, rivers, roads, buildings, she brings harm to them all. A flesh-eating, bloodsucking monster is she." [...] Gallu was a demon closely associated with Lilith, though the word (like [...] "Utukku") is also used as a general term for demons, and these are [...] "evil Uttuke" [...] or [...] "evil Galli". One incantation tells of them as spirits that threaten every house, rage at people, eat their flesh, and as they let their blood flow <b>like</b> <b>rain,</b> they never stop drinking blood. Lamashtu, Lilitu, and Gallu are invoked in different amulet texts, with Gallu showing up in Graeco-Byzantine myth as Gello, Gylo, or Gyllo. There she appears as a child-stealing and child-killing female demon, in the manner of Lamia and Lilith.|$|E

According to an interview with Sound on Sound magazine in 2002, the piano sounds heard within the score come from the Roland MKS–20, a rackmount synthesizer.

2500|$|Influencing {{the weather}} is {{the main purpose of}} the rain-making rituals – {{sometimes}} of a secretive character – that are found all over the Maya area and also of such rituals as 'Imprisoning the winds' [...] and 'Sealing the frost' [...] just before the sowing season. The officiating priests of the rain-making rituals are sometimes believed to ascend into the clouds and there to act <b>like</b> <b>rain</b> deities themselves. Influencing the weather can also mean deflecting the rain clouds from neighbouring areas, and thus imply black sorcery.|$|E
2500|$|Spitzer observations, {{announced}} in May 2011, indicate that tiny forsterite crystals might be falling down <b>like</b> <b>rain</b> {{on to the}} protostar HOPS-68. The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising, because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they {{are found in the}} molecular cloud where the temperatures are about [...] This led the team of astronomers to speculate that the bipolar outflow from the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star's surface to the chilly outer cloud.|$|E

According to historian Wang Zhaochun, the account of this battle provided the [...] "earliest truly detailed descriptions {{of the use of}} gunpowder weapons in warfare." [...] Records show that Jin utilized gunpowder arrows and trebuchets to hurl gunpowder bombs while Song responded with gunpowder arrows, fire bombs, thunderclap bombs, and a new addition called the [...] "molten metal bomb" [...] (金汁炮). As the Jin account describes, when they attacked the city's Xuanhua Gate, their [...] "fire bombs fell <b>like</b> <b>rain,</b> and their arrows were so numerous as to be uncountable."

2500|$|The volcano is {{currently}} classified as active {{with a low}} risk of eruption. The last recorded eruption was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707 (Hōei 4, 23rd day of the 11th month), and ended about January 1, 1708 (Hōei 4, 9th day of the 12th month), during the Edo period. The eruption formed a new crater and a second peak, named Mount Hōei (after the Hōei era), halfway down its southeastern side. Fuji spewed cinders and ash which fell <b>like</b> <b>rain</b> in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi. Since then, {{there have been no}} signs of an eruption.

2500|$|The wugongchuan {{were built}} {{based on what}} the Chinese {{observed}} from Portuguese ships. The mid-Ming dynasty text Longjiang chuanchang zhi (龍江船廠志, Account of the Longjiang Shipyard) describes their observations as follows: [...] "The Portuguese ships had a length of ten zhang and a width of three zhang (approximately 36 × 11 meters). They had forty oars on each side, carried three to four guns, had a sharp-pointed keel and a flat deck and were thus safe against storms and high waves. Moreover, the crew was protected by breastwork and therefore had no need to fear arrows and stones. There were two hundred men altogether, with many pulling the oars, which made these ships very fast, even if there was no wind. When the guns were fired and the gun balls poured <b>like</b> <b>rain,</b> no enemy could resist. These ships were called wugongchuan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Midnight Oil {{spent several}} months in mid-1986 on the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour of outback Australia with {{indigenous}} music groups Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, playing to remote Aboriginal communities and seeing first hand {{the seriousness of the}} issues in health and living standards. The tour was criticised by some journalists for being a one-off event instead of a long-term attempt to build bridges between communities. The band was galvanised by the experiences and made them the basis of their next album, Diesel and Dust, which was released in August 1987 and produced by Warne Livesey and the band. The album focused on the need for recognition by white Australia of past injustices involving the Aboriginal nation and the need for reconciliation. Peter Gifford left the band before the album's release due to extensive touring schedules, and was replaced on bass guitar by Bones Hillman, formerly of The Swingers. The track [...] "Gunbarrel Highway" [...] was not included on the United States version of the album, reportedly, because the line [...] "shit falls <b>like</b> <b>rain</b> on a world that is brown" [...] was deemed too offensive for US audiences.|$|E
