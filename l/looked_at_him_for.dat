60|$|Jeanne <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} without change of features.|$|E
60|$|Bobbie <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> an instant. Then {{he shrugged}} his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Ughtred <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} gravely; {{then turned to}} Reist.|$|E
60|$|The girl stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a {{long moment}} before she spoke.|$|R
60|$|She sat <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment; then timidly put her {{trembling}} hand in his.|$|R
60|$|The other made no reply, but <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} time, {{surveyed}} {{him with a}} troubled expression.|$|R
60|$|Berenice <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{several seconds}} without speaking. Borrowdean bit his lip.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} with {{twinkling}} eyes, and she smiled.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment, {{a little}} sadly, a little wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our marriage," [...] she answered, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} in most bewildering fashion and then {{suddenly}} dropping her eyes.|$|R
50|$|A rich guy who {{transferred}} schools {{so people}} wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> his wealth. He becomes Shi Fen and Kai Xin's friend.|$|R
6000|$|He {{composed}} {{himself to}} silence; and Margaret, after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> some moments in wonder, {{began in a}} sort of exculpatory tone: ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment, {{and then}} her gaze passed beyond him.|$|E
60|$|She {{threw her}} {{cigarette}} away and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment without speaking.|$|E
60|$|Her manner softened. She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} and then her eyes dropped.|$|E
60|$|She sighed. Her {{eyes seemed}} to have wandered away. He {{felt that it was}} a trick to avoid <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the moment.|$|R
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING [struck by his tone, <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} with some displeasure; then replies] It does not matter. A long time.|$|R
60|$|The {{newcomer}} {{turned to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> {{a moment he}} seemed puzzled. It was as though some old memory were striving to reassert itself.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} with {{slightly}} arched eyebrows, and then suddenly smiled.|$|E
60|$|His {{flying off}} at a tangent was indisputably natural. Bradley <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the reason.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a few seconds, {{and then}} answered, in a quiet, matter-of-fact voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is you {{who have}} sacrificed me," [...] she said, casting away her reticence, and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the first time during the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|Only when you're with me? [LUCY <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> an instant. He {{repeats the}} {{question}} in a caressing voice.] Only when you're with me, darling? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a quarter}} of a minute," [...] said the Tinker, [...] "since you so much wish it; but not a moment longer." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} very sadly, and then, smiling, gently shook her head.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment, and creased to the {{opposite}} side of the room.|$|E
60|$|Phineas Duge <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} in silence, while he decided how much to tell.|$|E
60|$|This {{time she}} frowned. She stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment. Arnold's face was very square and determined, {{but there were}} still things there which she appreciated.|$|R
60|$|He {{picked up}} the spanner {{and went to work}} again without paying any further {{attention}} to us. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a minute or so, we went away.|$|R
6000|$|She didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> it, but she {{was none}} the less {{strongly}} distinct [...] "He has been here--and that has done it He knows," [...] she admirably emphasised.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a long time, {{with strange}} bright eyes, {{but she did}} not answer.|$|E
60|$|Miller <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment. The {{little man}} was all white. He was {{actually}} trembling.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} in silence. There {{was nothing to be}} learned from his expression.|$|E
6000|$|But {{she did not}} rise. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a little}} while, she sank down closer to him, laid her arm across his knee, and {{dropping}} her head upon it, said: ...|$|R
60|$|Bailey had {{not been}} gone too long before Ruth appeared. She {{stood in the doorway}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> a moment. Her face was pale and her eyes bright. She was {{breathing}} quickly.|$|R
60|$|Was it his fancy, {{or did she}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} more intently during the {{momentary}} silence which followed his speech? It must have been his fancy. Yet her next words puzzled him.|$|R
