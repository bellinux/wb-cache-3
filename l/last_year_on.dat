5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season.

500|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to open before the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the line failed to obtain the mandatory safety clearance, and was opened on 24 February 2011, after a delay of around 5 months. After 16 months of commencement of operations, the line was shut down for repairs of the viaducts on 8 July 2012. [...] The line reopened on 22 January 2013.

DMRC has stated that this was done to reduce the crowding on Blue line, diverting some of the Dwarka-bound passengers to Airport Express Line, which is underutilised and faster compared to the Blue Line.|$|E
