France and Germany uniting precisely as Saxony and Prussia and Bavaria have united. And, most of all, a general realization that the fact that we cannot accomplish all these things at once does not indicate that they are hopeless; an understanding that one of the wonders of the future is the fact that we shall always, in all ages, have improvements to look forward to.|$|E

40|$|Autobiographical memory (AM), {{subjective}} {{recollection of}} past experiences, is fundamental in everyday life. Nevertheless, {{characterization of the}} spontaneous occurrence of AM, {{as well as of}} the number and types of recollected details, remains limited. The CRAM (Cue-Recalled Autobiographical Memory) test ([URL] adapts and combines the cue-word method with an assessment that collects counts of details recalled from different <b>life</b> <b>periods.</b> The SPAM (Spontaneous Probability of Autobiographical Memories) protocol samples introspection during everyday activity, recording memory duration and frequency. These measures provide detailed, naturalistic accounts of AM content and frequency, quantifying essential dimensions of recollection. AM content (∼ 20 details/recollection) decreased with the age of the episode, but less drastically than the probability of reporting remote compared to recent memories. AM retrieval was frequent (∼ 20 /hour), each memory lasting ∼ 30 seconds. Testable hypotheses of the specific content retrieved in a fixed time from given <b>life</b> <b>periods</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|Time {{is morally}} relevant. This chapter {{considers}} three temporal features {{that could be}} assigned moral significance when one assesses actions, activities, character-traits, and events: <b>life</b> <b>periods,</b> temporal order, and tense. It seems plausible to assign significance to <b>life</b> <b>periods</b> when one assesses character traits - innocence is a virtue for children but not for adults, for example. It {{is also clear that}} the temporal order between events can have moral significance when one assesses the overall value of the sequence of events. When it comes to tense-partiality it is clear that people often show a psychological bias towards the future. But, it is very doubtful that this bias can be upgraded to an acceptable tense-partial moral theory. First, such a theory will have many counterintuitive implications. Second, {{it will be difficult to}} consistently act on such a theory in dynamic choice situations. © 2013 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

He entered the US Army at the behest of some Party organizers, and he was put in contact with a KGB operative who provided him with an injection to keep him from receiving or transmitting AIDS (which mutates and spreads soon after, wiping out {{a large percentage of the}} population of Earth). The injection also enhanced his memory, and periodically regenerates his body, so that he becomes 10 years younger with each 15-year <b>life</b> <b>period.</b> This makes him a longtimer, and gives him the side-effect of having his memory wiped after every <b>life</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

The author analyses the influence of the contemporary society on an individual's education biography because he or she doesn't only learn in school but also from the environment. Education biooraphy consists of two parts: forma! an informal education. I defined their meaning as well as how they are created and how a personal education biography is evaluated in different <b>life</b> <b>periods.</b> One of the conditions for an individual to make his personal education biography is that he is aware of himself, his self and identity. Education biography is one of the ways to form our selfimage, self and identity, to distinguish between ourselves and the outer world to accept oursel ves and start a better s~lfdevelopment, acquiring new knowled cres, abilities etc. And this can be followed by important changes in our lives...|$|R
