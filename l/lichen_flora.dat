5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its <b>lichen</b> <b>flora.</b> Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich <b>lichen</b> <b>flora.</b> Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and <b>lichen</b> <b>flora</b> of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E

40|$|Species diversities and {{similarities}} of <b>lichen</b> <b>floras</b> from Italy via Austria, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway to Greenland {{are compared}} {{for the complete}} floras and separately for bark, wood, rock and soil, the latter two also for acidic and calcareous. Lichen species diversity declines about 15 % from Italy to Norway but 50 % from Italy to Greenland, a much lower percentage than for vascular plants (92 %!). The S&oslash;rensen coefficient and an NMDS-ordination display geographic groups well: Italy, Austria and Germany, Finland, Sweden and Norway and finally Greenland. Denmark as the only country without mountains lacks saxicolous species and differs from the other countries. About half of the lichen species grow on rock, followed by bark, except for Greenland, there soil. Diversity and composition of <b>lichen</b> <b>floras</b> on bark and wood are rather homogeneous from Italy to Scandinavia, on soil even from Italy to Greenland. Diversity is higher on acidic than calcareous rock and soil, a contrast to observations from vascular plants. The diversity loss in &ldquo;southern&rdquo; calciphytic species in the northern countries is compensated by additional &ldquo;nordic&rdquo; species on acidic substrate. From Greenland even more acidophytic terricolous lichen species are known than from Italy. The reasons for the pH dependent diversity patterns are, same as for vascular plants, not known...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 100 lichen species are listed for the islands. Six species are {{described}} as new to science: Arctomia subantarctica Øvstedal, Arthothelium evanescens Øvstedal, Coccotrema stellata Øvstedal, Ramonia subantarctica Øvstedal, Thelocarpon subantarcticum Øvstedal and Verrucaria umbilicata Øvstedal. Four new combinations are made: Amandinea subplicata (Nyl.) Øvstedal, Poeltinula cerebrinella (Nyl.) Øvstedal, Verrucaria nigra (Müll. Arg.) Øvstedal (from Cape Horn) and Verrucaria tesselata (Dodge) Øvstedal (from Heard Island). One third of the islands' lichen species also occur in the Northern Hemisphere. Of the Southern Hemisphere species, 24 are exclusively known from areas {{to the east of}} the islands (Kerguelen Province Islands, Australia, New Zealand, contrasting to only six species recorded exclusively to the west (South Georgia, Antarctic Peninsula). This suggests a distribution against the present predominantly westerly winds. The large number of seemingly endemic species is suggested to indicate the incomplete knowledge of the <b>lichen</b> <b>floras</b> of the sub-Antarctic islands. ...|$|R

North Exmoor covers [...] and includes the Dunkery Beacon and the Holnicote and Horner Water Nature Conservation Review sites, and the Chains Geological Conservation Review site. The Chains site is nationally important for its south-western lowland heath communities and for transitions from Ancient woodland through upland heath to blanket mire. The site is also of importance for its breeding bird communities, its large population of the nationally rare heath fritillary butterfly (Mellicta athalia), an exceptional woodland <b>lichen</b> <b>flora</b> and its palynological interest of deep peat on the Chains.|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{surveys of}} the <b>lichen</b> <b>floras</b> of Schirmacher Oasis (Queen Maud Land, {{continental}} Antarctic), Victoria Land (Ross Sector, continental Antarctic) and Admiralty Bay (South Shetland Islands, maritime Antarctic) were compared to help infer the major factors influencing patterns of diversity and biogeography in the three areas.

A total of 54 lichen species were documented from Schirmacher Oasis (SO), 48 from Victoria Land (VL) and 244 from Admiralty Bay (AB). Of these, 21 species were common to all areas. Most lichens from the SO and VL areas were microlichens, the dominant genus being Buellia. In AB, in contrast, many macrolichens were also present and the dominant genus was Caloplaca. In SO and VL large areas lacked any visible lichen cover, even where the ground was snow-free in summer. Small-scale diversity patterns were present in AB, where the number of species and genera was greater close to the coast.

5000|$|Many of the <b>lichens</b> and <b>flora</b> {{that still}} {{thrive in the}} Lanphere Dunes are from an epoch that passed long ago, with {{reindeer}} lichens thriving well after the Ice Age. Varieties of flora often found in Lanphere Dunes that are typically common are often far away from their natural ranges. Sands that are blown in with the occasional ocean breezes remain trapped in the forests, killing off the trees and leaving behind [...] "skeleton forests," [...] areas where all the husks of former trees are plentiful. American Dunegrass (Leymus mollis) used to be plentiful, once found along the west coast as south as Morro Bay in California, this native grass now occurs in just two areas along the California coast, Point Reyes and the Lanphere Dunes. [...] European Beachgrass is an invasive species that {{was found to be}} omnipresent in the Lanphere Dunes, having taken over many of the areas formally occupied by native grasses. Between 1992 and 1997, European Beachgrass from the dune zone was manually removed by laborers from the California Conservation Corps funded by the Nature Conservancy. After starting the restoration project in 1992, native plant cover in Lanphere Dunes increased by 47% by the year 1997 without the assistance of active re-planting.|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand <b>lichen</b> and {{bryophyte}} <b>floras</b> {{are highly}} diverse but are often overlooked in conservation efforts. The islands, estuaries and coastal zones of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park support {{a wide range}} of species of lichens and bryophytes but information on species distributions, threats and critical habitats is not readily available, so is therefore not commonly used in conservation management. Useful information does exist and species lists for some islands and coastal forest remnants have been published in journals such as Tane and the Auckland Botanical Society Journal. Further information can be found in monographs for particular genera. The most complete data can be found in herbarium collections, particularly those in the herbarium of the Auckland Museum and Institute (AK). This and information from other herbarium collections can be accessed online through the New Zealand Virtual Herbarium, although the information is not yet complete and not all collections are databased. National threat listings were done for lichens {{for the first time in}} 2012 and for bryophytes for the third time in 2011, and these publications include a number of threatened species found in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park.
