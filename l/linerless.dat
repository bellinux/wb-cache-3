40|$|NASA {{missions}} {{are becoming increasingly}} more demanding of propulsion capability, driving the mass of propulsion systems higher, even as the science mass of electronics is reduced. Typically, the propulsion tank is the single largest highest dry mass item of an in-space propulsion system. Ultralight <b>linerless</b> composite tanks (ULLCTs) promise to achieve the efficiencies that will make future propulsion systems viable and minimize propulsion system mass growth. ULLCTS may offer up to a 25 percent weight reduction compared to conventional metal lined composite overwrapped tanks, allowing increased reactant storage and/or reduced launch mass. For successful design of such a tank, the composite shell itself is required to provide an integral impermeable barrier, in addition to carrying the pressure and environmental loads for in-space propulsion. Significant materials technologies are required to achieve the microcrack resistance of the composites in order to contain small molecule gases such as helium (He).

40|$|An integrated, generic unibody {{composite}} pressurized structure (UCPS) {{combined with}} a positive expulsion device (PED), consisting of an elastomeric bladder for monopropellant hydrazine, has been quasi-standardized for spacecraft use. The combination functions as an all-composite, non-metallic, propellant tank with bladder. The integrated UCPS combines several previous innovations - specifically, the <b>linerless,</b> all-composite cryogenic tank technology; all-composite boss; resin formulation; and integrated stringer system. The innovation combines the UCPS with an integrated propellant management device (PMD), the PED or bladder, to create an entirely unique system for in-space use. The UCPS is a pressure vessel that incorporates skirts, stringers, and other structures {{so that it is}} both an in-space hydrazine tank, and also a structural support system for a spacecraft in a single, all-composite unit. This innovation builds on the progress {{in the development of a}} previous SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) Phase I with Glenn Research Center and an SBIR III with Johnson Space Center that included the fabrication of two 42 -in. (107 -cm) diameter all-composite cryogenic (LOX and liquid methane) UCPS test tanks for a lunar lander. This Phase II provides hydra zine compatibility testing of the elastomeric bladder, a see-through PED to validate the expulsion process and model, and a complete UCPS-based PED with stringers and skirts that will be used to conduct initial qualification and expulsion tests.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} {{research in the area}} of polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites. This research has shown that the dispersion of small amounts of an organically modified layered silicate improves the polymer strength, modulus, thermal stability, and barrier properties. There have been several reports on the dispersion of layered silicates in an epoxy matrix. Potential enhancements to the barrier properties of epoxy/silicate nanocomposites make this material attractive for low permeability tankage. Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) have several advantages for cryogenic storage tanks. They are lightweight, strong, and stiff; therefore, a smaller fraction of a vehicle's potential payload capacity is used for propellant storage. Unfortunately, the resins typically used to make PMC tanks have higher gas permeability than metals. This can lead to hydrogen loss through the body of the tank instead of just at welds and fittings. One approach to eliminate this problem is to build composite tanks with thin metal liners. However, although these tanks provide good permeability performance, they suffer from a substantial mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion, which can lead to failure of the bond between the liner and the body of the tank. Both problems could be addressed with polymersilicate nanocomposites, which exhibit reduced hydrogen permeability, making them potential candidates for <b>linerless</b> PMC tanks. Through collaboration with Northrop Grumman and Michigan State University, nanocomposite test tanks were manufactured for the NASA Glenn Research Center, and the helium permeability was measured. An organically modified silicate was prepared at Michigan State University and dispersed in an epoxy matrix (EPON 826 /JeffamineD 230). The epoxy/silicate nanocomposites contained either 0 or 5 wt% of the organically modified silicate. The tanks were made by filament winding carbon fibers with the nanocomposite resin. Helium permeability was measured by Northrop Grumman, showing that the leak rate/day of the nanocomposite matrix tank was approximately 80 -percent less than that of the neat epoxy matrix tank...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE The {{choice of}} {{containers}} for storage of aqueous samples between their collection, transport and water hydrogen (2 H) and oxygen (18 O) stable isotope analysis {{is a topic}} of concern {{for a wide range}} of fields in environmental, geological, biomedical, food, and forensic sciences. The transport and separation of water molecules during water vapor or liquid uptake by sorption or solution and the diffusive transport of water molecules through organic polymer material by permeation or pervaporation may entail an isotopic fractionation. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the extent of such fractionation. METHODS Sixteen bottle-like containers of eleven different organic polymers, including low and high density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and perfluoroalkoxy-Teflon (PFA), of different wall thickness and size were completely filled with the same mineral water and stored for 659 ?days under the same conditions of temperature and humidity. Particular care was exercised to keep the bottles tightly closed and prevent loss of water vapor through the seals. RESULTS Changes of up to + 5 parts per thousand for d 2 H values and + 2. 0 parts per thousand for d 18 O values were measured for water after more than 1 ?year of storage within a plastic container, with the magnitude of change depending mainly on the type of organic polymer, wall thickness, and container size. The most important variations were measured for the PET and PC bottles. Waters stored in glass bottles with Polyseal (TM) cone-lined PP screw caps and thick-walled HDPE or PFA containers with <b>linerless</b> screw caps having an integrally molded inner sealing ring preserved their original d 2 H and d 18 O values. The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotope compositions of the organic polymeric materials were also determined. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study clearly show that for precise and accurate measurements of the water stable isotope composition in aqueous solutions, rigorous sampling and storage procedures are needed both for laboratory standards and for unknown samples.

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{are one of}} {{the prospective}} material families being investigated for use in the fuel tanks of future reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). The extreme cryogenic thermo-mechanical loading that these structures experience can lead to damage build-up in the CFRP in the form of microcracking and delamination, which can lead to increased laminate permeability. This work presents a combined experimental and numerical approach for predicting damage and permeability in composite laminates and <b>linerless</b> cryogenic tanks. A novel extended finite element (XFEM) -based methodology for the combined simulation and prediction of thermal fatigue delamination for identification of delaminated crack opening displacement (DCOD) and, hence, composite laminate permeability is presented first. The methodology is validated through simulation of standardised static and fatigue delamination test methods, using computationally efficient modelling techniques. Delamination growth in a quasi-isotropic laminate under cryogenic fatigue loading is used {{to examine the effects of}} initial interlaminar defects on subsequent crack growth, as well as the relationship between delamination length and material permeability based on DCOD values predicted by the new methodology. An experimental investigation into damage formation in CF /PEEK laminates before, during and after cryogenic cycling, using optical microscopy and three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography (CT), is conducted. Thicker laminates were found to exhibit significantly greater microcrack density and delamination when compared to thinner laminates, with lay-up and material type also being important contributing factors. Microcracking induced by thermal residual stresses was also observed in thicker laminates following processing. 3 -D rendering software was used to establish the presence of through thickness crack networks within the laminates, as well as the extent of cracking through the specimen width. Crack opening in inner and off-axis ply groups was found to be significantly less than in outer plies, indicating the importance of these plies for limiting laminate permeability. The presence of voids was found to influence crack nucleation and growth paths within the laminates, with full void volume characterisation presented. A novel computational methodology for predicting three-dimensional microcracking and permeability in composite laminates is presented based on experimental observations and established numerical methods. The methodology simulates (i) microcrack initiation and propagation using XFEM, and (ii) delamination, using a mixed-mode cohesive zone model. Random microcrack initiation is modelled using a random (Weibull) distribution of fracture strengths. The Weibull distribution is adjusted to account for specimen volume, allowing mesh independent crack density predictions. An alternative method is also investigated, based on an elemental representation of defects using measured void geometry. The predicted microcracking and damage distributions are shown to correlate closely with 3 -D X-ray CT scans of cryogenically cycled specimens. Crack opening displacements are consistent with laminate test measurements. Permeabilities, based on the dimensions of the leak paths, were found to be within the measured range for various CF/PEEK materials. Finally, a combined experimental and numerical approach to the design and analysis of tape-laid composite cryogenic tanks is presented. A detailed material and defect characterisation of automated tape-laid CF/PEEK was undertaken using optical micrography and 3 -D X-ray CT, as well as cryogenic testing to investigate damage formation. Resulting material data is used as input to a novel XFEM-cohesive zone methodology which is used to predict intra- and inter-ply damage in an internally pressurised cryogenic tank. An optimised tank lay-up is presented and tested using the numerical method to ensure resistance to microcrack formation and fuel leakage through the tanks walls under operating loads...|$|E
