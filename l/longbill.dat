25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, <b>longbill</b> spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E
6000|$|<b>Longbill</b> chuckled. [...] "That's easy," [...] said he. [...] "I've got the handiest {{bill that}} ever was. See here!" [...] <b>Longbill</b> {{suddenly}} thrust his bill straight {{out in front}} of him and to Peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all. [...] "That's the way I get them," [...] said he. [...] "I can feel them when I reach them, and then I just open the top of my bill and grab them. I think there is one right under my feet now; watch me get him." [...] <b>Longbill</b> bored into the ground until his head was almost against it. When he pulled his bill out, sure enough, there was a worm. [...] "Of course," [...] explained <b>Longbill,</b> [...] "it is only in soft ground that I can do this. That is why I have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My cousin, Jack Snipe, can," [...] replied <b>Longbill</b> promptly. [...] "He {{feeds the}} same way I do, only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps. Perhaps you know him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly I'll excuse you," [...] replied Peter, staring around {{very hard}} {{to see what it}} could be <b>Longbill</b> was making such a good meal of. But Peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat. There wasn't even a bug or a worm {{crawling}} on the ground. <b>Longbill</b> took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion. Peter had to hide a smile, for <b>Longbill</b> had such an air of importance, {{yet at the same time}} was such an odd looking fellow. He was quite a little bigger than Welcome Robin, his tail was short, his legs were short, and his neck was short. But his bill was long enough to make up. His back was a mixture of gray, brown, black and buff, while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish-buff. It was his head that made him look queer. His eyes were very big and they were set so far back that Peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Longbill</b> nodded. [...] "Of course," [...] said he. [...] "You don't {{suppose we}} would take the trouble to bore one of them if we didn't know that we would get a worm {{at the end of}} it, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly <b>Longbill</b> plunged {{his bill}} into the ground. He plunged {{it in for}} the whole length. Then he pulled it out and Peter {{caught a glimpse of}} the tail end of a worm disappearing down Longbill's throat. Where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole. For the first time Peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about. [...] "Did you make all those little round holes?" [...] exclaimed Peter.|$|E
50|$|Macrosphenus is a genus of African warblers, {{formerly}} {{placed in}} the Sylviidae family. The genus {{is one of two}} in that family known as <b>longbills.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Melanocharitidae, the berrypeckers and <b>longbills,</b> {{is a small}} bird family {{restricted}} to the forests of New Guinea. The family contains ten species in four (sometimes three) genera. They are small songbirds with generally dull plumage but a range of body shapes.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{with the common}} names, as {{there are two other}} berrypecker species in the tiny family Paramythiidae, once considered to be close to the flowerpeckers as well; members of several African genera—notably species in the Old World warbler genus Macrosphenus—are also known as <b>longbills.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{too scared}} to come back, anyway," [...] said <b>Longbill</b> himself, {{dropping}} down {{just in front of}} Peter. [...] "I recognized you just as I was disappearing over the tops of the bushes, so I came right back. I learned when I was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards {{whether or not there is}} real danger. I am glad it is no one but you, Peter, for I was having a splendid meal here, and I should have hated to leave it. You'll excuse me while I go on eating, I hope. We can talk between bites." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter {{remembered how}} he had watched Welcome Robin listen and then {{suddenly}} plunge his bill {{into the ground and}} pull out a worm. But the worms Welcome Robin got were always close to the surface, while these worms were so deep in the earth that Peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there. Welcome Robin could see when he got hold of a worm, but <b>Longbill</b> couldn't. [...] "Even if you know there is a worm down there in the ground, {{how do you know when}} you've reached him? And how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in?" [...] asked Peter.|$|E
6000|$|When Peter {{thinks of}} {{something}} to do he wastes no time. Off he started, lipperty-lipperty-lip, for the Smiling Pool. He kept {{close to the edge}} of the Green Forest until he reached the place where the Laughing Brook comes out of the Green Forest on its way to the Smiling Pool in the Green Meadows. Bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the Laughing Brook at this point. The ground was soft in places, quite muddy. Peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly. From right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound. It startled Peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head. He had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes. Then Peter chuckled. [...] "I declare," [...] said he, [...] "I had forgotten all about my old friend, <b>Longbill</b> the Woodcock. He scared me for a second." ...|$|E
50|$|They have drab-coloured plumage in greys, browns {{or black}} and white. The berrypeckers exhibit some sexual {{dimorphism}} in their plumage. The berrypeckers resemble stout short-billed honeyeaters, and the <b>longbills</b> are like drab sunbirds or short-tailed honeyeaters. The calls of the berrypeckers {{have been described}} as high pitched and faint, and the song rapid.|$|R
50|$|The berrypeckers and <b>longbills</b> are not {{considered}} to be threatened by human activities. No species is listed as threatened by the IUCN, although one species, the obscure berrypecker, is listed as data deficient. That species is known officially from two collected specimens, but unconfirmed reports suggest that it is not uncommon in remote parts of New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|The satinbirds or cnemophilines, are a family, Cnemophilidae of {{passerine}} birds {{which consists}} of three species found in the mountain forests of New Guinea. They were originally thought {{to be part of}} the birds-of-paradise family Paradisaeidae until genetic research suggested that the birds are not closely related to birds-of-paradise at all and are perhaps closer to berry peckers and <b>longbills</b> (Melanocharitidae). The current evidence suggests that their closest relatives may be the cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae).|$|R
50|$|The dwarf <b>longbill,</b> spectacled <b>longbill,</b> plumed <b>longbill</b> or dwarf honeyeater (Oedistoma iliolophus) is {{a species}} of bird in the Melanocharitidae family.It is found in New Guinea.Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.|$|E

50|$|The berrypeckers are {{generally}} montane species, with only one, the black berrypecker, being found in lowland forest. In contrast the <b>longbills</b> live in lowland forests and low montane forests {{as well as}} on small islands around New Guinea. Amongst the berrypeckers there is a succession of species at different altitudes, with the black berrypecker being found in the lowlands, the mid-mountain berrypecker being found at lower altitudes (mid-montane) and the fan-tailed berrypecker being found near the treeline.|$|R
50|$|The African warblers inhabit a {{range of}} {{habitats}} in sub-Saharan Africa. These range from primary rainforest to forest edge and open woodland habitats for the <b>longbills,</b> wooded savanna to arid scrubland and bushland in the crombecs, rocky arid scree areas and grassland for the rockrunner, and grassland for the moustached grass warbler and Cape grassbird. The family is overwhelmingly non-migratory, although the moustached grass warbler and the northern crombec both make some localised movements in West Africa related to the rainy season.|$|R
50|$|Both {{species of}} painted berrypecker are endemic {{to the islands}} of New Guinea, one of two {{families}} to be restricted to the island (the other being the berrypeckers and <b>longbills).</b> Both species are restricted to montane areas, usually above 2200 m, though the tit berrypecker does occur as far down as 850 on occasions, and that species has a generally lower distribution than the crested berrypecker. Both species are arboreal birds of montane forest, particularly mossy forest. At higher altitudes the crested berrypecker will also inhabit stunted alpine forest and alpine thickets. It is unknown if the two species make any migratory movements, {{although it has been}} suggested that the tit berrypecker may be partly nomadic.|$|R

50|$|The exact {{limits of}} the family {{have been the subject}} of {{revision}} as well. The three species of satinbird (the genera Cnemophilus and Loboparadisea) were treated as a subfamily of the birds-of-paradise, Cnemophilinae. In spite of differences in the mouth, foot morphology and nesting habits they remained in the family until a 2000 study moved them to a separate family closer to the berrypeckers and <b>longbills</b> (Melanocharitidae). The same study found that the Macgregor's bird-of-paradise was actually a member of the large Australasian honeyeater family. In addition to these three species, a number of systematically enigmatic species and genera have been considered potential members of this family. The two species in the genus Melampitta, also from New Guinea, have been linked with the birds-of-paradise, but their relationships remain uncertain, more recently being linked with the Australian mudnesters. The silktail of Fiji has been linked with the birds-of-paradise many times since its discovery, but never formally assigned to the family. Recent molecular evidence now places the species with the fantails.|$|R
25|$|The true {{evolutionary}} affinities of the sittellas {{have long}} been clouded by their close resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere nuthatches. As late as 1967 the sittellas were retained in that family by some authorities, although doubts about that placement had been voiced in the previous decades. Both their climbing technique and overall morphology are extremely similar; however they differ both in their sociality and their nesting behaviour, as sittellas create nests on branches whereas nuthatches nest in cavities in trees. In addition {{the specifics of the}} morphology of the leg differed, with sittellas having leg muscles more {{similar to those of the}} honeyeaters. Their placement was then moved to various families, including the Old World babblers (an infamous wastebin taxon), the true treecreepers (Certhiidae, which range across the Holarctic and Africa) and the Australian treecreepers (Climacteridae). Their relationship with the Australian radiation of passerines was suggested by S.A. Parker on the basis of egg colour, nest structure and nestling plumage, and their position in this radiation was vindicated by Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA–DNA hybridization studies. These researchers placed the sittellas in a monotypic tribe within the superfamily Corvidae. Today they are afforded their own family in a clade close to the berrypeckers and <b>longbills</b> (Melanocharitidae) and the whistlers (Pachycephalidae).|$|R
