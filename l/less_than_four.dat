5|$|In Spain, Benidorm {{played a}} similar role as Cannes. Shortly after the bikini was banned in Spain, Pedro Zaragoza, {{the mayor of}} Benidorm {{convinced}} dictator Francisco Franco that his town needed to legalize the bikini to draw tourists.

Interestingly, in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> years since Franco's death in 1979, Spanish beaches and women had gone topless.|$|E

Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read.

5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 {{was thrown into}} a {{different}} light by events <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E

5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|Bursać {{was born}} on 2August 1920 {{in the village of}} Kamenica, near Drvar in the region of Bosanska Krajina, the {{north-western}} sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina (then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929). The Drvar area was inhabited primarily by ethnic Serbs, with Bosnian Muslims and Croats forming <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> percent of the population. Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife, Joka, who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm. Like other village girls, Bursać did not go to school—only the boys attended elementary school in Drvar. A shepherdess until age fourteen, she later helped her mother with housekeeping and agricultural work. Bursać became skilled at weaving, spinning, knitting and embroidery before completing a six-month tailoring course in Drvar.|$|E
