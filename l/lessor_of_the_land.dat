This practice, again, may lead, unless checked, to serious difficulties.

The NER's scheme was submitted in 1862, and in the same session the SYR submitted a bill with clauses enabling it to modify a previously permitted line from Doncaster to Thorne (South Yorkshire Railway Act, 1862.) to add a junction and branch north to near the Selby-Bawtry turnpike, northwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Thorne.|$|R

In the court cases that followed, Independent Air was judged to be negligent based on the following statement: [...] "undisputed facts show that the pilot and crew flew the plane below an altitude of 3,000 feet, when their charts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area clearly showed that it was dangerous to go below 3,000 feet because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. The pilot in command cannot excuse his act by alleging the air traffic controller directed him to descend to an altitude of 2,000 feet and gave him an incorrect altimeter setting.

Ten years earlier the school had 300 pupils, but since then the numbers had gradually diminished. Incredibly the inspectors who had visited the school only the year before had decided to do nothing when they had been told about the dire financial situation. For that summer term there were just seven pupils and seven teachers, three of who were working loyally without claiming pay to get their pupils through their O-levels. The school had been recognised as efficient in 1969, but due to <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> recognition being abolished in 1976, there was nothing the inspectors could do {{as long as they were}} satifisfied with the teaching.|$|R
