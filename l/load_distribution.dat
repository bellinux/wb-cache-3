In order to demonstrate the capability of the coupled method, comparisons between the calculated results and the available experimental data of the rotor blade flapping motion for a model rotor are presented covering conditions from hover through forward flight.

40|$|Summary. -In {{an attempt}} to avoid flow {{separation}} {{at the leading edge}} of a thin delta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed there. This is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached-flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift coefficient. For sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given in terms of slender-wing theory and the <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> corresponding to arbitrary conical camber are calculated. For supersonic speeds, <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> arising in the slender-wing theory are considered and the corresponding conical-camber distributions are found by linearized theory. The lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these <b>load</b> <b>distributions.</b> It is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these conically-cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached flow (in which leadingedge suction occurs) past the uncambered wing at the same Mach number, as more terms are included in the linear combination. However, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable reduction is predicted. The corresponding <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> and wing shapes are calculated and drawn. The optimum shapes for a fixed number of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their leading edges, so that the localized leading-edge suction is replaced by a distributed force on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar magnitude. 1.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{model for}} the {{estimation}} of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability frequency, {{in the case of}} short laminar separation bubbles over airfoils, has been developed. To this end, the Thwaites's pressure gradient parameter has been adopted to account for the effects induced by the aerodynamic <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> {{as well as by the}} Reynolds number on the separated shear layer thickness at separation. The most amplified frequency predicted by linear stability theory (LST) for a piecewise linear profile, which can be considered as the KH instability frequency, has been related to the shear layer thickness at separation, hence to the Reynolds number and the aerodynamic <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> through the Thwaites's pressure gradient parameter. This procedure allows the formulation of a functional dependency between the Strouhal number of the shedding frequency based on exit conditions and the dimensionless parameters. Experimental results obtained in different test cases, characterized by different Reynolds numbers and aerodynamic <b>loading</b> <b>distributions,</b> have been used to validate the model, as well as to identify the regression curve best fitting the data.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} analyze the effects of {{resistance}} training on functional performance, lower-limb <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> and balance in older women with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and osteoarthritis (OA) in the contralateral knee. In addition, this older knee OA and TKA group (OKG) was compared to older (OG) and young women (YG) without musculoskeletal diseases who underwent the same resistance training program. METHODS: Twenty-three women divided into OKG (N = 7), OG (N = 8) and YG (N = 8) had their functional performance, lower-limb <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> and balance compared before and after 13 weeks of a twice-weekly progressive resistance training program. RESULTS: At baseline, the OKG showed lower functional performance and unilateral balance, and impaired lower-limb <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> compared to the OG and the YG (p< 0. 05). After resistance training, the OKG showed improvements in functional performance (similar to 13 % in sit-to-stand and rising from the floor, similar to 16 % in stair-climbing and similar to 23 % in 6 -minute walking (6 MW)), unilateral balance (similar to 72 % and, 78 % in TKA and OA leg, respectively) and lower-limb <b>loading</b> <b>distribution,</b> which were greater than those observed in the OG and the YG. The OKG showed post-training 6 MW performance {{similar to that of}} the OG at baseline. Sit-to-stand performance and unilateral stand balance were further restored to post-training levels of the OG and to baseline levels of the YG. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training partially restored functional, balance and lower-limb loading deficits in older women with TKA and OA in the contralateral knee. These results suggest that resistance training may be an important tool to counteract mobility impairments commonly found in this population...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith the {{continuous}} ageing of infrastructures, live <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> related to actual traffic {{has become one}} of the key inputs in asset management. However, it is also one fraught with difficulty, due to its complex and dynamic nature, which can only be addressed at a network level. At this level, it is impossible to envisage in-situ SHM systems installed for all critical assets. In this context, the development of reliable alternative techniques to estimate live <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> would be a valuable addition to infrastructure asset management tools. As is well known, the accuracy of such estimates depends on several factors such as road capacity, asset condition/performance, traffic composition and seasonal effects, among others. Thus, the deployment of in-situ asset-specific systems needs to be complemented with other types of monitoring systems based on inexpensive and easy to install traffic flow sensors (point and line) in order to infer, with acceptable accuracy, rather than measure directly the live <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> pertinent to different asset types on the network. This paper presents an approach to derive <b>load</b> <b>distributions</b> based on a Transport Infrastructure Utilisation and Maintenance Framework by utilizing recent advances achieved in two, often non-communicating, fields: structural engineering and transportation engineering. From the realm of transport analysis, the parameter ÔflowÕ has been combined with the parameter Ôlive loadÕ pertinent to structural performance. Taking advantage of traffic flow sensor systems, the aim is to examine how information related to the former enables the understanding and modelling of the latter, thus paving the way for smart transport mobility technology to be harnessed by the structural asset management community...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} {{and application of}} a three-dimensional inverse methodology in which the blade geometry is computed {{on the basis of}} the speci cation of static pressure <b>loading</b> <b>distribution</b> is presented. The methodology is based on the intensive use of computational uid dynamics (CFD) to account for three-dimensional subsonic and transonic viscous ows. In the design computation, the necessary blade changes are determined directly by the discrepancies between the target and initial values, and the calculation converges to give the nal blade geometry and the corresponding steady state ow solution. The application of the method is explored using a transonic test case, NASA rotor 67. Based on observations, it is conclusive that the shock formation and its intensity in such a high-speed turbomachinery ow are well de ned on the <b>loading</b> <b>distributions.</b> Pressure <b>loading</b> is therefore as effective a design parameter as conventional inverse design quantities such as static pressure. Hence, from an understandingof the dynamics of the ow in the fan in relation to its pressure <b>loading</b> <b>distributions,</b> simple guidelines can be developed for the inverse method in order to weaken the shock formation. A qualitative improvement in performance is achieved in the redesigned fan. The nal ow eld result is con rmed by a well-established commercial CFD package...|$|R
