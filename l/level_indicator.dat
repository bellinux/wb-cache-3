On the reverse, it had a battery <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> light (activated by a button) and a three-position switch to turn the unit off or set it to play music in order or shuffled. It plugged {{directly}} into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to the iPod Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear the iPod Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E
60|$|We had a sort {{of endless}} band of bottles sliding along an {{inclined}} glass trough made slippery with running water. At one end a girl held them up to the light, put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough; the filling was automatic; at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet. Each tank, the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water, had a <b>level</b> <b>indicator,</b> and inside I had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low. Another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer papers and put them, with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair, into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packing-case. It sounds wild, I know, but I believe I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent medicines through the side of the packing-case, to discover there was a better way in than by the lid. Our cases packed themselves, practically; had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs, who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side. Our girls, moreover, packed with corrugated paper and matchbook-wood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and much waste and confusion.|$|E

Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening.

This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> (gauge glass) is faulty. A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Some of most used {{indicators}} {{in marine}} ecology are nucleic acid-derived indices. They {{can be divided}} by target levels in three groups: 1) at the organism <b>level</b> as ecophysiologic <b>indicators,</b> indicators such as RNA:DNA ratios, DNA:dry weight and RNA:protein, 2) at the population <b>level,</b> <b>indicators</b> such as growth rate, starvation incidence or fisheries impact indicators, and 3) at the community <b>level,</b> <b>indicators</b> such as trophic interactions, exergy indices and prey identification. The nucleic acids derived indices, especially RNA:DNA ratio, have been applied with success as indicators of nutritional condition, well been and growth in marine organisms. They are also useful as indicators of natural or anthropogenic impacts in marine population and communities, such as upwelling or dredge fisheries, respectively. They can help in understanding important issues of marine ecology such as trophic interactions in marine environment, fish and invertebrate recruitment failure and biodiversity changes, without laborious work of counting, measuring and identification of small marine organisms. Besides the objective of integrate nucleic acid derived indices across levels of organization, the paper will also include a general characterization of most used nucleic acid derived indices in marin...|$|R
40|$|The Last Interglacial (LIG) stage (ca. 130 115 ka), with polar {{temperatures}} likely 3 5 ◦ C {{warmer than}} today, {{serves as a}} partial analogue for low-end future warming scenarios. Multiple indicators suggest that LIG global sea level (GSL) was higher than at present; based upon a small set of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators,</b> the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 's Fourth Assessment Report inferred an elevation of approximately 4 6 m. While this estimate may be correct, it is based upon overly simplistic assumptions {{about the relationship between}} local sea level and global sea level. Sea level is often viewed as a simple function of changing global ice volume. This perspective neglects local variability, which arises from several factors, including the distortion of the geoid and the elastic and isostatic deformation of the solid Earth by shifting ice masses. Accurate reconstruction of past global and local sea levels, as well as ice sheet volumes, therefore requires integrating globally distributed data sets of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators.</b> To assess the robustness of the IPCC's global estimate and search for patterns in local sea level that are diagnostic of meltwater sources, we have compiled a comprehensive database that includes a variety of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> from 47 localities, as well as a global sea level record derived from oxygen isotopes. We generate a global synthesis from these data using a novel statistical approach that couples Gaussian process regression to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation of geochronological errors. Our analysis strongly supports th...|$|R
