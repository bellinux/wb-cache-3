5000|$|TBV is {{produced}} in two different geographical areas of the Emilia Romagna Region so that two different designations were granted by the European Council, i.e. Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (TBVM) and Traditional Balsamico Vinegar of Reggio Emilia (TBVRE). The two special vinegars are very similar products as the overall making procedure is the same; but, from a legal point of view, they are obtained according to specific and official production regulations defining (1) {{the basis of the}} vineyards ampelographic; (2) geographical area of production; (3) characteristics of starting materials; (4) making procedure; (5) the chemical, physical and sensorial requirements for sale; (6) bottling, <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation.</b> The sensory profile of TBV is evaluated by hedonicjudgment expressed through a numeric score. The sensory score achieved is used to rank TBV in different commercial classes. The specific regulations allow adding [...] "Extra Vecchio" [...] to the official designation when the product is aged for 25 years at least. However, under existing regulations, neither the definition of [...] "aging" [...] nor the methods for its objective evaluation are specified; it is evaluated only through panel-tasting tests, whose effectiveness for this purpose is clearly inadequate. TBV results as a blend of vinegars of different composition and age due to the traditional making procedure. Actually, an easy-to-use mathematical method for evaluating the actual residence time of TBV within each cask of the barrel set has been recently published. This method is an adequate tool helping aging certification. An easy-to-use spreadsheet of the theoretical model is available for download here. At present, however, independent agencies that officially state TBV authenticity of both the TBVM and TBVRE haven't adopted it or any analogous procedure as an evaluation system.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} how dierent aspects {{connected with}} regulations can in uence consumer quality perception {{and the value}} that consumers attribute to wine sector products. In particular, aspects concerning <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> of designations of origin, which, in turn, mirror dierent regulations of production methods, are considered. Consumer preference can allow enterprises to comply with more restrictive rules and sustain higher costs for dierentiating their products and achieving higher quality. When choosing a product, consumers do not evaluate each single quality factor but the product as a whole, therefore the analysis {{has to be done}} with a methodology considering both the combination of all characteristics of the product, and the contribution of every factor to the creation of value for consumers. For this reason the value that consumers attribute to dierent characteristics is evaluated through an experimental economic analysis applying the method of the Conjoint analysis. The experiment was realized evaluating dierent labels of a protected designation of origin "Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC" wine, with two dierent groups of consumers: a group of inhabitants of the Abruzzo Region, the region of origin of the wine, and a group of Brazilian people (inhabitants of the Santa Catarina State) ...|$|E

The potential difference between a ‘snack’ and a ‘meal’ illustrates these factors {{and the way in}} which they interact, particularly in terms of the label used to describe food and the way it is presented. To date no research has specifically explored the independent and combined impact of <b>label</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> on eating behaviour. Using a preload / taste test design this experimental study evaluated the impact of label (‘snack’ vs. ‘meal’) and place (‘snack’ vs. ‘meal’) of a preload on changes in desire to eat and subsequent food intake. Eighty female participants consumed a pasta preload which labelled as either a ‘snack’ or a ‘meal’ and presented as either a ‘snack’ (standing and eating from a container) or a ‘meal’ (eating at a table from a plate), generating four conditions. The results showed main effects of <b>label</b> <b>and</b> place with participants consuming significantly more sweet mass at the taste test when the preload had been <b>labelled</b> a ‘snack’ <b>and</b> more total mass and calories when the preload had been presented as a ‘snack’. No label by place interactions were found. The results also showed a combined effect of both <b>label</b> <b>and</b> place with those who had eaten the preload both <b>labelled</b> <b>and</b> presented as a ‘snack’ consuming significantly more in terms of nearly all measures of food intake than those in the other conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} reasons why the level of wastage of {{agricultural}} output, particularly of fruit and vegetables, is very high in the UAE in general and Abu Dhabi Municipality in particular, and the role of marketing in the situation. The Abu Dhabi agricultural region was used as the case-study for the investigation. After some literature review, the study examines the performance of the agricultural sector in the UAE since the establishment of agricultural policies geared towards developing the sector. The findings show that the sector has developed very rapidly, resulting in increased output over the years. The agricultural policies of the government are effective in encouraging farmers to produce more output through intensive and extensive farming. The main findings of the research are divided into two. First, the findings show that marketing of fruit and vegetables is very poor in the Abu Municipality. The government policy of purchasing whatever farmers produce to encourage agricultural development has meant a huge increase in production but this has not been matched by the form and level of marketing of the products. There is absolutely no promotion of local fruit and vegetables, the packaging, <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> are poor, the distribution channels are poorly managed and the pricing system has no bearing on the cost structure of agricultural activity or competition in the market. Above all, no marketing research is undertaken to understand the market and its requirements and, more so, to build up a marketing database and information flow for marketing planning. However, no marketing plan has every been developed for the marketing of fruit and vegetables in Abu Dhabi.

40|$|Organic food’s initial {{attraction}} to the public {{was that it was}} perceived to be healthier and tastier, but scientists and policy makers have mainly stressed the benefits to the environment of organic and sustainable farming. Scientific support for marketing actions addressed to those who want to be healthier and who want to enjoy better taste, and are willing to pay more for these benefits is scarce. Past research has produced little clear evidence about the importance of sensory characteristics such as taste, smell, appearance etc in consumers’ preferences with regard to organic food. The Ecropolis project, funded by the E. U., was set up with the aim of investigating the role of the senses in consumers’ preferences regarding organic food, and leading to research into how best to satisfy those preferences. This deliverable is aimed at providing a solid basis for such research with an in-depth review of, and two reports on, the relevant scientific literature. The first report (Annex I) regards what consumers expect from organic products in terms of taste, smell, appearance, etc and how these expectations are (or are not) met; the second is about the science of the senses (Annex II). The first project tasks included creating and agreeing on a glossary of terms, deciding on search criteria (key words, etc.), setting up a bibliographical data base, preparing then circulating the above-mentioned reports, and finally preparing a summary of the reports. The report on consumers expectations highlights the suggestion that while organic food has traditionally been marketed through specialized retailers, its market share will only grow significantly if it is promoted by multiple retailers. Research literature {{from all over the world}} seems to agree in indicating that consumers’ choices are largely motivated by health, the environment, price and social status. Other considerations include ethics, the localness of the product and lifestyle choices. The literature also indicates that the organic market will expand significantly only if consumers are more willing, and able, to recognize quality, but this presents serious issues. When buying the product they cannot personally verify its quality and genuineness and thus must rely on regulation and inspection bodies. The recognition of quality can also be encouraged by effective communication by producers and retailers through appropriate branding, <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation.</b> There are connections between this information and questions of sense perception, but researchers disagree about how important the latter is in influencing the customer, and in which ways it does so. The following report focuses, in fact, on the science of the senses, which tries to analyze in detail people’s responses to food, despite the many potential pitfalls in carrying out the research which might influence the reliability of the results. There is broad agreement on two points: - there is no proof that organic food is more nutritious or safer, and - most studies that have compared the taste and organoleptic quality of organic andconventional foods report no consistent or significant differences between organic and conventional produce. Therefore, claiming that all organic food tastes different from all conventional food would not be correct. However, among the well-designed studies with respect to fruits and vegetables that have found differences, the vast majority favour organic produce. Organic produce tends to store better and has longer shelf life, probably because of lower levels of nitrates and higher average levels of antioxidants. The former can accelerate food spoilage, while antioxidants help preserve the integrity of cells and some are natural antibiotics. The first conclusion may, however, depend on factors not directly connected to organic farming, such as harvesting and storage methods and the type of land used for growing the food. About the second finding it must be considered that measuring organoleptic quality is difficult and inherently subjective and evaluations may be clouded by the influence of numerous factors on the consumer’s perceptions of the food and not just its appearance and taste. Experimental research indicates that the information that a food is organic confers upon it a “halo effect” (making it seem better sense-wise simply because it is organic) which might make consumers like it more. Ecropolis researchers will analyze in detail which senses are indeed impacted on, and how, and try to match them to consumer needs and expectations in order to be able to offer suggestions for future policy, including how the food is stored, transported and presented, which is also essential for maintaining sensory properties. The workpackage WP 1 has also produced a specific report on how organic food sensory aspects are regulated. International standards, with some important exceptions, are largely in line with European ones. Differences in standards usually regard whether there is orientation towards freshness “per se” as opposed to increasing shelf-life, or quality standardization as opposed to quality differentiation. Differences in regulations regard such aspects as ingredients, additives, processing aids and methods, packaging, storage and transport. The lack of harmony among the different regulatory systems often reflects different traditions and market conditions, however, more complicated compliance procedures result in higher costs for importers. Greater homogeneity would not only reduce such costs but would also increase consumer confidence in international standards. Ecropolis will also investigate the effect of different regulations on how people perceive organic goods sense-wise. The work done to date is seen as a starting point for future research aimed at producing practical results in the organic food market. Ecropolis will try to bring together separate strands of research concerning how organic goods are regulated and marketed with regard to taste, appearance, etc., and how consumers themselves are affected by such factors. The aim is to find optimal matches between the two, and thus to greatly increase organic food’s share of the food market...|$|E

The contrasting object formats were: an unstructured display versus a thematically grouped one. The text variations were: single block labels versus a series of multiple labels with bold headings. Goal statements were either present or absent from the other format combinations. The treatment combinations were successively varied within one museum display case. They were evaluated using observation of visitor movement patterns and timed viewing, and written test scores and visitor comment responses. The results of these measurements were analysed using a comparison of treatment means, multiple regression, chi square, and correlation coefficients. The results provide conclusions regarding the use of bold headings, orientating statements, and thematic displays.

40|$|Food labels {{describe}} {{the content of}} a food and are intended to guide the consumer in food selection. The nutrition information provided must be in consistency with legal requirements and dietary recommendations. Selection of the specific nutrients or food components to be listed should further take into account label space, the analytical feasibility of measuring the particular nutritional component within the food matrix, and the relative costs of such analyses. Information provided on labels should be truthful and not mislead consumers. At the same time, labeling regulations should provide incentives to manufacturers to develop products that promote public health and assist consumers in following dietary recommendations. In some countries some {{segments of the population}} benefit from information about the composition of foods. In such cases, countries should consider the need to provide for appropriate <b>labeling</b> <b>and</b> its <b>presentation</b> relative to existing regulations. Different approaches and legal requirements have been established. These create difficulties in developing <b>and</b> harmonizing <b>labels,</b> which have broad international applications.

Ratings suggested that disgust could be evoked through all senses; they were highest for visual stimuli. However, autonomic reaction towards disgusting stimuli differed according to the channel of presentation. In contrast to the other, olfactory disgust stimuli provoked a strong decrease of systolic blood pressure. Additionally, labeling enhanced disgust ratings and autonomic reaction for olfactory and tactile, but not for visual and auditory stimuli. Repeated presentation indicated that participant’s disgust rating diminishes to all but olfactory disgust stimuli.
