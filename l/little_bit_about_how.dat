500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>how</b> people live. And then the end is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|R

So inspired by that, the album came out that way...I still love that album very much...it came together in a very natural way. The songs were sometimes written in a day, it did take time to work it out more, the way it sounded in the end, but it was like the ideas and the whole concepts of certain songs were written mostly in one day, the chorus and the verses." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this talk}} I will {{summarize}} {{some of the}} work that the CfA group has done to study the structure of the water masers in the accretion disk of NGC 4258. A series of 18 epochs of VLBA data taken from 1997. 3 to 2000. 8 were used for this study. The vertical distribution of maser features in the systemic group was found to have a Gaussian distribution, as expected for hydrostatic equilibrium, with a σ-width of 5. 1 µas. If the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium, its temperature is about 600 K. The systemic features exhibit a small, but persistent, gradient in acceleration versus impact parameter. This characteristic may indicate the presence of a spiral density wave rotating at sub-Keplerian speed. A more precise understanding of the dynamical properties of the disk is expected to lead to a more refined estimate of the distance to the galaxy. Please forgive my slightly flamboyant title, it’s really not me, but it reveals a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> enamored I have been with the galaxy NGC 4258 for almost 15 years now since the Nobeyama group (Nakai, Inouye & Miyoshi 1993) first discovered the high velocity maser features in its water vapor spectrum, whic...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} from any subject fields started to adopt agent based modelling to get deeper insight into complex system {{which are not}} well-captured by using traditional modelling approach. By using this, modeller can build the simulation {{from the bottom up}} which means, even the modeller may not have any idea about how the system as a general works and behaves, as long as modeller knows a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the objects works or behaves individually within the system, then the simulation can be built. This advantage may be useful to model the complicated system which the individual objects within the system are easier to be observed such as human oriented system. Therefore, human behaviour modelling will be great concern since it will affect the internal decision making system. Different methods have been used to represent human behaviour in the previous researches such as probabilistic method, fuzzy logic method, BDI, etc. Through this study, comparison of different methods to represent human behaviour has been conducted to see whether it can influence the outcomes of the simulation with the same scenario. Three methods that have been compared were probabilistic method, fuzzy logic method, and combination of fuzzy logic and probabilistic method. In this study, three simulation models that modelling daily work of software development working team have been built. Each simulation model implemented different method separately. At the end of the study, it can be concluded that different methods of human behaviour representation in the simulation model can affect the outcome simulation even if it simulated the same scenario...|$|E

40|$|First of all, I’d like {{to thank}} Fay very much for in-viting me to speak. I just want to explain a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> PCP {{developed}} for me over the years. When I was younger I used to hear people talking, articulating differently about ‘reality ’ with such cer-tainty, what was right, what was wrong, morality, political, social. It did seem very confusing to me, {{they seemed to be}} talking about different realities. When I was a young whippersnapper, I had sev-eral experiences {{in the middle of the}} night – which were not induced by any substances – which have informed me ever since, which has not been ex-plained by anything. It was like having an altered state of consciousness, everything seemed awe-somely strange, like I was a stranger in a strange world. It was like looking from a nothingness into a somethingness. As far as the world was concerned it seemed strange that anything exists, not just the world, but my own consciousness. And through these experiences I realised that even our most advanced human knowledge com-pared to this vast awesomeness was very limited. Beyond was an ontological, fundamental mystery. Later, much later, when I read the question “why is there something rather than nothing”, it made a lot of sense to me. So I began to search in my own way to find frameworks that touched on this experi-ence, for years, looking for elements of these, which I realise now I was looking for a range of conven-ience, a range of fit, but nothing really explained it. I used to read all sorts of things like existentialism (Macquarrie, 1972), phenomenological sociology (Berger & Luckmann, 1966) – which talked abou...|$|E
40|$|These lectures {{will cover}} the {{relationship}} of SU_ 3 and the weak interactions. The lectures will be geared for experimental people {{so that they may}} get an idea of how our theoretical predictions arise. At first, I will speak a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> calculations are made for the weak decays, then we shall consider SU_ 3, and finally the effects of unitary symmetry upon the weak interactions. The subject matter is split in this way so that one may get a clearer idea of the origins of the various problems in the theory of weak interactions. Not all of our difficulties arise from SU, nor do all of the successes, and it is important to realize this. The theory of weak decays is very unsatisfactory except that it agrees with experiment. To understand that remark let us consider the muon. A muon is a particle which has exactly the same properties as the electron except that its mass is 207 times the mass of the electron. This statement completely describes our experiments with the muon, but such a comment is also unsatisfactory for a true theorist. Experimentalists find a beautiful and simple thing which is easy for the theorists to describe. Nevertheless, we must be unhappy about this situation because we have no idea of why this particle exists. Similarly, the theory of weak decay, up {{to the point where we}} encounter strangeness changing interact ions, is accurate but unsatisfactory. There are various mysterious properties which I shall mention as I go on, but I should like to remind you that the most mysterious aspect of the weak decays is that they exist at all. It seems so much simpler just to forget them. There is no clue from electromagnetism, from gravity, or from nuclear forces that the weak interactions must exist. They seem to have no connection with the rest of the world...|$|E
40|$|A {{couple of}} years ago I was invited to write a story about myself for the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award. I called it “Word Play. ”[1] You can read it on my parc web page or in the December 2007 issue of Computational Linguistics. That piece starts with my arrival in Bloomington in 1964 but it doesn’t tell the story of how I got here and it quickly skips to my stay at the rand {{corporation}} in Santa Monica, CA and at UT Austin. So I will take this opportunity to tell you a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> I got here {{and some of the things}} I still remember about my short stay in Bloomington. 1 I graduated from high school in Tampere, Finland in 1959 and spent a miserable year doing my military service in the Finnish Army. Arriving at the University of Helsinki in the Fall of 1960, I had no idea what I wanted to study. In the Finnish university system at the time, there was no notion of a general undergraduate education. One had to choose a small set of fields of study from the start. I ended up majoring in the Finnish language with a minor in Psychology. But I wasn’t interested in either of those subjects. My passion at the time was poetry. I discovered that two of the girls in my entering class of students of Finnish, Maija Turunen and Anja Kosonen, had just published collections of poems right out of high school [2, 3]. Maija was a daughter of Aimo Turunen, one of our professors of Finnish. I had a hopeless crush on Anja. Another friend I made at the time was Auli Hakulinen, the daughter of Lauri Hakulinen, the most senior professor of Finnish in the department. It was thanks to Maija and Auli that I landed in Bloomington in the Fall of 1964. They both preceded me here. I will come to that shortly. I did not attend many classes during my first two undergraduate years in Helsinki. I wrote a lot of poems, among them a wedding poem for Anja who 1 This is the written version of the speech the author gave in accepting the “Distinguishe...|$|E

40|$|Nature 2 ̆ 7 s {{not what}} it used to be. Consider the following. In 2001 alone, {{scientists}} and so-called 2 ̆ 7 lifescience 2 ̆ 7 companies, like Monsanto, unveiled a seemingly non-stop array of new 2 ̆ 7 genetically modified 2 ̆ 7 (GM) organisms. Perhaps the most notable of these were ANDi, the rhesus monkey - implanted with genes from a jellyfish! - and Bessie, an American cow, who gave birth to an Indian gaur, an ox-like animal threatened with extinction {{on the other side of}} the world. Not surprisingly, these remarkable feats of biological engineering have caused considerable controversy. In Britain, for example, government attempts to assess the safety of GM crops were sabotaged by environmental organizations like Greenpeace, whose UK leader, Lord Melchett, was famously arrested for his part in destroying field test sites. More notable still has been Prince Charles 2 ̆ 7 s outspoken opposition to GM foods. As he put it in a BBC Radio 4 lecture given in May 2000, producing these foods entails 2 ̆ 7 playing God with nature 2 ̆ 7, which is why he has been a strong advocate of more natural, organic farming methods - methods he has used on his own farms in Cornwall and elsewhere. Charles 2 ̆ 7 s desires to 2 ̆ 7 get back to nature 2 ̆ 7 before we destroy it altogether was boosted in 2001 by a remarkable venture, again in Cornwall. The Eden Project, which cost 75 million pounds, is an attempt to harness modern science and technology to preserve nature rather than tamper with it - in this respect contrasting with GM organisms. It was established by environmentalists concemed about species extinctions worldwide. Situated in two reclaimed c 1 ay pits, the Eden Project 2 ̆ 7 s giant geodesic greenhouses contain whole biomes from around the world, including those, like tropical humid forests, that are currently under threat from human activities such as logging. The name says it all: echoing the famous Garden in the Bible, the Eden Project attempts to be a storehouse for life on Earth. It literally transplants nature, recreating it in an artificial environment designed to ensure its continued existence. Together, the proliferation of GM organisms and the Eden Project give us two glimpses of nature in the new millennium: the new 2 ̆ 7 engineered natures 2 ̆ 7 of advanced societies and the fast-disappearing 2 ̆ 7 natural natures 2 ̆ 7 bequeathed by evolution. Or do they? Despite their apparent differences, I would argue that in both cases nature is, in fact, a human fabrication. In other words, even the Eden Project - despite its intentions - serves up an 2 ̆ 7 unnatural 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 strange nature 2 ̆ 7. This may seem a peculiar, even outrageous, claim, but I am not alone in making it. In recent years many human geographers have been arguing that nature today is no longer natural. They insist that it is a human construction through and through. In this chapter I want to explain what is meant by this and why it matters. I shall do so by saying more aboUt GM organisms and nature-protection schemes like the Eden Project.
