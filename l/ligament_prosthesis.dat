40|$|Abstract】Objective: Management of Rockwood type 3 acromioclavicular {{disruptions}} is {{a matter}} of debate. Should we adopt conservative or operative measures at first presentation? It is not clear but most of the evidences are in favour of conservative management. We present our expe-rience in managing these patients surgically. Methods: We present a prospective series of eight cases of chronic Rockwood type 3 acromioclavicular joint disruptions treated surgically. Anatomical reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament was done by artificial braided polyester <b>ligament</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Results: All the patients were able to perform daily activities from an average of the 14 th postoperative day. All patients felt an improvement in pain, with decrease in ave-rage visual analogue scale from preoperative 6. 5 points (range 3 - 9 points) to 2. 0 points (range 0 - 5 points), Constant score from 59...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the combination of}} the FESSA-HLESF/lateral collateral <b>ligament</b> <b>prosthesis</b> in repairing the stifle joint and to study the effect of early physical therapy, eight feral pigeons were divided in two groups. One started physical therapy one day post surgery, and the controls after the HLESF removal (3 rd postoperative week). Healing was monitored with clinical, radiographic, pathologic and histologic criteria for six weeks. The combined technique stabilized the joint successfully, and clinically all birds used their limbs normally. Range of motion (ROM) was reduced in all birds (5 o in flexion, 40 o in extension). No significant difference was detected between the groups in ROM, thigh thickness and circumference or muscle/joint histology. Regressive lameness and pododermatitis (grade I) affected all birds. Fibrosis of the operated joint capsule, reduced synovial fluid and excessive callus were also detected (75 % of cases). Muscle histology indicated atrophy of the operated limb (mean fiber Ø 49 µm). Joint histology revealed inaccurate reposition and osteophytes in 62. 5 %. Remodelling of subchondral and trabecular bone was unremarkable (< 5 new osteoid areas/ bone). Common structural changes, associated with remobilization, were the presence of pannus/surface irregularities (25 %) and radial clefts (12. 5 %). In conclusion, the clinical interpretation of a stabilized joint should be made with caution, as intraarticular structures are highly impacted during remobilization...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{situations}} that require repairing of connective tissues {{are common in}} the surgical care of orthopaedic and dentistry patients. Composite materials can be very convenient for such an application, since {{it is possible to}} obtain tissue substitutes with the desired mechanical properties (in particular modulus and strength) by carefully choosing the characteristics of the composite with the help of micromechanics and laminate theory. For instance, {{it is not difficult to}} obtain materials whose properties are tailored to the specific application, even pointwise, thus leading to an optimisation of the material itself. In this report the mechanical behaviour of polymers and continuous fibre reinforced polymers is investigated and compared to the behaviour of connective tissues. The design and the manufacturing of composite structures, tailored to simulate the mechanical properties of the soft and hard tissues surrounding the prostheses (i. e. the hip, the mandible, tendons and <b>ligaments</b> <b>prostheses),</b> are hence reviewed, highlighting the advantages of using composite biomaterials in the selected applications. As an example, the authors introduce a novel functionally graded composite mandible to be used for in vitro investigations...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to describe and model viscoelastic behavior of textile anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>prostheses.</b> For this purpose, mechanical and viscoelastic properties of woven and braided artificial ligaments were studied. These structures were manufactured with the same braided yarn and the same number of yarns. The mechanical properties of the two structures, such as tensile strength, strain at break, work and stiffness were measured by using a constant speed gradient dynamometer. In order to determine the viscoelastic modulus of the two structures, a rheological model was proposed and the correlation between experimental and theoretical creep and relaxation curves were studied. The energy dissipation and the residual deformation were measured with an application developed by using Microsoft Visual Basic software. The obtained results showed that textile structure influences prosthesis viscoelastic and mechanical properties, material damping, hysteresis and residual deformation. The nonlinear viscoelastic model permitted to evaluate the elastic and the viscous modulus of the braided and woven structures and to describe its time-dependent deformation. This study may serve as a method for the selection of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The Ulmsten's "Integral Theory" for {{pelvic floor}} {{dysfunctions}} {{is based on}} the need to reinforce fascias and <b>ligaments</b> with <b>prostheses</b> to obtain a reconstitution of the pelvic floor's anatomy. In September 2004 we developed a "uterine-sparing" surgical technique to correct such pathologies and in this paper we present results obtained. Primary outcome was to evaluate the technique's efficacy, secondary outcomes the resolution of stress urinary incontinence, postoperative pain (VAS scale), safety and complications. Study design: This prospective study included patients affected by stage 3 and 4 uteri ne-vaginal prolapse who wished to conserve their uterus. Those with (1) minor degrees of severity, (2) unfit for Surgery, (3) with a clear indication to hysterectomy (i. e. endometrial cancer), (4) with an elevated operative risk (American Society of Anaesthesiologists-ASA score III and IV), (5) previous vaginal surgeries and (6) with moderate/severe defecation problems were excluded.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{interaction}} between gender and posterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> (PCL) <b>prosthesis</b> design on patient-reported outcomes is an understudied area of research. We evaluated 1613 patients, from the Ontario Joint Replacement Registry (2001 - 2006), who underwent primary total knee replacement. This study investigated the impact of the gender-PCL design interaction on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) change scores and patient satisfaction, by performing linear regression analysis, using full-adjusted models that also included the gender-PCL prosthesis design interaction variable. PCL prosthesis design did not affect WOMAC change scores or satisfaction (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Moreover, Gender did not influence either of the patient-reported outcomes (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). In addition, the interaction between gender and PCL design did not impact patient-reported outcomes (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). In conclusion, the surgical preference to retain or sacrifice the PCL should not be influenced by the gender of the patient...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of finite element models have been {{developed}} to study the behaviour of the knee joint under different loading conditions. They have been used to study knee <b>ligament</b> function, knee <b>prosthesis</b> design and <b>ligament</b> reconstruction procedures. The terms pretension or prestrain of a knee ligament refer to the strain in the ligament when the joint is at full extension and little is known about its influence on the kinematics of the joint. In knee models, the ligament reference strains are usually merely estimated [1] and sometimes adapted by means of trial and error in order to get better agreement with experimental data [2]. As a consequence, very different values {{can be found in the}} literature. The purpose of this study was to analyze how ligament prestrains can affect the kinematics of the knee predicted with a FE model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Tissue-sparing {{surgery for}} hip {{replacement}} aims to minimize muscle damage and conserve the femoral neck {{through the use}} of mini-prostheses. We propose a modification of the classical direct lateral access procedure that preserves the gluteus medius. Further advantages during the surgical phase include limited blood loss, visualization of the entire acetabulum, and sparing of the transverse ligament. Precise implantation is facilitated and normal biomechanics are preserved. The gluteus medius is divided longitudinally between the anterior third and pos-terior two-thirds to provide access to the gluteus minimus, which is detached from the femoral insertion together with {{a small portion of the}} vastus lateralis, forming a flap that exposes the underlying articular capsule. When the femoral head is revealed, a decision is made to either continue with its dislocation directly or to resect it and remove it sepa-rately to avoid damaging the gluteus medius during dislo-cation. Upon removal of the femoral head, with the limb flexed and slightly over-rotated, the acetabulum is com-pletely visible. Limb length is maintained {{through the use of}} reference stitches on the gluteus minimus tendon and the proximal insertion of the vastus lateralis. In keeping with the minimally invasive philosophy, only pathological tissue is removed (marginal osteophytes, geodes, joint capsule, carti-lage to the point of bleeding and pulvinar). We have per-formed more than 2, 000 implants with this procedure since 1990. Advantages and potential critical points are discussed.

30|$|All {{surgeries}} {{were conducted}} with the patient under general or spinal anesthesia using the same technique and the medial parapatellar approach and capsulotomy, with ischaemic limb (pneumatic tourniquet at 300  mmHg). After removing osteophytes and cruciate ligaments and after a partial release, the distal femoral cut was performed using an intramedullary guide. The cut, with a variation from 0 ° to 9 °, {{was based on the}} angle measured in preoperative planning [6]. Thereafter, the ligamentous balance was completed, and the tibial cut was performed. The definitive implant was cemented after choosing a polyethylene liner of appropriate size and after evaluating the range of motion and ligamentous balance. The technique for selective resurfacing was chosen for treating the patella [7]: patellar substitution only in cases of severe cartilage damage, serious deformity and wrong- racking; patellar conservation in the remaining cases. The PFC system offers the choice of either posterior cruciate ligament substitution or retention [8, 9]. All implants were posterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> substituting. The <b>prosthesis</b> also allows the use of a femoral or tibial stem when an augmented stability is required. All patients received an antibiotic prophylaxis approximately 1  h before surgery with a single dose of a single antibiotic and an antithromboembolic with low molecular weight heparin for 30  days.|$|R
