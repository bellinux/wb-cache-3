40|$|Scania {{is facing}} big {{challenges}} in the future. The constantly increasing competition requires Scania to constantly improve its production system. At the Chassis assembly in Södertälje, final assembly of trucks is performed. This master’s thesis {{has been carried out}} at one section of the Chassis assembly where cabs are being prepared for mounting on the truck chassis. In this section, the Cab pre-assembly, there are many opportunities for improvement. The function of the Cab pre-assembly is to mount <b>air</b> <b>deflectors,</b> front hatch and sunvisor on the cab. The Cab pre-assembly is divided into a number of workstations where different tasks are performed. At the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station the <b>air</b> <b>deflectors</b> are mounted on the cab. At station 1 front hatches are preassembled, and subsequently mounted on the cab at the front hatch station. At the sunvisor station sunvisors are preassembled and then mounted on the cab. There are a variety of cab types, <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> types, front hatch types and sunvisor types. This makes it difficult to level out, or balance, the workload on the different stations. The master’s thesis was initiated with a comprehensive data-gathering phase. Observation, interviews and time studies were performed to create insight in the situation on the Cab pre-assembly. The result of the time study was an extensive amount of data, which includes operation times for all tasks, for different types of cabs. The time studies showed that many of the cab types on the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> and front hatch stations takes more time than the takt time. This forces the assemblers to work really hard, but still they cannot always keep up. On other cab types the assembler at the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station has no work at all. At station 1, on the other hand, all types of front hatches take shorter time than the takt time. For the assembler at the sunvisor station, all different types of sunvisors take different amount of time to assemble and mount, but the work can always be done within takt time. At the Cab pre-assembly there is also an assembler, known as a variant, who performs certain tasks at some types of cabs that takes more than the takt time to assemble. For example, this variant helps the assembler at the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station with one type of cab that otherwise could not be assembled within takt time. The variant has many different tasks, and frequently a number of these tasks should be performed at the same time. Because of this the variant cannot carry out all tasks, and the assemblers who should have gotten help cannot perform their tasks in time. To even out the workload in the Cab pre-assembly and to unburden the variant, a concept for balancing of the Cab pre-assembly was developed. This concept includes- merging the front hatch station with the sunvisor station and letting a single assembler handle the workload at this new station- letting a variant preassemble the sunvisors that take long time to assemble and mount, to enable the above- moving some of the work, previously performed at the front hatch station, to station 1 and some of it to the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station- moving the assembler from the front hatch station to the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station and dividing the work at this station between the assembler at the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station and this new assembler- unburden the variant of many tasks that the assemblers at the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station can perform when they have no other work to do. Moving work from the front hatch station to the <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> station was a prerequisite for implementing this solution. Therefore this concept was tried out in real production. This trial showed that it was possible for the assemblers to do their work within the takt time, but that it resulted in some ergonomic problems. By changing the sequence the work tasks were performed in, these problems could be solved. Evaluation indicates that the concept for balancing the Cab pre-assembly is feasible and that the concept would considerably improve the situation at the Cab pre-assembly. Scania is recommended to implement this concept at the Cab pre-assembly, to be able to solve many of the problems that exist in this section of the Chassis assembly.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of {{flow field}} around two {{different}} full-scale heavy-duty truck with <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> and without an <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> model are presented. The full-scale truck model is considered which contains {{a number of}} details such as bumpers, underbody, tractor chassis, wheels and axles. The numerical simulations have been conducted with two virtual wind tunnels at different yaw angle at 0 °, 5 ° and 10 °. The models are placed at different yawing angles in the virtual wind tunnels with a blockage ratio of about 10 %, which is same as the experimental wind tunnel. To compare the corrected experimental results with the ideal case, other simulations are also conducted with a larger cross section at the blockage ratio of about 1 %. A detailed survey of both instantaneous and timeaveraged flow is presented. The steady state simulations with tetrahedral meshes predict the drag coefficient (Cd) accurately within 3. 3 %, 4. 5 % and 3. 3 % of with <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> model and 1. 3 %, 4. 1 % and 7 % of without an <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> model to corresponding experimental values at 0 o, 5 o and 10 o yaw cases, respectively.

40|$|Humidification of {{chicory root}} cold stores helps in {{maintaining}} the quality and extending the postharvest storage time of chicory roots. Low evaporation rate of the sprayed droplets at such sub-zero temperatures (- 2 degrees C to - 1 degrees C) favours surface deposition that could have an adverse effect on {{the efficiency of the}} storage room. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and used to predict the storage room air velocity, temperature and humidity distributions, and fate of the water droplets that were sprayed for humidifying the storage room. The humidification system in a chicory root cold store was then optimized. The efficiency of the humidification system was affected by length of cold <b>air</b> <b>deflector,</b> stack height, number of nozzles and duration of humidification. Elongating the <b>air</b> <b>deflector,</b> reducing the stack height, reducing the number of nozzles and shortening the humidification time increased the amount of droplet evaporated and decreased the amount of droplet deposited on the stack. The following combinations of room design and operating parameters could clearly give the best performance of the humidification system: deflector length of 0. 8 m, two nozzles with an interval humidification of 1. 5 min on and 2 min off cycle and stack height of 3. 4 m.

The fuel is a flat PMMA plate of constant length and thickness but variable width.

40|$|Seven orchard spray {{application}} techniques were compared {{in terms of}} within-tree deposition quality and off-target losses {{to the ground and}} behind the target trees. The studied spray techniques included different sprayer types, fan speeds and <b>air</b> <b>deflector</b> settings. An artificial pear canopy was realized for this purpose. Filter papers and a multiple tracer methodology were used to evaluate deposition. All measurements were conducted indoor and will be used as an input and to validate a CFD orchard spray model. Results showed that spray application technique has an effect on spray deposition. Sprayer design caused major differences in spray distribution and off-target losses. A sprayer with individual spouts gave the highest deposits on the tree (0. 15 L), followed by an axial sprayer (0. 10 e 0. 12 L). Changing settings on the axial sprayer only caused minor differences, although the high fan gear performed significantly better than the low gear. Lowest tree depositions were found for a cross-flow sprayer (0. 08 e 0. 09 L). A significant portion of the spray liquid was lost to the ground and directly behind the trees with all spray techniques. The axial fan sprayer and the sprayer with individual spouts caused higher ground deposits than the cross-flow sprayer.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to assess the}} outcomes on the spray patterns produced by the different feasible adjustments of two different air blast sprayers and one mist blower sprayer, commonly employed for treatments to Apulian "tendone" vineyards. The spray profiles of these machines and the respective refinements affected by the alteration of the available adjusting devices were evaluated using a test bench, suitably set up for calibrating the sprayers used inside such vines. The air blast sprayers, compared with the mist blower model, have a better chance to match the spray pattern and the canopy profile of the "tendone" vines. Furthermore, the left-right asymmetry of the spray profile is reduced only in the case of sprayers with two counter-rotating fans, under certain operating conditions. Conversely, the symmetry index worsens with the activation of the fan {{in the case of the}} air blast sprayer fitted with a single fan either with or without the <b>air</b> <b>deflectors.</b> The mist blower sprayer develops lower drawbacks, in terms of left-right asymmetry of the spray profile, even if the high "stiffness" of the spray profile makes this sprayer not particularly suitable to the changing needs of the canopy of the "tendone" vineyards.
