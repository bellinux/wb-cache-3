40|$|Abstract—Due to {{critical}} resource constraints, associating each sensor node {{with a global}} ID is not feasible in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, having an ID in each sensor node is the basic assumption in many WSN applications. Therefore, efficient <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> generation schemes, which have not been carefully considered in the past, is of great importance. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> assignment scheme, called GREENWIS. Without having the explicit location information in advance, each node is able to generate a 5 -tuple <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> within an application field in a distributed manner using the GREENWIS algorithm. We prove the correctness and show the effectiveness of GREENWIS by comprehensive analysis. A GREENWIS prototype is also deployed in our lab. We introduce our early experience with this design and implementation. We evaluate GREENWIS through intensive experiments. The results show that GREENWIS provides effective <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> assignment in a real WSN environment. I...|$|E

40|$|Network-on-a-Chip (NoC) has {{received}} attention as a high-performance interconnect, because traditional buses, which can’t transfer {{more than one}} data-stream simultaneously, {{are more likely to}} become a bottleneck. Since some concepts of NoC have been proposed by simply borrowing the networking structure of parallel computers or System Area Networks (SANs), it tends to require complicated network interface logic in all the nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel data-transfer method called Black-Bus as an NoC. In Black-Bus, a local identifier (ID) is attached to each raw data as routing information. Unlike the traditional packet transfer, the <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> is transferred on dedicated wires attached to data lines to remove complicated packet generation procedure in a node. Only a small-sized <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> is required to specify routing tags to the destination, and intermediate routers change it to solve <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> conflicts between paths on a physical channel. The required <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> and routing table sizes for the Black-Bus router are evaluated with access trace data of NAS Parallel Benchmarks for on-chip multiprocessors, and JPEG codec as stream processing. Evaluation results show that most of the applications require only at most 3 bits for the <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> in a 16 -node system. And the Black-Bus data-transfer reduces up to 75 % of routing tags compared with global addressing scheme used in the traditional packet networks.

40|$|International audienceThe Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of multivariate data {{is a very}} {{important}} concept in spectral unmixing of hyperspectral images. A good estimation of the ID is crucial for a correct retrieval of the number of endmembers (the spectral signatures of macroscopic materials) in the image, for dimensionality reduction or for subspace learning, among others. Recently, some approaches to perform spectral unmixing and super-resolution locally have been proposed, which require a local estimation of the number of endmembers to use. However, the role of ID in local regions of hyperspectral images has not been properly addressed. Some important issues when dealing with small regions of hyperspectral data can seriously affect the performance of conventional hyperspectral ID estimators. We show that three factors mainly affect <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> estimation: the number of pixels in the local regions, which has to be high enough for the estimations to be relevant, the number of hyperspectral bands which complicates the estimations if the ambient space has a high dimensionality, and the noise, which can be misinterpreted as signal when its power is important. Here, we review the hyperspectral ID estimators on the literature for <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> estimation, we show how they behave in a local setting on synthetic and real datasets, and we provide some guidelines to make proper use of these estimators in local approaches...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a multi-hop clustering mechanism using global and <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> to reduce transmission power consumption and an efficient routing method to improve performance of data fusion and transmission. Simulation results show that our algorithm can increase life time and disperse power consumption among the nodes. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare two methods for {{intrinsic}} dimensionality (ID) estimation based on optimally topology preserving maps (OTPMs). The {{first one is}} a direct approach, where the intrinsic dimensionality is estimated directly from the OTPM. We argue that this approach suffers from both practical and theoretical pitfalls. The second is a new approach which combines OTPMs with an efficient local principal component analysis (PCA). Exploiting the OTPM, local PCA can be shown to have only linear time complexity w. r. t. the dimensionality of the input space (in contrast to the prohibitive cubic complexity of the conventional approach), and hence the method becomes applicable even for very high dimensional input spaces as frequently encountered in computer vision. A <b>local</b> <b>ID</b> estimate is then obtained as the local number of significant eigenvalues. In addition to ID estimation the local subspaces as revealed by our local PCA can be directly used for further data processing tasks including [...] ...|$|E
30|$|In 2011, He et al. [6] {{proposed}} the MR-DBSCAN algorithm, {{which is a}} MapReduce-based implementation of the well-known DBSCAN algorithm. The proposed parallel method consists of four steps. In the first step, the size and the general spatial distribution of the total records are summarized, then, a list of dimensional index indicated an approximate grid partitioning is generated for the next step. The second step performs the main DBSCAN process for each subspace divided by the partition profile. The third step handles the cross border issues when merging the subspaces. At the end, a cluster <b>ID</b> mapping, from <b>local</b> clusters to global one, is built for the entire data set based on pairs lists collected from the previous step. Then, the <b>local</b> <b>ID’s</b> are changed by the global ones for points from all partitions {{in order to produce}} a united output.

40|$|Carrier Sense Multiple Access / ID Countdown (CSMA/IC) is a collision-free ad hoc MAC protocol. CSMA/IC avoids {{simultaneous}} medium {{access by}} competing with a <b>local</b> unique <b>ID</b> {{assigned to each}} node. However, assigning the <b>local</b> unique <b>ID</b> to each node is a very complicated problem. In this paper, we propose a simple distributed ID assignment scheme for CSMA/IC. Investi-gating CSMA/IC, {{we found that the}} largest ID screens all IDs of contenders during the contention process. Due to this “ID screen effect”, every node can estimate the largest ID among its contenders. Using this knowledge, we propose a self unique ID assignment scheme which does not require message exchanges. To complement our ID assignment scheme, we also suggest a “well arranged rotation ID system”. The proposed ID assignment scheme suffers from an ID increasing problem and an unfair medium access problem. However, the new ID system mitigates these problems in a very simple way. Simulation results show the proposed scheme operates quite efficiently and provides medium access opportunities fairly. 1...|$|R
