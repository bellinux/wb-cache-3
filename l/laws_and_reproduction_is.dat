The single women with a strong intention to acquire the knowledge of sexuality <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>was</b> found to have the image for their own childbirth as well as the will to study contraception. However, the discrepancy between such an intention and their real action was assessed. The study indicates that the more opportunity for learning sexuality <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> needed <b>and</b> the most important problem for women is to promote the spread of education with regard to reproductive health and right...|$|R

40|$|Composting {{is a waste}} {{management}} technology that is becoming more widespread {{as a response to}} the increasing production of sewage sludge and the pressure for its reuse in soil. In this study, different bioassays (plant germination, earthworm survival, biomass <b>and</b> <b>reproduction,</b> <b>and</b> collembolan survival <b>and</b> <b>reproduction)</b> <b>were</b> assessed for their usefulness in the compost quality assessment. Compost samples, from two different composting plants, were taken along the composting process, which were characterized and submitted to bioassays (plant germination and collembolan and earthworm performance). Results from our study indicate that the noxious effects of some of the compost samples observed in bioassays are related to the low organic matter stability of composts and the enhanced release of decomposition endproducts, with the exception of earthworms, which are favored. Plant germination <b>and</b> collembolan <b>reproduction</b> inhibition <b>was</b> generally associated with uncomposted sludge, while earthworm total biomass <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>were</b> enhanced by these materials. On the other hand, earthworm and collembolan survival were unaffected by the degree of composting of the wastes. However, this pattern was clear in one of the composting procedures assessed, but less in the other, where the release of decomposition endproducts was lower due to its higher stability, indicating the sensitivity and usefulness of bioassays for the quality assessment of composts...|$|R
