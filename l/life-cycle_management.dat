Although the first program of its kind from Boeing, post-sale protection programs are not new; such programs are usually offered by third party service centers. Boeing is also designing and testing composite hardware so inspections are mainly visual. This reduces the need for ultrasonic and other non-visual inspection methods, saving time and money.|$|E
25|$|On February 8, 2006, Borland {{announced}} the divestiture of their IDE division, including Delphi, JBuilder, and InterBase.

On March 20, 2006, Borland announced its acquisition of Gauntlet Systems, a provider of technology that screens software under development for quality and security. On November 14, 2006, Borland announced its decision to separate the developer tools group into a wholly owned subsidiary. The newly formed operation, CodeGear, was responsible for four IDE product lines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Joint data {{management}} (JDM) includes the hardware (e. g. sensors/targets), software (e. g. processing/algorithms), and operations (environments) of data exchange that enable persistent surveillance {{in the context}} of a data-to-decision (D 2 D) information fusion enterprise. Key attributes of an information system require pragmatic assessment of data and information management, distributed communications, knowledge representation, human-systems interaction, as well as a balanced sensor mix, algorithm choice, and <b>life-cycle</b> data <b>management.</b> Throughout the paper, we seek to describe the current technology, research approaches, and metrics that influence a realizable JDM product. We develop JDM methods for structured and unstructured data to determine an accurate target track and identification as a moving intelligence (MOVINT) capability.
