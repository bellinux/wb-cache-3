50|$|A <b>line</b> <b>level</b> {{describes}} a <b>line's</b> nominal signal <b>level</b> as a ratio, expressed in decibels, against a standard reference voltage. The nominal {{level and the}} reference voltage against which it is expressed depend on the <b>line</b> <b>level</b> being used. While the nominal levels themselves vary, only two reference voltages are common: decibel volts (dBV) for consumer applications, and decibels unloaded (dBu) for professional applications.|$|R

5000|$|Acoustic sounds (such as voices or musical instruments) {{are often}} {{recorded}} with transducers (microphones and pickups) that produce weak electrical signals. These signals must be amplified to <b>line</b> <b>level,</b> {{where they are}} more easily manipulated by other devices such as mixing consoles and tape recorders. Such amplification is performed by a device known as a preamplifier or [...] "preamp", which boosts the signal to <b>line</b> <b>level.</b> After manipulation at <b>line</b> <b>level,</b> signals are then typically sent to a power amplifier, where they are amplified to levels that can drive headphones or loudspeakers. These convert the signals back into sounds that can be heard through the air.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{incorrect}} {{restoration of}} the joint line during TKA can result in joint instability, anterior knee pain, limited range of motion, and joint stiffness. The joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> is usually measured only on pre- and post-operative radiographs. Current knee navigation systems can now potentially support intra-operatively joint line restoration by controlling the exact amount of the bone-cartilage removed and the corresponding overall thickness of the components implanted. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess how well the joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> is restored and the tibiofemoral overstuffing prevented when standard knee surgical navigation is used carefully also with these purposes. Intra-operative measurements during navigated TKA were taken. METHODS: Sixty-seven primary TKAs were followed prospectively. The variation before and after prosthesis component implantation of the joint <b>line</b> <b>level,</b> both in the femoral and tibial reference, was measured intra-operatively by an instrumented probe. Overstuffing was measured as the difference between the overall craniocaudal thickness of the femoral and tibial prosthesis components inserted and the thickness of the bone-cartilage removed. RESULTS: A significant elevation in the joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> after prosthesis implantation was found with respect to the tibial reference (1. 9  ±  2. 4  mm, mean ± SD), very little to the femoral reference (0. 3  ±  2. 1  mm), perhaps accounted for the femur-first operative technique utilized. Overstuffing was on the average of 2. 2  ±  3. 0  mm. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a knee navigation system can also support well a proper {{restoration of the}} joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> and limit the risk of overstuffing when relevant measurements are taken carefully during operation.
