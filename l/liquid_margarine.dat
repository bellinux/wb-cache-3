40|$|Bakgrund Svenska livsmedelsverket (SLV) har utarbetat fem kostråd för att främja en hälsosam kosthållning. Kostråden innefattar rekommendationer gällande frukt och grönt, fullkorn, nyckelhålsmärkningen, fisk samt olja och flytande margarin. Tidigare undersökningar tyder på att kostråden inte följs i tillräcklig utsträckning. Syfte Studiens syfte var att undersöka vuxna individers kännedom, upplevda följsamhet och attityder gentemot SLVs fem kostråd. Ytterligare syften var att undersöka olika faktorers samband med kännedom, attityder och upplevd följsamhet till kostråden samt förtroendet för SLV. Metod Via Facebook utlystes en nätbaserad enkätstudie innehållande frågor om kännedom, upplevd följsamhet och attityder till kostråden. Insamlade data bearbetades i SPSS 22. 0. Independent samples median test samt Chi- 2 test användes vid analys. Signifikansnivån sattes till p< 0, 05. Resultat I studien deltog 159 individer (113 kvinnor, 46 män). Kännedomen om kostråden var god förutom beträffande kostrådet om olja och flytande margarin som endast 48 % kände till sedan tidigare. Den upplevda följsamheten var störst till kostråden om fullkorn respektive olja och flytande margarin. Kostrådet om olja och flytande margarin ansågs även vara lättast att följa. Attityderna till kostråden gällande frukt och grönt, fullkorn samt fisk var mer positiva än till övriga kostråd. Kostrådet gällande nyckelhålsmärkningen ansågs vara mindre hälsosamt, mindre modernt, svårare att förstå, svårare att följa och hade lägst tilltro. De som följde Low Carbohydrate High Fat-dieten (n= 11) hade lägre upplevd följsamhet (p= 0. 011) och tilltro (p= 0. 023) till nyckelhålsmärkningen samt lägre tilltro till kostrådet angående frukt och grönt (p= 0. 008). Av deltagarna angav 45 % ett högt förtroende för SLV. Slutsats Kostråden, främst angående nyckelhålsmärkningen respektive olja och flytande margarin, kan behöva modifieras eller marknadsföras bättre för att i större utsträckning nå ut till befolkningen och på så sätt förebygga kostrelaterade sjukdomar.  Background The Swedish National Food Agency (SNFA) has {{developed}} five dietary guidelines to promote healthy eating. The guidelines include recommendations for fruit and vegetables, whole-grain, the Keyhole, fish, oil and <b>liquid</b> <b>margarine.</b> Previous {{studies indicate that}} the guidelines are not followed adequately. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to examine adult’s knowledge, perceived adherence and attitudes towards the SNFAs five dietary guidelines. Additional aims were to examine various factors related to knowledge, attitudes and perceived adherence towards the guidelines and adult’s confidence in SNFA. Method Via Facebook, a web-based questionnaire survey was announced containing questions about knowledge, perceived adherence and attitudes towards the guidelines. Collected data was processed in SPSS 22. 0. Independent samples median test and Chi- 2 test were used for analysis. The significance level was set at p< 0. 05. Results A total of 159 subjects participated in the study (113 women, 46 men). Knowledge of the dietary guidelines was good except regarding oil and <b>liquid</b> <b>margarine</b> which only 48 % knew since before. The perceived adherence was highest for the dietary guidelines on whole-grain, oil and <b>liquid</b> <b>margarine.</b> The guideline concerning oil and <b>liquid</b> <b>margarine</b> was also considered the easiest to follow. Attitudes towards the guidelines regarding fruit, vegetables, whole-grain and fish were more positive compared to the other guidelines. The Keyhole was considered less healthy, less modern, more difficult to understand and follow, and the least trustworthy. Those who followed the Low Carbohydrate High Fat-diet (n= 11) had lower perceived adherence (p= 0. 011) and confidence (p= 0. 023) towards the Keyhole and a lower trust towards the guideline regarding fruit and vegetables (p= 0. 008). Of the participants, 45 % indicated a high confidence in the SNFA. Conclusion The dietary guidelines, mainly concerning the Keyhole and oil and <b>liquid</b> <b>margarine,</b> may need to be modified or better marketed to reach the population in a wider extent and thus prevent diet-related diseases. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} effects of fatty acid composition of <b>liquid</b> <b>margarines</b> (LM) on the sensory properties of sponge cakes and compare it with cakes containing solid margarines and butter. Fats were different in principal groups of fatty acid and were of the following composition: SFA (9. 3 – 66. 4), TFA (1. 2 – 10. 3), PUFA (1. 9 – 53. 9 %). The taste and aroma of cakes scored lower with increasing content of unsaturated FA, especially PUFA and higher with increasing content of SFA and TFA combined. With respect to taste and aroma, cakes containing LM scored lower in comparison to cakes containing butter, while the texture of such cakes was rated as high as cakes containing butter. Approximately 34 – 65 % of young consumers perceived such cakes as “like very much” and “like moderately”, however, 5 % of consumers described them as “dislike a lot”. The results of this study indicate that <b>liquid</b> <b>margarines</b> could be recommended for cakes in large-scale manufacture. Regarding recommendations of reducing the intake of TFA in processed foods, it is justified to replace hydrogenated vegetable by liquid fats for manufacture of bakery products...|$|R

40|$|Blends of {{soybean oil}} (50) and fully {{hydrogenated}} soybean oil (FHSBO), with 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % FHSBO (w/w) content were interesterified under the following conditions: 0. 4 % sodium methoxide, 500 rpm stirring, 100 degrees C, 20 min. The original and interesterified blends were examined for triacylglycerol composition, melting point, solid fat content (SFC) and consistency. Interesterification caused considerable rearrangement of triacylglycerol species, reduction of trisaturated triacylglycerol content and increase in monounsaturated and diunsaturated triacylglycerols, resulting in lowering of respective melting points. The interesterified blends displayed reduced SFC at all temperatures and more linear melting profiles {{as compared with}} the original blends. Yield values showed increased plasticity in the blends after the reaction. Isosolid diagrams before and after the reaction showed no eutectic interactions. The 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30 and 60 : 40 interesterified SO:FHSBO blends displayed characteristics suited to application, respectively, as <b>liquid</b> shortening, table <b>margarine,</b> baking/confectionery fat and all-purpose shortenings/biscuit-filing base.

40|$|Are {{brand names}} more {{valuable}} online or in traditional supermarkets? Does the increasing availability of comparative price information online make consumers more price-sensitive? We address these and related questions by first conceptualizing how different store environments (online and traditional stores) can differentially affect consumer choices. We use the <b>liquid</b> detergent, soft <b>margarine</b> spread, and paper towel categories to test our hypotheses. Our hypotheses and the empirical results from our choice models indicate that: (1) Brand names {{become more important}} online in some categories but not in others depending {{on the extent of}} information available to consumers – brand names are more valuable when information on fewer attributes is available online, (2) Sensory search attributes, particularly visual cues about the product (e. g., paper towel design), have lower impact on choices online, and factual information (i. e., non-sensory attributes, such as the fat content of margarine) have higher impact on choices online (3) Price sensitivity is higher online, but this is due to online promotions being stronger signals of price discounts. The combined effect of price and promotion on choice is weaker online than offline...|$|R
