5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into <b>low</b> <b>orbit.</b> From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>orbiting</b> {{satellite}} communication networks will be competing with geosynchronous satellites for {{a share of}} the communications market. In world-wide communications that do not require immediate real time transmissions, <b>low</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites are competitive with geosynchronous satellites because the system is reliable and low in cost. Since satellites are a clear example of Newtonian laws, the distinct patterns they make in their orbiting process are predictable. Newton 2 ̆ 7 s law states that an object will remain in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force: a satellite remains in motion around the earth because there is no atmosphere to slow it down. A satellite stays in orbit because the pull of gravity inward is balanced by centrifugal energy outward. The rate which a satellite orbits the earth and the lifetime of the satellite depend on its altitude. <b>Low</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites trace unique paths over {{the surface of the earth}} [...] the satellite is accessible for communication if the path o the satellite comes within 1500 kilometers of a ground station. Unless there are 50 to 80 <b>low</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites, the system is not useful for exclusive real time communication and thus requires a different operating structure. The <b>low</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellite will use a combination of two modes for communication: the transponder mode, and the store and forward mode...|$|R

40|$|Protective {{effect of}} {{nanocomposite}} film from the <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> environment Gilsang Son and Chun-Gon Kim The various hazards in the <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> space cause damage {{mostly on the}} exposed surfaces of polymer-based materials. Neutral particles, especially atomic oxygen, erode the exposed surface, and cyclic temperature variation produces microcracks that degrade mechanical performance. To protect substrate materials from the harmful environ-ments, this research investigated the protective effect of nanocomposite film under a simulated <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> space environment involving 4 104 torr high vacuum, 200 nm ultraviolet radiation, 14 thermal cycles ranging from 70 C to 100 C, and atomic oxygen flux of 2. 07 1014 atoms/cm 2 s.

The physical and mechanical changes of the film-protected specimens under the simulated <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> environment were compared to those of no-film-protected specimens. The amount of specimen erosion during the <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> simulation test was analyzed through mass change. Furthermore, the tensile performance before and after exposure to the simulated <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> environment was evaluated. Since the uniformly dispersed nano-silica blocked the attack of atomic oxygen and ultraviolet radiation, and internal multi-walled carbon nanotubes impeded crack propagation due to the bridging effect, the speci-mens protected by nanocomposite film showed less damage on the exposed surfaces and smallest in degradation of tensile strength after exposure to the simulated <b>low</b> earth <b>orbit</b> environment...|$|R
