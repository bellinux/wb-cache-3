40|$|Boran pastoralists {{say they}} have one {{over-riding}} problem: Limited drinking water for both people and <b>livestock.</b> <b>Ponds</b> are therefore a critical resource. However, lack of <b>livestock</b> control in <b>pond</b> catchments subjects them to heavy grazing and trampling that creates landscapes vulnerable to erosion. Ponds collect sediment after rainfall events and water holding capacity is reduced We wanted to test a system to improve the managements of pond catchments. In March 2014 we erected bush fences to enclose catchments surrounding on demonstration pond in each of four Pastoral Associations. The purpose was to prevent unregulated livestock access and allow recovery of vegetation to trap sediment before it could reach the ponds. In June 2014 a sampling program was introduced to quantify ecological improvements evident after the first rainy season. Permanent 1 -m 2 plots were established {{inside and outside the}} enclosures. They were sampled for plant cover (%) and species presence in June 2014, November 2014, and June 2015. Protection from livestock grazing for only one year led to a 400 % increase in plant cover overall. Increases in cover tended to be greater on sites that had less cover to begin with. The pastoralists report that the increased cover has reduced pond sedimentation and improved water quality. In addition, protection from grazing improved plant biodiversity. Altogether, 64 plant species were recorded, half of which appeared {{for the first time in}} November, 2014. Perennial grasses responded dramatically to protection, which is important given that the Boran highly value their cattle, and cattle prefer to eat grass forage. The implications of these results go far beyond a program of pond rehabilitation. Short-term protection from livestock should be incorporated into a grazing management strategy planned and implemented by the pastoral community at the landscape level...|$|R

The coastal or riverine region is mainly made up of peat swamp with very limited suitable area for agricultural activities in its natural condition. In areas with improved irrigation systems, the soil has gradually improved to enable some agricultural activities to be carried out. Some of the crops planted in the coastal or riverine region are wet paddy, sago, coconuts and perennial crops. Some of the coastal or riverine areas have potential for aquaculture activities such as brackish water fish, tiger prawn and crab cultivation. The midland region has more suitable areas for agricultural activities. Crops such as pepper, rubber, paddy, and oil palm are planted in the midland region. Most of the <b>livestock</b> and <b>pond</b> fish rearing are also found in this region. All the commercial livestock in the division area are in this region.

By the nature, purpose and scale of the operation, integrated fish culture can be categorized into five major modes.

40|$|Extensive {{channel catfish}} farming {{is a means}} of {{utilizing}} farm ponds for aquaculture production for either supplementary income of home use. This involves stocking catfish at sufficiently low densities such that a pond is able to assimilate excess feed and fish wastes without needing supplemental aeration or chemicals to keep water quality from reaching toxic levels. This is "low-tech" aquaculture and requires little producer labor/management inputs. A mathematical model of extensive catfish culture in farm ponds was presented in this paper. This model used data from Kentucky where part-time producers, with a minimum of aquaculture experience and time for pond management, are involved in culturing catfish for retail/live markets. Results of this model showed that the optimal strategy would be to stock fish at densities up to 3, 000 /ha/yr (1, 200 /ac/yr). Other results showed that breakeven prices were less than $ 2. 20 /kg ($ 1. 00 /lb), a popular retail price for whole catfish. Hence, this paper concluded that small-scale aquaculture is both feasible and profitable in farm ponds, provided the producer had access to retail markets for the product.

40|$|The Sacramento (northern Central) Valley of California (CA) has a hot Mediterranean {{climate and}} a diverse {{ecological}} landscape that is impacted extensively by human activities, {{which include the}} intensive farming of crops and <b>livestock.</b> Waste-water <b>ponds,</b> marshes, and irrigated fields associated with these agricultural activities provide abundant larval habitats for C. sonorensis midges, {{in addition to those}} sites that exist in the natural environment. Within this region, C. sonorensis is an important vector of bluetongue (BTV) and related viruses that adversely affect the international trade and movement of livestock, the economics of livestock production, and animal welfare. To characterize the seasonal dynamics of immature and adult C. sonorensis populations, abundance was monitored intensively on two dairy farms in the Sacramento Valley from August 2012 - to July 2013. Adults were sampled every two weeks for 52 weeks by trapping (CDC style traps without light and baited with dry-ice) along N-S and E-W transects on each farm. One farm had large operational waste-water lagoons, whereas the lagoon on the other farm was drained and remained dry during the study. Spring emergence and seasonal abundance of adult C. sonorensis on both farms coincided with rising vernal temperature. Paradoxically, the abundance of midges on the farm without a functioning waste-water lagoon was increased as compared to abundance on the farm with a waste-water lagoon system, indicating that this infrastructure may not serve as the sole, or even the primary larval habitat. Adult midges disappeared from both farms from late November until May; however, low numbers of parous female midges were detected in traps set during daylight in the inter-seasonal winter period. This latter finding is especially critical as it provides a potential mechanism for the "overwintering" of BTV in temperate regions such as northern CA. Precise documentation of temporal changes in the annual abundance and dispersal of Culicoides midges is essential for the creation of models to predict BTV infection of livestock and to develop sound abatement strategies...|$|R
40|$|Ponds {{support a}} rich {{biodiversity}} because {{the heterogeneity of}} individual ponds creates, at the landscape scale, a diversity of habitats for wildlife. The distribution of pond animals and plants will be influenced by both the local conditions within a pond and the spatial distribution of ponds across the landscape. Separating out the local from the spatial is difficult because the two are often linked. Pond snails {{are likely to be}} affected by both local conditions, e. g. water hardness, and spatial patterns, e. g. distance between ponds, but studies of snail communities struggle distinguishing between the two. In this study, communities of snails were recorded from 52 ponds in a biogeographically coherent landscape in north-east England. The distribution of snail communities was compared to local environments characterised by the macrophyte communities within each pond and to the spatial pattern of ponds throughout the landscape. Mantel tests were used to partial out the local versus the landscape respective influences. Snail communities became more similar in ponds that were closer together and in ponds with similar macrophyte communities as both the local and the landscape scale were important for this group of animals. Data were collected from several types of ponds, including those created on nature reserves specifically for wildlife, old field ponds (at least 150 years old) primarily created for watering <b>livestock</b> and subsidence <b>ponds</b> outside protected areas or amongst coastal dunes. No one pond type supported all the species. Larger, deeper ponds on nature reserves had the highest numbers of species within individual ponds but shallow, temporary sites on farm land supported a distinct temporary water fauna. The conservation of pond snails in this region requires a diversity of pond types rather than one idealised type and ponds scattered throughout the area at a variety of sites, not just concentrated on nature reserves...|$|R
40|$|The Borana Plateau is an {{important}} rangeland for Ethiopia. Livestock production has supported pastoralists here for many generations, and animals are now supplied {{to a variety of}} domestic and export markets. The aim of this Livestock Innovation Lab project is to find ways to improve the sustainable productivity of the pastoral system. This is a big challenge, as the rangelands have been badly degraded by decades of heavy pressure from growing human and livestock populations. As a result, there has been extensive bush encroachment on the grasslands and a recent acceleration of gully erosion. The research team used Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), a method that allows scientists to gather information on pastoral knowledge and opinions, to reveal the priority problems of four Pastoral Associations (PAs) located within 90 kilometers of the town of Yabelo. The most critical problem for all of the PAs is a shortage of drinking water for both people and animals. Water resources are under threat from growing populations, high rates of pond siltation from overgrazed catchments, and gradual deterioration of cisterns, hand pumps and infrastructure for deep wells. Other problems include a lack of feed resources for livestock and inadequate public services for people. Because of the very high value placed by the people on water, the project’s next phase of work is focused on taking action where water and forage resources intersect, namely the protection of selected pond catchments with bush fencing. Bush fencing will also line pathways that will allow controlled access of <b>livestock</b> to the <b>pond’s</b> edge with minimal effects on the environment. Researchers expect that grass recovery in the catchments will be rapid, therefore greatly reducing pond siltation as well as enhancing water quantity and quality. This {{is the first step in}} a comprehensive, long-term process to rehabilitate the rangelands in support of more sustainable livestock production...|$|R
40|$|Numerous ponds {{have been}} {{constructed}} in recent years on the lower Waikato River floodplain yet many waterfowl populations are in decline. Overseas research {{highlights the importance of}} constructed ponds for waterfowl populations; however, no comprehensive research has been carried out in New Zealand. The overarching aim of this research was to investigate how the ecology of constructed ponds on the lower Waikato River floodplain influences waterfowl densities, community composition and juvenile productivity. The study involved 34 constructed ponds which were predominantly found around Lakes Waikare and Whangape, and the internationally significant Whangamarino wetland. Data were collected on the physicochemical, landscape and vegetation characteristics of the ponds, as well as macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages to determine relationships between and within abiotic and biotic pond factors. Waterfowl communities were observed four times between September and December 2013 to determine mean densities of waterfowl per hectare and the mean community composition of each pond. The waterfowl data were used to explore key relationships with abiotic and biotic factors. Site hydrology was found to have a significant influence on macroinvertebrate and fish community composition. The relative abundance of macroinvertebrates was predominantly lower in degraded ponds which were characterised by water supplied by swamps that frequently flood. Benthic macroinvertebrate abundance was lower in temporary ponds, indicating pond permanence was important. Fish communities of frequently flooded ponds were characteristic of pest fish as a result of increased connectivity. Ponds with high pest fish biomass, especially koi carp (Cyprinus carpio), tended to be more turbid with relatively low macroinvertebrate abundance. The percentage of pond margin fenced had consistently high explanatory power for differences in community composition of macroinvertebrate and fish communities. Food availability and physical pond characteristics were important for waterfowl. Higher waterfowl abundances were found on ponds with high food availability, larger areas, and high pond complexity. Waterfowl densities were higher on ponds with lower fish biomass which is likely a result of decreased competition for macroinvertebrates as food. The suitability of a pond for waterfowl appeared to be species-specific. Broods were often encountered on ponds with large areas, high complexities, and increased marginal fencing. This study has allowed {{for the development of a}} conceptual model of the relationships between pond attributes and waterfowl communities. The findings of this study indicate habitat heterogeneity at the landscape scale is important for waterfowl. Providing a network of heterogeneous ponds across the landscape will provide enough varied habitat to support diverse and abundant waterfowl communities, and should include ponds of varying sizes, shapes, depths, vegetation and hydrology. It is also important to construct permanent ponds with limited flood frequency. Excluding pest fish and <b>livestock</b> from <b>ponds</b> will likely increase waterfowl use, and brood occupancy, of ponds as a result of improved water quality and reduced competition for food with fish...|$|R

Cyanobacterial toxins {{have been}} implicated in fish, wildlife, {{livestock}} and human mortality events. Cyanobacteria blooms, which often produce toxins, are exacerbated by hot, dry weather. The majority of Georgia, {{with the exception of}} the coastal Plain and the Northwestern corner, is currently in severe to exceptional drought conditions. In May 2012 we began receiving reports of livestock deaths associated with algal blooms. Based on clinical signs and algal screening, we documented four cattle deaths at one central Georgia pond with a dense Microcystis aeruginosa bloom (4. 4 x 106 cells/mL) and microcystin (i. e. algal produced toxin) concentrations in excess of 142 ppb. Since this incident, we received and screened numerous water samples from <b>livestock</b> drinking water <b>ponds</b> throughout the state. We documented cyanoblooms, predominantly Microcystis aeruginosa, in the majority of ponds screened (11 / 14) and microcystins were present in the majority of samples screened for toxin (7 / 9). The livestock deaths have highlighted an important issue for Georgia farmers and pond owners that will likely be increasingly prevalent under projected climatic models. We have continued our outreach effort by establishing an official algal screening and cyanotoxin testing service through the existing Agricultural and Environmental Services Laboratories at UGA. This testing service will enable us to better serve the citizens of our state and provide a platform to disseminate information aimed at improving water resource management.

40|$|Agriculture and {{aquaculture}} {{systems are}} used by many farmers in various tropical countries of Asia, America and Africa. They have proven their relevancy to increase the productivity of farms by optimising nutrient fluxes and reducing requirements for external fertilisers. This article analysed {{the current state of}} fish farming and the way it is integrated with other farm subsystems in the urban/peri-urban and rural areas of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. More precisely, it examined the allocation of resources at the farm level, the recovery of helophytes plants, and the fate of fish production choices and it explored the possibility of intensifying these existing integrated farming systems. After a census of ponds in the urban and rural areas of Kinshasa, an on-site survey was conducted on 150 fish pond farms to assess the different activities practiced on farms, the impact of integrating crops and <b>livestock</b> to fish <b>pond</b> aquaculture and the constraints of the system. A total of three thousand and twenty (3020) fish ponds were recorded in the urban and rural areas of Kinshasa. Among these farms integrated aquaculture-agriculture systems exist with a wide diversity of practices (about 79 % of farms combined fish with livestock and/or vegetable production). No striking differences between fish farms according to the allocation of resources, fish production method such as monoculture or polyculture, the recovery of helophytes plants and the fate of fish production choice were found depending on the location. However, fish farms were differently managed when combined with agriculture and/or livestock. Regarding the integration of the different subsystems through nutrient fluxes, 11 different movements of material between subsystems were found in integrated farms. However, not all fluxes are equally used in all farms and therefore improvements cannot be generalised. Improvements to be explored are such as making better use of manure pond mud and helophyte plants. For this purpose, proper training of farmers might be critical. Finally, bringing farmers together in cooperatives could also contribute to reduce the cost of purchase and transportation of fish fry and feed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{integrated}} small-scale aquaculture farming, {{animal and}} human excreta maybe used as fish feed and pond fertilizer, thereby enhancing transmission of fish-borne zoonotic trematodes (FZTs) from final hosts, like humans, pigs and chickens, to snails. Areas within a pond could vary in trematode egg-load {{due to the}} immediate bordering land, and this might provide implications for control of these trematodes or sampling in field studies measuring FZT prevalence in snails. We therefore estimated the effect of bordering land use on prevalence and FZT burden in snails in different areas within small-scale aquaculture ponds. Nine sampling areas within a pond were assigned in six ponds. For each sampling area, about 120 Melanoides tuberculata snails were collected. Based on land use bordering a sampling area, these were categorized in 5 risk-categories: low-risk (road, rice planted in pond, agriculture, or middle of pond), human access point to <b>pond,</b> <b>livestock</b> sty (pigs or poultry), both human access point and livestock sty, and water connection to canal. In total, 5392 snails were collected. Percentages of snails with parapleurolophocercous cercariae varied between 6 % in areas categorized as low-risk and areas with livestock sty only to 15 % in areas with both human access point and livestock sty; only this 15 % was {{significantly different from the}} prevalence in the low-risk category. Percentages of snails with xiphidio cercariae did not differ between risk-categories and varied between 5 % and 10 %. Mean snail size was 15. 2 mm, and was significantly associated with both the probability of infection as well as parasite burden. Very small differences in parasite burden were found at different land use areas; the maximum difference was about 11 cercariae. This study demonstrated only small differences between areas surrounding a pond on risk of snails to be infected with fish-borne trematodes within different pond areas. In field studies on FZTs in M. tuberculata snails in ponds, sampling from ponds can therefore be done without considering areas within ponds...|$|R
