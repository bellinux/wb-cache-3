40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is responsible for}} {{a substantial part of}} the environmental impact generated by industrial production (Gutowski et al., 2006). Currently, minimising the energy {{consumption is}} hardly a priority for many machine tool designers, since they concentrate primarily on improving functionality, accuracy and safety. Nevertheless, alternative machine tool designs with improved energy consumption are emerging. This paper investigates the case of a <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> tool as common sheet metal processing machine tool. This paper verifies the potential for energy improvement by means of a case study. The analysis covers both the energy consumption during productive and non-productive time. Energy consumption improvement opportunities are identified. For this purpose a conventional CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> tool was investigated and compared with a possible fibre laser based machine tool configuration. The analysis shows that the CO 2 laser source and the chiller unit are the largest energy consumers during productive time. During non-productive time, 12 % of the yearly energy consumption is required to keep the chiller and other components active. For the alternative machine tool configuration it is assumed that no energy is needed during off-mode. The same scenario saves 16. 6 MWh during productive time because of the improved efficiency of a fibre laser source. status: publishe...|$|E

The effects on both parameters, which are striation frequency and the size of HAZ, are analyzed. Manual analysis was used to develop graphs that describe the effects of power on laser cut quality. The suitable desired power level to get the optimum cut quality of acrylic is 22. 5 watts at feed rate 1800 μs. For optimum cut quality, striation frequency and size of HAZ parameters are kept at minimum levels. Increasing power leads to the decrease of striation frequency. The size of HAZ increases when there is an increase in power. Power laser produces small effects on the striation frequency and size of HAZ. Study and analyze the other parameters or factors that affect the cut quality of acrylic should be consider for the future research...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} experimental {{investigations of}} <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> and piercing, with {{theoretical and practical}} discussions of the results. The thesis {{is made up of}} an introduction to <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> and six scientific Papers. These Papers are linked {{in such a way that}} each of them studies a different aspect of laser cutting: process efficiency in Paper I, morphology and melt flow on the laser cut front in Papers II, III and IV and laser piercing in Papers V and VI. Paper I investigates the effect of material type, material thickness, laser wavelength, and laser power on the efficiency of the cutting process for industrial state-of-the-art CO 2 and fibre <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> Here the <b>cutting</b> efficiency is defined in its most fundamental terms: as the area of cut edge created per Joule of laser energy. In Paper II a new experimental technique is presented which has been developed to enable high speed imaging of laser cut fronts produced using standard, commercial parameters. The results presented here suggest that the cut front produced when cutting 10 mm thick medium section stainless steel with a fibre laser and a nitrogen assist gas is covered in humps which themselves are covered in a thin layer of liquid. Paper III presents numerical simulations of the melt flow on a fibre laser ablation-driven processing front during remote fusion cutting, RFC. The simulations were validated with high speed imaging observations of the processing front. The simulation results provide explanations of the main liquid transport mechanisms on the processing front, based on information on the temperature, velocity and pressure fields involved. The results are of fundamental relevance for any process governed by a laser ablation induced front. In Paper IV cutting fronts created by CO 2 and fibre lasers in stainless steel at thicknesses between 2 mm and 10 mm have been ‘frozen’ and their geometry has been measured. The resulting three-dimensional shapes have been curve fitted as ninth order polynomials. Various features of the cutting front geometry are discussed, including the lack of correlation of the cut front inclination with either the relevant Brewster angle or the inclination of the striations on the cut edge. In this paper, mathematical descriptions of the cutting fronts are obtained, which can be used as input parameters by any researcher in the field of <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> simulations. Paper V investigates the subject of laser piercing. Before any cut is started the laser needs to pierce the material. In this paper the laser piercing process is investigated using a wide range of laser pulse parameters, for stainless steel using a fibre laser. The results reveal the influence of pulse parameters on pierce time and pierced hole diameter. A high speed imaging camera was used to time the penetration event and to study the laser-material interactions involved in drilling the pierced holes. In Paper VI a ‘dynamic’ or ‘moving beam’, laser piercing technique is introduced for processing 15 mm thick stainless steel. One important aspect of laser piercing is the reliability of the process because industrial <b>laser</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> are programmed for the minimum reliable pierce time. In this work a comparison was made between a stationary laser and a laser which moves along a circular trajectory with varying processing speeds. High speed imaging was employed during the piercing process to understand melt behavior inside the pierce hole. Throughout this work experimental techniques, including advanced high speed imaging, have been used in conjunction with simulations and theoretical analysis, to provide new knowledge for understanding and improving <b>laser</b> beam <b>cutting</b> and its associated piercing process...|$|R
