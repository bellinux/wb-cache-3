25|$|Electromechanical {{switching}} systems required sources of electricity {{in form of}} direct current (DC), as well as alternating ring current (AC), which were generated on-site with mechanical generators. In addition, telephone switches required adjustment of many mechanical parts. Unlike modern switches, a circuit connecting a dialed call through an electromechanical switch had DC continuity within the <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> area via metallic conductors.|$|E
25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had to dial the operator or {{look up the}} telephone number. An example of this was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> would require having to search through the city's 500-page telephone directory.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify, based on the {{portfolio}} balance exchange rate determination theory, the impact of the foreign exchange swaps offered by the Central Bank of Brazil on the attributes of the <b>local</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure. For this, it is used the Principal Component Regression. As a complementary analysis the volatility of the <b>local</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure and the volatility of the foreign exchange spot were studied. The results concerning the foreign exchange swaps were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the <b>local</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure. On the other hand, the swaps known as reversal foreign exchange swaps showed results that point out that the offer of this product by the Central Bank had no impact on the level of the <b>local</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> interest rate market.

50|$|The first System X unit {{to enter}} public service was in September 1980 and was {{installed}} in Baynard House, London and was a tandem junction unit which switched telephone calls amongst around 40 <b>local</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The first <b>local</b> digital <b>exchange</b> started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT's Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). The last electromechanical trunk exchange (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990 - completing the UK's trunk network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last electromechanical <b>local</b> <b>exchanges,</b> Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998.|$|R

25|$|In 1877, the American Bell Telephone Company, {{named after}} Alexander Graham Bell, opened the first {{telephone}} exchange in New Haven, Connecticut. Within {{a few years}} <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> companies were established in every major city in the United States.

25|$|This is {{also the}} area where the still largely unknown Jiroft culture emerged in the third millennium, as {{evidenced}} by excavation and looting of archaeological sites. The areas further north and east were important participants in the international trade of this period due to the presence of tin (central Iran and the Hindu Kush) and lapis lazuli (Turkmenistan and northern Afghanistan). Settlements such as Tepe Sialk, Tureng Tepe, Tepe Hissar, Namazga-Tepe, Altyndepe, Shahr-e Sukhteh and Mundigak served as <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> and production centres, but do not seem to have been capitals of larger political entities.|$|E
500|$|One {{approach}} to this dilemma has been the attempt to [...] "internalize" [...] these [...] "externalities" [...] by using market strategies like ecotaxes and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services. Community currencies associated with <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> Trading Systems (LETS), a gift economy and Time Banking have also been promoted {{as a way of}} supporting local economies and the environment. Green economics is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment. The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years.|$|E

50|$|For {{calls to}} manual <b>local</b> <b>exchanges</b> with CCI {{equipment}} {{to display the}} called number to the operator, the equipment required at the manual exchange and the director equipment holding time can be minimised by using storage equipment at the automatic exchange which holds the number information until manual exchange equipment is available.|$|R
500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were interfaced into the <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so the two of them together are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E
