He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|The same year, the {{government}} appointed a commission, led by Bue Fjermeros, {{to look into}} the organization of the domestic air routes. Since the last compromise in splitting routes, the traffic had increased more in Braathens SAFE's domain that SAS'. The commission also <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> to whom the two next airports that would be opened, Haugesund Airport, Karmøy and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, would be given. Neither company wanted to cooperate beyond the existing arrangement of coordinating their routes time-wise, along with those of Widerøe. In addition, Braathens SAFE bought handling services from SAS at Gardermoen, Bergen, Bodø and Tromsø, while SAS bought handling services from Braathens SAFE at Stavanger. The commission granted SAS the rights to fly from Oslo to Haugesund, Harstad/Narvik and the new airport Svalbard Airport, Longyear. Braathens SAFE was allowed to fly from Bergen to Northern Norway via Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund. SAS lost the right to fly directly from Bergen to Northern Norway. When the matter was passed by parliament, they also granted SAS the right to fly from Oslo to Stavanger, even if their planes did not continue abroad.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss and {{confidently}} {{sent the}} tourists in to bat on what <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> lively pitch, in fact {{as the day}} wore on, batting became easier and easier. Australia retained their new opening partnership of Geoff Marsh and Mark Taylor who was playing in just his third Test and had so far failed to cement {{his place in the}} order. The first session saw the pair nervously trying to see off the new ball, and England's decision to bowl <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> good one when the opening stand was broken for 44, Marsh out for 16. The second wicket only added 13, with Australian stalwart David Boon caught behind for 9 and Australia teetering.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year saw the provincial Liberals come {{very close to}} extinction. The party's political credibility had been steadily eroding, and with the negotiations with Social Credit, it was not immediately clear that it had any ideological purpose. There was much discussion of the party abandoning provincial politics altogether (there was only one organization at federal and provincial levels), and concentrating on federal politics, which <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> great deal more hopeful at the time than they did two years later.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss {{and chose}} to bat on what <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> good Lord's batting pitch. Alderman began from the {{pavilion}} end and was bowling into the breeze, helping him {{to swing the}} ball. Graham Gooch and Chris Broad initially looked comfortable, but the ball began to move more as it wore on. Alderman finally struck, rapping Broad on the pads directly in front to have him LBW for 18. Kim Barnett was {{on the receiving end}} of some intimidating bowling from Merv Hughes, and the tactic paid off when Boon caught him at bat pad trying to fend a short ball away. Mike Gatting made a disappointing golden duck, dismissed in exactly the same fashion.|$|E

He <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him.

25|$|Xavier was {{selected}} for UEFA Euro 2000 {{and became one of}} the key figures in the competition, not only due to playing some of his best football but also due to a distinctly bleached-blonde hairstyle with a matching beard. In the semi-final against France, he went from close to hero, as France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez blocked what <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> sure goal, to a villain, when he deflected a shot by Sylvain Wiltord near the post in the dying seconds of golden goal extra time with his hand. Zinedine Zidane scored the penalty and put France in the final. Xavier was initially given a nine-month ban from football for his vociferous protests against referee Günter Benkö's decision to award the penalty, but it was eventually reduced to six months. In the 2002 World Cup, {{he was part of the}} squad but played only as a substitute in the final group stage match against South Korea in his final of 20 international appearances.|$|E

25|$|After {{surrendering}} their titles {{the following}} year, Cork {{had to wait}} until 1969 for further success. A 3–12 to 1–14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave McCarthy his first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial decider pitted Cork against reigning champions Tipperary. A 4–6 to 0–9 victory gave Cork a first defeat of Tipp since 1957 while it also gave McCarthy a second Munster medal. Once again this victory paved the way for an All-Ireland showdown with Kilkenny, however, the team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval and <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> good bet for the victory, particularly after Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. The Rebels were still to the good coming into the last quarter, however, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2–15 to 2–9.|$|E
25|$|Hutton returned, and England gave debuts to Peter Loader and Frank Tyson, who {{had been}} {{selected}} for the winter tour to Australia. Rain delayed the start and Pakistan were soon in trouble, falling to 51 for seven before Kardar and the tail effected a small recovery. Tyson and Loader took seven wickets between them. Torrential rain washed out the second day, and when England batted on the Saturday the pitch helped the Pakistani medium-fast bowlers, Fazal Mahmood and Mahmood Hussain, who took six and four wickets respectively. Every batsman was caught. For a second time, Pakistan were rescued by the tail, which doubled the score from 82 for eight to 164, with Wazir Mohammad making an unbeaten 43. Johnny Wardle took seven for 56 but lacked support. When Reg Simpson, Peter May and Denis Compton took England to 109 for two, an England victory <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> formality, but lower-order timidity against Fazal, who took a further six wickets to finish with 12 for 99 in the match, brought a famous victory after only 55 minutes on the fifth day.|$|E
25|$|The AIF took a {{break at}} this point with no matches between Monday, 10 and Wednesday, 20 August inclusive. They {{returned}} to action on Thursday, 21 August at Southchurch Park in Southend, playing Essex until Saturday, 23 August. Johnny Douglas won the toss and put the AIF in to bat. It <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> good decision as he took seven for 50 himself with his fast-medium pace and the Australians were all out for only 130. Essex were 101 for six at the close and reached 151 on the second morning, Gregory and Collins again bowling in tandem and taking four apiece. The Australians started again before lunch and this time their batting excelled with Taylor scoring 146 and Murray 82. From 362 for five overnight, Collins was able to declare at 447 for eight on the Saturday morning. Douglas took four more wickets, but this time conceding 168 runs, giving him eleven wickets in the match. In the fourth innings, the early Essex batsmen were no match for Gregory who took all the first five wickets, leaving the county on 22 for five. They eventually reached 117 and the Australians were easy winners in the end by 309 runs.|$|E

25|$|Nottinghamshire, captained for {{the first}} time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to {{retirement}} and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches.|$|E
25|$|Kenny Dalglish moved {{upstairs to}} the {{position}} of Director of Football {{at the end of the}} Premier League winning season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford. Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995–96 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points. A terrible start to the 1996–97 Premier League campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. After an abortive attempt to bring in Sven-Göran Eriksson as manager, long-serving coach Tony Parkes took over as manager for the rest of the campaign, narrowly steering the side to survival. That summer, the manager's job was taken by Roy Hodgson, who joined the club from Internazionale. UEFA Cup football was secured with a 6th-place finish. However, Rovers made a poor start to the 1998–99 campaign and Hodgson was sacked in December less than an hour after a 2–0 home defeat by bottom side Southampton, a result that locked Rovers in the relegation zone. He was replaced as manager by Brian Kidd. However, he could not save them as the club slipped away, relegation was confirmed with a scoreless draw at home to Manchester United in the penultimate game of the season.|$|E
25|$|Donegal {{opened the}} second half by adding to their lead. Colm McFadden's shot from play went over the bar to give him his third point of the game. More Dublin wides {{followed}} until their goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton stepped up to send a free over the Donegal bar and score his first point of the game. McFadden duly responded by sending another free over Cluxton's bar and Donegal opened up a three-point lead on a scoreline of 0–06 - 0-03. In the forty-ninth minute Dublin's Cian O'Sullivan showed his frustration by lashing out at Rory Kavanagh, sending him flat onto the Croke Park turf. O'Sullivan picked up a yellow card for his trouble. In the fifty-second minute Bernard Brogan sent over a simple free to reduce {{the gap between the}} sides, with Cluxton sending over a '45 soon afterwards. In the fifty-seventh minute Diarmaid Connolly won a free close to the Donegal goal but, before it was taken, Connolly lost his cool and raised a fist to the face of a Donegal player. The referee Maurice Deegan consulted his lineman Rory Hickey before showing Connolly the red card and changing his decision to a hop-ball which Donegal cleared. With ten minutes left Kevin McManamon sent over Dublin's first point from play, to bring the game level. With eight minutes left Bryan Cullen gave Dublin the lead with his team's second point from play. Five minutes later Bernard Brogan sent a free over Paul Durcan's bar to give Dublin a two-point lead. In stoppage time Durcan intercepted McManamon's pass to Michael Darragh MacAuley to prevent what <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> certain Dublin goal. Then Cluxton sent another free wide.|$|E

25|$|The 2004 tournament {{was held}} in Bangladesh. More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament. The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams - West Indies and Pakistan. It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd {{acclaimed}} the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own. The players, from the ten Test countries and six other nations, were feted wherever they went, and the appetite for cricket was remarkable: even Zimbabwe v Canada sold out. The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history. And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations. The downside was {{the quality of the}} cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions. Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England - when both teams had already qualified for the semis. England reached the last four, which was progress, and Alastair Cook <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> class apart. But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final. India completed the semi-finalists. Dhawan and Suresh Raina were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level. Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order. The captain Ambati Rayudu had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17. But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes. India's Shikhar Dhawan was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16. Bangladeshi Enamul Haque was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.|$|E
25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E
