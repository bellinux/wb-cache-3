5|$|Rabearivelo's {{early period}} of modernist-inspired poetry showed skill and {{attracted}} critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim. Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry reviews, Rabearivelo was never afforded {{access to the}} elite social circles of colonial Madagascar. He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments, including {{the death of his}} daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhibitors</b> at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.|$|E

The system would be more useful if it is augmented with a recommender system. Our recommender system would recommend users a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> interesting <b>exhibitors</b> based on associations that mined from the web server logs. The recommendations are ranked based on various Objective Interestingness Measures (OIMs) that quantify the interestingness of an association. Due to data sparsity, some OIMs cannot provide distinct values for different rules and hamper the ranking process. In mobile applications, the ranking of recommendations is crucial because of the low real estate in mobile device screen sizes. We show that our system is able to select an OIM (from 50 OIMs) that would perform better than the regular Support-Confidence OIM.
