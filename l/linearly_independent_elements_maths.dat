More precisely {{a set of}} <b>linearly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>elements</b> describing the forces (a basis) is identified.

From this set of trajectories, a generic static force basis was determined by using static Beam, B-spline theories and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This generic basis was first validated on theoretical simulations and then on 20 different needles inserted into in vivo human tissues during real clinical interventions.

Let Magg be the kernel of the Magnus representation of the Torelli group of a compact, connected, oriented surface S of genus g ≥ 2 with one boundary component. And let Burn be the kernel of the Burau representation of the braid group on n strands, for n ≥ 6. In this paper it is shown that these groups have infinite rank first homology. As a consequence, neither group is finitely generated. Both kinds of groups are treated in a similar way, by constructing a “Johnson-type ” homomorphism from the corresponding group to Hom(G ab, ∧ 2 G ab). In {{the case of the}} Magnus representation G = [π 1 (S), π 1 (S) ], while {{in the case of the}} Burau representation G is the kernel of the homomorphism Fn → Z taking each fixed generator of Fn (the free group of rank n) to 1. In each case, the authors find infinitely many <b>linearly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>elements</b> contained in the image of the “Johnson-type ” homomorphism, so the main result follows.

Previously, V. G. Drinfel′d (in a fundamental paper (1983, Soviet Math. Dokl. 27, No. 1, 68 - 71)), introduced the notion of what later (1987, in "Proceedings, International Congress of Mathematicians, 1986, Berkeley, CA," pp. 798 - 820, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI) {{came to be known as}} a triangular, coboundary Lie bialgebra G associated to a solution r ∈ G ⊗ G of the Classical Yang-Baxter Equation; and together with A. A. Belavin he showed (1982, Functional Anal. Appl. 16, No. 3, 159 - 180) that all invertible solutions r of that equation could be obtained as inverses of 2 -cocycles. E. Witten (1988, Comm. Math. Phys. 114, 1 - 53) considered the case of such invertible r for diff(S 1), the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on the circle. E. Beggs and S. Majid (1990, Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré Phys. Theor. 53, No. 1, 15 34) considered the invertible case further (in a topological framework) and found solutions for the complexification of diff(S 1) but not for the real Lie algebra diff(S 1). In this note, we exhibit a Lie bialgebra structure corresponding to a non-invertible solution r. The method by which we obtain such a structure works for both the real and the complex case of diff(S 1), the Virasoro algebra (with or without a central extension), the Witt algebra, and many other Lie algebras. We present an explicit expression for the diagonal in all these cases.

40|$|We shall use {{the setup}} and the {{notation}} of [1], where we considered the eigenvalue problem JLωu = λu (1) for a self-adjoint operator Lω and a bounded, skew-symmetric, invertible operator J (i. e. J ∗ = −J) with properties as in [1]. Let kr represent {{the number of}} positive real eigenvalues of (1), kc the number of quadruplets of eigenvalues with nonzero real and imaginary parts, and k − i the number of pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues with negative Krein signature. Slightly rephrasing [1, (3. 2) ], we have Lωφj = 0, JLωψj = φj, j = 1, [...] ., n (2) for <b>linearly</b> <b>independent</b> <b>elements</b> φj and ψj. Following [1, (3. 1) ], let D ∈ R n×n be given by Dij = 〈ψi, Lωψj〉. We denote the dimension of the null space of a self-adjoint operator A {{and the number of}} its negative eigenvalues by z(A) and n(A), respectively. Our goal is to prove that [1, Theorem 3. 2] can be strengthened as follows: Theorem 1 Assume that [1, Hypotheses 2. 1 - 2. 2] hold true and that z(D) = 0, then we have kr + 2 kc + 2 k − i = n(Lω) − n(D). (3) The original statement [1, Theorem 3. 2] showed that the left-hand side is {{less than or equal to}} the right-hand side. Remark 1 As a consequence of Theorem 1, the discussion in [1, § 5. 4] can be made more definitive. In particular, it is not possible for a resonance pole to create an eigenvalue of negative Krein signature, so that any eigenvalues arising from an edge bifurcation must necessarily have positive Krein signature. The rest of this note is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1. The basic idea is to embed the original problem into the framework of [1, § 3. 3 - 3. 4] in which we were able to establish the equality (3). Following [2], we define Mω: = J ∗ LωJ = −JLωJ. We record that Mω is self-adjoint and, because J has a bounded inverse, we have z(Mω) = z(Lω). The equation 〈Lωv, v 〉 = 〈LωJw, Jw 〉 = 〈J ∗ LωJw, w 〉 = 〈Mωw, w〉, v = Jw (4) together with invertibility of J shows that Next, we se...|$|R
