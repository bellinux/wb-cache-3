40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{strategies to}} build a library consortium from a long term point of view. Contrary to the conventional wisdom {{to build a}} consortium around groups of homogenous institutions (Davis, 2002), we find that <b>libraries</b> <b>with</b> similar preferences are likely to lose from building a consortium while <b>libraries</b> <b>with</b> opposite preferences almost always gain from it. Our results suggest a strong tension between a short-term strategy and a long-term strategy {{as long as the}} former dictates forming a consortium around <b>libraries</b> <b>with</b> homogenous preferences in order to gain from quantity discounts. This tension might create a "library consortium trap"...|$|R

5|$|Currently, Tuck {{has five}} {{residential}} facilities: Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968) and Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000) Pineau-Valencienne Hall, Achtmeyer Hall and Raether Hall (2008). Further, a new complex called the Tuck Living and Learning Complex that houses 95 additional {{students as well}} as classrooms and study space serves as the home for nearly half of first-year Tuck students. This state-of-the-art facility was constructed in 2008 for around $27.2 million. The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering <b>Library)</b> <b>with</b> the adjacent Thayer School of Engineering. The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's {{library was}} started {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The library grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one of the homes of the library in the early years. The library was located {{on the third floor of}} the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University Library, which by 1901 was a free, general <b>library</b> <b>with</b> both circulating and reference collections. That year the library collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{construction}} {{began on}} a new concrete and brick-faced building to house the library. Completed in 1938, the building housed a collection that grew to 35,000 volumes in 1940. Now known as Smullin Hall, the library building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi in the Georgian style of architecture. In 1965, the school received a $450,000 loan {{from the federal government}} for the library. Congressman Al Ullman worked to secure status as a Federal Depository Library in the late 1960s, with status conferred in 1969. In 1980, Willamette began a multi-year fund raising campaign intended to raise funds to renovate academic halls and build a new <b>library,</b> <b>with</b> $18 million total raised during the funding drive. At the time the library held a collection of 143,000 volumes.|$|E

5|$|In England, St-Calais {{once more}} became a leading {{advisor to the}} king. In 1093 he {{negotiated}} with Anselm, Abbot of Bec, concerning Anselm's becoming Archbishop of Canterbury; in 1095 it was St-Calais who prosecuted the royal case against Anselm after he had become archbishop. During his bishopric, St-Calais stocked the cathedral <b>library</b> <b>with</b> books, especially canon law texts. He was also active in defending the north of England against Scots raids. Before his death, {{he had made his}} peace with Anselm, who blessed and consoled St-Calais on his deathbed.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} years, the library {{received}} book donations {{from the village}} Sunday school and the Club. In July 1928, the library moved from the Community Center building to the tower room of the former Briarcliff Farms office building, currently {{a branch of the}} International Union of Operating Engineers. The Community Center building was sold in October 1929 for $16,000; these funds were required to be used for recreational purposes. Thus, the organization gave $11,000 to the village for the construction of the Law Memorial Park pool, and $5,000 to the library. Upon the building's sale and the Club's dissolution, the library was reconstituted as an association <b>library</b> <b>with</b> a 15-member board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{building}} is a six-storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the Beinecke Library, containing the King's <b>Library</b> <b>with</b> 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820. In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by Rosie Winterton. The new facility, costing £26 million, has a capacity for seven million items, stored in more than 140,000 bar-coded containers, which are retrieved by robots, from the 162.7 miles of temperature and humidity-controlled storage space.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small <b>library</b> <b>with</b> biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
5|$|No more volumes were {{purchased}} {{until the end}} of 1820, when the society acquired the works of Livy, Tacitus, and John Marshall's Life of Washington. Three months later, the society purchased a bookcase for its growing collection. In April 1821, the society further expanded its <b>library</b> <b>with</b> the acquisitions of Nathaniel Hooke's Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth, the works of Herodotus, Travels in Greece, Modern Europe, David Ramsay's History of the United States, and the works of Benjamin Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Oregon State University was {{established}} in 1868. The Oregon Legislative Assembly appropriated $1,000 to the school to buy books for a library in 1876, marking the first instance of the legislature giving funds to the school for a library. In 1887, the library {{was established}} at the school, and in 1890, May Warren was hired as the first full-time librarian. By 1893 the library's collection had grown to 1,950 volumes. After adding 2,600 volumes from 1899 to 1900, the collection stood at 5,000 volumes. At that time the library was a free, general <b>library</b> <b>with</b> both circulating and reference collections with A. J. Stimpson serving as the librarian. The library also had 6,000 pamphlets {{at that time and}} the annual circulation was 8,000.|$|E
