5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed <b>less</b> <b>power</b> than Intel chips announced {{around the same time}} and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E

He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce <b>less</b> <b>power</b> than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|E

5|$|USB2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip (HSIC) is a chip-to-chip {{variant of}} USB2.0 that {{eliminates}} the conventional analog transceivers found in normal USB. It was adopted {{as a standard}} by the USB Implementers Forum in 2007. The HSIC physical layer uses about 50% <b>less</b> <b>power</b> and 75% less board area compared to traditional USB2.0. HSIC uses two signals at 1.2V and has a throughput of 480Mbit/s. Maximum PCB trace length for HSIC is 10cm. It does not have low enough latency to support RAM sharing between two chips.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{building}} a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, {{in parallel with}} Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C.

5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a {{concrete}} gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means <b>less</b> <b>power</b> can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.|$|E
5|$|In New York, {{the city}} asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and {{apartment}} buildings to stop incinerating their residents' garbage and turn heating down to 60°F (15°C). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, {{and to use}} <b>less</b> <b>power</b> and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic was light in New York City. A check on 303 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests.

5|$|Qualcomm {{unveiled}} its next-gen Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC on November 17, 2016, {{which will}} be built by Samsung using its 10-nanometer FinFET process. The new processor will have 30 percent more parts within the same space and will have 27 percent better performance with 40 percent <b>less</b> <b>power.</b> Due to Samsung's role in manufacturing the chip, its mobile division also acquired the initial inventory of the chip. This means that no other OEM {{will be able to}} manufacture products containing the 835 until the release of Samsung's next flagship device.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much <b>less</b> <b>power</b> available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The Intel 8080 did {{not have}} {{dedicated}} circuitry to support dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because in 1975, this type of memory was still a new technology. MITS wanted to use DRAM because it consumed <b>less</b> <b>power</b> than static RAM. However, they had several design and component problems {{that led to a}} high failure rate with their 4K Dynamic RAM board. By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards with the promise of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.|$|E
5|$|The SIII {{comes in}} two {{distinct}} variations that differ {{primarily in the}} internal hardware. The international SIII version has Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad {{system on a chip}} (SoC) containing a 1.4GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 central processing unit (CPU) and an ARM Mali-400 MP graphics processing unit (GPU). According to Samsung, the Exynos 4 Quad doubles the performance of the Exynos 4 Dual used on the SII, while using 20percent <b>less</b> <b>power.</b> Samsung had also released several 4G LTE versions—4G facilitates higher-speed mobile connection compared to 3G—in selected countries to exploit the corresponding communications infrastructures that exist in those markets. Most of these versions use Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 SoC featuring a dual-core 1.5GHz Krait CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU. The South Korean and Australian versions are a hybrid of the international and 4G-capable versions.|$|E

5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required <b>less</b> <b>power</b> to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
5|$|The major {{difference}} between the F-4J and the British Phantoms was {{the absence of the}} Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, the former being fitted with the GE J79-10B. This produced <b>less</b> <b>power</b> than the British engine, but had a faster afterburner light up, giving it better performance at high altitude, at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level. The high-altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes. Initially delivered capable of carrying the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (AAM), they were soon made compatible with the Skyflash and SUU-23A gun pod, bringing them into line {{with the rest of the}} RAF's Phantoms. Despite modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet, the F-4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with, even requiring their crews to use American flying helmets.|$|E
