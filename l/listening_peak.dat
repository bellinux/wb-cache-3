5000|$|The second single from Ear Candy: the Reddy co-write [...] "The Happy Girls", began a seven-week Hot 100 tenure with 8 October 1977 chart with an {{eventual}} peak of #57, the 8 October 1977 issue of Billboard also inaugurated the eleven-week Easy Listening chart tenure of [...] "The Happy Girls", the Easy <b>Listening</b> <b>peak</b> {{of which was}} #14. The singles B-side: [...] "Laissez les Bontemps Rouler", afforded Reddy a unique Hot Country Songs chart appearance with a one-week tenure at #98 reported in the 22 October 1977 issue of Billboard. In November 1977, [...] "The Happy Girls" [...] reached #65 on the Canadian pop chart.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} {{advertisements in}} Hits FM are rated according to <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> time. It is rated in five different categories, namely; Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver and Brass.|$|R
50|$|HF/DF used {{a set of}} antennas {{to receive}} the same signal in {{slightly}} different locations or angles, and then used the slight differences in the signal to display the bearing to the transmitter on an oscilloscope display. Earlier systems used a mechanically rotated antenna (or solenoid) and an operator <b>listening</b> for <b>peaks</b> or nulls in the signal, which took considerable time to determine, often {{on the order of}} a minute or more. HF/DF's display made the same measurement essentially instantaneously, which allowed it to catch fleeting signals, such as those from the U-boat fleet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{programme}} {{is considered}} one of the BBC's most successful projects, acknowledged to have [...] "transformed the landscape for serious ideas at <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> time". Frequent contributors to the programme since 1998 include A. C. Grayling, Angie Hobbs, Ian Stewart, Simon Schaffer, Martin Palmer, John Mullan, Steve Jones and Carolin Crawford.|$|R
5000|$|In Our Time is a live BBC radio {{discussion}} series {{exploring the}} history of ideas, presented by Melvyn Bragg since 15 October 1998. It is one of BBC Radio 4's most successful discussion programmes, acknowledged to have [...] "transformed the landscape for serious ideas at <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> time". As of 6 July 2017, 769 episodes have been airedand the series attracts a weekly audience exceeding two million listeners.|$|R
50|$|In {{the days}} before {{television}}, <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> time was around 8pm, but with television arriving {{in the country in}} the late 1950s, the station had to change formats to survive the new medium. This was even more the case when 2KO's owners at the time, United Broadcasting Company (Australia) (who also owned Sydney's 2UE), itself owned by the local Lamb family, was part of the consortium that brought television to Newcastle, launching NBN Television on channel 3 in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|The Chaba River {{is a major}} {{tributary}} of the Athabasca. The Chaba is fed by the glacial melt originating in the Chaba Icefield, comprising Chaba Peak, as well as <b>Listening</b> and Sundial <b>Peaks.</b> A small glacier on Mount Quincy also contributes to the Chaba. The river was given its name by A. P. Coleman, a geologist born in Eastern Canada in 1852. [...] He stated there [...] "were endless beaver dams and trees" [...] along the river, and named it after the Stoney Indian word for beavers." ...|$|R
5000|$|The CBSC panel later {{ruled that}} CKIX-FM's {{handling}} of the [...] "Missing 9" [...] contest - specifically placing the object such {{that it was not}} reasonably accessible to the public at the outset, and later moving the object in contradiction of the broadcast clues - violated Clause 12 of the Canadian Association of Broadcastersâ€™ Code of Ethics. That clause states that [...] "all on-air contests and promotions shall be conceived and conducted fairly and legitimately and particular care shall be taken to ensure that they are not misleading". As is standard practice for CBSC violations, the station was required to announce the decision twice during <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> hours.|$|R
50|$|The City Talk format was revived when, on 9 November 2006, it was {{announced}} by Ofcom that Radio City had beaten competition from rival broadcasters to win a new FM licence for a talk station for the Liverpool area. The new City Talk launched on 28 January 2008 and broadcasts on 105.9FM. Due to poor listening figures, the station has since dropped most of its presenters and had a format change which means, outside of <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> hours like breakfast and drivetime, the station now broadcasts a mix of classic hit music similar to the music played on sister station Magic 1548, although under the format change the station {{is not allowed to}} simulcast with Magic, only Radio City.|$|R
5000|$|For many years, 3AK {{management}} {{had been}} lobbying the Postmaster General's Department and, then, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board {{for an increase}} to its permitted broadcasting hours. Eventually, 3AK was allowed to broadcast during those daylight hours when {{it was thought that}} it would not interfere with transmissions from 2BS. From 1 February 1954, 3AK was permitted to broadcast from 6.00 am-7.00 pm daily. [...] However, 2BS still experienced difficulties during the Summer and, so, for 4-5 months per year, 3AK was forced not to open until 7.00 am and to close as early as 5.00 pm. Until the introduction of television into Australia in 1956, the peak hours for any radio station were 7.00 pm-10.00 pm - 3AK was never {{able to take advantage of}} this <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> period.|$|R
5000|$|The KM Group {{increased}} {{their involvement in}} the station's day-to-day running in October 2000 with a re-launch and programming re-direction. The station became the fastest growing in the UK in terms of listenership with a 48% increase in listening in Q4 RAJAR 2000 (in part due to highly successful sponsorship deal with the University of Kent Cricket Club) and a 500% increase in <b>peak</b> <b>listening,</b> during the Ian St James breakfast show. The KM Group took full control of the station in 2001, following a [...] "public interest test" [...] due to laws preventing a newspaper group owning a radio station {{in the same area}} unless it was found not to be against the public interest. The station was rebranded to KMFM Canterbury the following year, moving the studios to the Kentish Gazette offices.|$|R
50|$|After a brief spell at Fire Radio in Bournemouth, in 2001 {{he joined}} Virgin Radio (now Absolute Radio), {{initially}} working in late night or overnight spots. In 2004 {{he became the}} host of the Most Wanted show, but in late 2006, he was allocated the Virgin Radio Drivetime show an afternoon/early evening show at one of the <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> times of the day. He has, however, worked in many slots on the radio station at various times of the day and week, often filling in for missing DJs. Jones has presented a wide variety of shows, including Afternoons, Virgin Superstars, Most Wanted, Virgin radio drive-time, Album Chart, Sunday Night Live 7-10pm. Since July 2007 however, Jones has returned to primarily host the Most Wanted show. This suits Jones's needs well, given that interviewing well established actors and successful musicians and any musical sessions is one of his most desired areas of radio broadcasting.|$|R
40|$|The noise {{coming from}} wind power {{development}} {{can be an}} environmental impact forthe surrounding communities. It {{is well known that}} the main wind turbine noise iscaused by the movement of the turbine wings through the air. However, there areuncertainties about the importance of machinery sounds and possible variations amongwind turbines. A high resolution acquisition system was used to perform a fieldexperiment comparison of the noise spectra from some wind turbines at Laholm(Sweden). The results have shown different band spectra peaks associated to machinerysounds among wind turbines from the same model and also from those of differentmanufactures. Maintenance conditions of these wind turbines could explain thedifferences in intensity and frequency locations of the band spectra peaks found. Inorder to know the importance for human audition of these <b>peaks,</b> <b>listening</b> test or doseresponsestudies would be needed to provide relevant information in this regard. Themethodology developed in this study is suggested to be useful for identifying certainmachinery failures which could corrupt the noise sounds emitted at certain wind turbinelocations...|$|R
40|$|A study {{investigated}} {{the use of the}} Cypriot Greek dialect (CG) in radie commercials of the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) over a period of ten years. CG, the language of everyday interaction in Cypriot villages, is distinguished from the other language variety commonly used, one closer to standard modern Greek. Analysis of the radio commercials in CG focuses or why this variety is chosen in certain commercials, principally those for traditional food products, locally manufactured products competitive with similar imported products, and products whose possession indicates maintenance of traditional values. It is concluded that CG is used to appeal to rural lower and middle class consumers who embody the values of trad:tional Cypriot society. The most important values, as deduced from the commercials themselves, include consumption of traditional foods, exclusive use of Cypriot products, and priority of family. These commercials also tend to be broadcast at a single <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> time, after chuvch and before the traditional family meal on Sundays.

50|$|In use, the RDF {{operator}} {{would first}} tune {{the receiver to}} the correct frequency, then manually turn the loop, either listening or watching an S meter to determine {{the direction of the}} null (the direction at which a given signal is weakest) of a long wave (LW) or medium wave (AM) broadcast beacon or station (listening for the null is easier than <b>listening</b> for a <b>peak</b> signal, and normally produces a more accurate result). This null was symmetrical, and thus identified both the correct degree heading marked on the radio's compass rose as well as its 180-degree opposite. While this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft, the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction. By taking bearings to two or more broadcast stations and plotting the intersecting bearings, the navigator could locate the relative position of his ship or aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Before the MAPL {{system was}} {{established}} in 1971, Canadian music was regarded with indifference by Canadian radio, and during the 1960s, much of Canadian radio was dominated by British and American acts. This was a major hurdle for Canadian musicians since they could not gain attention in their home country without having a hit single in the United States or Europe first. Even after MAPL was implemented in the early 1970s, some radio stations were criticised for ghettoizing their Canadian content to dedicated program blocks, in off-peak listening hours such as early mornings or after midnight, during which the music played would be almost entirely Canadian â€” thus having the effect of significantly reducing how many Canadian songs would actually have to be played during <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> times. These program blocks became mockingly known as [...] "beaver hours". This practice is now prevented by CRTC regulations stipulating that CanCon percentages must be met between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., rather than allowing a station to save all their Canadian content for off-peak hours.|$|R
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period, commercial stations typically had a schedule that looked something like this: a breakfast session with bright music including band music, news and weather, a children's segment and, usually, an exercise segment; morning programs {{were aimed at}} women listeners, often with large blocks of soap operas or serials, and many segments of the handy hints genre; afternoon programs were also usually geared at women but with more music and, often, a request session; after school, there was inevitably a Children's Session (often hosted by an aunt or uncle or both), and usually featuring birthday greetings; {{this was followed by}} another block of serials, often geared at children, and/or dinner music; the major news bulletin was usually at 7.00pm, often followed by a news commentary; the <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> hours typically consisted of a mix of variety programs (including many quizzes), dramas, talent quests and the occasional musical program, often live; late night programming mainly consisted of relaxing music, usually mellow jazz or light classical. There was usually only one station in each capital city that was licensed to broadcast through the night.|$|R
