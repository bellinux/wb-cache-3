5|$|In 1724, {{the suburb}} of Floriana {{was founded in}} the area between the Floriana <b>Lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Valletta Land Front. The suburb was named Borgo Vilhena after Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena, but it was {{commonly}} known as Floriana. It is now a town in its own right.|$|E
5|$|The MCTA {{would buy}} 500 {{high-speed}} air-conditioned subway cars {{to operate on}} the new lines. New and expanded train depots would be built for the new <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enlarged subway fleet. The purchase of an additional 500 subway cars was covered in Phase II.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} bus network {{that covers the}} entire city by three bus services, but no tram or subway exists. The three bus operators are partially owned by the city (KPKM, KPK and KZK) and each shares approximately {{a third of the}} <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bus fleet.|$|E
50|$|Regional Express Rail (RER) is {{a project}} to improve GO Transit train service by adding all-day, two-way service to <b>the</b> Barrie <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inner {{portions}} of <b>the</b> Kitchener <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Stouffville <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> by increasing frequency of train service on various lines to as often as every 15 minutes on five of the corridors. This would be achieved with the full electrification of <b>the</b> Lakeshore East <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Barrie <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electrification of the inner portions of the Lakeshore West <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> Kitchener <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Stouffville <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{ridge of}} low Jurassic hills {{runs through the}} county, {{separating}} the basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> M1 motorway, and it has many small industrial centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural feature is its country houses and mansions.|$|E
5|$|After a {{hard but}} {{inconclusive}} fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to dislodge the French <b>lines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{returning}} {{track in}} the south of the station between <b>the</b> Kobe <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Takarazuka <b>Line.</b> The track is used for the trains for <b>the</b> Kobe <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Takarazuka <b>Line</b> running to <b>and</b> from Shojaku Workshop for maintenance, and for seasonal trains running between Kobe or Takarazuka <b>and</b> Arashiyama via <b>the</b> Kobe <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kyoto <b>Line.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of Valletta were {{not strong enough to}} withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana <b>Lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Valletta Land Front, and it is now a town in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Griffiss International Airport in Rome {{primarily}} serves {{military and}} general aviation, and Syracuse Hancock International Airport and Albany International Airport provide regional, domestic, and international passenger air {{travel in the}} Utica–Rome Metropolitan Area. Amtrak's Empire, Maple Leaf, and Lake Shore Limited trains stop at Utica's Union Station. Bus service {{is provided by the}} Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (CENTRO), a Syracuse public transport operator which runs 12 lines in Utica and has a downtown hub. Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound <b>Lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Birnie Bus Company, with weekday and Saturday service to Syracuse; both stop at Union Station.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal <b>lines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Kempeitai under Lieutenant Colonel Haruzo Sumida was charged with finding the culprits {{responsible}} for acts of sabotage in Singapore, mainly the cutting of telephone <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> burning of warehouses. Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, the British built Fort Verdala and St. Clement's Retrenchment in the Cottonera area, while Lascaris Battery {{was built}} in Valletta. Later on in the 19th century, parts of the Cottonera Lines, Santa Margherita <b>Lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fortifications of Senglea were {{demolished}} {{to make way for}} extensions of the Malta Dockyard. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the British built barracks {{in various parts of the}} island, such as Tigné Point and Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the NK 6th Division {{had made}} {{breakthroughs}} in the US 24th Infantry sector to the south, overwhelming the regiment and forcing it back. The 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, on the ridges overlooking Haman, was pushed back as its soldiers retreated without orders. Survivors from the 24th Infantry's 1st and 2nd battalions later {{appeared in the}} 35th's <b>lines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> regimental commanders found that the entire regiment had crumbled under North Korean attack. Kean ordered the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry to move in and help restore the 24th's position.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine {{also proved}} that if lines are drawn through the Lemoine point {{parallel}} {{to the sides of}} the triangle, then the six points of intersection of the <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sides of the triangle are concyclic, or that they lie on a circle. This circle is now known as the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.|$|E
5|$|SS Black Osprey was a {{cargo ship}} for the American Diamond <b>Lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British Cairn Line. She was {{formerly}} known as SS West Arrow when she was launched for the USSB during World War I. The ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Arrow (ID-2585) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian pelican is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct. However, several colonies are increasing in size and the colony at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece has nearly 1000 breeding pairs.|$|E
30|$|The {{network edges}} are denoted as the {{branches}} of <b>the</b> transmission <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> transformers, <b>the</b> weight as the impedance of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> direction as that of power flow.|$|R

5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|The next day, September 16, {{there was}} further {{fighting}} when {{a clash of}} outposts escalated into a running battle below Washington's lines on Harlem Heights. After several hours exchange of musketry, the forces engaged returned to their start <b>lines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> position of the two armies on Manhattan remained relatively unchanged {{for the next two}} months. Having held their own against picked British troops, the American army received a much needed boost to their morale after the debâcle of the previous day, while the British acquired a renewed respect for the American ability to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
