40|$|With the {{potential}} for extreme weather conditions, {{it is necessary to}} clarify the policy for office closure, excused absences and the coding of time and attendance (T&A) reports. Please read this policy carefully. Since all employees will be expected to be familiar with this policy if weather conditions so warrant, it is strongly encouraged that each employee keep a copy of this policy handy at home. First, and most important, employees are to presume the office is open for business, regardless of weather conditions or emergency situations that may exist. Each employee is responsible for assessing the weather and transportation conditions that may exist and determining the risk of commuting to work. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) do not require employees to travel during inclement weather; therefore, a liberal leave policy will be in effect during these periods. Employees who determine the risk is too great will be granted personal leave (annual <b>leave,</b> <b>credit</b> hours, compensatory time and leave without pay [LWOP]). Employees under a flexible schedule may adjust their hours to complete their basic work requirement. However, if conditions are so severe (e. g., public safety authorities urge people to stay home), the office may be closed for {{all or part of the}} day. The primary source of information for FS and BLM employees concerning office closure or delayed arrival due to weather conditions is by contacting either of the following numbers...|$|E

40|$|The Maternity/Paternity/Adoption Leave, more {{commonly}} referred to as “Parental Leave, ” is a paid leave associated with the birth of an employee’s own child or the placement of a child with the employee in connection with adoption, and includes foster care for certain employee categories (specified by an asterisk below).

25|$|In October 2017, the MTA started {{installing}} eTix-compatible {{electronic ticketing}} turnstiles in 14 stations in Manhattan. The eTix system, already {{used on the}} Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, allows passengers to pay their fares using their phones. The system would originally be for MTA employees only. On October 23, 2017, {{it was announced that}} the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by a contactless fare payment system also by Cubic, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Wallet, debit/credit cards with near-field communication enabled, or radio-frequency identification cards. The October 23 announcement calls for the expansion of this system to a general-use electronic fare payment system at 500 subway turnstiles and 600 buses by late 2018, with all buses and subway stations using electronic fare collection by 2020. However, support of the MetroCard is slated to remain until 2023.

Traditionally, best-efforts syndications were used for risky borrowers or for complex transactions.

This also includes attendance monitoring using biometrics, calculation of tardiness and absences of employees, and processing and printing of payroll. The system is developed using Visual Basic. Net, as the main programming language, SQL Server 2008 for back end database, MS Word and MS Excel for all needed reports. Two (2) units of computers that served as server and client, network devices and finger print biometric scanner completed the set-up of the developed system. The developed system consists of three (3) major application software or modules such as the Human Resource Information System, the Fingerprint Attendance System and the Payroll Alert System. The Human Resource Information System {{is used in the}} processing of employee records of the HR office. The Fingerprint Attendance System is used for getting the employee’s time-in and time-out for their attendance. The Payroll Alert System is used in notifying the accounting staff to generate the payroll on time.

Finally, we highlight a potential cost of setting defaults too high, as a higher proportion of customers opt to <b>leave</b> no <b>credit</b> card tip when presented with the higher suggested amounts...|$|R
