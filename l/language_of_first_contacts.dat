In our theoretical description, the non-Markovian feature of monomer motion, arising from the interactions with the other monomers, is captured by accounting for the non-equilibrium conformations of the macromolecule at the very instant <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>contact.</b> This analysis reveals a simple scaling relation for the MFCT between two monomers, which involves only their equilibrium distance and the spectral dimension of the macromolecule, independently of its microscopic details.

40|$|Abstract Background: To {{the best}} of our knowledge, there are no studies {{evaluating}} the influence of the unit <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> <b>contact</b> on the frequency and time of pharmacological treatment during an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. Objectives: The main objective was to investigate if the unit <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>contact</b> influenced the frequency and time of aspirin treatment in the Strategy of Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ERICO) study. Methods: We analyzed the pharmacological treatment time in 830 ERICO participants - 700 individuals for whom the hospital was the unit <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>contact</b> and 130 who initially sought primary care units. We built logistic regression models to study whether the unit <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>contact</b> was associated with a treatment time of less than three hours. Results: Individuals who went to primary care units received the first aspirin dose in those units in 75. 6 % of the cases. The remaining 24. 4 % received aspirin at the hospital. Despite this finding, individuals from primary care still had aspirin administered within three hours more frequently than those who went to the hospital (76. 8 % vs 52. 6 %; p< 0. 001 and 100 % vs. 70. 7 %; p= 0. 001 for non ST-elevation ACS and ST-elevation myocardial infarction, respectively). In adjusted models, individuals coming from primary care were more likely to receive aspirin more quickly (odds ratio: 3. 66; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 06 - 6. 51). Conclusions: In our setting, individuals from primary care were more likely to receive aspirin earlier. Enhancing the ability of primary care units to provide early treatment and safe transportation may be beneficial in similar settings...|$|R
