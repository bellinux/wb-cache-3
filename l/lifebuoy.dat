25|$|At 1615 hrs Teti {{returned}} to sea and sighted an exhausted {{man in the}} water and covered with fuel oil. Caffery dived into the sea and supported the man, and Tetis crew threw them a <b>lifebuoy</b> on a line. The sea was tossing Teti so violently that her crew could not haul the two men aboard, so she towed them to calmer water inside the mole. Tetis engineer, Fanciulli, tried to haul the men aboard but because of the oil they kept slipping from his grasp. The tug India came to assist. Her Captain, Ragone, passed a rope around the two men, and Teti took the rope and towed the two men ashore.|$|E
25|$|Jones' {{father was}} a Southern Pacific {{railroad}} agent. Young Lindley Jones got his nickname by being so thin that he was compared to a railroad spike. At age 11 {{he got his first}} set of drums. As a teenager he played in bands that he formed himself; Jones' first band was called Spike Jones and his Five Tacks. A railroad restaurant chef taught him how to use pots and pans, forks, knives and spoons as musical instruments. Jones frequently played in theater pit orchestras. In the 1930s he joined the Victor Young orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including Al Jolson's <b>Lifebuoy</b> Program, Burns and Allen, and Bing Crosby's Kraft Music Hall.|$|E
50|$|The UK Royal Life Saving Society {{considers}} <b>lifebuoys</b> {{unsuitable for}} use in swimming pools because throwing one into a busy pool could injure the casualty or other pool users. In these locations, <b>lifebuoys</b> have been superseded by devices such as the torpedo buoy.|$|R

500|$|Even in {{the late}} 19th century, the islanders could {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the world only by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair which would, weather permitting, be visible to those on the isles of Harris and the Uists, or by using the [...] "St Kilda mailboat". This was the invention of John Sands, who visited in 1877. During his stay, a shipwreck left nine Austrian sailors marooned there, and by February supplies were running low. Sands attached a message to a <b>lifebuoy</b> salvaged from the Peti Dubrovacki and threw it into the sea. Nine days later it was picked up in Birsay, Orkney, and a rescue was arranged. The St Kildans, building on this idea, would fashion a piece of wood into the shape of a boat, attach it to a bladder made of sheepskin, and place in it a small bottle or tin containing a message. Launched when the wind came from the north-west, two-thirds of the messages were later found on the west coast of Scotland or, less conveniently, in Norway.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1847 Captain John Bush, of the Kirkcaldy and London Shipping Company, married Margaret Greig, {{daughter}} of a shipmaster, at the pier. In 1849 a <b>lifebuoy</b> and rope were provided at the pier head for swimmers who got into difficulty. A ladder leading into the sea was provided for swimmers, {{in addition to the}} stairs which were for use by steamboat passengers. By the 1850s the pier was falling into disrepair, but it was still popular with bathers, and early-morning trains were advertised allowing for a swim before work. There was a gymnasium {{at the head of the}} pier, and the Forth Swimming Club was based there from its inception in 1850. They organised swimming competitions, including [...] "fast swimming" [...] and [...] "long diving" [...] which were, respectively, a [...] race and an underwater endurance contest. [...] "Deep diving" [...] involved retrieving objects from the bottom in [...] of water then surfacing through a floating <b>lifebuoy.</b> A longer race was from Newhaven harbour to the Chain Pier, a distance of [...] In 1864 the winning time was 11 minutes and 35 seconds. Two floating platforms were moored east of the pier; the closer one was about [...] out. In July 1858 an attempt was made to restart ferry services from the pier; this caused annoyance to swimmers.|$|E

2500|$|Lever’s {{desire to}} {{directly}} influence the consumer {{led to the}} employment of “District Agents” whose tasks involved engaging directly {{with members of the}} public in order to advance the merits of the company’s products, as well as to act as undercover agents who reported on anything they observed that could be useful to Port Sunlight. The success of this aspect of Lever’s marketing strategy led to the first overseas manufacturing plant being established in Switzerland. 'Savonneries Helvetia' was the inspiration of the somewhat charismatic François-Henri Lavanchy-Clarke, Lever’s District Agent in Switzerland who used the fledgling cinema industry as an advertising tool. The success of this venture led, by 1900, to the establishment of factories in Switzerland, Germany, Canada, the United States, Holland, and Australia with several others planned, while the Sunlight brand had been strengthened by the addition of <b>Lifebuoy,</b> Vim and Lux.|$|E
2500|$|William Hesketh Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme ( [...] ; 19 September 1851 – 7 May 1925) was an English industrialist, philanthropist, and politician. Having {{been educated}} {{at a small}} private school {{until the age of}} nine, then at church schools until he was fifteen; a {{somewhat}} privileged education for that time, he started work at his father's wholesale grocery business in Bolton. Following an apprenticeship and a series of appointments in the family business, which he successfully expanded, he began manufacturing Sunlight Soap, building a substantial business empire with many well-known brands such as Lux and <b>Lifebuoy.</b> In 1886, together with his brother, James, he established Lever Brothers, {{which was one of the}} first companies to manufacture soap from vegetable oils, and which is now part of the Anglo-Dutch transnational business Unilever. In politics, Lever briefly sat as a Liberal MP for Wirral and later, as Lord Leverhulme, in the House of Lords as a Peer. He was an advocate for expansion of the British Empire, particularly in Africa and Asia, which supplied palm oil, a key ingredient in Lever's product line.|$|E

Hurricane Hunters aircraft investigating the storm flew much lower than normal in an unsuccessful effort to locate the stricken ship. The United States Coast Guard conducted searches during the day of October 2 without success; efforts resumed at dawn on October 3. On October 3, a <b>lifebuoy</b> from El Faro was recovered about [...] northeast of the ship's last known position.

40|$|Pumice is a {{volcanic}} igneous rock which forms when magma with extremely {{high levels of}} water and gases is violently ejected from a volcano (in an explosive eruption), cools and depressurizes quickly and simultaneously above the ground. It is typically light colored, composed of volcanic glass, {{may or may not}} contain crystals, and commonly originated from high-silica (felsic) to intermediate magmas. Pumice commonly has vesicular or foamy (porous) texture and very low density, so it is enough for it to become the only rock that can float in water. In this study, pumice is for the first time exposed to see its potential as a new and alternative material to produce floating devices and buoy products. This rock is cut and shaped to become some products, such as surfing boards and <b>lifebuoys.</b> Different from other types of the same kind products that are mostly made of heavy materials, such as plastic (polyethylene), rubber, and fibreglass, pumice-based products are lighter, stronger, more buoyant, more durable, resistant, friendly to users and environmental as well as unique in appearance. Potential markets and customers of these products among others are sport and safety equipments traders and marine transportation (such as ship and ferry) companies. People can use pumice-based surfing boards personally for surfing activity and pumice-based <b>lifebuoys</b> for swimming especially for babies and kids...|$|R
