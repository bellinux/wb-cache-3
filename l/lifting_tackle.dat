An indistinguishable object plunged past the schooner's stern, there was a crash to leeward as she rolled, and a man {{standing}} up in the boat clutched her rail. He was swung out of it as she rolled back again, but he crawled on to the rail with a rope in one hand, and after jamming it fast round something sprang down with the hooks of the <b>lifting</b> <b>tackles</b> {{which one of the}} rest had given him. Then, while two more men scrambled up, there was a clatter of blocks, but a shattered sea struck the boat as they hove her dear, and when she swung in the brine poured out through the rents in her.

50|$|Most yachts launch their {{dinghies}} by hand or with {{a simple}} <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> rigged from the main mast. Davits over the transom is convenient and elegant, but sailing in a heavy following sea could cause {{the loss of a}} dinghy. If a dinghy is towed, an extra line with a loop in the end (known as a lazy painter) can be attached to a dinghy so that if the towing line breaks, there is a line to grab with a boat hook. This makes retrieval easier at sea, especially if the boat is partially swamped.|$|E

50|$|An {{accepted}} procedure {{would be}} for the bellman to switch to on-board gas supply, in case the main breathing gas supply is part of the problem, then lower the <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> into the water deep {{enough to be able to}} hook onto the diver. Then put on his helmet or mask and open the hot water supply to his suit before pushing his umbilical out of the bell and opening the flood-up valve. The bellman then locks out and follows the diver's umbilical to the diver, and assesses the status of the diver.|$|E
50|$|The bell bottom hatch must {{be large}} enough for a large diver fully kitted with {{appropriate}} bailout cylinders, {{to get in and}} out without undue difficulty, and it can not be closed while the diver is outside as the umbilical is tended through the hatch by the bellman. It must also be possible for the bellman to lift the working diver in through the hatch if he is unconscious, and close the hatch after him, so that the bell can be raised and pressurised for the ascent. A <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> is usually fitted inside the bell for this purpose, and the bell may be partially flooded to assist the procedure.|$|E
50|$|Once {{under the}} bell, the bellman would hook the <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> {{to one or}} more of the D-rings {{provided}} for this purpose on the diver's harness, then enter the bell and hoist the diver in, taking care to avoid and release any snags, which may require the bellman to work below the water surface. Once the diver is in the bell, CPR should be started if the diver is not breathing. This requires the diver's helmet to be removed. If this must be done with the diver suspended from the hoist, the divers body must remain in the water to help preserve blood supply to the upper body and head by hydrostatic pressure.|$|E

The successful 11 -day Shuttle Radar Topography Mission produced the most complete terrain map of the world.

The payload consisted of a main antenna and an electronics package in the shuttle 2 ̆ 7 s payload bay with an outboard antenna {{at the end of}} a 200 f mast extended once the shuttle is in orbit. Maintaining the planned orbital profile was crucial to guarantee complete coverage of the entire land coverage with no gaps between radar swaths. Orbital maintenance was accomplished during trim maneuvers executed approximately once per day. Maneuver design was constrained significantly by the presence of the delicate 200 f mast. During the flight, seven trim burns were performed using a ?fly-cast? maneuver which required a set of precisely timed pulses to minimize loading on the mast. All maneuvers were successful and kept the orbit within required limits. Extensive interaction with the Johnson Space Center Flight Dynamics Office ensured proper design and execution of the orbital control...|$|R
50|$|With {{four minutes}} remaining, {{and the ball}} deep in North Queensland's territory, Ben Hunt conceded a penalty for a {{dangerous}} <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> on Linnett, giving North Queensland field position. North Queensland failed to score on the ensuing set; but on Brisbane's following set, the Broncos failed {{to get to a}} sixth tackle kick, after Feldt stripped the ball one-on-one from Hunt at midfield on fourth tackle with one minute remaining. North Queensland attacked, and on the sixth tackle, Michael Morgan ran to the right side, cut in to draw three Brisbane defenders, then flicked a short outside pass to Feldt who scored just inside the right corner as time expired. Thurston's attempted game-winning conversion hit the near upright and bounced out, leaving the game tied at 16-16.|$|E
50|$|The bellman is an in-water standby diver and backup to {{the working}} diver. The bellman will usually stay in the bell and tend the working diver's umbilical, but is also {{expected}} to be available for immediate deployment to assist the working diver and recover the diver to the bell if this becomes necessary. Procedures are basically similar to those for a surface standby diver, but the bellman must manage their own umbilical, usually by placing it all outside the bell so that it can run free under tension. Recovery of the distressed diver into the bell is also done entirely by the bellman, and a <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> may be provided to facilitate hoisting the diver to the airspace and securing them in place. The bellman will also ensure that the umbilicals of both divers are stowed before ascent {{to reduce the risk of}} them snagging.|$|E
50|$|Kilmar {{was another}} long boiler 0-6-0ST {{supplied}} new in 1869 by Hopkins Gilkes and Company (successors to Gilkes, Wilson and Co), works number 264.

Driving wheels were, again, 4 ft 0in diameter and cylinders were either 12in x 24in or 14in x 24in (sources disagree; Messenger says 13in x 24in). She was the only locomotive recorded to {{have been involved in}} an accident on the L&CR when a load of granite blocks that she was hauling managed to move the rails apart when heavy rain softened the ground sufficiently for the blocks holding the rails to move. While several wagons fell between the rails, Kilmar was unaffected, continuing her journey and returning the following day with a gang and <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle.</b> She became GWR number 1313 (Mitchell and Smith say 1312) and was scrapped in 1914.|$|E
50|$|In round 6, {{against the}} Sydney Roosters, Hunt had a {{brilliant}} {{performance in the}} match, scoring 2 tries, {{one of them in}} golden point extra time to win the match for the Broncos 22-18 at Suncorp Stadium. In round 25, against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Hunt scored his first NRL hat trick of tries in the Broncos 47-12 win at the Sydney Football Stadium. On 4 October 2015, in the 2015 NRL Grand Final match against the North Queensland Cowboys, Hunt played at halfback in the Broncos historic golden point 16-17 loss. Hunt was heavily talked about after the match after a horror last three minutes, first being penalized for a <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> on Cowboys centre Kane Linnett which resulting in Hunt being placed on report for the tackle. In the Broncos last set with ball in the match, Hunt got his hands on the ball 44 metres out from Brisbane's line, but a loose carry results in a one-on-one strip from Kyle Feldt, who shortly after scored the try in the corner to tie up the match at 16-all. Four seconds into extra time, with the ball spiralling in the air, Hunt set himself underneath the ball but knocked on, which give the Cowboys the opportunity win the match when the Cowboys' captain, Johnathan Thurston, kicked the winning field goal. Hunt played in 26 matches, scoring 12 tries and kicking 4 goals.|$|E

The Indigenous side won 20-6 over the NRL All Stars. On 27 February 2015, Hodges was named as the solo {{captain of the}} Broncos for the 2015 season by coach Wayne Bennett. On 25 April 2015, Hodges {{announced that he would}} retire from representative duties {{at the conclusion of the}} year in order to focus solely on playing for the Broncos. In what was his final State of Origin series, Hodges featured for Queensland in all three matches of the 2015 State of Origin series. In Game Three of the series, in what was his final State of Origin match for Queensland, Hodges scored the final points of the match, converting Aidan Guerra's 78th minute try in an eventual 52-6 win in front of a record crowd of 52,500 at Suncorp Stadium. On 10 August 2015, Hodges announced that he would retire from Rugby League at the end of the season. In the Broncos Preliminary Finals match against the Sydney Roosters, Hodges played his 250th NRL match and also was placed on report for a <b>lifting</b> <b>tackle</b> on Aidan Guerra in the Broncos 31-12 win at Suncorp Stadium. Hodges had a nervous wait in the lead up to the Broncos Grand Final match against Queensland rivals the North Queensland Cowboys while waiting for a decision at the NRL Judiciary to see if he can complete his fairytale swansong with a possible Grand Final win. Dale Copley was named as 18th man as cover for Hodges but on 29 September 2015, Hodges was cleared to play in the Grand Final after being found not guilty of a grade one dangerous throw. On 4 October 2015, in the Broncos Queensland derby 2015 NRL Grand Final match against the North Queensland Cowboys, Hodges played his last match of his NRL career match at centre and captained the Broncos in the historic golden point 17-16 loss. Hodges and Cowboys captain Johnathan Thurston were noted as the first two Indigenous players to captain a grand final team. Hodges finished his last season in the NRL with him playing in 20 matches and scoring 3 tries for the Brisbane Broncos in the 2015 NRL season.|$|E
