40|$|Background: Distalisation of {{the upper}} molars {{can be used to}} treat a dental Class II deep bite {{malocclusion}} with a flat facial profile. It is a useful procedure when extraction treatment has been refused and providing distalisation is an appropriate solution to the patient’s problem. Aims: To describe distalisation {{of the upper}} buccal segments using a modified distal jet appliance and miniscrew. Methods: Two case reports are presented. The first case was treated with a distal screw appliance: a modified distal jet appliance with a palatal miniscrew and without the premolar arms. The Nance button was anchored to the palatal bone by a miniscrew inserted through a posterior <b>locating</b> <b>plate.</b> Locating holes in the plate ensured that the miniscrew was inserted into a site with optimal bone in the posterior part of the palate. The second case was treated with a similar distal screw appliance, but in this case the <b>locating</b> <b>plate</b> was embedded in the acrylic button. The miniscrew was inserted through a prepared hole in the button and plate. The locating hole(s) ensured that a screw could be inserted into an optimal site {{to one side of the}} median palatal suture. Conclusions: The distal screw appliance can be used to distalise upper teeth with minimal or no anchorage loss...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{license plate}} {{recognition}} (LPR) {{plays an important}} role in numerous applications and a number of techniques have been proposed. However, most of them worked under restricted conditions, such as fixed illumination, limited vehicle speed, designated routes, and stationary backgrounds. In this study, as few constraints as possible on the working environ-ment are considered. The proposed LPR technique consists of two main modules: a license <b>plate</b> <b>locating</b> module and a license number identification module. The former characterized by fuzzy disciplines attempts to extract license plates from an input image, while the latter conceptualized in terms of neural subjects aims to identify the number present in a license plate. Experiments have been conducted for the respective modules. In the experiment on <b>locating</b> license <b>plates,</b> 1088 images taken from various scenes and under different conditions were employed. Of which, 23 images have been failed to <b>locate</b> the license <b>plates</b> present in the images; the license plate location rate of success is 97. 9 %. In the experiment on identifying license number, 1065 images, from which license plates have been successfully located, were used. Of which, 47 images have been failed to identify the numbers of the license <b>plates</b> <b>located</b> in the images; the identification rate of success is 95. 6 %. Combining the above two rates, the overall rate of success for our LPR algorithm is 93. 7 %.

40|$|The area of {{automatic}} license plate recognition (ALPR) offers a big scope in numerous applications {{and a lot}} of techniques have been proposed. Most of the techniques work under restricted and supervised conditions. The proposed ALPR technique consists of two main modules: <b>plate</b> <b>locating</b> module and <b>plate</b> segmentation module. In the initial stage, search is being made for a prospective license plate on the basis of some of the local features contained in its fuzzy geometry. The second module utilizes a fuzzy C means based clustering over the finalized plate-patch to cluster the eight-connected components in it into desired and undesired regions. Segmentation proceeds only over the cluster containing the desired plate regions. In the experiment on <b>locating</b> license <b>plates,</b> 852 images were taken at various backgrounds and conditions. Of these, 10 images failed to locate the license plates; the rate of success was 98. 82 %. Experiments for character segmentation were carried out on the remaining 842 plates.
