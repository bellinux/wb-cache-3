5|$|Both fighters' {{victories}} on April 12 {{cleared the}} way for a July 26 showdown between Cotto and Margarito. The WBA welterweight title fight took place at the MGM Grand <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas,</b> marking the first time Cotto headlined a <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas</b> card. It was Cotto's first fight in <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas</b> since December 11, 2004, on the undercard of Vitali Klitschko's bout with Danny Williams. According to Bob Arum, the match took place in <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas</b> to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. The <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas</b> notion gained momentum in the previous month when the Nevada Athletic Commission amended its provisional rules on glove size, allowing welterweights to wear 8ounce (227g) gloves instead of the previously mandated 10ounce (284g) gloves. Nearly every other boxing jurisdiction in the United States allows welterweights to fight with 8ounce gloves, and both Cotto and Margarito likely would have refused to fight in <b>Las</b> <b>Vegas</b> without their usual glove size. Margarito had to vacate the IBF welterweight title after the IBF mandated him to defend the title against Joshua Clottey. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E
