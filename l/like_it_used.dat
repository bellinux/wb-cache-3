Top players were employed in the army or the police, whose sides CSA Steaua București and Dynamo practised six days a week in superb sporting centres.

500|$|Days {{before the}} release of the Big Wish Movie, Scholastic Press {{published}} a Care Bears storybook based on the film; it was written by Sonia Sander and illustrated by Jay Johnson. [...] One scene in the book involves Wish Bear and the three new Bears grocery shopping; this does not appear in the film. [...] Later in the book, when Messy Bear wishes for everything to be <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> to be, it causes the Bears to travel back to the age of the dinosaurs; in the film, Twinkers just turns Messy Bear into Messy Cub.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' loud, fast, {{straightforward}} musical {{style was}} influenced by pop music that the band members {{grew up listening to}} in the 1950s and 1960s, including classic rock groups such as the Beach Boys, the Who, the Beatles, the Kinks, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival; bubblegum acts like the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Ohio Express; and girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las. They also drew on the harder rock sound of the MC5, Black Sabbath, the Stooges and the New York Dolls, now known as seminal protopunk bands. The Ramones' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced, often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s. [...] "We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard," [...] Joey once explained. [...] "In 1974 everything was tenth-generation Elton John, or overproduced, or just junk. Everything was long jams, long guitar solos.... We missed music <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> to be."

500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E

500|$|Everyone {{is pleased}} to welcome the new {{neighbours}} at first, but things soon get out of control. [...] The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything (especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution). Then, after a confrontation with them at a picnic ("Get a Lot") Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears; they soon abuse the star's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear, a mud pie for Messy Bear, and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear. [...] Once the new bears finally realise their problem, they try to fix it with more wishes, but to no availCare-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing {{that all of this}} was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for everything to be back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for everything to be <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> to be). [...] When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard). [...] Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957 city {{government}} {{decided to put}} in order the neglected, feral island.

It is [...] long, [...] wide at the crown and prevented the Sava to flood the island every spring, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> to do. Already at the time, Ada was the largest and the most visited swimming and excursion site. , engineer {{and a member of the}} Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts suggested the dual solution for Ada, as both the source of the drinking water and a sports and recreation center. His plan was conducted by 1967 when Ada was connected to the mainland on both the north and south tips, and the lakes of Sava Lake and Taložnik were created. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the first sporting championships were organized, such as the kayaking championships in 1971, prompting the construction of special facilities. The popularity of Ada was further increased in the 1980s with the music and entertainment show Leto na Adi ("Summer on Ada"), televised live by the Radio Television of Serbia. Makiš side was officially declared a swimming area in the season of 2010.|$|E

On the porch, wrapped in comforters and coats against the seaside chill, Father and Mother cuddled together. They said little--everything was said for them by the moonlight, silvery on the marshes, wistful silver among the dunes, while the surf was lulled and the whole spacious night seemed reverent with love.

Wonder how long we can keep it up, Hank? We're safe as long as the good little boys like George Babbitt and all the nice respectable labor-leaders think you and me are rugged patriots. There's swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city working to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and rallying to our banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation, whenever some squealer like this fellow Seneca Doane comes along! Honest, Hank, a smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if he didn't milk cattle like them, when they come around mooing for it!
