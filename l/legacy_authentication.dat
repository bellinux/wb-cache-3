Some important aspects, such as resource-constraint Mobile Stations (MSs) and the ping-pong movement phenomenon when handover roaming across different hotspots occurs, are considered. An analytic model is developed {{to investigate the}} efficiency of the proposed scheme. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the resultant signalling overhead, power consumption, and authentication latency, compared with the <b>legacy</b> <b>authentication</b> schemes without losing the capability of preserving the system security...|$|E

40|$|Most SSL/TLS-based {{e-commerce}} applications employ conventional {{mechanisms for}} user authentication. These mechanisms—if decoupled from SSL/TLS session establishment—are vulnerable to manin-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In this paper, we {{elaborate on the}} feasibility of MITM attacks, survey countermeasures, introduce the notion of SSL/TLS session-aware user authentication (TLS-SA), and present a proof of concept implementation of TLS-SA. We think that TLS-SA fills {{a gap between the}} use of public key certificates on the client side and currently deployed user authentication mechanisms. Most importantly, it allows for the continued use of <b>legacy</b> two-factor <b>authentication</b> devices while still providing high levels of protection against MITM attacks...|$|R
40|$|IKE was {{designed}} for use with certificates. In a remote access scenario, that implies that clients must possess their own certificates. We leverage off of work already done to fast-start certificate use with IPsec via the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol [SCEP]. We use only parts of SCEP over a client authenticated TLS/HTTP connection to a CA. By using TLS, the client can trust a CA root certificate it receives, without an out-of-band verification and the CA can perform automatic enrollment. We replace the out-of-band client identification process for a certificate enrollment with a <b>legacy</b> <b>authentication,</b> like RADIUS. Further, since the certificates issued here are short-lived, {{there is no need}} to support client-based revocation or rekeying. Also, there is typically no need for CRL support...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) within {{the third generation}} (3 G) networks materializes {{the next generation of}} mobile/wireless systems, named 3 G-WLANs integrated networks. This paper proposes an improved authentication procedure for the 3 G-WLANs integrated networks that enables a WLAN user to get access to the 3 G packet switched services or to the public Internet through the 3 G public land mobile network. The proposed procedure reduces significantly the authentication overhead compared to the legacy one, without compromising the provided security services. A security analysis of the proposed authentication procedure is elaborated that ensures the correctness of the authentication procedure, the provision of advanced security services and the elimination of possible attacks that may threaten the proposed authentication procedure. In addition, an energy cost analysis is carried out that compares the energy consumption induced by the legacy and the proposed authentication procedures. Finally, a communication cost analysis is provided that estimates the cost improvement of the proposed over the <b>legacy</b> <b>authentication</b> procedure.

Authorization credentials are portable, and {{may be used in}} locationindependent fashion, without the need for cumbersome export and import procedures. 1. Overview The use of public-key technology for authentication and authorization in enterprise environments has been slow in deployment due to a number of factors. The use of “soft ” publickey credentials in desktop applications such as Web browsers is convenient, but the portability of such credentials is limited. Truly portable public-key devices, such as smartcards, require infrastructure, in the form of smart card readers, which is not yet widely available. Access control in applications faces something of a “chicken and egg ” problem. Users do not {{want to go to the}} trouble of obtaining key pairs and certificates until their applications require it. Major application developers, on the other hand will not use public-key technology in their products until a critical mass of users has keys and certificates. This makes the conversion to public-key an allor-nothing proposition, where all users and applications must be upgraded at once...|$|E

Naturally, the PIC protocol does not even offer this option, because the goal of PIC is to obtain credentials {{that can be used for}} client authentication. In addition to running the authentication protocols within such tunnel, it should also be possible to use them in legacy mode without any tunneling so as to leverage the legacy advantages such as widespread use. In this paper we show that in practical situations, such a mixed mode usage opens up the possibility to run a man-in-the-middle attack for impersonating the legitimate client. For those well-designed client authentication protocols that already have a sufficient level of security, the use of tunneling in the proposed form is a step backwards because they introduce a new vulnerability. The problem is due to the fact that the <b>legacy</b> client <b>authentication</b> protocol is not aware if it is run in protected or unprotected mode. We propose to solve the discovered problem by using a cryptographic binding between the client authentication protocol and the protection protocol. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{security}} protocol that provides mutual authentication between a user and a WLAN {{that the first}} tries to connect to, and deploys a mobile Virtual Private Network (VPN) that protects the user’s data conveyed over the wireless network. For the user authentication {{as well as for}} the initialization of the VPN and the related key agreement, the EAP-SIM encapsulated within the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv 2) is proposed. The deployed VPN, which is based on IPsec, ensures confidentiality, source authentication and integrity of the data exchanged over the WLAN. At the same time, the user has been subscribed to the 3 G-network for charging and billing purposes using the <b>legacy</b> EAP-SIM <b>authentication</b> protocol. The established VPN can seamlessly operate and continuously provide security services as the mobile user moves and roams, materializing the notion of mobile VPN. The proposed security protocol eliminates the required enhancements to the current network infrastructure and operates transparently to the existing network functionality I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn ubiquitous/pervasive {{computing}} environments, it is envisaged that computing elements—entities—will start interacting {{in an ad}} hoc fashion. The peer-to-peer (p 2 p) {{paradigm is}} appealing for such types of interaction especially with JXTA, which supports the development of reusable p 2 p building blocks, which facilitate implementation on any smart device. However, the inability {{to rely on a}} centralised authentication infrastructure, the openness of the environment and the absence of an administrator (it is assumed to be too expensive to have a skilled administrator at hand due to the large number of peers) challenge the use of <b>legacy</b> <b>authentication</b> mechanisms. Supporting spontaneous interactions among previously unknown entities requires dynamic enrolment of strangers and unknown entities. Entity recognition (ER) is a process that is carried out each time an interaction happens between entities in order to dynamically recognise previously met entities. In this paper, we present the Claim Tool Kit (CTK), a Java-based implementation of ER: entities exchange messages, called Claims, and rely on their associated clues to evaluate the level of confidence in recognition. The CTK employs advanced features available with Java, such as JXTA and Java Cryptography and Security Architectures. We show that the CTK needs performance results on these features in order to increase the level of auto-configuration of the CTK. We describe how to obtain performance assessment for some of these new features. Finally, we explain how the CTK can be instrumented to take into account performance assessment. By analysing the evaluation results, the applicability of these advanced Java-based technologies for peer entity recognition is assessed...|$|E

40|$|A user in Beyond 3 rd Generation (B 3 G) {{networks}} {{in order to}} get access to the network services must perform a multi-pass authentication procedure, which includes two or three sequential authentications steps. These multiple authentication steps include a redundant repetition of the same or similar authentication functions, which impose an unnecessary authentication overhead. This paper proposes a security binding mechanism, which reduces the execution of the redundant authentication functions of multi-pass authentications in a simple yet effective and secure manner. To achieve this, the proposed mechanism authenticates a user {{in the second and third}} step of a multi-pass authentication, by using the user’s authentication credentials of the initial step. The focal point of the security binding mechanism is its generic application in multi-pass authentications, regardless of the underlying network architecture or protocols. To prove this, we have selected to present and analyze the application of the proposed mechanism in two different B 3 G scenarios (i. e., 3 G-WLAN and WiMAX), resulting in the improved authentication procedures. A security analysis of the improved procedures has been carried out to identify possible attacks and propose security measures to eliminate them. Moreover, a simulation model has been developed to estimate and compare the performance of the improved 3 G-WLAN authentication procedure to that of the <b>legacy</b> 3 G-WLAN <b>authentication.</b> Simulation results show that the improved procedure presents better performance than its legacy counterpart...|$|R
