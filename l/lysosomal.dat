5|$|The genome of the {{nematode}} worm C. elegans contains 9 serpins, all {{of which}} lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated <b>lysosomal</b> disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits <b>lysosomal</b> cysteine proteases released after <b>lysosomal</b> rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate.|$|E
5|$|Other cell-death {{mechanisms}} include proteasomal and <b>lysosomal</b> system dysfunction {{and reduced}} mitochondrial activity. Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed {{in conjunction with}} the protein inclusions. It may be related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in <b>lysosomal</b> membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (<b>lysosomal</b> trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Metachromatic leukodystrophy, {{also known}} as MLD, is a {{recessive}} <b>lysosomal</b> storage disorder. It {{is believed to be}} caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A is a <b>lysosomal</b> sulfatase that is able to hydrolyze the 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide. Both 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide can be located mainly in the central nervous system {{as well as in the}} peripheral nervous system. When lacking the <b>lysosomal</b> enzyme or mutations in the gene coding for saposin B occur, this can lead to the accumulation of <b>lysosomal</b> sulfatide, which then develops into metachromatic leukodystrophy.|$|E

25|$|Niemann–Pick type C is a <b>lysosomal</b> {{storage disease}} {{associated}} with mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 genes. Niemann–Pick type C affects an estimated 1:150,000 people. Approximately 50% of cases present before 10 years of age, but manifestations may first {{be recognized as}} late as the sixth decade.|$|E
25|$|Another {{proposed}} {{life extension}} technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation {{may be obtained}} by removing aging damage via the use of stem cells and tissue engineering, telomere-lengthening machinery, allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins, targeted ablation of cells, immunotherapeutic clearance, and novel <b>lysosomal</b> hydrolases.|$|E
25|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses are a {{group of}} {{metabolic}} disorders caused by the absence or malfunctioning of <b>lysosomal</b> enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans. These long chains of sugar carbohydrates occur within the cells that help build bone, cartilage, tendons, corneas, skin and connective tissue. Glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides) are {{also found in the}} fluids that lubricate joints.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally the {{inherited}} metabolic diseases {{were classified}} as disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, organic acid metabolism, or <b>lysosomal</b> storage diseases. In recent decades, hundreds of new inherited disorders of metabolism have been discovered and the categories have proliferated. Following {{are some of the}} major classes of congenital metabolic diseases, with prominent examples of each class. Many others do not fall into these categories.|$|E
25|$|The hydrolyzed {{chylomicron}}s are {{now called}} chylomicron remnants. The chylomicron remnants continue circulating the bloodstream until they interact via apolipoprotein E with chylomicron remnant receptors, found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the endocytosis of the chylomicron remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within lysosomes. <b>Lysosomal</b> hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, {{which can be}} used for energy or stored for later use.|$|E
25|$|Sandhoff {{disease is}} a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord. The disease results from mutations on chromosome 5 in the HEXB gene, critical for the <b>lysosomal</b> enzymes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and B. Sandhoff Disease is clinically indistinguishable from Tay-Sachs Disease. The most common form, infantile Sandhoff disease, is usually fatal by early childhood.|$|E
25|$|Part of the endomembrane {{system in}} the cytoplasm, the Golgi {{apparatus}} packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination. The Golgi apparatus resides {{at the intersection of}} the secretory, <b>lysosomal,</b> and endocytic pathways. It is of particular importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy techniques {{have been investigated}} for <b>lysosomal</b> storage disorders, and could potentially be used to treat Tay–Sachs as well. The goal would be to replace the nonfunctional enzyme, a process similar to insulin injections for diabetes. However, in previous studies, the HEXA enzyme itself has been thought to be too large {{to pass through the}} specialized cell layer in the blood vessels that forms the blood–brain barrier in humans.|$|E
25|$|Autophagy {{is when a}} cell digests some of its own organelles by <b>lysosomal</b> degradation. Autophagy is {{employed}} to remove damaged organelles, or under starvation conditions to provide additional nutrients. Normally, autophagy occurs by the TSC-Mtor pathway, but can be induced by ROS. TIGAR, even at very low levels, inhibits autophagy by decreasing ROS levels. The mechanism by which TIGAR does this is independent from the Mtor pathway, but the exact details are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>lysosomal</b> {{storage disease}} often {{confused}} with the mucopolysaccharidoses is mucolipidosis. In this disorder, excessive amounts of fatty materials known as lipids (another principal component of living cells) are stored, in addition to sugars. Persons with mucolipidosis may {{share some of the}} clinical features associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses (certain facial features, bony structure abnormalities, and damage to the brain), and increased amounts of the enzymes needed to break down the lipids are found in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Shen, et al. created fusion {{proteins}} between OA1 and GFP. Melanosomal localization of OA1 {{has been}} confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy and other techniques alike. Localization patterns of wild type OA1-GFP and mutated OA1-GFP were compared. The wild type OA1 localized to late endosomal or <b>lysosomal</b> compartments. This is supported by data from Samaraweera, et al. that OA1 colocalizes with Lamp1, which is a marker for late endosomal compartment. Hence, OA1 might traffick itself out of this compartment to the melanosomes.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group. However, in order for this reaction to be carried out, a sphingolipid activator protein such as saposin B must be present. Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A can then hydrolyze the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a <b>lysosomal</b> storage disease and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.|$|E
25|$|Other {{experimental}} methods being researched involve substrate reduction therapy, which attempts to use alternative enzymes {{to increase the}} brain's catabolism of GM2 gangliosides {{to a point where}} residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation. One experiment has demonstrated that using the enzyme sialidase allows the genetic defect to be effectively bypassed, and as a consequence, GM2 gangliosides are metabolized so that their levels become almost inconsequential. If a safe pharmacological treatment can be developed– one that increases expression of <b>lysosomal</b> sialidase in neurons without other toxicity– then this new form of therapy could essentially cure the disease.|$|E
25|$|LDL {{particles}} {{are the major}} blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, recognized by LDL receptors in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors concentrate in clathrin-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via endocytosis. These vesicles then fuse with a lysosome, where the <b>lysosomal</b> acid lipase enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to {{not interfere with the}} cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|Cells can undergo necroptosis in {{response}} to perturbed homeostasis in specific circumstances. In response to DNA damage, the RIPK1 and RIPK3 are phosphorylated and lead to deterioration of the cell {{in the absence of}} caspase activation. The necrosome inhibits the adenine nucleotide translocase in mitochondria to decrease cellular ATP levels. Uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain leads to additional mitochondrial damage and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which releases mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol. The necrosome also causes leakage of <b>lysosomal</b> digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm by induction of reactive oxygen species by JNK, sphingosine production, and calpain activation by calcium release.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis {{can also}} occur in {{neonates}} and {{is attributable to}} a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or perinatal infection with the hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal hepatitis. Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis. Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and <b>lysosomal</b> storage disorders are also implicated. Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Niemann–Pick type C is biochemically, genetically and {{clinically}} {{distinct from}} Niemann–Pick Types A or and B. In Types A and B, there is complete or partial deficiency of the <b>lysosomal</b> enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase. In Niemann–Pick type C, the protein {{product of the}} major mutated gene NPC1 is not an enzyme but appears {{to function as a}} transporter in the endosomal-lysosomal system, which moves large water-insoluble molecules through the cell. The protein coded by the NPC2 gene more closely resembles an enzyme structurally but seems to act in cooperation with the NPC1 protein in transporting molecules in the cell. The disruption of this transport system results in the accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes.|$|E
25|$|Receptor {{desensitization}} {{is mediated}} {{through a combination}} phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because <b>lysosomal</b> membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the exact}} role of OA1 {{is yet to}} be confirmed, many studies give clues about the {{probable}} roles of OA1. The Oa1 gene product might be involved in vesicular trafficking or sorting them to the melanosomes. It is also believed to be involved in redistribution of mannose-6-phosphate receptors, thus suggesting that it is important for melanogensis. Literature shows that it {{plays a major role in}} the final stages of growth and maturation of melanosomes. This conclusion is based on the fact that there are no intermediates of melanosome-melanosome fusion and the number of melanosomes decreases only on maturation of the cell and not in the initial stages of development. A number of genes in Drosophila, like the hook gene that alter ocular pigment granules have been shown to affect <b>lysosomal</b> delivery. Moreover, it has been found that in normal conditions, melanosomal proteins traffic normally to late endosomes, while in the absence of OA1, they continue to accumulate in the mature melanosomes. This may mean that OA1 acts as a stop signal for melanosomal growth.|$|E
25|$|Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and {{are found}} in {{phagocytic}} vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire <b>lysosomal</b> features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on <b>lysosomal</b> proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E

500|$|TGF-beta is a {{regulator}} {{of tissue}} remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development, and promotes metastasis in cancer. [...] A {{number of studies}} have identified NEDD9 as a downstream effector in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, essential for promoting EMT. In MCF-7 cells, NEDD9 negatively regulates expression of the epithelial protein E-cadherin, preventing association of E-cadherin with cell membrane and activating SRC-kinase. Activated SRC provides internalization and <b>lysosomal</b> degradation of E-cadherin. Consistent with these findings is a study demonstrating downregulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, occludin, β-catenin) and concurrent upregulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin) in response to NEDD9 overexpression in MCF-10 cells.|$|E
