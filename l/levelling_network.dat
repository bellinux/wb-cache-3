To further enhance the com-munication efficiency, an overheard-based relay-assisted MAC protocols for vehicular networks is proposed in this paper. Since the symbol <b>level</b> <b>network</b> coding (SLNC) scheme has lower error probability than the packet <b>level</b> <b>network</b> coding (PLNC) scheme, SLNC is adopted in the proposed protocol so as to improve the transmission efficiency. An overheard relay vehicle is chosen to help the avoidance of different data multiplying with the same coefficient. When the original data cannot be decoded due to the lost of some symbols, the symbol acquisition process is initiated. Simulation results {{have shown that the}} proposed protocol performs better than the traditional network coding protocol.

40|$|Abstract. Extreme {{learning}} machine (ELM), a relatively novel {{machine learning algorithm}} for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs), has been shown competitive performance in simple structure and superior training speed. To improve the effectiveness of ELM for dealing with noisy datasets, a deep structure of ELM, short for DS-ELM, is proposed in this paper. DS-ELM contains three <b>level</b> <b>networks</b> (actually contains three nets) : the first <b>level</b> <b>network</b> is trained by auto-associative neural network (AANN) aim to filter out noise as well as reduce dimension when necessary; the second <b>level</b> <b>network</b> is another AANN net aim to fix the input weights and bias of ELM; and the last <b>level</b> <b>network</b> is ELM.

A regional <b>levelling</b> <b>network</b> naturally consists of several hundreds of BM points hence its adjustment is becoming a cumbersome tasks. In practice such adjustment is performed using commercial software. This paper is aim to discuss the least squares adjustment of a height network of regional coverage by using an in-house developed computer routine instead of commercial software. This paper exemplified the work done to adjust the <b>levelling</b> <b>network</b> covering the region of Sabah and Sarawak which involved quite a large number of unknown parameters with a total of about 300 BMâ€™s in Sabah and more than 500 BMâ€™s in Sarawak. The adjustment task has become interesting to report because it was done using as self developed in-house software. One good thing about the software is that user will find it easy to use, requires a very simple file of input data and yet manage to solve a large number of unknowns.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of Second Precise <b>Levelling</b> <b>Network</b> (PLN) for the Peninsular Malaysia which {{was completed in}} 2000 by Department of Surveying and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) is set to replace the First Order <b>Levelling</b> <b>Network</b> of 1967. The new network consists of 113 levelling lines with more than 5000 bench marks and covers a total distance of over 5000 km. Precise levelling technique is used to establish the network where the allowable misclosure between fore and back levelling is less than 3 mm per root kilometre of length along a line. Its configuration is predominantly dictated by the land transportation pattern. The mean sea level (MSL) at Port Kelang, based upon a 10 -year tidal observation (1984 - 93), was later being adopted as the new Peninsular Malaysia Geodetic Vertical Datum (PMGVD). A consistent and accurate set of adjusted heights of benchmarks has been achieved in the adjustment of the Precise <b>Levelling</b> <b>Network</b> of Peninsular Malaysia on the datum defined by MSL height at Port Klang. These adjusted heights {{are based on the}} Helmert orthometric height system. By fixing Port Kelang, the precision of the PLN can be expressed as 1. 14 mmvkm. This implies that for any of the 5, 295 first-order levelling bench mark across the nation, a height precision of better than 3 cm can be expected...|$|E

New levelling loops are formed based on data of old measurements and a geological map, so that these take place mostly after solid ground of Ljubljana marsh. Method of determination of vertical displacements is described and accuracy of determination of vertical displacements between two term measurements is given. Unstable vertical points are determined with software Premik. Determination proceedings of vertical displacements of benchmarks for term measurments before year 1992. are also presented. Results are determined unstable vertical points between individual term measurments (comparison of measurments in year 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2000). These results introduce base for further geological interpretation of geodinamical activity. Finally, based on the results, unstable benchmarks are showed on geological map. ...|$|E

To {{make sense of}} it, the brain {{must be able to}} process a {{constant}} stream of noisy input data in real time and in an (apparently) optimal manner {{in order to be able}} to direct behavior. Formally, to achieve optimality, the brain ought to be performing some sort of Bayesian filtering; yet how such computations can be performed in neural networks is still an open question [1, 2]. In a previous abstract to this conference [3] we extended the work of Deneve et al. [4] to allow optimal decoding of a single moving stimulus with divisive normalization neural networks; and in this work we extend it still further to handle the case of more complex moving stimuli. For concreteness, we use the example of gait recognition and tracking, in particular the case where we wish to track several different joint angles simultaneously. The approach we take is to build a causal model for the generation of joint angle data, where each joint angle configuration is a function of both the type of gait and the current phase through the gait cycle. Such a hierarchical scheme maps readily onto a neural network. In particular we encode each joint angle as a bump of activity in a low <b>level</b> <b>network</b> (one per joint angle), and the phase angle in a high <b>level</b> <b>network,</b> with one high <b>level</b> <b>network</b> for each gait.
