The <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>association</b> first {{offered to buy}} the house, then began marching out front with burning flares, sending threatening letters and making threatening phone calls. Two crosses were burned on their lawn, {{said to be the}} Ku Klux Klan's final warning. The Francises remained in the house until they moved to Liberia.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876, Mayer {{purchased}} {{a home in}} historic Annapolis and took an active interest in the city’s improvement. In 1884, Mayer helped found the <b>Local</b> <b>Improvement</b> <b>Association</b> of Annapolis. Mayer was active in landscaping public {{areas of the city}} such as the circle around Market Space. He was later a member of the building committee of a new public school and was interested in architecture as well as the history of Annapolis. He conducted research on the [...] "customs and characters" [...] of Annapolis that later formed the basis for a chapter in Elihu S. Riley's The Ancient City: A History of Annapolis, in Maryland 1649-1887 (Annapolis: Record Printing Office, 1887).|$|E
50|$|The Francis' would {{themselves}} {{become the}} targets of escalating racist abuse and Ku Klux Klan attacks {{a few years later}} when they bought a home in a white neighborhood in St. Paul. The couple bought a two-storey house (with a title held in Juno Frankie Pierce's name) in Sargent Avenue, Groveland Park, experiencing an increasingly vicious Ku Klux Klan campaign to stop them moving in. First, the <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>association</b> offered to buy the house. When they refused, a campaign including marches with burning flares and threatening letters and phone calls followed. The Ku Klux Klan burned a cross on the lawn twice, said to typically be the final warning. The Francises moved in, and remained there until they moved to Liberia.|$|E

50|$|After the {{development}} of the test, it was much easier for a dairy operation to not only compensate farmers fairly, but to produce a consistent product that consumers could depend on. The Babcock test was also utilized by farmers to selectively breed for cows who produced milk with higher butterfat content - the tests were usually done monthly by an employee of the <b>local</b> Dairy Herd <b>Improvement</b> <b>Association</b> (DHIA).|$|R
5000|$|The Globe and Mail {{described}} John Street's current {{character as}} [...] "a largely utilitarian stretch of broken pavement, parking lots, chain restaurants and media company headquarters." [...] Plans are underway to turn John into {{the hub of}} Toronto's Entertainment District by widening the sidewalks and creating a tree lined boulevard that {{would serve as a}} central access to the neighbourhood. In places where John is four lanes, it will be reduced to two to make more room for sidewalks and trees. The plan was developed by the <b>local</b> Business <b>Improvement</b> <b>Association</b> and the City of Toronto and is the current top planning priority for the Entertainment District.|$|R
5000|$|Philip C. Jimeno (born February 28, 1947, in Fairmont, West Virginia) is an American {{politician}} {{and was a}} long-serving member of the Maryland State Legislature as a Democrat. He attended Fairmont State College in his hometown. He was married in 1969, {{and he and his}} wife Ramona moved to Brooklyn Park, Maryland in 1970. He worked as a probation and parole officer in Baltimore and was involved in the <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>association,</b> the Roland Terrace Democratic Club and became president of the Greater Brooklyn Park Council. In 1978, he decided to run for a seat in the Maryland House. He won that election, and went on to representDistrict 31 in the Maryland State Legislature from 1985 until his retirement in 2007. In more than two decades of service, Mr. Jimeno missed just one day of the General Assembly session when a snowstorm left him unable to get out of his driveway.|$|E
5000|$|Located in Norwood Park Township, {{the first}} names {{of what would}} become Norridge were [...] "Goat Village", due to a local resident's goat farm, and [...] "Swamp" [...] {{due to a lack}} of streets and the area's swamp-like conditions. Norridge started out as an 80 acre {{subdivision}} that ran from Ozanam Avenue in the west to Olcott Avenue in the east and from Irving Park Road in the south to Montrose Avenue in the north. In 1948, Norridge was about to be annexed by Chicago when a <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>association</b> moved to incorporate as a village, ending the city's effort to incorporate it. That year, Karl Kuchar was elected the first President of the village. The 1950s was a decade of growth and development, encouraged by the construction of a waterworks system, the paving of sidewalks, streets, and curbs, and the installation of storm and sanitary sewers. In 1954 Norridge annexed land north from Montrose to Lawrence. Also that year, the Norridge Youth Committee was established.|$|E
500|$|Claflin was a {{major force}} in the {{development}} of the village of Newtonville in Newton, Massachusetts. [...] In 1854 he purchased a farm that had once been owned by two governors: Simon Bradstreet (a 17th-century governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony), and William Hull, governor of the Michigan Territory. [...] Claflin moved Hull's mansion to one side of the property and built a new one on the old foundation. [...] He subdivided portions of the estate for development, and was responsible for the construction of the Claflin Block in Newtonville. [...] After his death the <b>local</b> civic <b>improvement</b> <b>association</b> purchased the rest of Claflin's estate and gave it to the town. [...] The site is now the location of the Newton North High School athletic fields. Newtonville's Claflin School is named in his honor.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the {{neighbourhood}} {{has faced}} adversarial conflict as its <b>local</b> business <b>improvement</b> <b>association</b> has battled a city plan to widen Notre-Dame Avenue, {{a major city}} arterial which passes through the neighbourhood, to six lanes to accommodate expanded traffic. In 2013 three pedestrians were struck with vehicles while crossing Notre Dame Ave in the area between King and Wilma streets, resulting {{in the death of}} one of the pedestrians. Cyclists in the area typically choose to ride on the sidewalk rather than risk riding on the road which has a speed limit of 60 km/h. The business association also launched a neighbourhood beautification plan, including adding an [...] "avenue of trees" [...] to Notre-Dame, new benches and community banners, and the construction of a waterpark facility in the neighbourhood's O'Connor Park.|$|R

We relate this analysis to the governance arrangements for this case study. Our main conclusion is that the creative city concept translates strongly in the place-making aspect of the project, and serves the objective of a specific set of stakeholders to enhance the identity of the area and foster the attraction of new residents and businesses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the second order systems U 1 2 and V 1 2 of bounded arithmetic, which have proof theoretic strengths corresponding to polynomial space and exponential time computation. We formulate improved witnessing theorems {{for these two}} theories by using S 1 2 as a base theory for proving the correctness of the polynomial space or exponential time witnessing functions. We develop the theory of nondeterministic polynomialspace computation, includingSavitch’s theorem,inU 1 2. Kolodziejczyk, Nguyen, and Thapen have introduced <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> properties to characterize the provably total NP functions of these second order theories. We show that the strengths of their <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> principles over U 1 2 and V 1 2 depend primarily on the topology of the underlying graph, not the number of rounds in the <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> games. The theory U 1 2 proves the <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> principle for linear graphs even without restricting to logarithmically many rounds. The <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> principle for grid graphs with only logarithmically many rounds is complete for the provably total NP search problems of V 1 2. Related results are obtained for <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> principles with one improvement round, and for <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> over rectangular grids...|$|R
