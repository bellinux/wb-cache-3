The {{music for the}} game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai, who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air Ride. Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most, given {{that he could not}} use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka, the composers for the first two games, as they were both busy with other projects. Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game, over 250, he needed someone who had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dedicate to the project and who could focus exclusively on it.|$|E

25|$|Operation Sayasila {{ended on}} 31 October 1971. The Royal Lao Armed Forces {{suffered}} 136 of its troops {{killed during the}} offensive, and 302 wounded. PAVN losses were estimated at 170. However, the Royalists had won the airstrips at Salavan and Paksong. This {{cleared the way for}} two follow-up offensive moves, Operation Bedrock and Operation Thao La. However, with a Royalist casualty list that outnumbered the PAVN opposition, it was a dubious victory. Eight Royalist battalions had been rendered unfit for service. The CIA's Chief of Station in MR 4 believed that the failure of Sayasila resulted from several Royalist weaknesses. He blamed the Royalist regulars for poor battle performance. He believed the new commanding general did not yet have a strong command relationship with his subordinates. He also noted that the extensive slow-paced movements by the Royalists gave the PAVN a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> scout out intelligence about the Royalists.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{occurs to}} the muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon {{cessation}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs. This {{can lead to}} benzodiazepines being taken for longer than originally intended, as people continue to take the drugs {{over a long period}} of time to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV for substance abuse and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia escalate their dosage, sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed dose levels. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients escalated their dosage. Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that the drugs are acting to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing effects of benzodiazepines occurs within a few weeks in most patients.|$|E

[...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo.

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet.

As Mars had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> create the album, something that didn't happen during his debut, he reportedly had the possibility to develop a musically outstanding product that displayed his music taste and completely revealed his artistry. Because {{he had been a}} composer of pop and radio-friendly songs for a long time, it ultimately influenced the style of his debut; however, he didn't have the chance to craft the [...] "sounds and sonics" [...] he wanted to.
