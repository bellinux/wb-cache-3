In it, the witches are <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting.
