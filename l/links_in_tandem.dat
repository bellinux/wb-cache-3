Of particular importance, we show that specific interactions between natural folded neighbors at either terminus confer even greater stability by additionally increasing the folding rate constants. We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between natural stabilizing interactions and nonspecific stabilizing effects through examination of the kinetics of well chosen mutant proteins.

To further characterize the YbbR domains, structures of two of the four domains (I and IV) from the YbbR-like protein of Desulfitobacterium hafniense Y 51 were solved by solution nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. The structures show the domains to have nearly identical topologies despite a low amino acid identity (23 %). The topology is dominated by β-strands, roughly following a “figure 8 ” pattern with some strands coiling around the domain perimeter and others crossing the center. A similar topology is found in the C-terminal domain of two stress-responsive bacterial ribosomal proteins, TL 5 and L 25. Based on these models, a structurally guided amino acid alignment identifies features of the YbbR domains that are not evident from naïve amino acid sequence alignments. A structurally conserved cis-proline (cis-Pro) residue was identified in both domains, though the local structure in the immediate vicinities surrounding this residue differed between the two models. The conservation and location of this cis-Pro, plus anchoring Val residues, suggest this motif may be significant to protein function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background New genes {{generated}} by retroposition are widespread in humans and other mammalian species. Usually, this process copies a single parental gene and inserts {{it into a}} distant genomic location. However, retroposition of two adjacent parental genes, i. e. co-retroposition, had not been reported until the hominoid chimeric gene, PIPSL, was identified recently. It was shown how two genes <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> (phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate 5 -kinase, type I, alpha, PIP 5 K 1 A and proteasome 26 S subunit, non-ATPase, 4, PSMD 4) could be co-retroposed from a single RNA molecule to form this novel chimeric gene. However, understanding of the origination and biological function of PIPSL requires determination of the coding potential of this gene {{as well as the}} evolutionary forces acting on its hominoid copies. Results We tackled these problems by analyzing the evolutionary signature in both within-species variation and between species divergence in the sequence and structure of the gene. We revealed a significant evolutionary signature: the coding region has significantly lower sequence variation, especially insertions and deletions, suggesting that the human copy may encode a protein. Moreover, a survey across five different hominoid species revealed that all adaptive changes of PSMD 4 -derived regions occurred on branches leading to human and chimp rather than other hominoid lineages. Finally, computational analysis suggests testis-specific transcription of PIPSL is regulated by tissue-dependent methylation rather than some transcriptional leakage. Conclusion Therefore, this set of analyses showed that PIPSL is an extraordinary co-retroposed protein-coding gene that may participate in the male functions of humans and its close relatives. </p...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic notothenioid fishes {{and several}} {{northern}} cods are phylogenetically distant (in different orders and superorders), yet produce near-identical antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) {{to survive in}} their respective freezing environments. AFGPs in both fishes are made as a family of discretely sized polymers composed of a simple glycotripeptide monomeric repeat. Characterizations of the AFGP genes from notothenioids and the Arctic cod show that their AFGPs are both encoded by a family of polyprotein genes, with each gene encoding multiple AFGP molecules <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> by small cleavable spacers. Despite these apparent similarities, detailed analyses of the AFGP gene sequences and substructures provide strong evidence that AFGPs in these two polar fishes in fact evolved independently. First, although Antarctic notothenioid AFGP genes {{have been shown to}} originate from a pancreatic trypsinogen, Arctic cod AFGP genes share no sequence identity with the trypsinogen gene, indicating trypsinogen is not the progenitor. Second, the AFGP genes of the two fish have different intron–exon organizations and different spacer sequences and, thus, different processing of the polyprotein precursors, consistent with separate genomic origins. Third, the repetitive AFGP tripeptide (Thr-Ala/Pro-Ala) coding sequences are drastically different in the two groups of genes, suggesting that they arose from duplications of two distinct, short ancestral sequences with a different permutation of three codons for the same tripeptide. The molecular evidence for separate ancestry is supported by morphological, paleontological, and paleoclimatic evidence, which collectively indicate that these two polar fishes evolved their respective AFGPs separately and thus arrived at the same AFGPs through convergent evolution...|$|R

Furthermore, interferon (IFN) -γ-secreting CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were induced which suppressed B 16. OVA tumor growth in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Tumor protection was mediated by a CD 8 + T-cell-dependent mechanism and did not require CD 4 + help to protect mice 7 days after a boost immunization. Alternatively, 40 days after a boost immunization, the presence of CD 4 + help enhanced antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting CD 8 + T cells and tumor protection in mice challenged with B 16. OVA.

The repertoire ranges from one subfamily of visual opsins (scotopic vision) including rod opsin only retinas seen in many deep-sea species to multiple subfamilies of visual opsins in some pelagic species. We have investigated the opsin repertoire of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using information in the recently sequenced cod genome and found that despite cod not being a deep sea species it lacks visual subfamilies sensitive towards the most extreme parts of the light spectra representing UV and red light. Furthermore, we find that Atlantic cod has duplicated paralogs of both blue-sensitive SWS 2 and green-sensitive RH 2 subfamilies, with members belonging to each subfamily <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> within the genome (two SWS 2 -, and three RH 2 A genes, respectively). The presence of multiple cone opsin genes indicates {{that there have been}} duplication events in the cod ancestor SWS 2 and RH 2 opsins producing paralogs that have been retained in Atlantic. Our results are supported by expressional analysis of cone opsins, which further revealed an ontogenetic change in the array of cone opsins expressed. These findings suggest life stage specific programs for opsin regulation which could be linked to habitat changes and available light as the larvae is transformed into an early juvenile. Altogether we provide the first molecular evidence for color vision driven by only two families of cone opsins due to gene loss in a teleost...|$|R
5000|$|The crystal {{structures}} of zinc finger-DNA complexes solved in 1991 and 1993 revealed the canonical pattern of interactions of zinc fingers with DNA. The binding of zinc finger {{is found to}} be distinct from many other DNA-binding proteins that bind DNA through the 2-fold symmetry of the double helix, instead zinc fingers are <b>linked</b> linearly <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> to bind nucleic acid sequences of varying lengths. [...] The modular nature of the zinc finger motif allows for a large number of combinations of DNA and RNA sequences to be bound with high degree of affinity and specificity, and is therefore ideally suited for engineering protein that can be targeted to and bind specific DNA sequences. In 1994, it was shown that an artificially-constructed three-finger protein can block the expression of an oncogene in a mouse cell line. Zinc fingers fused to various other effector domains, some with therapeutic significance, have since been constructed.|$|R
