50|$|The {{engineers}} {{noticed the}} spinning of their compass needles {{due to the}} large quantities of magnetic ore under their feet. In 1889, the Magnetic Iron Company began developing the Star <b>Lake</b> <b>ore</b> body, which sat under some three-thousand acres of land. Production of ore halted in 1893 with a depression in the iron ore industry, but resumed in 1900. In 1910, the Benson Mines Company bought the site from the Magnetic Iron Company and continued operations on and off until 1918. At the onset of World War II, Benson Mines reopened when Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation leased the site. The U.S Department of Defense built ore processing facilities and the iron-ore was shipped to Pittsburgh {{for use in the}} war effort. The mining operation expanded significantly in the 1950s, and was renamed the New York Ore Division, although control remained {{in the hands of the}} Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation. At its height, the company employed 840 workers in 1960.|$|E

40|$|According to Solitander C. P., the {{extraction}} of <b>lake</b> <b>ore</b> from Eastern Finland lakes considerably rose in the 1870 - 1880 period in relation with the increasing demand from the ironworks being operated in the region. In St. Petersburg, Nicholas Putiloff, a business tycoon and State Minister owned the Haapakosken, Huutokosken and Oravin ironworks which were using 99 % of <b>lake</b> <b>ore</b> for their supply. During this period the biggest production came from lake Sysmäjärvi in the Joroinen county with 3676 tonnes at an average concentration of 35. 94 % Fe, 4. 55 % Mn, 0. 26 % P and 0. 04 % S.

40|$|The Cigar <b>Lake</b> <b>ore</b> {{body is a}} {{high-grade}} uranium deposit situated within water-saturated sandstone. In {{order to}} extract the uranium ore remotely, ensuring minimal radiation dose to workers, and also to access the ore from stable ground, the Jet Boring System (JBS) was developed. This method of mining involves drilling a pilot hole up through a frozen ore body and utilizing a high-powered water jet to mine out cavities. During the mining process an ultrasonic sensor {{will be used to}} provide feedback to the operator, who is located beneath the ore body, as to the dimensions of the cavity. However, more precise data is required to determine final shape, volume, and location of the cavity for mine planning purposes. Selecting a device that will provide sufficient range data in the challenging environment will be vital to optimizing the mining process. Major issues include fog build up and flying debris during mining, and an environment that is wet, dark, and cold. A test cavity has been designed and constructed at the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) so that a study comparing three different technologies, as prospective candidates for the survey system, can be conducted. The devices being evaluated include a Senix ultrasonic sensor, an MDL Cavity Auto-Scanning Laser System (C-ALS), and a MESA Time of Flight (ToF) camera. The ultrasonic sensor is known t...|$|E

40|$|The Hanson <b>Lake</b> <b>ore</b> {{body was}} a small (156, 000 tons), massive lens with sharp ore-wall rock {{contacts}} and a homogeneous mineralogy. The major sulfide minerals were sphalerite and galena. Textures of the sulfide and gangue minerals indicate that the ore body had undergone deformation and recrystallization. Composition and gross features of the alteration envelope suggest that the deformation and recrystallization {{are a result of}} regional metamorphism and metasomatism during the Kenoran orogeny. The relative age of the ore body in relation to metamorphism indicates the ore was deposited penecontemporaneously with the host, volcanic, rocks. The lack of a suitable magmatic source precludes a hydrothermal origin,and shearing within the ore precludes a metasomatic origin for the ore. However, Pb-Pb age of galena in the ore body is not consistent with the author's proposed volcanogenic origin for the ore. The Hanson Lake and Flin Flon group of ore bodies differ in many respects, although they are similar, structurally, within metamorphosed volcanic rocks. The Hanson Lake deposit, with its lack of an extensive alteration zone and its distinctive mineralogy, occurs in older rocks than those of the Flin Flon deposits. The basic differences suggest that the Hanson Lake deposit should not be correlated regionally with the Flin Flon group of deposits, and may account for the lack of good correlation between Co:Ni. ratios of pyrrhotite in the Hanson Lake deposit and in 'economic' deposits of the Flin Flon group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Although {{phosphate}} sorption by goethite {{and other}} less-abundant Fe oxides trongly influences the concentration f this anion {{in the soil}} solution and aquatic environments, relatively little is known on the P-sorption characteristics of natural goethites. For this reason, we examined the P-sorption capacity and time course ofP sorption of 10 goethite-rich soil, ferricrete and <b>lake</b> <b>ore</b> samples, in which the content and nature of mineral impurities were unlikely to affect P sorption significantly. Phosphate sorption could be adequately described by a modified Freundlich equation including a time term. The amount of P sorbed after i day of equilibration ata concentration f 1 mg P/liter ranged widely (0. 36 - 2. 04 #mol P/m 2). The total P sorbed after 75 days of equilibration varied less, in relative terms (1. 62 - 3. 18 #tool p/m 2), i. e., a higher slow sorption tended to compensate for a lower initial (fast) sorption. Total sorbed P (X = 2. 62, SD = 0. 52 ~mol P/m 2) {{was similar to the}} sorption capacity of synthetic goethites, uggesting a common sorption mechanism and the predominance of one type of crystal face, which, according to previous transmission electron microscope observations, might be the (110). The extent of the slow reaction correlated to the ratio between micropore surface area and total surface area, as well as to oxalate-extractable Fe, which is an estimation ofthe ferrihydrite content. Ferrihydrite impurities might affect he slow reaction by contributing tothe microporosity of some samples. Silicate adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} goethites was readily desorbed uring phosphate sorption and did not significantly affect he extent of the slow sorption process...|$|E
40|$|The {{solution}} {{chemistry and}} statistical modelling of the O$ sb 2 $-CaCl$ sb 2 $-HCl leaching of a high-grade arseniferrous uranium ore (Key Lake, N. Saskatchewan) were studied {{with the objective}} of optimizing the co-extraction of uranium and radium. To this end, two types of experiments were carried out: (a) those designed to study arsenic speciation under simulated U-leaching conditions, with the use of model arsenide minerals, namely niccolite (NiAs), rammelsbergite (NiAs$ sb 2 $) and gersdorffite (NiAsS); and (b) statistically designed tests involving actual leaching of samples of the Key <b>Lake</b> <b>ore.</b> Niccolite and rammelsbergite were found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ in solution as oppossed to gersdorffite, which was found to yield H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ was found to be metastable in the Fe$ sb 2 $(SO$ sb 4) sb 3 $ leaching system, while in the FeCl$ sb 3 $ and pressure (O$ sb 2 $) leaching systems, further oxidation to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $ was observed to take place at relatively slow rates. A mechanism has been advanced to account for the latter slow oxidation of H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 3 $ to H$ sb 3 $AsO$ sb 4 $. Finally, it was concluded that the formation of As(III) /As(V) in oxidative acid leaching is independent of the prevailing suspension redox potential which, in turn, renders impractical the possible stabilization of As(III) via potential control. The solubility of RaSO$ sb 4 $ in HCl-MeCl$ sb{ rm x}$ leaching media was quantitatively established by employing the "reduced activity coefficient" method. The estimated solubility profiles clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of CaCl$ sb 2 $ in solubilizing radium as oppossed to other monochloride salt additions. Finally, optimization of the co-extraction of U and Ra was attained {{with the use of a}} computer-aided response surface methodology. An incomplete three-level, four-variable factorial design (Box-Behnken) was applied in the region: 0. 33 kg/L $ leq$ d$ sb{ rm s}$ $ leq$ 0. 99 kg/L; 0. 5 N $ leq$ (HCl) $ sb{ rm o}$ $ leq$ 1. 5 N; 1. 5 M $ leq$ (CaCl$ sb 2 rbrack sb{ rm o}$ $ leq$ 3. 5 M; and 2 hrs $ leq$ Time$ leq$ 6 hrs. Temperature and oxygen pressure were kept constant at 68 $ sp circ$C and 510 kPa (75 psi), respectively. Uranium and radium were found to dissolve simultaneously and rapidly (99 % co-extraction in 2 hrs). Effective reduction of radioactivity levels from 10, 000 pCi/g Ra$ sp{ 226 }$ down to 160 pCi/g has been achieved in a single-stage batch process, thus making possible the production of environmentally innocuous tailings...|$|E
