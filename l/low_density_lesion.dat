40|$|Infiltrating angiolipomas {{are rare}} benign soft-tissue {{neoplasms}} that are locally aggressive and require wide surgical excision. Of 10 patients studied, five showed serpiginous densities intermixed with fat on plain films. Six radionuclide bone scans showed uptake by the soft-tissue lesion. Eight angiograms demonstrated poorly mar-ginated, very hypervascular lesions. Computed tomography (CT) in five patients yielded excellent visualization of predominantly <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>lesions</b> that invaded and replaced skeletal muscle.

40|$|It is {{not known}} whether {{conservative}} or early aggressive (resective surgery with or without radiotherapy) management is better for tumours presenting with epilepsy. The prognosis of 560 patients with a clinical and CT diagnosis of intrinsic supratentorial tumour was examined retrospectively. Epilepsy was the first symptom in 164 patients. Histological confirmation of diagnosis was available in 391 (70 %) of cases. Median survival was 37 months in the group presenting with epilepsy and six months in those presenting with other symptoms (p less than 0. 0001). Patients presenting with epilepsy {{were more likely to}} have a normal clinical examination, a non-enhancing <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>lesion</b> on CT scan and a low grade tumour. From Cox's stepwise proportional hazards model, significant independent variables adversely affecting prognosis were increasing age, focal neurological signs and enhancing CT lesions at diagnosis, non-resective surgery and male sex. Of those presenting with epilepsy 80 patients had surgical treatment within two months of CT diagnosis. The Cox's model failed to identify any beneficial effects for either early resective surgery or radiotherapy. In primary intracerebral tumours with presentations other than epilepsy, resective surgery and radiotherapy were amongst the important factors associated with prolonged survival. Primary intracerebral tumours presenting with epilepsy are relatively benign and their outcome appears to be chiefly determined by clinical factors...|$|E
40|$|A 32 -year-old male sought {{treatment}} for abdominal pain {{in an emergency}} room in December 2002. Contrast en-hanced CT revealed a horseshoe kidney with bilateral en-hancing, partly cystic renal masses. The largest enhancing mass, within the right kidney, measured 11 x 7 cm. The patient was lost to follow up for two years without a tissue diagnosis. He presented two years later to a different emergency room with abdominal and neck pain. Physical examination revealed thyromegaly and a palpable mass in the mid ab-domen. Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed innumerable enhancing lesions of variable size within both kidneys and within the isthmus. The largest lesion within the right renal moiety measured 14. 5 x 10. 5 cm (Fig. 1 A). There was mild bilateral hydronephrosis thought to be secondary to the renal masses. He was also noted to have a 2. 5 x 1. 9 enhancing left adrenal lesion (Fig. 1 B). CT revealed no hepatic lesions.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the CT features of hepatic tuberculosis (TB). Methods: CT features of 15 cases of clinically and pathologically proved hepatic tuberculosis identified over a five-year period (2010 â 2015) were retrospectively analyzed. The CT features were analyzed for nature, range and extent of the various pathological patterns. The CT images of chest were also evaluated for any lung abnormality. Results: There were 4 types of hepatic TB: 1. Serohepatic type (nÂ =Â  2), which showed coalesced multiple nodular hypodense lesions in the subcapsule of the liver with nodular and fusiform uneven calcifications. 2. Parenchymal type (nÂ =Â  9) : included miliary subtype (nÂ =Â  2), showing diffuse low-density miliary nodules in the liver with no enhancement after contrast administration; cystic subtype (nÂ =Â  2), demonstrating cystic low-density lesions with no enhancement; nodular subtype (nÂ =Â  5), showing hypodense lesion with curved edge irregular calcification in three cases, and ill-defined <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>lesion</b> with minimal enhancement in two cases. 3. Mixed type (nÂ =Â  3), which showed the CT features of both parenchymal and serohepatic types. 4. Tuberculous cholangitis (nÂ =Â  1), dilatation of biliary ducts and calcification along the wall of bile ducts were revealed. Abnormal chest CT scan was found in 9 cases (60 %, 9 / 15). Conclusions: Different types of hepatic TB have various imaging features that closely relates with pathological changes. Recognition and understanding the spectrum of CT features of hepatic TB is helpful for the diagnosis; however, definitive diagnosis still depends on pathological examination. Chest CT scan is also helpful to aid in the diagnosis. Keywords: Hepatic, Tuberculosis, CT, Chest, Patholog...|$|E

40|$|Brain {{tumors are}} {{considered}} in regarded to their size, position and aggressive manner. Brain tumors cause several neurologic symptoms. For instance, they increase intracranial pressure due to local damage and displacement of surrounding tissues. In this paper, two glioblastoma multiform cases {{with more than}} 15 year- survival have been reported. The first patient was a 52 year- old woman who suffered from seizure. The CT scan demonstrated a focal low density in the left temporoparietal lobe, and Carbamazepine was prescribed. However, after 12 years, the patient started to suffer from seizures with transient awareness repletion and vomiting. Therefore, daily injection of 16 mg of dexamethason in two divided dosages was prescribed. Fourteen years after illness, biopsy with stereotaxy method was used and glioblastoma multiform was diagnosed by a pathologist. Unfortunately, this patient died due to progression of her illness 16 years after beginning of the seizures. The second patient was a 47 year- old man who also suffered from seizure. In the CT scan, a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>lesion</b> was observed in his left parietal lobe. The patient was treated with 400 mg of Carbamazepine per day in two divided dosages. Dosage of drug was increased to 1200 mg per day. After one year, due to drug resistance, Phenytoin and Phenobarbital were also added to Carbamazepine because of repeated seizures. After 15 years, the soberness disorder of the patient increased and CT scan was repeated. However, due to increase in the tumor size, hydrocephaly surgery was performed and the pathologist reported glioblastoma multiform. Following the surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were also used. This patient is in a good condition now {{and he has no}} serious problems. Glioblastoma multiform is a high degree astrocytic tumor. In this paper, two patients who were afflicted with glioblastoma multiform in fourth and fifth decades of their life were presented.

He also {{presented with a}} {{one and a half}} month history of a slowly growing painless swelling {{on the left side of}} his neck. Examination revealed normal vital signs, an erythematous, firm but mobile mass on the left side of the neck, and signs of a right sided pleural effusion. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed a 4. 5 X 3 cm echodensity in the right ventricle. Furthermore, a 3. 5 X 3. 5 cm sessile echodensity was noted in the right atrium. The left and right ventricles were normal in size and function with an ejection fraction of 60 %. There was trace circumferential pericardial effusion. CT scanning of the neck displayed a fungating and ulcerating soft tissue mass situated at the dermal layer measuring 3. 5 X 1. 7 cm and located above the level of the hyoid at the lower end of the left parotid gland. CT of the chest revealed an extensive bulky filling defect in the right atrium, right ventricle, and outflow track at the level of the pulmonary valve. Multiple <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>lesions</b> were evident in the right lobe of the liver (Figure 1). Lymphadenopathy was noted inferior to the aortic bifurcation.

40|$|Ring-enhancement on CT (RECT) is {{generally}} considered a sine qua non in diagnosing a cerebral abscess. We describe a 16 -year-old female who presented with headaches, vomiting and drowsiness, which over 2 weeks rapidly progressed to coma. CT demonstrated a moderately large left frontal extradural abscess, associated with contiguous left frontal osteomyelitis, and underlying frontal and ethmoidal sinusitis. In addition, {{there was a large}} circular <b>low</b> <b>density</b> area within the left frontal lobe associated with midline shift that, owing to negative RECT, was assumed to represent nascent ischaemic cerebritis. Despite emergency twist-drill drainage of the extradural abscess, and antibiotic/corticosteroids administration, her clinical condition continued to deteriorate and two episodes of uncal herniation were reversed medically. Repeated CT, however, continued to demonstrate negative enhancement within the left frontal <b>low</b> <b>density,</b> although significant enhancement continued to be apparent with recurrent contiguous extradural suppuration. At definitive craniotomy, a large, well-encapsulated abscess cavity was excised from the left frontal lobe corresponding precisely to the area of previously negative enhancement, along with drainage of the recurrent extradural abscess. Thus, in addition to well-known 'false-positives' for RECT with a cerebral abscess, our case highlights the rare occurrence of a 'false-negative'. A <b>low</b> <b>density</b> mass <b>lesion</b> on CT with persistent negative RECT can neither be assumed to represent early cerebritis nor to exclude a mature abscess...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{occurrence}} of intussusception in adults is rare. The condition {{is found in}} 1 in 1300 abdominal operations and 1 in 100 patients operated for intestinal obstruction. The child to adult ratio is 20 : 1. Case presentation A 52 -year-old Irish Caucasian woman was investigated for a 3 -month history of intermittent episodes of colicky midgut pain and associated constipation. Ileocolonoscopy revealed a pedunculated lesion in the terminal ileum prolapsing into the caecum. Computed tomography confirmed a smooth-walled, nonobstructing, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> intramural <b>lesion</b> in the terminal ileum with secondary intussusception. A laparoscopic small bowel resection was performed. Histology revealed a large pedunculated polypoidal mass measuring 4 × 2. 5 × 2 cm consistent with a submucosal lipoma. She had complete resolution of her symptoms and remained well at 12 -month follow-up. Conclusion This case highlights an unusual cause of incomplete small bowel obstruction successfully treated through interdisciplinary cooperation. Ileal lipomas are not typically amenable to endoscopic removal and require resection. This can be successfully achieved via a laparoscopic approach with early restoration of premorbid functioning. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} imaging {{findings}} of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary paragonimiasis. Methods: The imaging findings of serologically and clinically confirmed 22 cases of Paragonimus westermani infection identified {{over a five-year}} period (2010 – 2015) were retrospectively analyzed. Chest CT (n =  22), brain CT (n =  2) & MRI (n =  1), abdomen CT (n =  3) scans were available. Results: Chest CT scan was abnormal in 20 patients and the CT findings were as follows: nodule (n =  18), ground glass opacity (GGO) (n =  12), worm cyst (n =  10), migration track (n =  7), fibrosis (n =  5), pleural effusion (n =  15), pleural thickening (n =  10), pleural calcification (n =  1). Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was noted in three patients. Brain CT scan showed patchy <b>low</b> <b>density</b> in the left occipital lobe in one patient and patchy mixed density in the right basal ganglia and kidney-shaped <b>low</b> <b>density</b> area in the left basal ganglia in another patient. Brain MRI scan revealed a circular lesion with ring enhancement in the right parietal lobe. Abdominal CT scan showed conglomerated small cystic or serpentine lesions and migration track in the right lobe of liver and spleen. Conclusions: The imaging findings of P. westermani is so diverse and non-specific due to its complex life cycle and several life stages during infestation of human; however, common features include nodule, GGO, worm cyst, migration track, pleural effusion, pleural thickening on chest CT scan; patchy <b>low</b> or mixed <b>density</b> <b>lesions</b> on brain CT scan; ring enhancing lesion on brain MRI scan; conglomerated small cystic or serpentine lesions and migration track in liver and spleen on abdominal CT scan.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the spiral CT and ultrasound findings of hepatic adenoma {{and the value}} of spiral CT and ultrasound in the diagnosis of hepatic adenoma. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the spiral CT and ultrasound findings of 15 patients with pathologically confirmed hepatic adenoma in Langfang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2009 to December 2015. Results All the 15 patients showed hypoechoic, isoechoic, or hyperechoic ultrasound findings. Seven of these patients had single hepatic adenoma. In the 7 cases, 4 had low-density lesions, 1 had a slightly low-density lesion, and 2 had equal-density lesions; as for the arterial phase, 5 showed obvious enhancement, 1 showed moderate enhancement, and 1 showed mild enhancement; as for the portal venous phase and delayed phase, 3 showed reduced enhancement, 2 had equal-density lesions, and 2 showed gradual enhancement. Eight patients experienced multiple hepatic adenoma with 80 lesions in total. In the 80 lesions, 4 lesions (3 patients) showed a mixed <b>density,</b> 40 <b>lesions</b> (4 patients) showed a <b>low</b> <b>density,</b> 36 <b>lesions</b> (4 patients) showed a slightly low density; 8 lesions (4 patients) showed obvious enhancement in the arterial phase and reduced enhancement in the portal venous phase and delayed phase; 3 lesions (1 patient) showed obvious enhancement in the arterial phase and an equal density in the portal venous phase and delayed phase; 18 lesions (2 patients) showed obvious enhancement in the arterial phase and portal venous phase and reduced enhancement in the delayed phase; 49 lesions (5 patients) showed moderate enhancement in the arterial phase and reduced enhancement in the portal venous phase and delayed phase; 2 lesions (1 patient) showed no enhancement in any phase. The correct rates of spiral CT in the diagnosis of single hepatic adenoma and multiple hepatic adenomas were 14. 3 %(1 / 7) and 87. 5 %(7 / 8), respectively. Conclusion Ultrasound can only suggest space-occupying lesions, but cannot analyze the lesions qualitatively; spiral CT with three-phase enhancement scanning has a great value in the diagnosis of hepatic adenoma, especially multiple hepatic adenoma...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{vasoactive}} {{effects of}} native and oxidatively modified <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins {{as well as}} their effects on endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5 -hydroxytryptamine were studied in isolated rings of pig right coronary artery. Slowly developing contractions were caused by native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins (100 micrograms protein/ml). The contractions were more pronounced in the absence than {{in the presence of the}} trace metal chelator, EDTA, and coincided with the formation of lipid peroxides during the response. The lipophilic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene, prevented the oxidation of, and contraction to, native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. <b>Low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins oxidized by exposure to copper contracted coronary arteries more rapidly with a threshold of only 1 micrograms protein/ml, but with a similar maximal contraction at 100 micrograms protein/ml. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the contraction to native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins, but not to oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. Catalase blocked contractions to both native and oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. Contractions to oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were unaffected by indomethacin, but were abolished by removal of the endothelium or by inhibitors of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins but not native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Thus, oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins caused endothelium-dependent coronary artery contractions which are mediated by a hydroperoxide. Contractions to native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins are due to their oxidation in the organ chamber by the superoxide anion radical. Oxidized, but not native, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins impair normal endothelial cell vasodilator function in vitro. Oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins, important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, may directly contribute to the increased risk of vasospasm seen in hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis...|$|R

When protein-labeled very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were injected into rats, the relationships of specific activity again indicated that B apoprotein of very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins may be the sole precursor of that of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. However, less than 10 % of the B apoprotein that disappeared from very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins appeared in density lipoproteins. To evaluate the sites of removal of B aproprotein of very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins from plasma, protein-labeled very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were incubated with unlabeled high density lipoproteins to reduce radioactivity in non-B apoproteins selectively by molecular exchange. Most of the B apoprotein was rapidly removed by the liver. The extensive hepatic uptake of both the cholesteryl ester and B apoprotein components of rat very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins may explain the characteristically low concentrations of plasma <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins in the rat...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} macrophages to Influence the {{metabolism}} of native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipo-protein by arterial smooth muscle cells was evaluated using cultured human monc-cyte-derlved macrophages. Macrophage-condltloned medium stimulated the binding and degradation of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein by cultured arterial smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts. Sterol synthesis also was stimulated by macrophage-condl-tloned medium as was cholesterol esterlficatlon In {{the presence of}} high concentra-tions of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein. These findings suggest that macrophages secrete a factor that enhances {{the activity of the}} <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein receptor. <b>Low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein degradation by arterial smooth muscle cells also was enhanced by macro-phage-condltioned medium In the presence of high concentrations of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotelns In the medium. The macrophage factor that stimulates <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipo-protein metabolism Is stable to freezing, Is Inactivated by acid hydrolysis, tryptic digestion, and boiling, and Is of large molecular weight (> 12, 000 to 14, 000 daltons).

40|$|Simple {{arguments}} {{suggest that}} shortened codes must have distance properties {{equal to or}} better than those of their parent codes, {{and that they should}} be equally practical to decode. This relationship holds true in the case of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> generator codes and <b>low</b> <b>density</b> parity check codes. We investigate the properties of shortened turbo codes. I. Motivation for Shortening In our previous work on codes based on very sparse matrices we have observed that while codes with a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> generator matrix [1] are asymptotically bad, codes with a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> parity check matrix [2] are asymptotically good [3, 4, 5]. One way of viewing the relationship between <b>low</b> <b>density</b> generator matrix codes and <b>low</b> <b>density</b> parity check matrix codes is that one obtains a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> parity check matrix by taking the M Θ N parity check matrix [P IM] of a (N; K) <b>low</b> <b>density</b> generator matrix code and chopping off its right-most M columns (where M = N Γ K), to yield an M Θ K matrix [P], which [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Modification of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins {{by human}} {{arterial}} smooth muscle cells {{was characterized by}} increased electrophoretic mobility and increased content of malondialdehyde-like oxidation products reactive with thiobarbituric acid. Lipoprotein modification was promoted by micromolar concentrations of iron or copper in the culture medium and was metal ion concentration- and time-dependent. The ability of diverse media to promote smooth muscle cell-mediated <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein modification correlated with their iron concentration. Therefore, metal ion concentration of culture media contributes substantially to <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein modification in vitro. Human monocyte-derived macrophages took up and esterified the cholesterol from modified <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein more extensively than from native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein. Metal ion-mediated modification of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein may be a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Serum amyloid A, an apolipoprotein of {{high density}} lipoproteins, is also present {{to a lesser}} degree in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins and is co-localized with apolipoprotein B in {{atherosclerotic}} lesions. This study examined the effect of serum amyloid A on cellular affinity of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein in vitro. 125 I-labelled <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein, when loaded with recombinant serum amyloid Al (acute phase isotype) or recombinant serum amyloid A 4 (constitutive isotype), had enhanced binding to both human skin fibroblasts and a murine macrophage cell line, J 774, while its degradation was slightly increased in both cells. The binding of oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein to J 774 cells was also enhanced by addition of recombinant serum amyloid Al or serum amyloid A 4, and degradation of oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was moderately enhanced by recombinant serum amyloid Al. The effects of recombinant serum amyloid A on cellular binding of labelled <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein were not competed by non-labelled <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein and were diminished in the presence of high density lipoprotein. These findings suggest that serum amyloid A in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein may promote association of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein with cells by non-specific adsorption, and high density lipoprotein may prevent such interactions by removal of serum amyloid A...|$|R
40|$|Many {{patients}} with cardiovascular disease have their <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein cholesterol within normal range. This {{raises the question}} about the most important lipoprotein to use as a marker of atherogenecity. In fact, small dense <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein has recently been suggested as a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease. Among high risk patients, those with metabolic syndrome represent an important target population. Different methods of small dense <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein measurement were developed. Accordingly, two phenotypes of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein are recognized: Phenotype A (predominance of large buoyant <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein) & phenotype B (predominance of small dense <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein). However, none of the methods has been yet considered as a gold standard one. A lot of studies confirmed the role of small dense <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein in the development of cardiovascular disease through atherogenic properties & clinical trials. However, others failed to do so. These discrepancies may be due to different sample sizes, different populations, different age groups, different methods of measurement & other possible confounding factors. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of small dense <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein as a valuable screening/preventive tool of cardiovascular disease in {{patients with}} metabolic syndrome...|$|R
