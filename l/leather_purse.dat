25|$|At first Faringdon's {{relationship}} with King Henry VIII of England {{seems to have}} been supportive. King Henry was his guest on 30 January 1521, and he later became one of the royal chaplains. Among Henry's New Year gifts in 1532 was £20 in a white <b>leather</b> <b>purse</b> to the Abbot of Reading. When the king was hunting in the neighborhood the abbot would take the opportunity of sending him presents of Kennet trout or hunting knives.|$|E
25|$|The {{creature}} is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces {{that they must}} fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a <b>leather</b> <b>purse</b> around his neck ("On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast"). The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, Ciappo Ubriachi, the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni (who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join him here), and Giovanni di Buiamonte. Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.|$|E
500|$|The noted New York fashion {{house of}} Mainbocher {{designed}} the uniforms. Their design services were secured, without cost, {{through the efforts}} of Mrs. James V. Forrestal, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The winter uniform was made from navy blue wool, worn with a white shirt and dark blue tie. [...] The jacket was single breasted and unbelted, with a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black <b>leather</b> <b>purse,</b> and rain and winter coats. The summer uniform was much the same as the winter uniform, however, it was lighter in weight, made of white material and worn with white shoes. [...] Later, a gray and white striped, seersucker work uniform for summer was added, along with the wearing of slacks and dungarees when appropriate.|$|E

50|$|Maundy {{money is}} struck in {{denominations}} of one penny, two pence, three pence, and four pence. Until the 18th century the coins given {{were from the}} circulating coinage, {{and it was not}} until the latter half of the century that the four Maundy coins developed as distinct, noncirculating pieces. The obverse design of the coins features the reigning monarch. The reverse, with a crowned numeral enclosed by a wreath, derives from a design first used during the reign of William and Mary, and which has been virtually unaltered since 1822. The coins are presented in two <b>leather</b> <b>purses,</b> a white one containing coins to the value of the same number of pence as the years of the monarch's age, and a red purse containing a £5 and a 50p coin. These <b>leather</b> <b>purses</b> are traditionally supplied to the sovereign by Barrow Hepburn & Gale. In most years there are fewer than 2,000 complete sets of Maundy money; they are highly sought after by collectors.|$|R

His label, named Kiva, first focused on <b>leather</b> <b>purses,</b> belts, and hats. In 1948, he expanded to a full clothing line. He collaborated with major Native American artists, including Manfred Susunkewa (Hopi), Charles Loloma (Hopi), and Andrew Van Tsinhajinnie (Navajo). His boutique flourished through the 1940s and 1950s. When Miss Arizona Lynn Freyse competed for Miss America in 1957, she wore a Kiva New-designed dress. Kiva designs sold to Neiman-Marcus.|$|R
500|$|The uniforms {{worn by the}} SPARS {{were the}} same design and style as those worn by the WAVES, except for the service insignias; created for them by the New York fashion house of Mainbocher. The {{decision}} made regarding the type and style of the uniforms was largely that of the U.S. Navy Uniform Board. The standard uniform was a navy blue suit, consisting of a jacket and a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black <b>leather</b> <b>purse,</b> and rain and winter coats. [...] The summer uniform was of the same design as the standard uniform, worn in white Palm Beach cloth, tropical worsted, or other light fabrics. Shoes were oxfords or pumps of white leather. The summer work wear was a grey and white striped seersucker dress with jacket.|$|E
2500|$|Cornish {{historian}} and archaeologist Charles Thomas noted in 1993: [...] "So far, no structure excavated on [...] Island... {{can be put}} forward as a Roman-period settlement, native-peasant or otherwise." [...] Despite this, a quantity of apparently Romano-British pottery has been unearthed on the site, as has a Roman-style drawstring <b>leather</b> <b>purse</b> containing ten low denomination Roman coins dating between the reigns of Tetricus I (AD 270–272) and Constantius II (AD 337–361). This suggests that [...] "at face-value... either the Island or the landward area of the later Castle (or both...) formed the scene of third-fourth century habitation" [...] even if no evidence has been found of any buildings dating from this period.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, a Royal Warrant {{was granted}} to Barrow Hepburn and Gale {{to produce the}} {{traditional}} white and red <b>leather</b> <b>purses,</b> which continues to today. Until 1979, the Queen made two distributions of money in <b>leather</b> <b>purses</b> to each recipient. [...] The first distribution, given to women in green purses and to men in white, was of an allowance {{in lieu of the}} clothing formerly given. [...] The white purses used for the clothing allowance may be distinguished from the white purses which contained Maundy money, as the former was tied with a short green string; the latter bears a long red string. [...] The clothing allowance purses had been introduced in 1936; prior to that, the clothing allowance was distributed in a paper packet. [...] In the second distribution two purses were given by the monarch; the red one contained £1.50 for provisions, once given in kind, and the additional sum of £1 mandated by Elizabeth I. [...] The white purses contained the Maundy money. [...] After 1979, the separate distribution of the clothing allowance was discontinued—the gifts have now been consolidated, and recipients now receive two purses in a single distribution, one white containing the Maundy coins, and one red containing the other money. [...] The distributions were consolidated so as to reduce the physical strain of the ceremony on the Queen as she aged. [...] The red purse contains £1 representing the money for redemption of the monarch's gown, £3 in lieu of the clothing once given, and £1.50 in place of the food once presented, totalling £5.50. [...] In 2015, for the ceremony at Sheffield Cathedral, the £5.50 not given in Maundy money took the form of a £5 coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill and a 50p piece for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.|$|R

6000|$|Then Ali Baba {{climbed down}} {{and went to}} the door {{concealed}} among the bushes, and said: [...] "Open, Sesame!" [...] and it flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man {{in the form of a}} vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich bales of merchandise--silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in <b>leather</b> <b>purses.</b> He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry, loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots. Using the words: [...] "Shut, Sesame!" [...] he closed the door and went home.|$|R
60|$|In {{the rear}} of this warlike pageant {{followed}} a peaceful band intent upon profiting by the anticipated victories. They were not the customary wretches that hover about armies to plunder and strip the dead, but goodly and substantial traders from Seville, Cordova, and other cities of traffic. They rode sleek mules and were clad in goodly raiment, with long <b>leather</b> <b>purses</b> at their girdles well filled with pistoles and other golden coin. They {{had heard of the}} spoils wasted by the soldiery at the capture of Alhama, and were provided with moneys to buy up the jewels and precious stones, the vessels of gold and silver, and the rich silks and cloths that should form the plunder of Malaga. The proud cavaliers eyed these sons of traffic with great disdain, but permitted them to follow for the convenience of the troops, who might otherwise be overburdened with booty.|$|R

5000|$|The oldest known purse {{was found}} with Ötzi the Iceman who lived around 3,300 BC. Another early example is on Egyptian hieroglyphs, which show pouches worn around the waist. The purse-lid from the Sutton Hoo burial is a very elaborate, {{probably}} royal, metalwork cover for a (presumably) <b>leather</b> Anglo-Saxon <b>purse</b> of about 600 AD.

50|$|In 1945, Orr {{was among}} the U.S. Army Intelligence {{officials}} who investigated this technology, which was originally developed in Germany during the 1930s. According to one story, in 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to record {{a message to the}} German people, which he did using captured German tape. However, the tape had not been completely erased, and Hitler's voice, so the story goes, could be heard intermittently along with that of Eisenhower. Eisenhower ordered that no more captured tape could be used, and ordered Major John Herbert Orr to use captured German scientists to set up an American tape manufacturing facility. Paper tape was the medium in use at the time, but the German engineers had been experimenting with a plastic based tape; they provided Major Orr with the data on this and it became the basis of the modern audio and video recording industry. When the German engineers gave Orr their studies on plastic tape, the only place in Europe manufacturing the material was a factory making ladies imitation <b>leather</b> <b>purses.</b>|$|R

[...] They looked at me blankly enough, I promise you, {{and one of them}} asked me what the devil I did there, and how I dared to join in a private sport. [...] "Nay, I was not chasing your hare, gentlemen," [...] said I. [...] "What then, fellow?" [...] asked one of them. [...] "Why, marry, I was chasing you," [...] I answered, [...] "and a better run I have not had for years." [...] With that I lugged out my persuaders, and made the thing clear in a few words, and I'll warrant you would have laughed could you have seen their faces as they slowly dragged the fat <b>leather</b> <b>purses</b> from their fobs. Seventy-one pounds was my prize that morning, which was better worth riding for than a hare's ears.' ...|$|R

50|$|After {{graduating from}} Chinese Culture University {{in which he}} majored in art, Jimmy worked in an {{advertising}} company for twelve years, and then he worked as an illustrator for newspapers and magazines. In 1998 his picture books Secrets In The Forest (森林裡的秘密) and A Fish With A Smile (微笑的魚) were published in Taiwan. These two books earned him several book awards and were regarded as “The Best Children’s Books” in several Taiwanese newspapers, such as The China Times, Min Sheng Bao, and United Daily News. His picture book A Chance of Sunshine or Turn Left, Turn Right (向左走, 向右走), {{which was published in}} 1999, was voted “One of the Ten Most Influential Books” by the Taiwanese bookstore chain, Kingstones. Jimmy’s books have been translated into dozens of languages and sold around the world. His books have also been adapted for theater, movie, television, and animation. Many of his characters from his picture books have been applied to the making of dolls and pictures on other authorized products, notably <b>leather</b> <b>purses.</b> Jimmy was a middle-aged man who had survived a battle with leukemia in 1995 and was determined to devote himself heart and soul to his art. His pictures are characterized by their use of striking, bold colours and depict central figures that often appear small in the foreground, suggesting the viewpoint of a child in the wide, sometimes sinister, world, or to hint at loneliness.|$|R

I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thought I had better do without it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself.|$|E

The lottery which the men were making related to the number of miles which the ship would have made during the twenty-four hours. The men were just making up the list of subscribers to the tickets when Hilbert went up to them. He gave his half sovereign to the man who had the list.

[...] "What!" [...] he screamed. [...] "Bad? O Lord! I'm robbed again!" [...] And falling on his knees before the settle he began to pour forth the most dreadful curses {{on the head of}} his deceiver. His eyes were shut, for to him this vile solemnity was prayer. He held up the bad half-crown in his right hand, as though he were displaying it to Heaven, and what increased the horror of the scene, the curses he invoked were those whose efficacy he had tasted--old age and poverty, rheumatism and an ungrateful son. Nance listened appalled; then she sprang forward and dragged down his arm and laid her hand upon his mouth.|$|E

Then he drew a red morocco case from an inner breast pocket in the dead man's coat. To his surprise and delight he found that it contained a gold watch and several gold rings and brooches, in some of which were beautiful stones. Swankie was no judge of jewellery, but he could not avoid the conviction that these things must needs be valuable. He laid the case down on the rock beside him, and eagerly searched the other pockets. In one he found a large clasp-knife and a pencil-case; in another a <b>leather</b> <b>purse,</b> which felt heavy as he drew it out. His eyes sparkled at the first glance he got of the contents, for they were sovereigns! Just as he made this discovery, Davy Spink climbed over the ledge at his back, and Swankie hastily thrust the purse underneath the body of the dead man.|$|E

60|$|He {{would have}} renewed his sorrows with the daylight, but her words struck him pleasantly. Everything his eyes opened upon was his very own to keep for ever. The carved four-post Chippendale bed, {{obviously}} worth hundreds; the wavy walnut William and Mary chairs--he had seen worse ones labelled twenty guineas apiece; the oval medallion mirror; the delicate eighteenth-century wire fireguard; the heavy brocaded curtains were his--all his. So, too, a great garden full of birds that faced {{him when he}} shaved; a mulberry tree, a sun-dial, and a dull, steel-coloured brook that murmured level {{with the edge of}} a lawn a hundred yards away. Peculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee that he sniffed {{at the head of the}} wide square landing, all set round with mysterious doors and Bartolozzi prints. He spent two hours after breakfast in exploring his new possessions. His heart leaped up at such things as sewing-machines, a rubber-tyred bath-chair in a tiled passage, a malachite-headed Malacca cane, boxes and boxes of unopened stationery, seal-rings, bunches of keys, and at the bottom of a steel-net reticule a little <b>leather</b> <b>purse</b> with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven shillings in silver.|$|E
