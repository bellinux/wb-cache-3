40|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>lipofibroma</b> of the median nerve are described. The {{literature}} is reviewed and the clinical and treatment {{aspects of this}} unusual condition are discussed. The clinical entity of infiltration of the median nerve by fatty and fibrous tissue {{has been referred to}} by a variety of terms including fibro-fatty overgrowth (Mikhail, 1964), benign intraneural lipoma (Morley, 1964), fatty infiltration of the median nerve (Yeoman, 1964), <b>lipofibroma</b> (Rowland, 1967), lipomatous hamartoma (Emmett, 1965), fibro-fatty proliferation (Callison, 1968) and lipofibromatous harmartoma (Johnson, 1969). At present, <b>lipofibroma</b> is the accepted term because it most accurately reflects the fatty and fibrous characteristics of this benign tumour. Pathologically, the nerve fascicles themselves remain largely intact, but the epineurium, perineurium and endoneurium ar...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} fusiform {{expansion of}} the median nerve by a mass in a patient who admitted to our clinic with the complaints of swelling in the wrist, weakness of the fingers, and aggravating pain and tingling sensation at night. Surgical decompression revealed a fusiform {{expansion of the}} median nerve by the mass and an intact epineurium. The mass was completely removed by dissection. Pathologic examination revealed a <b>lipofibroma</b> surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. The patient was symptom-free and complete remission of neurologic findings was noted on the last clinical examination at 20 months postoperatively. In conclusion, we think that intramural lipofibromas in the median nerve can be successfully treated with a precise surgery and respecting the nerve fibers.

40|$|Herein, {{we present}} {{the case of}} a patient who had {{complaint}} suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome due to fibrolipoma of the median nerve and macrodactyly. 32 -year-old male patient has macrodactyly of the right index finger and coarse skin lines and hyperkeratosis on the volar aspect of the index finger. The patient reported numbness and tingling sensation in his right hand that have woken him at night for 10 years. Electromyography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right hand and diagnostic biopsy were performed to the patient. Sensory action potential of the right median nerve was absent. The median motor study on the right showed low amplitude of the compound muscle action potential with a markedly prolonged distal latency. MRI scan demonstrated a lesion that extended from the palm to the forearm and gave cable-like appearance to the median nerve which is pathognomonic for <b>lipofibroma.</b> Biopsy result was consistent with fibrolipoma. Neural fibrolipoma is a rare benign tumor of the median nerve. MRI is the best method for observing the involvement of the nerve. In one-third of the cases, macrodactyly is associated with neural fibrolipoma. In the differential diagnosis of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms, fibrolipoma of the median nerve should also be kept in mind. (Archives of Neuropsychiatry 2011; 48 : 155 - 7...|$|E
40|$|A 25 {{year old}} male {{presented}} with unusual, multiple, broad-based <b>lipofibromas</b> {{on the right}} leg. These were soft, sessile, each measured form 1 to 2 cms and composed of loosely arranged collagen with a central core of mature adipose tissue. Even though skin tags of less than 5 mm size are usual, multiple bag-like protuberances of more than 1 cms size are extremely rare. the large size and multiple numbers of <b>lipofibromas</b> prompted us to publish this case...|$|R
