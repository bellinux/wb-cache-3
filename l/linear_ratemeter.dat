40|$|A device {{has been}} {{constructed}} and tested which provides immediate readout of {{bone mineral content}} and bone width from absorptiometric scans with low energy radionuclides. The basis of this analog system is a logarithmic converter-integrator coupled with a precision <b>linear</b> <b>ratemeter.</b> The system provided accurate and reliable results on standards and ashed bone sections. Clinical measurements were made on about 100 patients with the direct readout system, and these were highly correlated with the results from digital scan data on the same patients. The direct readout system has been used successfully in field studies and surveys {{as well as for}} clinical observations...|$|E
