5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past <b>life</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been {{the daughter of an}} Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E

25|$|She {{was most}} earnest also in {{promoting}} the cause of temperance, speaking often in its behalf before the Alliance in her own church. She felt deeply the general lack of interest which was shown in her denomination.

25|$|Margaret {{was often}} viewed as a {{controversial}} member of the British royal family. Her divorce earned her negative publicity, and she was romantically associated with several men.

In recognition of this favor, she added the name Mary to her baptismal name of Margaret. According to her later account of her <b>life,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> visions of Jesus Christ, which she thought were a normal part of human experience and continued to practice austerity.|$|E

25|$|She {{should have}} been a man – a great navigator. Her {{powerful}} reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with <b>life.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.|$|E

She ran {{faithfully}} with her Union Diesel until 1958 when she was tied up {{at the foot of}} Lonsdale Ave along with North Vancouver Ferry No. 4. Capt. Jesse Oliver Kinnie, a North Vancouver Ferry employee, looked into the possibility of purchasing North Vancouver Ferry No. 4 and running it on the same route as she had run all her <b>life.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> a higher height clearance on the car deck than Ferry No. 5 and was faster. The numbers did not add up and the plan was abandoned. Ferry No. 4 also ran on a Union Diesel.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Mother Bernard, MacKillop was once more elected unopposed as {{superior}} general in 1899, a position she held until her own death. During the later years of her <b>life</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> many problems with her health which continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism and after a stroke in Auckland, New Zealand in 1902, became paralysed on her right side. For seven years, she {{had to rely on}} a wheelchair to move around, but her speech and mind were as good as ever and her letter writing had continued unabated after she learned to write with her left hand. Even after suffering the stroke, the Josephite nuns had enough confidence in her to re-elect her in 1905.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose <b>life</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 {{review by}} Simon noted that Donna lacked {{dedication}} to her job, and was easily distracted by her love life. Following an April 2008 interview with Jacobs, the itv.com website for the entertainment show This Morning observed that despite Donna's [...] "chaotic" [...] personal <b>life,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> grown more serious about her work. Ultimately, adopting her half-niece Mia forced Donna to grow up, focussing on her career by attaining promotion to ward sister and accepting the resultant responsibilities. Reflecting on Donna's development in January 2011, Jacobs observed {{that she had}} changed {{a great deal from}} her early days, when she was used as a comical character with [...] "bumbling one-liners", into a serious, more responsible person.|$|E
500|$|In Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' Rivers Lamar York {{says that}} Rawlings' {{settings}} are {{an essential part}} of her plots, and that she did not choose to write about a river by accident. At a low time in her <b>life</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken time off and traveled the length of the St. Johns River with a friend. Later she wrote about the boat trip in [...] "Hyacinth Drift", a chapter of Cross Creek. The trip, she said, cured her depression and allowed her to live in peace, as The Secret River did for Calpurnia and her community. The river, York writes, expresses Rawlings' belief that [...] "man must know or discover a relationship to a suitable physical setting" [...] in order to survive the harshness of the world, as she herself did on the St. Johns.|$|E

500|$|Maura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the {{development}} of the character ahead of season 12 saying, [...] "When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her <b>life.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman — and she will be just fine." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout her <b>life,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a good {{relationship}} with her brother, which traced back to their childhood as Rashad reflected that growing up with Aaliyah was [...] "amazing". He recalled her running around their home singing and that never being annoying due to her having a [...] "beautiful voice". She and her brother became close with their cousin Jomo Hankerson, since growing up, they lived [...] "about five blocks apart". Jomo walked Aaliyah and Rashad to their home from school when their mother was not able to pick them up and recalled the Haughton household being filled with music. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when the Haughtons moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.|$|E
500|$|Kylie was {{initially}} {{described as having}} a [...] "full on" [...] personality, similar to Becky. She was also labelled a [...] "firecracker". Lane described her as a [...] "messed up girl, dragged up by an alcoholic mother". In her <b>life</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to [...] "fight for survival". Lane has also expressed her admiration of Kylie's [...] "comedy". She has also said Kylie is [...] "quite witty" [...] and amid confrontation is [...] "quick off the mark and won't let someone stamp her down." [...] Viewers of the serial later observed Kylie to be as evil as Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford). Lane said that the comparison was taken too far because Kylie has not murdered anyone, although she acknowledged that Kylie comes across as evil. She also stated: [...] "Kylie will be a thorn in Becky and Steve's sides {{for a long time}} to come".|$|E
