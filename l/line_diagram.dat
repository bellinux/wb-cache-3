25|$|Because the {{existing}} narrow gauge between Stirling North and Port Augusta {{had been removed}} many years earlier, {{the challenge for the}} PRRPS was to develop an effective means of reinstating the narrow gauge in to Port Augusta. The greatest aspect to this challenge was how to cross over what remains of the standard gauge line to Marree, which has since been truncated at Leigh Creek {{with the opening of the}} newer standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980. This line to Leigh Creek is exclusively used for transporting coal from Leigh Creek to Northern Power Station, and branches off the main standard gauge network at Stirling North. Many options for crossing this line were investigated, including a draw bridge arrangement, diamond crossovers and an underpass. The final decision was an underpass, passing below the Leigh Creek coal train line, which greatly reduced the amount of safe working interfacing with the standard gauge <b>line.</b> <b>Diagram.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kuznetsov and Obiedkovsurvey many {{algorithms}} {{that have}} been developed for constructing concept lattices. These algorithms vary in many details, but are in general {{based on the idea that}} each edge of the <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> of the concept lattice connects some concept C to the concept formed by the join of C with a single object. Thus, one can build up the concept lattice one concept at a time, by finding the neighbors in the <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> of known concepts, starting from the concept with an empty set of objects. The amount of time spent to traverse the entire concept lattice in this way is polynomial in the number of input objects and attributes per generated concept.|$|E
50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> of {{the concept}} lattice encodes enough {{information}} to recover the original context from which it was formed. Each object of the context corresponds to a lattice element, the element with the minimal object set that contains that object, and with an attribute set consisting of all attributes of the object. Symmetrically, each attribute of the context corresponds to a lattice element, {{the one with the}} minimal attribute set containing that attribute, and with an object set consisting of all objects with that attribute. We may label the nodes of the <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> with the objects and attributes they correspond to; with this labeling, object x has attribute y if and only if there exists a monotonic path from x to y in the diagram.|$|E
