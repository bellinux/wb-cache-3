5|$|It {{soon came}} time to name the new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{proved to be the}} focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a <b>light</b> <b>beam,</b> with their product equalling c.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{thought to}} belong to Nigersaurus were first {{discovered}} during a 1965–72 expedition to the Republic of Niger led by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus {{was the result of}} poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.|$|E

In the limit n [...] > infinity, elegant Laguerre-Gauss beams can be identified with Durnin's Bessel beam.

25|$|The {{impossibility of}} faster-than-light {{relative}} speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal (faster-than-light) travel {{by ensuring that}} {{the speed of light}} is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them outside the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> to make the journey if it took a path through the space outside the wormhole. However, a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> traveling through the wormhole would of course beat the traveler.|$|E
25|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{method and}} a set-up to control <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> in thin liquid crystal (LC) layer were developed. The topic {{of our work}} is the {{switching}} of light by reflection and refraction of <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> propagating in a plane of LC layer from the boundaries, which separates the regions of LC cell with different director orientations and refractive indices. We studied experimentally a waveguide formed between two transition orientation areas and effect of light defocusing.

25|$|Fibre optic laser {{safety is}} characterised {{by the fact}} that in normal {{operation}} the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> is inaccessible, so something has to be unplugged or broken for it to become accessible.

25|$|Consider {{the case}} of an {{observer}} and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.|$|E
25|$|Instruments such as {{the laser}} Doppler {{velocimeter}} (LDV), and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) {{have been developed to}} measure velocities in a fluid flow. The LDV emits a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> and the ADV emits an ultrasonic acoustic burst, and measure the Doppler shift in wavelengths of reflections from particles moving with the flow. The actual flow is computed {{as a function of the}} water velocity and phase. This technique allows non-intrusive flow measurements, at high precision and high frequency.|$|E
25|$|The oldest breath {{analyzer}} models pass breath {{through a}} solution of potassium dichromate, which oxidizes ethanol into acetic acid, changing color in the process. A monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> is passed through this sample, and a detector records the change in intensity and, hence, the change in color, {{which is used to}} calculate the percent alcohol in the breath. However, since potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizer, numerous alcohol groups can be oxidized by it, producing false positives. This source of false positives is unlikely as very few other substances found in exhaled air are oxidizable.|$|E

In this paper, we generalize the MES quantum photolithography to the case where two <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> share a $N$-photon nonmaximally-entangled state. we investigate the correlations between quantum entanglement and quantum photolithography. It is shown that for nonlocal entanglement between the two <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> the amplitude of the deposition rate can be changed through varying the degree of entanglement described by an entanglement angle while the resolution remains unchanged, and found that for local entanglement between the two <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> the effective Rayleigh resolution of quantum photolithography can be resonantly enhanced.

25|$|Lighting {{instruments}} can be broadly {{separated into}} two categories: floodlights, which illuminate a wide area, and spotlights (sometimes known as profiles), which produce a narrower, more controllable <b>light</b> <b>beam.</b> The distinction {{has to do}} with the characteristics of the light produced by the instrument. Spotlights produce a potentially tightly focused light, while floodlights produce a much more diffuse light. Instruments that fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum can be classified as either a spot or a flood, depending on the type of instrument and how it is used.|$|E
25|$|Most {{single mode}} / multi mode fiber systems {{actually}} use infra-red light, {{invisible to the}} human eye. In this case, there is no 'eye aversion response". A special case is systems operating at 670–1000nbsp&nm, where the beam {{may appear to be}} a dull red, even if the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> is actually very intense. Technicians may also use red lasers for fault finding at around 628–670nbsp&nm. These can create a significant hazard if viewed incorrectly, particularly if they are abnormally high power. Such visible fault finders are usually classified as Classnbsp&2 up to 1nbsp&mW, and Classnbsp&2M up to 10nbsp&mW.|$|E
25|$|Focusing the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> to a {{point on}} the surface of the sample under test, and {{recombining}} the reflected light with the reference will yield an interferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (Z axis only). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning the light on the sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan), also called full-field OCT.|$|E
40|$|By {{analyzing}} the first-order interference of two independent thermal <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> with both clas-sical and quantum theories, {{we conclude that}} it is impossible to observe the transient first-order interference pattern by superposing two independent thermal <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> even if the degeneracy parameter of thermal light is much greater than one. The result suggests that the classical model of thermal light field within the coherence time may not be the same as the one of laser light field within the coherence time. Shortly after the invention of laser [1], the first-order interference of two independent laser <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> was re-ported [2 – 4]. Magyar and Mandel observed spatial tran-sient first-order interference pattern by superposing two independent ruby laser <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> [3]. Transient first-order interference pattern is the first-order interference pattern obtained in a short time interval, which is usu-ally shorter than the coherence time of the field.

25|$|A lens is a {{transmissive}} {{optical device}} that focuses or disperses a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> {{by means of}} refraction. A simple lens consists of {{a single piece of}} transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a <b>light</b> <b>beam,</b> or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|While Einstein's {{result is}} the same as Bradley's {{original}} equation except for an extra factor of , it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, {{in the sense that it}} gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E
