5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic {{into the area}} included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.|$|E

In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business.

5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps {{of the past}} mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
5|$|Shield volcanoes undergo {{at least}} two stages of {{volcanic}} activity. The initial shield stage is the most productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> predominately fluid peralkaline felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small summit caldera may form, {{as is the case}} for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by stream erosion is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E

5|$|Triceratops {{teeth were}} {{arranged}} in groups called batteries, of 36 to 40 tooth columns, in {{each side of}} each jaw with 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, {{depending on the size}} of the animal. This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (tooth replacement was continuous and occurred throughout the life of the animal). They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation. The great size and numerous teeth of Triceratops suggests that they ate <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> fibrous plant material, with some suggesting palms and cycads, and others suggesting ferns, which then grew in prairies.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they {{pass on to}} the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{fluorocarbons}} {{can hold}} <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> oxygen or carbon dioxide, {{more so than}} blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E
