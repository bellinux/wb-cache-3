40|$|Complex multidimensional {{capturing}} setups such as plenoptic cameras (PC) {{introduce a}} trade-off between various system properties. Consequently, established capturing properties, like image resolution, {{need to be}} described thoroughly for these systems. Therefore models and metrics that assist exploring and formulating this trade-off are highly beneficial for studying as well as designing of complex capturing systems. This work demonstrates the capability of our previously proposed sampling pattern cube (SPC) model to extract the lateral resolution for plenoptic capturing systems. The SPC carries both ray information as well as focal properties of the capturing system it models. The proposed operator extracts the lateral resolution from the SPC model throughout an arbitrary number of depth planes giving a depth-resolution profile. This operator utilizes focal properties of the capturing system {{as well as the}} geometrical distribution of the <b>light</b> <b>containers</b> which are the elements in the SPC model. We have validated the lateral resolution operator for different capturing setups by comparing the results with those from Monte Carlo numerical simulations based on the wave optics model. The lateral resolution predicted by the SPC model agrees with the results from the more complex wave optics model better than both the ray based model and our previously proposed lateral resolution operator. This agreement strengthens the conclusion that the SPC fills the gap between ray-based models and the real system performance, by including the focal information of the system as a model parameter. The SPC is proven a simple yet efficient model for extracting the lateral resolution as a high-level property of complex plenoptic capturing systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{development of}} multi-hull ships {{began in the}} second half of the twentieth century. Today, many hundreds of multi-hull ships of various designs are being built. This intensive development can be explained by the specifi c characteristics of multi-hull ships. A multi-hull ship can consist of various numbers of hulls and of hulls of various common or uncommon shapes and/or hulls with small water-plane areas (SWA ships). Any type of multi-hull ship differs from other multi-hulls and mono-hulls because of its own specifi c features, and its own advantages and disadvantages. The main characteristics of multi-hulls are examined briefl y here. Their larger deck area compared to that of mono-hull ships means that all multi-hulls are more economical for most types of “volume” cargoes, including passengers in cabins or saloons, cars and other wheeled vehicles, <b>light</b> <b>containers,</b> laboratories, weapons, aircraft and helicopters, and so on. Similarly, in comparison with corresponding mono-hulls, a suffi ciently greater, and simply achievable, transverse stability is the important reason for higher safety in multi-hulls. A larger permissible aspect ratio of these hulls also makes them more energy effi cient at higher speeds. The relatively large size of the hull connecting platform is the main reason for higher non-sinkability and higher safety. All multi-hull ships are generally more seaworthy than their mono-hull counterparts. The ships with small waterplane area (SWA) have the best performance characteristics regarding seakeeping. The strength specifi city of multi-hulls plays the leading role in determining transverse loads. Multi-hull ship specifi c features are the reason for possible wider application in order to improve the main characteristics of ships and/or for various other purposes. A general picture of multi-hulls, newly proposed by the author, is presented. Some examples of such options are given...|$|E

25|$|Increasing gas {{pressure}} improves the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not <b>lighter</b> <b>container</b> tanks (see pressure vessel). Achieving higher pressures necessitates {{greater use of}} external energy to power the compression. The mass of the hydrogen tanks needed for compressed hydrogen reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle. Because {{it is a small}} molecule, hydrogen tends to diffuse through any liner material intended to contain it, leading to the embrittlement, or weakening, of its container. The most common method of on board hydrogen storage in today's demonstration vehicles is as a compressed gas at pressures of roughly 700bar (70MPa).|$|R
25|$|Compressed hydrogen, by comparison, {{is stored}} quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good energy density by weight, but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it {{requires}} a larger tank to store. A large hydrogen tank will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store {{the same amount of}} energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not <b>lighter</b> <b>container</b> tanks (see hydrogen tank). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content to power the compressor. Higher compression without energy recovery will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low permeation.|$|R
50|$|In {{container}} shipping, stowage planning {{refers to}} the arrangement of containers on board a container vessel. The stowage of a container ship involves different objectives, such as to optimize the available space and prevent damage to the goods, and more importantly, to minimize the time the vessel spending at the port port terminal. Containers will be arranged depending on their destinations (those going to the first port calls in the schedule will be placed on top), cargo weight (<b>lighter</b> <b>containers</b> are stored on top of heavier ones), cargo nature (dangerous goods containers normally are placed {{at the end of}} ship, and on upper deck to minimize the loss, in case of fire or leakage), etc.|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{container}} medium differing in composition were either artificially infested with Phytophthora cinnamomi and Fusarium oxysporum, or left un-infested. Infested and un-infested media were fumigated with methyl bromide at 200 g m 3, or exposed to aerated steam at 75 °C {{in the laboratory}} and in a commercial steam pasteuriser for periods of 30, 60 and 120 min. Steam treatment for 30 min in the commercial pasteuriser was sufficient for eliminating P. cinnamomi and F. oxysporum from pre-infested medium, and therefore comparable with methyl bromide regarding disinfective properties. Laboratory results nevertheless indicated a pasteurisation time of one hour for optimal efficiency. <b>Light</b> <b>container</b> medium (1 sand: 1 peat: 3 compost) appeared more conducive to recolonisation by fungi than heavy medium (1 composted sugar-cane fibre: 1 river sand) after pasteurisation, whereas the opposite was true for bacteria.
