5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{the most}} {{significant}} factor was the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier. One Australian veteran, Sergeant Charles Lemaire, who had previously fought against the Germans at El Alamein with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion, described the Japanese as [...] "tenacious, brave, self-sacrificing". In {{the minds of the}} Australian soldiers, the Japanese had a reputation for being tough opponents and for not taking prisoners. Despite this perception amongst the Australians, {{there was a sense of}} confidence in their technological superiority. For the Japanese soldiers, the technological edge that the Australians possessed and their relatively abundant supply of ammunition and artillery and air support was the main psychological factor that governed their perceptions of the Australians as enemy. In order to counter this, Japanese commanders exhorted their troops to draw upon [...] "spiritual strength" [...] to achieve victory. In the end, although many of the significant actions of the campaign were infantry engagements which occurred a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Australian base areas where their technological superiority was limited, the Australians' use of combined arms tactics ultimately proved decisive. Although preliminary aerial bombardment, particularly that which was employed around Sattelberg, proved largely ineffective in terms of its physical effects, it did serve to reduce Japanese morale. Used in combination with artillery preparation, which caused significant casualties, considerable disruption was caused to Japanese lines of communications that were already stretched. Suffering from ammunition shortages that limited their fire support, the Japanese defenders were overwhelmed by Australian infantry that had a level of artillery support that was unprecedented for an Australian division in the Pacific, and who advanced in concert with tanks that they employed in a manner that exploited the element of surprise.|$|E
