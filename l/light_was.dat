5|$|Designed by Robert Stevenson {{and built}} by James Smith of Inverness the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first {{exhibited}} on 15 October 1833. The oil-burning <b>light</b> <b>was</b> converted to incandescent in 1906 and the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation on 23 October 1980, {{when the last}} keepers were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{automated}} in 1979, {{people were}} in charge of the light on a continuous basis. The heads and first assistants of the light played a prominent role in carrying out the daily processes of the light.|$|E
5|$|Chester Rock <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E

50|$|In fish-only marine aquariums, <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{only for}} illumination. <b>Lighting</b> <b>is</b> chosen primarily with aesthetic considerations for optimal viewing of the fish.

50|$|Vehicles {{produced}} between 1965 - 1979 were {{equipped with}} old-style lights: turn signal <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> colorless (white), rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> round, {{and the back}} of the body was rounder. Subsequent post-1979 models got amber (yellow) signal lights, and rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> slightly bigger and rectangular.|$|R
5000|$|Soft light {{refers to}} light {{that tends to}} [...] "wrap" [...] around objects, casting diffuse shadows with soft edges. Soft <b>light</b> <b>is</b> when a <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> large {{relative}} to the subject; hard <b>light</b> <b>is</b> when the <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> small relative to the subject.|$|R
50|$|Monochromators {{are used}} in many optical {{measuring}} instruments and in other applications where tunable monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> wanted. Sometimes the monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directed at a sample and the reflected or transmitted <b>light</b> <b>is</b> measured. Sometimes white <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directed at a sample and the monochromator is {{used to analyze the}} reflected or transmitted <b>light.</b> Two monochromators <b>are</b> used in many fluorometers; one monochromator is used to select the excitation wavelength and a second monochromator is used to analyze the emitted light.|$|R
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, <b>light</b> <b>was</b> pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that <b>light</b> <b>was</b> an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio's use of <b>light</b> <b>was</b> also revolutionary. While earlier {{artists like}} Giotto had applied a flat, neutral light from an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a {{specific}} location outside the picture, casting {{the figures in}} light and shadow. This created a chiaroscuro effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.|$|E

5000|$|A catch <b>light</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as the red-eye effect; in general, red-eye is an {{undesired}} effect (caused by the reflection of light from the retina inside the back of the eyeball), while catch <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> often aesthetically desirable, and produced by light reflecting from the cornea. Especially in portraiture, eyes without catch <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> often said to appear dull or lifeless. <b>Lighting</b> <b>is</b> often arranged in studio portraits specifically to create attractive catch lights.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{energy in the}} <b>light</b> <b>is</b> also {{decreased}} when the wall is moving away, because the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> doing work on the wall by radiation pressure.

The {{rate at which the}} pressure does work on the wall is found by multiplying by the velocity: ...|$|R
5|$|The Essex Reef <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> first lit on July 1, 1889, it {{featured}} a fixed red light until December 15, 1892, {{when it was}} changed to a fixed white light.|$|E
5|$|The Round Island Lighthouse {{is located}} {{just south of}} the island on the small, {{uninhabited}} Round Island. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> built in 1894 and automated in 1924. Extensive restoration efforts began in the 1970s and the exterior and structure have since been repaired.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Connecticut has {{fourteen}} active lighthouses in the state, {{two of which}} are maintained as private aids; six are standing but inactive. Another was destroyed after its deactivation. The earliest lighthouse in the state was erected in 1760, but that tower, the first New London Harbor <b>Light,</b> <b>was</b> replaced in 1801, and its successor is the oldest surviving light in Connecticut, as well as the tallest. The last officially recognized lighthouse in the state, the Avery Point <b>Light,</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1943, but was not lit until the following year. The Mystic Seaport Light, constructed in 1966, is a functioning replica housed with a historic Fresnel lens; it is classified as an unofficial and non-navigational aid.|$|E
50|$|Butterfly <b>lighting</b> <b>was</b> a {{favourite}} of famed Hollywood portraitist George Hurrell, {{which is}} why this style of <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> often called Paramount lighting.|$|R
50|$|Red {{flashing}} <b>lights</b> {{may only}} <b>be</b> {{used at the}} locations specified above; any other use of the <b>lights</b> <b>is</b> in breach of the convention.

50|$|Photographic <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> the {{illumination}} {{of scenes}} to be photographed. A photograph simply records patterns of light, colour, and shade; <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> all-important in controlling the image. In many cases even illumination is desired {{to give an}} accurate rendition of the scene. In other cases the direction, brightness, and colour of <b>light</b> <b>are</b> manipulated for effect. <b>Lighting</b> <b>is</b> particularly important for monochrome photography, {{where there is no}} colour information, only the interplay of highlights and shadows. <b>Lighting</b> and exposure <b>are</b> used to create effects such as low-key and high-key.|$|R
