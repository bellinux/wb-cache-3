It is then when they start to play on stage, without much knowledge or a polished sound, but with enthusiasm. Their sound in particular lacked polish because it was strongly conditioned by the technological tools the band members had access to during the time. At first they used a Commodore Amiga 1200, an 8-bit sampler, and a Boss Dr. 5 rhythm box. Their sound was basic, with strong drums, blues and jazz samples, and simple bass lines, {{almost to the point of}} saturation (more because they <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> than due to the technical limitations).|$|R
50|$|The band’s single {{included}} {{a description of}} Mortuus as being “the primitive expression”. A member of the band stated that “Mortuus is really primitive music-wise. It is not {{due to lack of}} musical knowledge or technique, but because we <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> The lyrics and ideas expressed through our lyrics are often very complex, but they are still channeled through a very primitive but effective medium.” According to the band, “there are many differences between the ep and the album, but the essence and atmosphere are the same”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{opposite}} of a neophile is a neophobe; {{a person with}} an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as [...] "witch," [...] "satanist," [...] "heretic," [...] etc. He also speculates in his Prometheus Rising series of books that the industrial revolution and related enlightenment {{represents one of the}} first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society.

5000|$|Hinton was broadly {{regarded}} as a consummate sideman, possessing a sensitivity for appropriately applying his formidable technique and his extensive harmonic knowledge to the performance at hand. He was equally adept at bowing, pizzicato, and [...] "slapping," [...] a technique for which he first became famous while playing with the Cab Calloway Orchestra early in his career. He was also an accomplished sight-reader, a skill which he developed {{on the road with}} Calloway and honed during his several decades of studio work. As he described his technical diversity, [...] "Working with Cab for sixteen years could have made me stale. You play the same music over and over, and after awhile you can do it in your sleep. Many guys <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because <b>it</b> was easy. But when the band business got bad, they weren’t prepared to do anything else. On the other hand, I was able to work on radio and TV and get all kinds of record dates. In a real way, practicing and discipline paid off." ...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} visible {{geographical}} features in Moreno Valley, visible from almost anywhere in the city, is Box Springs Mountain. This mountain at the northwest end of the city towers over the city, providing a concrete landmark. The face of the mountain that faces the city has a large [...] "M" [...] constructed upon it. This was built privately at the encouragement of the City Council, which argued it would foster unity. The letter is located on public land and is maintained entirely by charity. The letter had lights installed on December 3, 2005 to celebrate Moreno Valley's 21st anniversary of its incorporation and {{the completion of the}} repairs of heavy damage to the M, due to excessive rain the year before. The mayor at that time, Bonnie Flickinger, has said <b>that</b> the citizens <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> and <b>that</b> the council would try to get it to light up regularly. Between December 2, 2009 and December 6, 2009, Moreno Valley, along with Edison lit up the [...] "M" [...] in celebration of the city's 25th anniversary. Several Eagle Scout projects have been dedicated to maintaining the letter.|$|R
5000|$|In Future Islands writing process, Gerrit Welmers and William Cashion {{develop the}} music which Sam Herring {{responds}} to with the lyrics. Herrings' sad lyrics often {{contrast with the}} upbeat mood of the music. He explains: [...] "Where the songs have always been kind of upbeat and happy, the message is often melancholy. I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> peoples natural instinct is to let their guards down and dance, and then they actually let the words seep in. Instead of {{turning away from the}} darkness, they embrace the light and find the darkness. I think the opposite is true too." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the rest of}} the group, Penny is not well educated nor savvy in a specific technical field, but she has great social skills and is more streetwise than her neighbors.

She is messy and disorganized but appears to <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Having dropped out of community college prior to the start of the series, she is the only regular character with less education than Howard Wolowitz, who has a master's degree. Despite her weak education, she is insightful. While Sheldon routinely disparages both Penny's and Howard's educations, he occasionally acknowledges her intelligence and potential, though he rarely treats Howard so. He has also asked for her advice more than once regarding various social situations.|$|E
5000|$|Norman is {{most often}} {{referred}} to as a dramatic soprano but unlike most dramatic sopranos, Norman has become known for roles more traditionally sung by other types of voices. From her student days Norman had been selective about her repertoire, heeding her own instincts and interests more than the advice of her teachers or requests of her management. In the beginning of her career, this tendency put her at odds with the Deutsche Opera and compelled her to seek out musical works on her own that she felt were more suitable to her vocal skills. Norman told John Gruen of the New York Times: [...] "As for my voice, it cannot be categorized—and I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> because I sing things that would be considered in the dramatic, mezzo or spinto range. I like so many different kinds of music that I've never allowed myself the limitations of one particular range." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{his book}} Buckaroo, Markus {{reflected}} on {{himself and his}} profession, saying this. I was not born to ranching. I was born a daydreamer, and I know of no slot {{for one of those}} on any ranch. At times I am saddened that I am not what I photograph. Always the observer, seldom the participant, what I am made of remains unanswered. My distance protects me, physically and emotionally; from getting as busted up as I ought to sometimes. Which is why you're {{not going to get the}} whole truth from me. I have entered into an unspoken, unwritten and generally inscrutable pact with the people I have photographed and lived among: if I promise not to tell all I know about them, they will do the same for me. In most cases, I have more to hide. My consolation is a simple-heartedness I would not exchange. The greenest cowboy alive has my respect, and I have no problem whatsoever photographing people who are possessed with the determination to do what I cannot. The awful truth is that I love all of cowboying, even when everything has gone wrong and it's not looking to get any better. Sometimes I especially <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

Our full length however, gives the listener a better idea of who we are becoming.

40|$|The word {{networking}} {{was one of}} the buzzwords of the eighties. More recently, it {{has become}} one of the hot topics of the swine industry. Networking has been defined as a means of gaining access to a set of advantages which by yourself, or with your own resources, you would not be able to acquire. So networking is about working with other people to gain an advantage. The advantage might be in marketing, information, purchasing, labor, or capital investments. There are examples of successful networks in every human endeavor. History is full of examples. But what does networking have to do with the cow-calf industry in the northern plains? The argument is that cattlemen are an independent group, and that we <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> The opposite of independence is dependence, and cattlemen don 2 ̆ 7 t like being dependent on anyone or anything. However, networking is about interdependence. Successful networks are synergistic. That is, the activity of individuals in the network will serve to enhance the efforts of all the other members of the group. To meet our common goals, we need every advantage, especially ones that we cannot gain by ourselves. Because it allows us to gain an advantage, networking has become a very important and timely concept for today 2 ̆ 7 s cattle industry...|$|E
40|$|In broad terms, {{this work}} aims {{to gain a}} greater {{understanding}} of the particular features introduced in the regulatory set-up by competitive issues and vertically related markets. Specifically, we explore their impact on the profitability of the market and the p ssibility for the incumbent to maintain monopoly profits under different regulatory regimes. There was a time when utilities industries and in particular telecoms each seemed to be a natural monopoly. Most governments <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because they owned the monopoly and siphoned off some of the profits. Nowadays, competition is spreading in most utilities market and it becomes imperative to assess its impact on the tariffs and in general on social welfare. We deal with a second degree price discrimination model allowing the players -namely, an incumbent, who has a natural monopoly on the network, and a rival- to make use of non-linear pricing in intermediate and final goods. In this framework the entrant's choice of the customer types is endogenised in a sequential multistage game, where the incumbent, who is undoubtedly the most powerful player, acts as a first mover. We also show that cream skimming, contrary to the general wisdom, can be welfare enhancing. Particular attention is devoted to the access pricing problem which is becoming the key issue to the regulators, examining the relevance of simple pricing rules, such as the Baumol-Willig rule. Despite the presence of a growing literature in these areas, other models fail to incorporate the use of non-linear access pricing. Since price discrimination is common in practice this omission can lead to misleading results. Our analysis shows that the regulator should not allow competition for the low-demand consumers' types or by a less efficient entrant and should impose the adoption of socially optimal non-linear access tariffs. Therefore the general conclusion is that competition will not obviate the need of regulation. ...|$|R
