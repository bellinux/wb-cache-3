Employing the chromium hard mask from the imprint mold etching process as a <b>light</b> <b>blocking</b> metal <b>layer</b> {{on top of the}} imprint mold protrusions is an efficient manufacturing method for CNP molds. The surface chemistry of the mold and in particular of the chromium layer is crucial for the realization of antisticking layers (ASLs) on suchlike CNP molds.

The <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> formed directly on the working electrode, separated it from the electrolyte, and prevented the back transfer of electrons from the electrode to the electrolyte.

The presence of a percolating TiO 2 network within the hybrid film is verified by GISAXS and TEM/ESI measurements. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of both types of <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is compared. Finally, the impact of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> on the power conversion efficiency is investigated by implementing both types of <b>blocking</b> <b>layers</b> in solid-state DSSCs under identical conditions.|$|R
30|$|The {{solar cell}} with the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> {{exhibits}} the highest {{power conversion efficiency}} with 2.71 % followed by the device employing the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> with 2.56 %. The reference device without <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is poorly functional which is indicated {{not only by the}} low efficiency of 0.50 % but also by significantly lower values for the short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage {{as well as for the}} fill factor. Furthermore, the absence of a <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> leads to a linear current–voltage relation for this device and demonstrates the necessity of the <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> for this type of solid-state DSSCs.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} compare {{the effect of the}} <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> two kinds of DSSCs were assembled: (a) a {{pristine}} cell fabricated from the ESD TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> and (b) a SHI cell using an irradiated ESD TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> In addition, a reference cell was fabricated from the TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> prepared by conventional spin coating (Ti(IV) bis (ethyl acetonato)-diisopropoxide solution in 2 wt% of 1 -butanol) and was also tested under identical experimental conditions. Further, TiO 2 photoanodes thickness about ~ 6 μm were prepared on the TiO 2 <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> using TiO 2 paste (Solaronix) by a doctor blade technique [27] and subsequently sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air.|$|R
30|$|For {{both types}} of <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> a linear current–voltage {{relation}} is found, indicating that an ohmic contact is present. The difference in work function of TiO 2 (Φ =  4.2  eV) and FTO (Φ =  4.3 – 4.4  eV) {{is too small to}} create a rectifying Schottky-contact to result in a diode-like IV-curve (Peng et al. 2004; Qiao and McLeskey 2005). However, these measurements clearly show that the current flow is significantly higher for the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> than for the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> The conductance, as determined by the slopes of the curves, is 78  mS for the hybrid and 37  mS for the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> Thus, the current flow through the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is increased by 110 %. This increased current flow is attributed to the reduced film thickness and the associated decreased serial resistance of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> Furthermore, it verifies the findings from TEM, ESI and GISAXS, where a percolating TiO 2 network was found, as the increased current flow shows that no or only few discontinuities are present in the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b> The increased macroscopic conductance of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> promises a positive impact on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells.

40|$|A {{uniform and}} compact hole <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is {{necessary}} for a high performance perovskite solar cells, as it not only serves as an electron collector but also represses the electron recombination by blocking direct contact between the transparent conducting oxide and the perovskite layer.

30|$|The {{short-circuit}} current is 6.75  mA/cm 2 for the solar cell with the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> and 5.78  mA/cm 2 for the solar cell using the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer,</b> thus, {{an improvement in}} the {{short-circuit current}} of 17 % is found. It is noteworthy that the difference in efficiencies between these solar cell is mainly attributed to that difference in short-circuit current, while the values for the open-circuit voltage and fill factor remain basically unchanged. This is a direct evidence for the functionality of the blocking layers: as all devices are identical in construction and under illumination {{the same amount of}} charge carriers is generated, the increased short-circuit current shows that the charge recombination is effectively avoided by both types of <b>blocking</b> <b>layers.</b> However, the increased conductivity of the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> improves the charge transport towards the electrode to increase the extracted photocurrent for this solar cell. Thereby, the efficiency of the solar cells with the hybrid <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is improved by 6 % compared to the device employing the conventional <b>blocking</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|R
30|$|The film {{thickness}} determined from the SEM image varies locally between 30 and 90  nm {{due to the}} high roughness of the FTO.

This novel type of <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> is thinner than the classical <b>blocking</b> <b>layer</b> films as shown with SEM and XRR measurements, and thereby the conductivity of the hybrid film is increased by 110 %. A percolating TiO 2 network, proven by TEM/ESI and GISAXS measurements, allows for the charge transport. Although being thinner, the hybrid film completely separates the rough electrode material from the hole-transport medium in solar cells to avoid the recombination of charge carriers at this interface.
