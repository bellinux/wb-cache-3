5|$|Acid Tongue is {{the second}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis, {{released}} in September 2008 (see 2008 in music) through Warner Bros. and Rough Trade Records. Inspired by jam sessions, the album was recorded in January 2008 in Van Nuys, California {{with the intent of}} capturing a more live feeling than 2006's Rabbit Fur Coat. Lewis worked with a number of guest musicians and wrote the album with boyfriend Johnathan Rice. Lewis, Rice, Jason <b>Lader,</b> and Dave Scher produced the album. Acid Tongue features musical styles ranging from indie rock to alternative country and Americana.|$|E
25|$|A study {{into the}} effects of the {{benzodiazepine}} receptor antagonist, flumazenil, on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms persisting after withdrawal was carried out by <b>Lader</b> and Morton. Study subjects had been benzodiazepine-free for between one month and five years, but all reported persisting withdrawal effects to varying degrees. Persistent symptoms included clouded thinking, tiredness, muscular symptoms such as neck tension, depersonalisation, cramps and shaking and the characteristic perceptual symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, namely, pins and needles feeling, burning skin, pain and subjective sensations of bodily distortion. Therapy with 0.2–2mg of flumazenil intravenously was found to decrease these symptoms in a placebo-controlled study. This is of interest as benzodiazepine receptor antagonists are neutral and have no clinical effects. The author of the study suggested the most likely explanation is past benzodiazepine use and subsequent tolerance had locked the conformation of the GABA-BZD receptor complex into an inverse agonist conformation, and the antagonist flumazenil resets benzodiazepine receptors to their original sensitivity. Flumazenil was found in this study to be a successful treatment for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, but further research is required. A study by Professor Borg in Sweden produced similar results in patients suffering from protracted withdrawal. In 2007, Hoffmann–La Roche the makers of flumazenil, acknowledged the existence of protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, but did not recommended flumazenil to treat the condition.|$|E

40|$|It is commonplace to {{characterize}} legal arguments {{in favor of}} protecting the human embryo or fetus as “inherently religious” such that laws embodying this point of view constitute an establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment. The practical effect of this argumentative strategy is to foreclose substantive debate {{on the issue of the}} legal status of the unborn – to preclude from consideration an entire point of view and so win an argument without ever really having one. This claim has a long pedigree, tracing back to the founding of NARAL and Lawrence <b>Lader’s</b> “Catholic strategy. ” Its most prominent spokesperson, however, has been Justice Stevens, who set forth the claim in his opinions in Thornburgh, Webster, and Casey. Surprisingly, a close, critical reading of these texts is almost entirely absent from the scholarly literature – an absence that this article seeks to remedy. The article demonstrates that Stevens simply takes for granted the central claim upon which the conclusion of establishment turns – the religious character of pro-life legislation. He then employs this assumption rhetorically in order to dismiss a point of view he never squarely confronts. Furthermore, Stevens’ characterization of religious establishment is so broad that it would render any attempt to define who is a human being worthy of legal protection (including Stevens 2 ̆ 7 own) unconstitutional. The article also shows that Stevens’ cryptic invocation of the “endorsement” test fails, and that he covertly repudiates the principle of McGowan v. Maryland. The point of the article is not to show that powerful arguments cannot be made on behalf of the abortion license, or even that some argument cannot be constructed to show that pro-life legislation is religious. Rather, the point is to show that a genuine argument must be made to that end, and not a mere accusation...|$|R

40|$|As convulsÃes dialÃpticas tÃm como principais alteraÃÃes ictais as alteraÃÃes de consciÃncia que sÃo independentes das manifestaÃÃes ictais no eletroencefalograma. Essa classificaÃÃo de convulsÃes epilÃpticas foi proposta por <b>LÃders</b> et al em 1998 e tem como base exclusivamente a semiologia ictal. O presente estudo avalia um total de 59 eventos dialÃpticos de 27 pacientes. Os eventos foram retrospectivamente avaliados e classificados em: crises dialÃpticas parciais complexas, crises dialÃpticas parciais simples, e eventos dialÃpticos nÃo epilÃpticos. Ã de amplo conhecimento que a regulaÃÃo {{cardiovascular}} Ã uma funÃÃo da atividade neuronal no cÃrtex cerebral, na amÃgdala e na formaÃÃo reticular do bulbo e que a ativaÃÃo seletiva dos centros cardÃacos nessas Ãreas produz aumento ou diminuiÃÃo da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca. Esse estudo analisou as alteraÃÃes da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca 1 hora antes, durante e 1 hora depois de cada evento dialÃptico. Foi observado que a freqÃÃncia cardÃaca do perÃodo basal era semelhante nos grupos de crises parciais complexas e de crises nÃo epilÃpticas. TambÃm foi observado que a freqÃÃncia cardÃaca basal estÃ aumentada no grupo de pacientes com crises parciais simples (P< 0, 05). Por sua vez, a freqÃÃncia cardÃaca no perÃodo ictal nÃo aumentou no grupo de crises nÃo epilÃpticas, bem como no grupo de crises parciais simples. Foi observado um aumento da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca (taquicardia) em cada crise dialÃptica parcial complexa (P< 0, 05), com o retorno da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca aos nÃveis basais no perÃodo pÃs ictal. Esses achados indicam que a taquicardia mediada por vias centrais Ã uma caracterÃstica das crises dialÃpticas parciais complexas. Na segunda parte do estudo, foram analisada as alteraÃÃes da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca induzidas pelo movimento em crises epilÃpticas e nÃo epilÃpticas. Foi demonstrado que em nenhuma crise nÃo epilÃptica moderada houve um aumento da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca durante a fase ictal acima de 39, 3 %, comparando-se com a freqÃÃncia cardÃaca do perÃodo basal. NÃo houve aumento da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca em nenhuma crise nÃo epilÃptica leve acima de 16, 3 % durante a fase ictal, bem como nenhuma crise parcial simples apresentou um aumento da FC acima de 20, 6 %, comparando-se com o perÃodo basal. Foi verificado que a utilizaÃÃo de uma escala para gradaÃÃo da quantidade de movimento pode ser usada como ferramenta na verificaÃÃo de uma tendÃncia de alteraÃÃo da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca de acordo com a quantidade de alteraÃÃo de movimento. Assim, a anÃlise da freqÃÃncia cardÃaca pode ser usada como critÃrio para exclusÃo de eventos psicogÃnicosDialeptic seizures {{are characterized}} by ictal loss of consciouness, that is independent of the EEG correlate. This classification of epileptic seizures is based only on ictal semiology and was proposed by <b>LÃders</b> et al in 1998. We studied 59 dialeptic events of 27 patients. The events were retrospectively analyzed and classified in: dialeptic complex partial seizures, dialeptic simple partial seizures and dialeptic non epileptic events. It {{is well known that}} cardiovascular regulation is a function of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and reticular formation in the medulla, and that selective activation of cardiac centers in theses areas is responsible for changes in the heart rate. Our study analyzed the heart rate changes 1 hour prior, during and 1 hour after each dialeptic event. It was shown that the heart rate of the basal period was similar in the complex partial seizures group and in the non epileptic group. The basal heart rate was increased in the simple partial seizures group (P< 0. 05). The ictal heart rate did not increase in the non epileptic group, {{as well as in the}} simple partial seizures group. We showed an increase in the heart rate in each dialeptic complex partial seizure (P< 0. 05), and the heart rate returned to normal in the post-ictal period. Our study showed that central mediated tachycardia is a feature of dialeptic complex partial seizures. In the second part of our study, the heart rate changes secondary to movement in epileptic and non epileptic seizures were analyzed. It was shown that none of the moderate non epileptic seizures had an increase in the ictal heart rate above 39. 3 % when compared to the heart rate in the basal period. There wasnât any heart rate increase in any of the mild non epileptic seizures greater than 16. 3 % in the ictal period. None of the simple partial seizures showed heart rate increase above 20. 6 % of the basal period. We showed that a scale for movement quantification allow us to show a tendency of heart rate changes secondary to different degrees of body movement. Therefore, heart rate analysis can be used as an additional criterion for exclusion of psychogenic event...|$|R
