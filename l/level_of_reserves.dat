This paper analyzes {{the effects of}} financial development and capital flows on foreign reserve accumulation in East Asian economies. Using annual data from 12 Asian economies between 1980 and 2009, the empirical results suggest that financial development can reduce a central bank’s motivation to hoard foreign reserves by reducing the impact of capital flows on foreign reserve demand. Based on the empirical observations, this study then constructed a simple model <b>of</b> foreign <b>reserve</b> accumulation in which the optimal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>reserves</b> depends on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> financial development.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Several {{studies of}} {{herbaceous}} perennials {{have addressed the}} effects of environmental factors during and after production, inherent cold hardiness, and post-harvest handling procedures to enhance flowering and growth during establishment. The regrowth of both woody and herbaceous forage plants following establishment {{is reported to be}} directly related to reserve-nitrogen content. Plants with higher nitrogen reserves grow sooner and produce more growth than plants with low reserves. The first objective in my study, carried out in the greenhouse and outdoors, was to identify any relationship between initial plant size and the regrowth of fourteen herbaceous perennials from five nursery sources. Of the varieties analyzed, six showed differences in growth between nurseries when grown outdoors, but it appears this was not due to their initial plant size. The second objective was to determine whether reserve nitrogen (N) content or the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserved</b> total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) had an effect on regrowth. In this greenhouse experiment, six out of nine varieties that had higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> N per plant tended to grow more. In contrast, five varieties showed more growth with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> TNC per plant. This suggests that reserve nitrogen may have more effect than carbohydrates on the regrowth of perennial plants during establishment. The third objective was to determine the timing of N uptake from soil applied N after establishment.

This approach assumes that the provision <b>of</b> secondary <b>reserve</b> is made under a competitive market. In this market, the supply curve that collects the bids from generators providing secondary reserve is matched with the calculated elastic demand cost curve.

50|$|The {{structural}} reform process {{that started in}} 1992 under the government of President Alberto Fujimori led to the privatization of the electricity sector in a decade in {{which most of the}} countries in the region underwent a similar process. The restructuring process, articulated in the Electricity Concessions Law (LCE) of 1992, unbundled the vertically integrated state monopoly into generation, transmission and distribution and led the basis for the introduction of private operators and competition for generation and commercialization, with transmission and distribution regulated on the basis of free entry and open access. The 1992 Law was modified by Law No. 26876 (Anti-monopoly and Anti-oligopoly Law) in 1997. The process of concessions and transfer of generation assets to private companies was started in 1994 and relaunched in 2002 as it had not been completed yet. Private companies emerging from the 1992 reforms made substantial investment commitments that were fulfilled in the following years. Investment figures reached their highest levels in the period 1996-1999, declining afterwards once the commitments had been fulfilled.
