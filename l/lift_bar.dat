50|$|This Cembalet II has a side case profile with taper {{towards the}} front of the lid. It has a gold lid <b>lift</b> <b>bar</b> fitted to {{the front of the}} lid. The sides are {{extended}} to the floor with a shaped foot extending toward the player. It has a wooden fascia panel below the keys with a central lid lock. The music support ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. A speaker housing containing two speakers is fitted below the keyboard and spans the full width of the keyboard in front of the player's knees. Just one speaker was used in early Cembalet II. Two additional rotary controls are fitted at the left hand end of the keyboard.|$|E
50|$|The Cembalet & Cembalet I has a {{rectangular}} case profile with no taper towards the front. It has a gold lid <b>lift</b> <b>bar</b> fitted {{to the front}} of the lid. It has tapered cylindrical wooden legs with gold ferrules at the foot that mount to angled blocks on the underside of the case. It has a wooden fascia panel below the keys with a central lid lock. The keys are wood with conventional plastic laminates for the top and front. Later Cembalet I used plastic keys. The word 'Cembalet I' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a valve pre-amplifier and a knee lever for volume control.|$|E

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Albuterol {{delivery}} {{through a}} tracheostomy tube {{is affected by}} device (nebulizer vs metered-dose inhaler), interface (mask vs T-piece), bias flow, and humidification. METHODS: A <b>lift</b> <b>bar</b> was placed between the chambers of a dual-chambered lung model such that a ventilator triggered simulated spontaneous breathing {{at a rate of}} 20 breaths/min, tidal volume of 0. 4 L, and inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1 : 2. An 8 -mm inner diameter cuffed tracheostomy tube was placed through a semi-circular model that simulated a patient’s neck. Four conditions of gas flow and humidification were used for the nebulizer experiments: heated aerosol (approximately 30 L/min, approximately 30 °C), heated humidity (approximately 30 L/min, approximately 30 °C), high flow without added humidity (approximately 30 L/min), or a nebulizer attached to the tracheostomy tube without additional flow. The nebulizer was filled with 4 mL that contained 2. 5 mg of albuterol, and operated at 8 L/min. The nebulizer was tested with a T-piece or tracheostomy mask. For the metered-dose inhaler experiments, a spacer was used and actuation of the inhaler (100 g per actuation) was synchronized with inhalation (4 actuations separated by> 15 s). When the spacer was used without additional flow, a valved T-piece was used with a 1 -way valve placed either proximal or distal to the spacer. A filter was attached between the lung model and the distal end of the tracheostomy tube. Albuterol washed from the filter was measured by ultraviolet spectropho-tometry. RESULTS: For the nebulizer, the most efficient delivery was with no flow other than that to power the nebulizer and with a T-piece (p < 0. 001). The most efficient method for aerosol delivery was metered-dose inhaler with a valved T-piece and placement of the 1 -way valve in the proximal position (p < 0. 001). The effect of humidity was unclear from the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Albuterol delivery via tracheostomy was affected by the delivery device (nebu-lizer vs inhaler), bias gas flow, and the patient interface. Key words: aerosol, bronchodilator, metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer, tracheostomy. [Respir Care 2005; 50 (8) : 1071 – 1076. © 2005 Daedalus Enter-prises...|$|E

Safe bucking is started at the log highside and then sections worked offside, toward the butt end. The offside log falls and allows for gravity to help prevent binds. Watching the log's kerf movement while cutting, helps to indicate binds. Additional equipment (<b>lifts,</b> <b>bars,</b> wedges and winches) and special cutting techniques can help prevent binds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We have {{analysed}} the biomechanical {{structure of}} the second competition exercise, Clean and Jerk, depending on highly-qualified weightlifter’s sex and weight category. We have also defined general tendencies and differences in rhythm, temporal and spatial indices of the technique in two types of Clean and Jerk – <b>bar</b> <b>lift</b> and <b>bar</b> jerk. It was determined that highlyqualified middle-weight weightlifters of different sex are more skilful than athletes of other weight categories due to the optimal correlation between body and high level of speed-power qualities...|$|R
50|$|A {{new plan}} {{was drafted by}} Kalff, the {{director}} of the Public Works department (Plan-Kalff, 1876). The only thing he retained from the old plan was the raising of the polder area with about five feet for the drainage and sewage. He refrained from regrouping, so that the street pattern was a copy of the old polder lock pattern. It was all built as quickly as possible, using the cheapest materials (jerry-building). No villas were built. De Pijp became an area of long streets with a typical street wall image: generally four stories with a canopy, the height staggered between the plots, each piece topped with a white roof with a cap and <b>lifting</b> <b>bar,</b> and each house is three windows wide.|$|R

5000|$|The snatch is {{the first}} of two lifts contested in the sport of weightlifting (also known as Olympic weightlifting) {{followed}} by the clean and jerk. The objective of the snatch is to lift the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion. There are four main styles of snatch used: squat snatch (or full snatch), split snatch, power snatch, and muscle snatch. The squat snatch and split snatch are the most common styles used in competition while power snatch and muscle snatch are mostly used for training purposes. In the squat snatch, the lifter <b>lifts</b> the <b>bar</b> as high as possible and pulls themselves under it in a squat position, receiving the bar overhead with the arms straight, decreasing the necessary height of the bar, therefore increasing the amount of weight that the lifter may successfully lift. In the split snatch, the lifter <b>lifts</b> the <b>bar</b> as high as possible and pulls themselves under the bar similar to the squat snatch but in the split snatch the lifter [...] "splits" [...] his legs, placing {{one foot in front of}} them and one behind, allowing themselves to receive the bar lower as in the squat snatch. The split snatch has become much less common with the increased popularity of the squat snatch but is occasionally performed by some lifters. In the power snatch, the lifter lifts the barbell as high as possible and receives the bar overhead with only a slight bend in the knee and hip, increasing the height that the <b>bar</b> must be <b>lifted</b> and decreasing the amount of weight that may be successfully lifted. In the muscle snatch, the lifter <b>lifts</b> the <b>bar</b> all the way overhead with arms locked out and the hip and knee fully extended.|$|R

40|$|The coolant outlet {{temperature}} in VVER- 440 type nuclear reactors is measured using thermocouples. In the Loviisa nuclear power plant, the thermocouple readings {{are used in}} the evaluation of the fuel assembly power. The assembly power is needed as an input for the reactor core performance monitoring system. However, since the coolant is not perfectly mixed in the assembly head, the thermocouple reading might differ from the real average temperature of the flow in the fuel assembly. In order to study the coolant mixing in the fuel assembly head, a 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is conducted. The CFD model describes the head parts of the fuel assembly, including the ends of the fuel rods, a central tube, a top flow plate, <b>lifting</b> <b>bars,</b> a catcher and the thermocouple. The computation grid is a tetrahedral and hexahedral hybrid mesh consisting of 22 - 32. 5 million cells. Following The Best Practice Guidelines, the model's sensitivity to boundary conditions, turbulence models and grid resolution is assessed. The CFD analysis provides information on the coolant mixing in the assembly head and thereby helps to define the average coolant {{outlet temperature}} from the thermocouple reading. 1...|$|R
