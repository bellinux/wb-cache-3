60|$|She {{glanced down}} at him, startled. He was sitting, with his legs crossed, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> intently.|$|E
60|$|Stephens {{meanwhile}} {{had pushed}} his way to Sadie's beast. She saw his worn earnest face <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> through the dim light.|$|E
60|$|The {{gray eyes}} {{that had so}} often <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with entreating worship, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> now, with a last {{struggling}} ray of hope in them, and Maggie met them with her large sincere gaze.|$|R
60|$|Hastings Weare <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> with laughter-brimming eyes.|$|R
60|$|Marie <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{guessing}} her thoughts, and blushed scarlet.|$|R
60|$|Stephen flung {{himself down}} again contentedly in the grasses at her feet, pillowing his chin in his palms and <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> adoringly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{what have}} you come to say, mother?" [...] she asked, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> clear-eyed and composed. [...] "Better let's get it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll do your best, old Bob," [...] said Grace, and the dog, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with {{friendly}} eyes, {{beat his}} tail on the ground.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> the slow, derisive smile curling his lips.|$|R
60|$|Naomi Holland <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{sister-in-law}} {{with something}} like malicious enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|Philippa <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{husband with}} an air of {{pleasant}} candour.|$|R
6000|$|Fiorsen laughed; he laughed, {{holding his}} sides. It was droll {{coming on the}} top of his assertion, too droll! And, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{hesitated for}} the reason, and [...] "Well!" [...] said her father, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from his second cup of coffee. [...] "What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One day,' he said, softly, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> 'I shall destroy YOU, as {{you stand}} {{looking at the}} sunset; because {{you are such a}} liar.' ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sharply. She nodded slowly, like a {{porcelain}} mandarin.|$|R
60|$|Chiltern {{paused in}} his {{tugging at the}} straps, and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ingleby, who lay nearest <b>her,</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with {{a little}} smile.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel still sat <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, and {{watching}} {{the effect of the}} poison of ambition which he had artfully instilled into her mind.|$|E
60|$|And {{there she}} sat, {{and there he}} sat, alone, {{opposite}} to her, on the back desk, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with his furtive eyes every minute.|$|E
60|$|She rose {{slowly with}} a speech upon her lips. Sir Isaac {{remained}} seated <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with a mitigated fury {{in his little}} red-brown eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ashborne {{opened the}} Morning Post, and {{presently}} <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|Philippa <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{husband for}} a moment and back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> work.|$|R
60|$|Toto <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with his}} bright black eyes and wagged his tail.|$|R
6000|$|Ernest groaned again. 'There's {{nothing else}} to be done, Edie,' he said, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> despondently. 'I must earn money somehow to keep the house going.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{letter from}} papa,' she exclaimed, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> brother with great animation. 'We may expect him every day; and yet, alas! he cannot fix one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} {{leaned back in}} her chair, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> 'It would be very bad, I daresay. But it wouldn't prevent me from taking you in.' ...|$|E

60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sitting {{her great}} black horse beside {{which he had}} been pacing.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and {{the ghost}} of an unholy smile flickered upon his lips.|$|R
60|$|He spoke so seriously, {{in a tone}} of such {{deep and}} bitter feeling, that Miss Temple could not resist <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion. His countenance was gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had spoken}} with impatience, and her {{suddenly}} quitting him had sharpened it; {{in spite of}} which he kept his place, only <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "You're prodigious!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said John quietly, and <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "I don't {{think that}} you are {{entitled}} to complain {{of the way in}} which Nature has treated you." ...|$|E
60|$|Anna <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion, {{her eyes}} wide open, a little smile parting her lips.|$|R
60|$|She paused, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion, {{and stopped}} another {{compliment}} on the incorrigible Allan's lips.|$|R
60|$|Drexley <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with a grim smile {{twitching}} at {{the corners}} of his lips.|$|R
