40|$|A wide {{field of}} view {{augmented}} reality display is a special type of head-worn device that enables users to view augmentations in the peripheral visual field. However, the actual effects of a wide {{field of view}} display on the perception of augmentations have not been widely studied. To improve our understanding {{of this type of}} display when conducting divided attention search tasks, we conducted an in depth experiment testing two view management methods, in-view and in-situ labelling. With in-view labelling, search target annotations appear on the display border with a corresponding <b>leader</b> <b>line,</b> whereas in-situ annotations appear without a <b>leader</b> <b>line,</b> as if they are affixed to the referenced objects in the environment. Results show that target discovery rates consistently drop with in-view labelling and increase with in-situ labelling as display angle approaches 100 degrees of field of view. Past this point, the performances of the two view management methods begin to converge, suggesting equivalent discovery rates at approximately 130 degrees of field of view. Results also indicate that users exhibited lower discovery rates for targets appearing in peripheral vision, and that there is little impact of field of view on response time and mental workload...|$|E

40|$|Annotating metro maps with {{thumbnail}} photographs is {{a commonly}} used technique for guiding travelers. However, conventional methods usually suffer from small labeling space around the metro stations, {{especially when they}} are interchange stations served by two or more metro lines. This paper presents an approach for aesthetically designing schematic metro maps while ensuring effective placement of large annotation labels that are sufficiently close to their corresponding stations. Our idea is to distribute such labels in a well-balanced manner to labeling regions around the metro network first and then adjust the lengths of metro line and <b>leader</b> <b>line</b> segments, which allows us to fully maximize the space coverage of the entire annotated map. This is accomplished by incorporating additional constraints into the conventional mixed-integer programming formulation, while we devised a three-step algorithm for accelerating the overall optimization process. We include several design examples to demonstrate the spatial efficiency of the map layout generated using the proposed approach through minimal user intervention...|$|E
40|$|Cranial {{cruciate}} ligament rupture (CCLR) {{is one of}} the most important orthopedic conditions in dogs, leading to joint instability, pain, osteoarthritis and eventually to meniscal injuries. Several surgical techniques have been described to reestablish joint stability following CCLR, including extracapsular procedures. This study compared the biomechanical effects of two extracapsular stabilization techniques (lateral fabello-tibial suture – LFTS, and modified retinacular imbrication technique – MRIT) using nylon <b>leader</b> <b>line</b> following experimental CCLR in cadaver dogs. Twenty canine cadaveric stifles were used. Joint stiffness, cranial and caudal tibial displacement were evaluated in 4 different experimental scenarios: intact stifle, stifle with CCLR, CCLR treated with lateral fabello-tibial suture (LFTS), and CCLR treated with modified retinacular imbrication technique (MRIT). Results: Mean cranial tibial displacement increased progressively from intact to MRIT, LFTS and CCRL stifles. MRIT resulted in less caudal drawer motion than LFTS. Joint stiffness did not differ significantly between LFTS and MRIT treated stifles. Conclusion: LFTS and MRIT increase joint stability but MRIT is more effective; however none of the techniques studied was able to restore original intact stifle stiffness. Clinical implications of the results presented remain to be determined but kinetic gait analysis studies are warranted to determine whether this biomechanical advantage translates into improved hind limb function in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Annual Assembly of Chinese Meteorological Society, Xian, China, 2 - 4 November 2016 This paper {{presents}} a macroscopic physical model that can simulate an upward leader initiated from a tall grounded object under thunderclouds. Based on a tri-layer leader channel {{structure and the}} energy conservation law, a new equation for estimating the upward leader propagation speed is proposed. Equations for modeling other physical parameters, such as the <b>leader</b> <b>line</b> charge density, leader core radius, leader corona sheath radius, leader current, leader electric field and leader conductance, are also proposed. Besides, a set of initiation and survival criteria for a steady self-initiated upward leader from a tall grounded object is suggested. Based on the suggested criteria and the proposed model, the critical corona and charge amount {{as well as the}} minimum height for successful initiation of an upward positive leader (UPL) from a tall grounded object are evaluated and discussed. The model is then used to investigate the general properties of UPLs self-initiated from tall grounded objects with and without the effect of corona space charge layer near the ground under different thunderstorm conditions. The modelling results can well explain the leader properties observed in literature. The model is further tested with two set of experiment data and very promising results are obtained.

40|$|This paper aims at {{examining}} {{relations among}} safety climate (safety attitudes and communication), psychological strains (psychological distress and job dissatisfaction), and safety performance (accident rate and occupational injuries). The present study administers a questionnaire to construction workers from 27 construction sites in Hong Kong (N = 374, M = 366, F = 8, mean age = 36. 68 years). It {{consists of a}} 45 -item Safety Attitude Questionnaire and a 7 -item communication scale developed by Donald and Canter (1993), a 13 -item psychological distress scale (Siu 2 ̆ 6 Cooper, 1998), and items measuring job satisfaction, and accident rate/injuries. Qualitative in-depth interviews and a survey collected data from February to May in 2000. The internal consistencies of these scales are acceptably high, with alphas ranging from 0. 81 to 0. 93. The validity {{of the structure of}} safety attitudes is demonstrated by facet analysis. It consists of three facets: Organizational Role (with self, workmates, team <b>leader,</b> <b>line</b> management, and safety officers as elements), Safety Object (with passive and active safety referents as elements), and Behavioural Modality (with cognitive, affective, and behavioural as elements). These results corroborate previous findings in Western societies. A path analysis using the EQS- 5 was employed to test the proposed model relating safety climate, safety performance, and psychological strains. The results show that safety attitudes is negatively related to occupational injuries; and psychological distress is a mediator of the relationship between safety attitudes and accident rate ((2 = 3. 11, NFI = 0. 99, NNFI = 0. 99, CFI = 1. 00.

40|$|Objective: To biomechanically compare {{different}} {{loop and}} crimp configurations used for extracapsular suture stabilization of the CCL-deficient stifle. Study Design: In vitro study. Sample Population: Crimped loop constructs of 100 [*]lb Ande type nylon <b>leader</b> <b>line</b> in 7 different configurations comprising single and double loops, single and double crimps, and the interlocking loop configuration. Methods: Constructs premade on external skeletal fixator bars 60 [*]mm apart and tested in tension with a custom-made split circular arm {{mounted on a}} table-top materials testing machine. Data were derived from force/displacement plots. In “load to failure” test (10 /group) constructs were loaded to failure with distraction rates of 10 [*]mm/min; ultimate load, tension at 2 [*]mm elongation and failure were recorded. In “staircase” test (5 /group) constructs cycled at 100 [*]N/s from 75 [*]N with incremental increases of 50 [*]N/cycle; ultimate load, maximum tension before elongation at rest over 2 [*]mm and failure were recorded. In “cycling and jumping” test (10 /group) 3 of 7 constructs cycled at 100 [*]N/s 100 times from 50 to 100 [*]N, then 5 times from 50 to 600 [*]N; failure and elongation at cycles 1, 50 and 100 and at jumps 1 to 5 recorded. Results: Double-loop double-crimp configurations were statistically superior to all other configurations in ultimate load, and to single-loop and interlocking loop configurations in elongation in “load to failure” and “staircase” tests. In “cycling and jumping” test the interlocking loop configuration specimens elongated significantly more than the others and only in the double-loop double-crimp group did all constructs complete the test. Conclusions: Double-loop double-crimp configurations are mechanically superior to other previously described configurations...|$|E
