5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, <b>lima</b> <b>bean,</b> melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have {{developed}} a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born {{at a very early}} stage of development—after a gestation of 31–36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. When the joey is born, it {{is about the size of}} a <b>lima</b> <b>bean.</b> The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180–320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.|$|E

Field experiments were conducted on an acidic sandy loam alfisol to investigate the effects of wood ash on the growth indices and chlorophyll content of maize and <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> intercrop during the late and early seasons of 2014 and 2015 at Akure in the rainforest zone of southwestern Nigeria. The treatments were 100 % sole maize with ash, 100 % sole maize without ash, 75 % maize + 25 % <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> with ash, 75 % + 25 % <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> without ash, 50 % maize + 50 % <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> with ash, 50 % maize + 50 % <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> without ash, 25 % maize + 75 % <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> with ash and 25 % maize + 75 % <b>lima</b> <b>beans</b> without ash. Wood ash was applied at 2. 4 kg/plot. Wood ash increased chlorophyll content in all amended treatments except in amended 25 : 75 % maize-lima beans intercrop and 25 : 75 % maize –lima beans intercrop without ash, however 75 : 25 % maize-lima beans amended with wood ash significantly (P≥ 0. 05) recorded the highest chlorophyll content. Growth parameters such as plant height, number of leaves, leaf area, leaf area index, leaf length, stem diameter, number of flowers, number of pods, weight of plant and total biomass of amended maize-lima beans intercrop were significantly (P≥ 0. 05) increased by wood ash application. Based on experimental findings, 25 : 75 % maize-lima beans intercrop and 75 %: 25 % maize-lima beans intercrop amended with wood ash was concluded to be more recommendable in the study area...|$|R
