5000|$|The cut {{should be}} made to retain 1 meter or more of the fiber, in order to {{establish}} equilibrium mode distribution conditions for the second measurement. In a multimode fiber, the lack of an equilibrium mode distribution could introduce errors in the measurement due to output coupling effects. In a single-mode fiber, measuring a shorter cutback fiber could result in significant transmission of cladding modes (light carried in the cladding rather than the core of the optical fiber), distorting the measurement. The errors introduced will result in conservative results (i.e., higher transmission losses and <b>lower</b> <b>bandwidths)</b> than would be realized under equilibrium conditions.|$|R

The algorithm constructs a load-balanced backbone tree, which simplifies routing and avoids per-destination state for routing and per-flow state for QoS reservations. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} algorithm using several metrics including adaptation to mobility, degree of load-balance, bandwidth blocking rate, and convergence speed.
