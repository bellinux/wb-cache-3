30|$|The large {{range of}} {{electronic}} and optical properties of organic conducting polymers makes them very good candidates {{for use in}} modern electronic devices. The fabrication of electronic devices based on conducting polymers, especially Schottky diodes, can be simple and of low cost compared with devices based on inorganic semiconductors. The photoelectrical properties of metal–semiconductor (MS)—have been studied as photovoltaic cells, photodiodes and Schottky diodes {{by a number of}} authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Schottky diodes are playing an important role in modern electronic devices. Although Schottky diodes have the simplest structure, they are the base of a great number of compound semiconductor electronic devices [23, 24]. Schottky diodes are less expensive to fabricate than p–n junction diodes and the device performance is better due to faster response, low resistance, very small transient reverse current during switching and the reverse saturation current of Schottky barrier diodes is higher than that of the conventional p–n junction diodes [25, 26, 27]. The Schottky diode requires <b>lower</b> forward <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> deliver a given current compared to a p–n junction diodes. The operation of Schottky barrier diodes relies upon the device characteristics of the MS junction. Therefore, the understanding of the electronic properties of the surface between metal and the organic layer is important for device applications. Series resistance (R s), formation of Schottky barrier, insulating layer between metal and semiconductor and also the interface states can affect the properties of the junction.|$|R

The achieved charge and mass resolution has been quantitatively expressed using a Figure of Merit (FoM).

40|$|The {{detection}} and measurement of neutrons are vital {{in a wide}} range of fields including homeland security, radiation protection and scientific research. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments have become important techniques in the investigation of the material properties on the atomic scale. For a long period ^ 3 He based detectors were extensively used for neutron detection in these experiments, but due to the scarcity of ^ 3 He, researchers started to look for alternatives. Scintillation based solid state detectors appeared as a prominent alternative. A neutron scattered by a sample under test impinges a scintillating material and initiates a nuclear reaction that produces secondary particles which in a second scattering process generate a light emission that can be detected by an underlying photodetector. By determining the neutron scattering angle, the momentum transfer of the scattered neutron can be identified. Using this information the investigated sample structure can be determined with very high spatial resolution. These experiments using scintillation based detectors rely on efficient detection of photons, hence on the performance of photodetectors. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM), having <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> compared <b>to</b> photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), being able to operate in high magnetic fields, offering the possibility of modular design, and yielding higher readout rates have the potential to become a photon detector of choice in these experiments. The concern regarding SiPMs to be used in these experiments is especially their neutron radiation hardness. When exposed to the neutron irradiation, the amount of defects caused by the impinging neutrons increases the dark count rate and diminishes the photon detection efficiency in the SiPM. In order to study the performance degradation of SiPMs due to neutron irradiation, three different SiPM modules (two analog SiPM arrays provided by manufacturers SensL and Hamamatsu Corporation and one digital array by Philips Digital Photon Counting GmbH), were irradiated at the KWS- 1 instrument of the Heinz Maier-Leibniz (MLZ) research reactor in Garching, Germany with cold neutrons having a 5 A wavelength. The scope of this work is to perform a quantitative comparison of the photodetection efficiency (PDE) for these SiPM technologies before and after irradiation with cold neutrons and assess the feasibility of the SiPM as the technology of choice for scintillation-based photodetectors...|$|R

Here, a detailed comparative analysis of photon detection efficiency (PDE) for three different SiPM technologies, before and after irradiation with cold neutrons, has been carried out.

However, they have a relative large physical size, which limits their spatial resolution, and require a high <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> achieve an acceptable collection of charges, excluding their use for in vivo dosimetry.

The successful deposition of AlOx-MTJs demonstrated the capability of BTIBD to make multilayer structures with good film quality. MTJ thin film surface roughness and intermixing between layers are among the key problems leading to low TMR performance. Here by studying the <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> effect on MTJ properties via the measurement of Neel coupling field and TMR, we suggest that the <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> reduces the intermixing that occurs when top CoFe free layer is deposited on AlOx barrier, but produces relatively high surface roughness. On the other hand, higher energy deposition enhances both interlayer mixing and surface flattening. Such understanding of <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> effects on film properties {{could be used to}} optimize the MTJ performances...|$|R
