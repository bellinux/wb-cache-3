We introduce the non-unital generalizations of graded analogues of noetherian and artinian rings, graded <b>locally</b> noetherian <b>and</b> graded <b>locally</b> artinian rings, <b>and</b> characterize graded <b>locally</b> noetherian <b>and</b> graded <b>locally</b> artinian Leavitt path algebras without any restriction on the cardinality of the graph.

5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle {{beyond the bounds of}} the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback.
