Therefore, a key challenge for manufacturing company is to determine how to <b>control</b> the <b>inventory</b> flows effectively as to get the best overall inventory performance. Since <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> manages to cover a wide range of aspects, it is chosen to focus on specific element such as inventory monitoring and ordering; control limits; and replenishment decisions.

This thesis explores the role of <b>Inventory</b> <b>Control</b> in Product Service System (PSS) applications within manufacturing contexts. This research led to a new approach for dealing with <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> and contributes to understanding of the PSS paradigm in manufacturing industries. PSS embraces the product and service continuum as one system; meanwhile, <b>Inventory</b> <b>Control</b> has led to substantial improvements in performance across many industries. PSS and <b>Inventory</b> <b>Control</b> have for many years been recognized in the scientific literature and by industry as enablers of manufacturing operations. Most studies {{in the field of}} PSS and <b>Inventory</b> <b>Control</b> have only focussed on its individual scenarios; little is known about where the boundaries of PSS should lie as it needs to integrate both external and internal elements in managing PSS <b>Inventory</b> <b>Control.</b> To date, very little research has been reported related to <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> in product-service systems from manufacturing operations perspectives. Research has been done in three stages: (1) PSS characteristics were synthesised from the literature; (2) current industry example of PSS inventory were investigated through a survey; four case studies were developed; (3) uncertainty elements were identified from the literature related to the current PSS <b>Inventory</b> <b>Control</b> scenario and these were evaluated, developed and validated producing a generic model. The research carried out involved collecting primary data from qualitative research conducted through four case studies with companies in the United Kingdom and Malaysia; and information from secondary sources; utilising techniques such as survey, interview, matrix and modelling language method.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{examines}} the possible impact of <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> on the service quality of the academic library, using the academic library of the University of South Africa as an illustrative case study. Service quality components with a close relation to <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> were identified. The first component identified was the library catalogue as a finding aid to provide relevant and accurate information to assist a client in discovering what information resources are located within the library. Two performance measures were chosen, namely client complaining behaviour (CB) {{in regard to the}} perceived state of the library catalogue before and after <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> and the number of changes to the library catalogue after <b>inventory</b> <b>control,</b> indicating the number of incorrect item records on the catalogue. The second component identified was the ability of a client to find a specific information resource personally in the library when needed. This component was measured by availability study outcomes performed in the library, the number of misplaced information resources corrected during the <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> project, and client complaining behaviour concerning the order of information resources on the shelves before and after <b>inventory</b> <b>control.</b> Overall, from the findings of the case study it can be concluded that the service quality of the library has improved as a result of <b>inventory</b> <b>control.</b> # Unisa Press ISSN 0027 - 2639 Mousaion 24 (1) 2006 pp. 75 ± 95 7...|$|R

The various factor influencing <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> were broken into bureaucratic procurement procedure, carrying cost,stock audit practice,stock record practice and staff skill & experience. The particular objective that were analyzed include; evaluation of the effects of procurement procedure to the effectiveness of <b>inventory</b> <b>control,</b> examination of the effect of high inventory carrying cost to the effectiveness of <b>inventory</b> <b>control,</b> determination of the effects of stock audit practices to the effectiveness of <b>Inventory</b> <b>control,</b> analysis of the effects of poor stock record practice to effectiveness of <b>inventory</b> <b>control,</b> and examination of the effects of staff skill & experience to the effectiveness of <b>inventory</b> <b>control.</b> The research adopted descriptive study design. A stratified random sampling technique was applied to the study. The researcher used a sample size of 30 % of the target population to act as the sample size. The researcher used questionnaire to collect data for the research. The questionnaire contained open and closed ended questions and five point Likert scale questions and covered areas of <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> to come up with good raw data for the research. The collected data were quantitatively analyzed using statistical methods such as SPSS which was commanded to produce frequency tables, graphs and pie charts for effective interpretation. The key findings from the study revealed that: delays in procurement of goods, frequent stock-outs and no use of mathematical model were some of the effects of long bureaucratic procurement procedure. According to the study, some products were over stocked, expired, damage and obsolete that eventually increase carrying cost were some of the effects in <b>inventory</b> <b>control.</b> The study revealed that lack of specific time or date for stock taking exercise and discrepancies between actual and physical stock balances were some of the effects of stock audit practice.

The researcher recommends that cumbersome rules and reliance on rigid rules and policies that slow down procurement process should be avoided; current <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> practices and procedures need to be reviewed and redesigned. The management should stay up-to-date on inventory carrying cost. Only qualified and adequately trained personnel should be involved in stock control...|$|R
40|$|<b>Inventory</b> <b>control</b> is a well-covered area in literature. Nowadays, many {{concepts}} and techniques {{are available for}} effectively <b>controlling</b> <b>inventories.</b> Eminent examples are stochastic models to determine order quantities, techniques for forecasting demand and different kinds of ABC analysis. Remarkably enough, the theoretical backgrounds of these {{concepts and}} techniques show {{a great deal of}} similarity: they all stem from the field of operations management and operations research. Despite the value of the available concepts, such a one-sided approach has its limitations in practice. In this article it is argued {{that it is important to}} take a broader view when dealing with practical <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> problems. First of all, an organizational perspective on <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> is developed. The main idea behind this perspective is the importance of the organizational context of inventories. This means that in addition to the traditional points for attention, such as order quantities and replenishment strategies, other aspects need attention as well. They are, for example, the allocation of responsibilities and authorities regarding inventory management, the quality of inventory information and the relevant decision-making processes. These contextual factors as well as the traditional factors are mapped out and integrated into a framework to be used in solving practical <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> problems. One of the main features of the framework is that it is useful in both analyzing and redesigning an inventory situation. Secondly, this article describes the results of a case study regarding the application of the organizational perspective to a practical <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> problem. The central issue of the case study is the spare parts inventory of a missionary aviation organization in Africa. The case study shows that the organizational perspective on <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> is very helpful in dealing with <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> problems. It is illustrated that taking into account the organizational context of inventories, especially the responsibilities and authorities of the persons concerned, is a necessity to accurately understand <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> problems. In addition, it is illustrated that the organizational perspective leads to a more appropriate redesign. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
