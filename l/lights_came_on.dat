5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> he would rush home to see if he could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 6 Hours of Castellet {{got off to}} a {{controversial}} start when the pace car did not return to the pits when the green <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b> The front running LMPs slowed down but some of the GT cars could not react fast enough, resulting in heavy damage to all three GTE Pro class Porsches which caused them to retire. The GTE Am class IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche and GTE Pro JOTA Aston Martin were also caught up in the carnage.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E

500|$|In the video, Janet Jackson {{takes on}} a darker persona, {{previously}} unseen in her own music videos. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control." [...] In the video, a sign appears with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. Then, the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming. In the first verse, Michael {{is seen in the}} room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck, art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while {{at the core of the}} craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) Meanwhile, Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. Then, Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars. The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series, Vampire Hunter D 1985 movie, and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens. The version of the video included on Michael Jackson's Vision is uncut and contains the [...] "Stop fucking with me" [...] lyric, which was censored in HIStory on Film, Volume II.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, the National Christmas Tree was {{relocated}} to Lafayette Park {{north of the}} White House. The 1931 Norway spruce had again become damaged, and the National Park Service purchased two [...] "Koster" [...] blue spruce cultivars to plant {{on the west side}} of Sherman Square with the intent of using alternating between trees each year. But when it became clear later that year that the National Christmas Tree would have to be moved from Sherman Square, the agency asked the Commission of Fine Arts (which had partial jurisdiction over planting decisions around the White House) for permission to plant the two trees to the southeast and southwest of the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square. [...] The Commission of Fine Arts opposed the plan, and suggested that two fir trees be planted east and west of the statue instead. For a time, the National Park Service hoped to plant two trees (of an undetermined species) on the Ellipse near the White House, but in the end acceded to the Commission of Fine Art's plan. Two [...] high Fraser firs from North Carolina were planted to the [...] east and west of the Jackson statue. The trees were planted just a few weeks before the tree lighting ceremony, and the western tree was chosen to begin the alternating use of the trees because it was more visible from the first family's living quarters. During the tree lighting ceremony, President Roosevelt drew attention to the statue of Andrew Jackson and asked the American people to be as courageous in the face of the depression as Jackson had been throughout his lifetime. The tree did not light when Roosevelt threw the switch. The tree remained unlit for about five seconds while Roosevelt worriedly looked about, but then the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
60|$|A long, vague period intervened, {{and people}} {{looking out of}} the windows of upper rooms {{discovered}} the dark hulls of German airships, gliding slowly and noiselessly, quite close at hand. Then quietly the electric <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> again, and an uproar of nocturnal newsvendors began in the streets.|$|E

60|$|With the {{excitement}} of one {{trying to find the}} address of a friend in a strange land Claire looked over the audience when the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> before the vaudeville. In the second row she saw Milt's stiffish, rope-colored hair--surprisingly smooth above an astoundingly clean new tan shirt of mercerized silk.|$|E
6000|$|Harris {{snapped off}} the projector, and the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b> He and Cox blinked. [...] "That was all I could get," [...] Harris said. [...] "But I {{was lucky to}} get that. He wasn't {{supposed}} to tell, not at all. That was the thing they all promised not to do, tell who taught them to become plants. The Pipers {{who live in the}} woods, on Asteroid Y-3." ...|$|E
60|$|Cole fumbled in {{the dark}} until he found a flashlight. Power failure. He could hear {{crackling}} flames. Abruptly the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> again, an ugly yellow, then faded back out. Cole bent down and examined the door with his flashlight. A magnetic lock. Dependent on an externally induced electric flux. He grabbed a screwdriver and pried at the door. For a moment it held. Then it fell open.|$|E

50|$|At 14:28 the {{co-pilot}} (who was flying) reported {{hearing a}} muffled bang {{which was also}} heard {{by some of the}} passengers, from the area of the No. 2 engine transmission. Shortly after, the No. 2 engine's fire warning <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on.</b> The pilot immediately began a descent and transmitted a distress call.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} few minutes, several warning lights on the {{overhead}} panel in the cockpit illuminated. One {{or both of the}} equipment cooling warning <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> to indicate low airflow through the cooling fans (a result of the decreased air density), accompanied by the master caution light. The passenger oxygen light illuminated when, at an altitude of approximately 18000 ft, the oxygen masks in the passenger cabin automatically deployed.|$|E
50|$|The Basement is {{pitch black}} and the caller, with infra-red camera at their disposal, tries to guide the person through the {{basement}} collecting bags of money along the way.

50|$|Later, Bray Wyatt {{arrived at}} the arena and {{performed}} his usual entrance. As the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> Randy Orton appeared and attacked Wyatt. SmackDown's The Singh Brothers (Samir and Sunil) then appeared and attacked Orton, who managed to fight them off. Orton performed an RKO on Wyatt, only for Jinder Mahal to attack Orton with the title belt he had stolen from Orton on the previous episode of SmackDown. Wyatt then performed Sister Abigail on Orton to win the match.|$|E

50|$|Stratosphere {{began playing}} regular {{shows in the}} L.A. area. Aeriel Stiles was {{nominated}} by Rock City News magazine for best guitarist for 3 consecutive years.

50|$|The yellow <b>light</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> {{with about}} 27 laps {{to go for}} debris on the backstretch.

After leading 138 laps, his car quit with ignition trouble. He limped around very slowly for handful of laps, then parked the car in the pits. Jerry Grant blasted by to take the lead, and Mark Donohue was now in second place.|$|R
50|$|Knight {{appeared}} at the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling event TNA Destination X 2005 on March 13, 2005 during the scheduled match between Monty Brown and Trytan.

If the combination was correct, all the <b>lights</b> <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> the Golden Doors opened, and the couple won the house. If not, the topmost section remained dark, a buzzer sounded, and the host revealed the correct combination.|$|E
5000|$|Whitney {{finished}} with three encores {{and the next}} act, Salt-N-Pepa (SNP), started on the side stage using 3 minutes and 30 seconds of pre-approved stage time. Following SNP's performance, there was no announcement, no sound from the main stage until, out of the darkness, came the opening lines of [...] "I Just Called to Say I Love You" [...] and a huge roar from the audience.
