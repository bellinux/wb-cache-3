The express was travelling at its normal speed of around 80 mph approaching the station {{when the driver}} noticed the Knowle and Dorridge distant signal set to caution, but was only able on braking to reduce its speed to 20 mph, before colliding with the freight train which was stationary on the same line, having stopped when the signalman showed the driver a red flag. The distant signal was only 902 yards from Knowle's up main home signal, insufficient distance for the express to stop from 80 mph.

The problem is analytically considered {{in the context of}} elastic bending of the face sheet accompanied by non-linear deformation of the crushed foam core. The plane and axisymmetric formulations are studied. The obtained solutions allow for the estimation of the magnitude of the residual face dent through the size of the crushed core zone (or vice versa). Thus, the analytical background is proposed for a non-destructive inspection of locally indented/impacted sandwich structures. The solutions are verified experimentally...|$|E

40|$|A {{control volume}} method is {{presented}} for predicting the displacement and rotation of thin transversely <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> plates. The new procedure uses discrete Kirchoff triangle (DKT) elements but introduces a dual mesh of interconnected control volumes (CVs) centred on the finite element (FE) vertices. Discrete equations for the unknown {{degrees of freedom}} are subsequently derived by enforcing equilibrium on these CVs; as such this implementation is a quadrature free routine. To allow a comparison, a quadrature free implementation of the DKT element, using the standard finite element procedure, was developed using symbolic methematics. The CV based procedure is validated by patch tests for a state of pure bending and twist. Convergence tests for various loading types show enhanced performance for coarse meshes over the equivalent FE method...|$|E

A special test rig was constructed for superimposing fretting corrosion onto constant amplitude and spectrum loading of the specimen.

The behaviour of the specimens was further investigated by using nonlinear finite element analysis to predict the failure modes and load capacity. In this study, bond failure is the dominant failure mode for normal modulus (240 GPa) CFRP bonding which closely matched the results of finite elements.

This damage has been shown to significantly reduce the strength, stiffness and fatigue life of compression <b>loaded,</b> <b>flat</b> composite laminates [1, 2, 4 – 7], as well as the strength of thin walled composite tubes [8].

The design parameters included {{the number of}} layers (2 or 3), the level of prestress (annealed, heat strengthened, thermally tempered), and laminate type (PVB of SG). Additionally, steel reinforced glass beams were tested. Three different methods were applied to obtain complete redundancy curves (development of residual strength under increasing levels of damage) : 4 -point bending after no, partial, or full damage. The damage was applied by a custom made impact device consisting of a spring <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> steel head that impacted {{the edges of the}} glass layers of the beams.

The results revealed that the remaining fatigue life after a proof cycle was longer than that without the proof cycle because of crack growth retardation due to increased crack closure. However, based on a crack length that is slightly less than the critical value at the maximum proof stress, the minimum assured life or proof test interval must {{be no more than}} 550 pressure cycles for a 1. 33 proof factor and 1530 pressure cycles for a 1. 5 proof factor to prevent in-flight failures...|$|E

40|$|The stress {{concentrations}} {{produced by}} tensile loading of elastic solids with periodic notches are addressed. The criterion suggested by Neuber, which likens the periodic notch {{to a single}} notch of similar shape but smaller depth, is evaluated. According to Neuber, the depth reduction factor only depends on the ratio between the depth and pitch of the periodic notch, regardless of its particular shape. This work benchmarks the criterion against many axially <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> plates and round bars with periodic V-notches, which are analysed {{by means of the}} boundary element method. The investigation highlights a strong disparity between Neuber’s predictions and numerical findings. However, upon slight adjustment of the depth reduction factor with respect to Neuber’s proposal, a satisfactory agreement is achieved. The good correlation holds true both for shallow notches (notched semi-infinite plate) and for deep notches (notched plates or bars of finite width), which were not covered in Neuber’s work. Excellent correspondence is also found for the stress concentration around an infinite row of equispaced circular holes loaded longitudinally, a solution taken from the literature as a testcase. These results lead to the conclusion that Neuber’s criterion, supplemented with the newly disclosed depth reduction factor, can be applied to periodic notches of whatever geometry under normal stresses...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} assessment {{of the effectiveness of}} steel fibre reinforcement in terms of punching resistance of centrically <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> slabs, and to the development of an analytical model capable of predicting the punching behaviour of this type of structures. For this purpose, eight slabs of 2550 x 2550 x 150 mm 3 dimensions were tested up to failure, by investigating the influence of the content of steel fibres (0, 60, 75 and 90 kg/m 3) and concrete strength class (50 and 70 MPa). Two reference slabs without fibre reinforcement, one for each concrete strength class, and one slab for each fibre content and each strength class compose the experimental program. All slabs were flexurally reinforced with a grid of ribbed steel bars in a percentage to assure punching failure mode for the reference slabs. Hooked ends steel fibres provided the unique shear reinforcement. The results have revealed that steel fibres are very effective in converting brittle punching failure into ductile flexural failure, by increasing both the ultimate load and deflection, as long as adequate fibre reinforcement is assured. An analytical model was developed based on the most recent concepts proposed by the fib Mode Code 2010 for predicting the punching resistance of flat slabs and for the characterization of the behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete. The most refined version of this model was capable of predicting the punching resistance of the tested slabs with excellent accuracy and coefficient of variation of about 5 %.

40|$|The {{punching}} of {{reinforced concrete}} slabs is a three-dimensional failure mechanism which {{is influenced by}} several material and geometrical parameters whose values scatter over a range. The known engineering and design models comprise a variety of these parameters, which in some cases can predict experimental failure loads {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. Since these models were mainly derived from experiments on symmetrically <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> slabs, their results have limited prediction accuracy outside of the field investigated. Therefore, in normative design approaches additional rules or restrictions are often required to achieve the required safety level in the entire field of application of construction practice. For the second generation of Eurocode 2, the punching shear design should be specifically revised with the aim to simplify the design approach and to better structure it. Within the framework of the present thesis, this is taken as an opportunity to compare and contrast the main structural design models and to critically evaluate current research findings on the effects of prestressing, ducts in slabs, optimised punching shear reinforcement systems, steel fibres and retrofitting measures. Based on own punching shear tests on individual footings and extensive literature research, data sets were compiled, with which the known design models were compared and an own practice-oriented design approach was derived. Using targeted comparisons of structural models and standards as well as the evaluation of punching shear experiments, an integrated design approach that correctly determines the punching shear resistance of both flat slabs and foundations, with and without punching shear reinforcement, was derived. Comparison with experiments shows that the main influencing factor largely registered no trend and with the new design model many additional provisions can be dispensed with. With the evaluation of tests on edge columns, it was demonstrated that even with non-uniform shear stresses around the column, the model reached very good agreement between experimental and calculated failure loads. Furthermore, through the addition of a modified load increase factor, safer and more economical results can be obtained compared to other design codes. The extension of the proposed model to applications such as prestressing, ducts in slabs, optimised punching shear reinforcement systems and steel fibres increases considerably the range of applications, without increasing the computational work in a significant manner. By presenting the model in an English text proposal conforming to standards for the second generation of Eurocode 2, the design approach will be structured in such a way that it can be introduced as a German contribution to the European Committee for Standardization...|$|E

In this paper, we suggest adaptive bit allocation algorithms that {{operate in a}} frequency selective fading channel environment by exploiting channel state information obtained through a feedback channel. The proposed algorithms try to maximize the overall throughput of the system with significantly reduced complexity while guaranteeing that mean bit error rate (BER) of all sub-channels remains below the pre-defined BER threshold. To do that, the first proposed algorithm divides all sub-channels into several groups according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The grouping criteria are adaptive to the current channel state and BER constraint. The second algorithm tries to find the appropriate constellation size for each sub-channel. The proposed algorithms were compared with existing algorithms through simulation.
