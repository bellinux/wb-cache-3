6000|$|I had simply, I suppose, {{a change}} of heart, and it must have begun when I {{received}} my manuscript back from Mr. Pinhorn. Mr. Pinhorn was my “chief,” as he was called in the office: he had the high mission of bringing the paper up. This was a weekly periodical, which had been supposed to be almost past redemption when he took hold of it. It was Mr. Deedy who had let the thing down so dreadfully: he was never mentioned in the office now save in connexion with that misdemeanour. Young as I was I {{had been in a}} manner taken over from Mr. Deedy, who had been owner as well as editor; forming part of a promiscuous lot, mainly plant and office-furniture, which poor Mrs. Deedy, in her bereavement and depression, parted with at a rough valuation. I could account for my continuity but on the supposition that I had been cheap. I rather resented the practice of fathering all flatness on my late protector, who was in his unhonoured grave; but as I had my way to make I found matter enough for complacency in being on a “staff.” At the same time I was aware of my exposure to suspicion as a product of the old <b>lowering</b> <b>system.</b> This made me feel I was doubly bound to have ideas, and had doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing to Mr. Pinhorn that I should lay my lean hands on Neil Paraday. I remember how he looked at me—quite, to begin with, as if he had never heard of this celebrity, who indeed at that moment was by no means in the centre of the heavens; and even when I had knowingly explained he expressed but little confidence in the demand for any such stuff. When I had reminded him that the great principle on which we were supposed to work was just to create the demand we required, he considered a moment and then returned: “I see—you want to write him up.” ...|$|E

60|$|Lydgate {{could not}} be long in Middlemarch without having that {{agreeable}} vision, or even without making the acquaintance of the Vincy family; for though Mr. Peacock, whose practice he had paid something to enter on, had not been their doctor (Mrs. Vincy not liking the <b>lowering</b> <b>system</b> adopted by him), he had many patients among their connections and acquaintances. For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not connected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old manufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in which there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more or less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy's sister had made a wealthy match in accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the town, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done well in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other hand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper's daughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money; for Mrs. Vincy's sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Featherstone, and had died childless years ago, so that her nephews and nieces might be supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And it happened that Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock's most important patients, had, from different causes, given an especially good reception to his successor, who had raised some partisanship as well as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to the Vincy family, very early had grounds for thinking lightly of Lydgate's professional discretion, {{and there was no}} report about him which was not retailed at the Vincys', where visitors were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined to general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but {{there was no need for}} him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond silently wished that her father would invite Mr. Lydgate. She was tired of the faces and figures she had always been used to--the various irregular profiles and gaits and turns of phrase distinguishing those Middlemarch young men whom she had known as boys. She had been at school with girls of higher position, whose brothers, she felt sure, it would have been possible for her to be more interested in, than in these inevitable Middlemarch companions. But she would not have chosen to mention her wish to her father; and he, for his part, was in no hurry on the subject.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Laser {{generated}} ultrasound {{systems have}} historically been more complicated and expensive than conventional piezoelectric based systems, and this fact has relegated the acceptance of laser based systems to niche applications for which piezoelectric based systems are less suitable. <b>Lowering</b> <b>system</b> costs, while improving throughput, increasing ultrasound signal levels, and improving signal-to-noise are goals which will help increase the general acceptance of laser based ultrasound. One current limitation with conventional laser generated ultrasound is a material's damage threshold limit. Increasing the optical power to generate more signal eventually damages the material being tested due to rapid, high heating [1, 2]. Generation limitations for laser based ultrasound suggests the use of pulse modulation techniques as an alternate generation method. Pulse modulation techniques can spread the laser energy over time or space, thus reducing laser power densities and minimizing da...|$|E

By relaxing the original CMFB and the recombination transmultiplexer (TMUX) to be biorthogonal, nonuniform CMFBs with <b>lower</b> <b>system</b> delay can be obtained. This increases the possible choices of the prototype filters and greatly reduces the overall system delay of the nonuniform filter bank.

In this paper we present a novel de-sign exploration tool—based on a local search algorithm with global convergence properties—which simultane-ously explores choices for computing resources, assign-ments of nodes to these resources, task schedules on the programmable processors and context definitions for the re-configurable circuits.

40|$|Electronic cash {{should be}} {{revocable}} {{in order to}} nullify the effect of attacks mounted by a capable attacker (e. g., double spending by reverse-engineering tamper-resistant devices). For prudent engineering considerations, cash revocability forms a necessary complementary measure to using tamper-resistant devices, adding system security while <b>lowering</b> <b>system</b> cost by reducing the level of physical tamper resistance required. We propose a revocable cash scheme. Cash revocation is achieved efficiently via withdrawing an attacker's ability to further use the system. In several ways the new scheme improves from previous ones (including trustee-based tracing techniques, e. g., [5, 14, 19]), that identify the attacker and revoke cash in terms of publishing a blacklist of coins misused or robbered. Firstly, the new scheme can stop the attacker from further using the system without need of physical confiscation of him/her or his/her devices (physical confiscation is difficult over the network). Secondly, it will achieve a better performance due to avoiding real-time checking through a potentially big coin revocation list. Thirdly, without using trustee, the system serves unconditional privacy for honest users and uses simpler protocols for transactions. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} that enables percutaneous needle-placement procedures {{to be performed}} with unencoded, unregistered, minimally calibrated robots while removing the constraint of placing the needle tip on a mechanically enforced Remote Center of Motion (RCM). Materials and Methods: The algorithm requires only online tracking of the surgical tool and a five-degree-of-freedom (5 -DOF) robot comprising three prismatic DOF and two rotational DOF. An incremental adaptive motion control cycle guides the needle to the insertion point and also orients it to align with the target-entry-point line. The robot executes RCM motion without having a physically constrained fulcrum point. Results: The proof-of-concept prototype system achieved 0. 78 mm translation accuracy and 1. 48 rotational accuracy (this is within the tracker accuracy) within 17 iterative steps (0. 5 – 1 s).

The principle aims are to show how it is possible for a genetic algorithm to control the received power distribution within multiple dynamic environments, such that a single receiver design can be employed <b>lowering</b> <b>system</b> costs. This kind of approach is not typical within the research currently being undertaken, where normally, the emphasis on system performance has always been linked with improvements to the receiver design. Within this thesis, a custom built simulator has been developed with the ability to determine the channel characteristics at all locations with the system deployment environment, for multiple configurations including user movement and user alignment variability. Based on these results {{an investigation}} began into the structure of the genetic algorithm, testing 192 different ones in total. After evaluation of each one of the algorithms and their performance merits, 2 genetic algorithms remained and are proposed for use. These 2 algorithms were shown capable of reducing the receiver power deviation by up to 26 %, and forming, whilst the user perturbs the channel, through movement and variable alignment, a consistent power distribution to within 12 % of the optimised case. The final part of the work, extends the use of the genetic algorithm to not only try to optimise the received power deviation, but also the received signal to noise ratio deviation. It was shown that the genetic algorithm is capable of reducing the deviation by around 12 % in an empty environment and maintain this optimised case to within 10 % when the user perturbs the channel.
