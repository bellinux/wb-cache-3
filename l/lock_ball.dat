50|$|The Space Jam {{pinball machine}} has many {{noteworthy}} features {{that make up}} its pinball experience. On the main playfield, there are six red arrows pointing to critical targets. From left to right, they are as follows: Left Loop, Captive Ball, Basket, Jump Ball, Ramp, and Right Loop. These targets help players complete some of the seven planets surrounding Michael Jordan as well as score jackpots in Multiball mode.There is also a basket {{at the end of}} the launch ramp for skill shot opportunities. Before launching the ball with the plunger, players can choose an award to receive upon a successful skill shot into the launch basket: 300,000 points, Lite Lock / <b>Lock</b> <b>Ball</b> (advances one level up in the Jump Ball), Wabbit Hole (randomly selects a mystery prize or minigame to be played), or Super Pops (increases the bumper threshold's strength). If the player does not make the basket, 50,000 points will still be awarded. However, if the player does make the basket and had selected 300,000 points, Lite Lock / <b>Lock</b> <b>Ball,</b> or Super Pops, he will be given a few seconds to try to shoot the left basket ramp for 10 basketball points and earn a super skill shot.|$|E
30|$|Calipers are the {{orthotic}} devices used in SCI {{cases with}} injury at T 6 –T 9. The classification of calipers {{has been mentioned}} in Fig.  9. They are fitted to the lower limb of SCI patients {{with the help of}} metal rods. KAFO is a type of orthotic device which stabilizes knee, ankle and foot, where the knee is supported by a caliper. In some cases, the joint is locked using a drop lock, spring loaded lock, cam <b>lock,</b> <b>ball</b> lock, dial lock or a plunger type of lock. The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40]. However, combination of KAFO and a Shannon’s brace provides better support. Shannon’s brace is used separately or combined with KAFO to provide waist support, once the patient shows improvement. It helps the patients in restoring his functional abilities. In context to locomotion, it helps a patient to become independent of supportive/mobility aids.|$|E

5000|$|The primary plot of The Machine {{revolves}} around the eponymous female robot (also known as The Machine) that makes {{up the majority of}} the playfield. The robot begins the game in a semi-completed state, requiring the player to activate her voice circuits and her eyes, then cause her to metamorphose into a human female. Each of these events occurs as the player makes shots up the left ramp to <b>lock</b> <b>balls.</b> A two-ball multiball mode begins once the player <b>locks</b> two <b>balls</b> as her [...] "eyes", enabling her to [...] "see". During multiball, <b>locking</b> the two <b>balls</b> again begins her metamorphosis into a fully human woman. The Machine reverts to an incomplete robot when multiball ends.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes conical {{ground glass}} joints can lock together, {{preventing}} the user from rotating them - {{this is known}} as freezing or <b>locking.</b> <b>Ball</b> and socket-type joints are much less susceptible since they have more degrees of rotation than a conical joint. This may happen for a variety of reasons: ...|$|R

5000|$|SDS-Plus: a 10 mm shank {{with two}} open grooves {{held by the}} driving wedges and two closed grooves held by <b>locking</b> <b>balls.</b> This {{is the most common}} size and takes a hammer up to 4 kg. The wedges grip an area of 75 mm2 and the shank is {{inserted}} 40 mm into the chuck.|$|R
25|$|Ball lock: Each time a ball {{goes into}} a {{specific}} hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the <b>balls</b> are physically <b>locked</b> in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> instead, in which the game merely keeps count {{of the number of}} <b>locked</b> <b>balls</b> and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it is time for them to be released.|$|R
5000|$|Two sets of four targets, {{similar to}} drop targets, {{are in the}} top corners of the bonus screen. When all activated, the upper left targets, labeled [...] "RAISE THE SAVER", place a stopper at {{the gap between the}} left wall and the left flipper apparatus. The upper right targets, labeled [...] "OPEN THE GATE", open a {{kickback}} slot in the lower right corner. <b>Locking</b> a <b>ball</b> in the kickback slot will send the ball into play as part of a two-ball multiball event when the bonus game is enabled. If the slot is opened when a <b>ball</b> is already <b>locked,</b> the <b>locked</b> <b>ball</b> will kick the entering ball back into play.|$|R

5000|$|Light Lock / Light Holodeck: Lights the <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> and the <b>ball</b> gets <b>locked</b> for multiball. When {{this option}} is {{selected}} twice, [...] "Light Lock" [...] changes to [...] "Light Holodeck".|$|R
50|$|A 5x5 grid sits {{in front}} of Pin Bot's visor, and two banks of targets on the top and side of the grid allow the player to light the grid one or two units at a time. Once the grid is fully lit, the visor opens, {{allowing}} the player to <b>lock</b> the <b>ball.</b> <b>Locking</b> a second <b>ball</b> in the visor starts a two-ball multiball mode, during which scores are doubled. The player can then re-lock one of the balls and shoot the other up the Solar Ramp, collecting a bonus score.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{features}} the talking {{fish from the}} show, a safe that can be opened, Bada Bing! dancers and the boat (called Stugots) from the show that <b>locks</b> <b>balls</b> for a mini-multiball. The main characters that died in the series (up to the release date) can be collected as bonus multipliers.If, after playing, the player activates the flippers in an LLRLLRLLRLLRLLR pattern, the words [...] "Secret Message" [...] and the number 742.|$|R
5000|$|... 140 to 260 {{kilograms}} {{of pressure on}} the top pressure plate resulted in it bending downwards and pressing on the MV-5 fuze. One to three {{kilograms of}} pressure on the head of the fuze was sufficient to activate it. The fuze's <b>lock</b> <b>balls</b> are forced out of position by the pressure, releasing a striker, which triggers a detonator, then a booster and then the mine's main charge. The mine was used with anti-handling devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{top of the}} playfield {{contains}} upper rollovers that advance bonus multiplier. The white target sequence advances the BAT-O-METER. Completing {{the left}} drop-targets lights the <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> then {{it is possible to}} <b>lock</b> the <b>ball</b> with the right ramp. Completing the C-O-F-F-I-N letters collects a 2 MILLION point jackpot. The playfield contains elements such as for example pop-bumpers, stationary targets, drop-targets, rollovers, ramps, saucer holes and spinners.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} ways to start multiball (<b>locking</b> three <b>balls,</b> elevator, or slots). Once it is active, shoot the {{roulette}} wheel, sewer, or elevator for jackpots.|$|R
2500|$|The {{player can}} add {{letters to the}} word [...] "GREED" [...] by hitting the {{bookcase}} {{in front of the}} vault. [...] Spelling [...] "GREED" [...] opens the bookcase, revealing a shot into the vault {{that can be used to}} [...] "lock" [...] (hold) balls for multiball; for the first multiball, the swamp can also be used to <b>lock</b> <b>balls.</b> [...] The Power turns on for the player's attempt to lock the third and final ball. [...] Multiball can be started from the vault or, for the first multiball, the electric chair.|$|R
5000|$|All hits of {{the upper}} playfield pop bumpers {{increase}} the base [...] "Borg Jackpot" [...] amount awarded in Borg Multiball mode. To start the mode, and thus the battle with the Borg ship, the player needs to <b>lock</b> three <b>balls.</b> <b>Locks</b> are lit by shooting the right orbit (or selecting [...] "Light Lock" [...] on {{the start of a}} ball). Then shoot the right orbit again (or — if either or both are lit — the Delta Quadrant ramp or the Neutral Zone) to <b>lock</b> a <b>ball.</b> After <b>locking</b> the third <b>ball,</b> Multiball will start with one ball placed into the left cannon and the [...] "Start Mission" [...] hole lit. Shooting the hole damages the Borg Ship and scores the Jackpot. A second hit will score a Double Jackpot, and a third hit destroys the Borg ship and scores the Triple Jackpot. In addition, each cannon shot in the [...] "Start Mission" [...] hole adds 10 million points to the Jackpot. After a Triple Jackpot, levels reset to Single Jackpot, allowing for multiple Triple Jackpots.|$|R
5000|$|Run the Red Light [...] - [...] <b>Lock</b> {{the three}} <b>balls</b> by first hitting all three {{stoplight}} {{targets of the}} same color (first green, then yellow and finally red) and then shooting the left loop or the small inner loop to <b>lock</b> the <b>ball.</b> After the final lock, Multiball will start. (Super) Jackpots can then be lit by shooting into the Supercharger and scored by shooting the left loop or the small inner loop.|$|R
5000|$|Juggler - Player must shoot left orbit 3-times to {{activate}} this. Then the games starts <b>locking</b> up <b>balls.</b> After <b>locking</b> up three juggler shots, they are released for [...] "Juggler multi-ball".|$|R
50|$|Additionally three lights labeled U, S and A are lit when a ball {{rolls over}} them. They are worth 2,000 points each. Spelling USA {{increases}} {{the end of}} ball bonus multiplier (a multiplication factor for points earned and awarded when {{the ball in play}} drains). There are three pop bumpers that are worth 100 points when unlit and 1,000 points when lit. Two or three ball multiball is started by hitting one ball up a <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> or two <b>balls</b> up two different <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> and then shooting a ball up the center ramp when the drop target is down.|$|R
5000|$|Standard Multiball (3-ball) - Started {{when the}} player <b>locks</b> two <b>balls</b> in the <b>Lock,</b> then either shoots the Lock {{a third time}} or (in some cases) shoots the left ramp. Jackpots are awarded for {{shooting}} the Player Piano when lit, and are re-lit by shooting the Camera. The player can increase the jackpot value by hitting the flashing 5-Million targets. If the Powerball is shot into the Player Piano, a double jackpot is awarded. On normal settings, the player can start this multiball {{for the first time}} by shooting the left ramp after <b>locking</b> one <b>ball,</b> but the jackpot's starting value will be reduced.|$|R

50|$|Michael Owen (born 7 November 1980 in Pontypridd), is {{a former}} Welsh {{international}} rugby union player, who most often played Number 8, but was also versatile enough to play flanker or even <b>lock.</b> His <b>ball</b> handling was arguably his greatest asset.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} releases, Judge Dredd pinball was {{intended}} to <b>lock</b> the <b>balls</b> in the atmosphere of Deadworld, but there were issues so the <b>ball</b> would be <b>locked,</b> {{picked up by the}} crane, and be dropped back onto the playfield.|$|R
50|$|The left eject is lit for 25,000 at {{start of}} game. Hitting this eject scores and {{advances}} the eject hole value (10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 150,000 plus <b>ball</b> <b>lock).</b> Upon <b>locking</b> a <b>ball,</b> right eject lights for lock. Hitting right eject when lit for lock starts multiball. During multiball, completing HARLEY and DAVIDSON scores 5 million, and lights the orbit shots for 1 million each {{for the rest}} of multiball. The jackpot is not related to multiball. After the first multiball, the eject hole resets to 10,000 (no lights).|$|R
5000|$|The quick-connector {{fittings}} {{which allow}} hoses {{to be easily}} attached and removed from the ports come in two mechanical varieties, namely pin <b>lock</b> and <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> which are not interchangeable. Historically, pin lock kegs were used primarily by the Coca-Cola company, while <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs were used primarily by Pepsi. On a pin lock keg, there are metal posts (pins) extending horizontally from around the port. When the connector is attached, these pins hold it in place. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has two pins, while the [...] "liquid out" [...] has three, {{making it impossible to}} accidentally switch the gas-versus-liquid hoses (which would harmlessly result in carbon dioxide bubbling up through the drink, while gas but no drink would be dispensed). <b>Ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs have ridges in the ports, which are gripped by small metal balls in the connectors. Both types of kegs are fairly easy to find, though ball-lock seem to be more common.As a result of demand from home brewers, second hand kegs are becoming progressively more scarce and in recent years brand new kegs have come onto the market, manufactured in China to the same specifications.|$|R
5000|$|The Two Towers: Spell [...] "K-E-E-P" [...] {{to enable}} the <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> on the right ramp. <b>Lock</b> three <b>balls</b> to start multiball. Shoot all lit shots for Jackpots (depending {{on the number of}} balls, these can be 1x, 2x or 3x (when stacked with Gollum Multiball)). Combo Shots (subsequent Jackpot shots) {{increase}} the second Jackpot multiplier (up to 7x). The Two Towers is considered [...] "complete" [...] after the first scored Super Jackpot, after which a limited amount of additional Super Jackpots may be collected. Once the all Super Jackpots have been collected or time expires, victory lap mode is enabled.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a third}} eject on the field, {{this one}} is below the IDSON standups, and is {{impossible}} to shoot directly. A ball can only bounce in by accident. This awards Speed trap ("He's gettin away!"), provided it did not land in from a weak plunge, a random mystery value. This can be a score bonus, bonus advance, lighting the speed bonus, losing a tilt warning ("Let me see your license... hey, that's a nice bike. Now go on. Git!") a traffic ticket (lose 10,000 points) or advance city. Speed bonus, traffic ticker, and tilt warning seem to be most common. It will always award instant multiball if a <b>ball</b> is <b>locked.</b> <b>Locked</b> <b>balls</b> can be stolen in this game. Speed trap is usually awarded only once per ball.|$|R
50|$|The machine {{features}} a Harley-Davidson motorcycle theme including authentic engine sound. The game enables players to <b>lock</b> the <b>ball</b> in wheelies on the playfield. The game has an up post between the flippers that {{is controlled by}} the player by an extra flipper button {{on the right side of}} the cabinet.|$|R

The Shadow's speech for this game was provided by Williams/Midway voice actor, Tim Kitzrow. The game's noted features include player-controlled ball diverters {{on the left and}} right ramps, a magnetic <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> (which freezes the ball and pulls the ball inside the <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> for Shadow Multiball), and a Breakout-style upper playfield, called [...] "The Battlefield".|$|R

50|$|The Multiball mode in Dr. Who begins {{after the}} player lights 15 Time Expander Factors after <b>locking</b> the <b>ball.</b> After the Time Expander reaches 0, the mini-playfield rises again to level 3, which has three gates {{in it with}} a small picture of a Dalek on the front. The player must shoot {{one of the doors}} to start multiball. Once the player has done this, the mini playfield lowers, {{releases}} the two <b>locked</b> <b>balls,</b> and then rises again back to level 3. To earn the jackpot, the player must hit all three gates on level three of the mini-playfield. This awards a jackpot that begins at 5,000,000 points for the lowest tier of Daleks and grows dramatically as the player rises through the ranks of Daleks (up to the Emperor Dalek at 50,000,000 points). After the player defeats the Emperor Dalek, Davros is revealed as the arch-villain behind the story. The mini-playfield lowers itself back to Level 2, and to defeat Davros, the player must hit the bank of 5 targets once (more if the player has already defeated Davros) to deactivate Davros' shield and get the mini-playfield to raise back to level 3. Once Davros' shield is down, the player must hit the three gates on level 3 again, after which a 100,000,000-point Davros Jackpot is awarded. All jackpots are affected by the playfield multiplier, allowing the player to collect tremendous amounts of points from a single jackpot (1,200,000,000 points if Davros has been defeated twice before and the Playfield Multiplier is 4).|$|R
