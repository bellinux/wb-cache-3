5|$|NY273 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with US4 {{east of the}} village of Whitehall {{in the town of}} Whitehall. After the intersection, the route passed the Our Lady of Angels Cemetery, where it turned to the southeast. NY273 ran along the base of Ore Red Hill, outside of Whitehall. Near Ore Red Hill, the highway intersected with a <b>local</b> <b>road,</b> which connected to US4. The route progressed to the southeast, entering the hamlet of East Whitehall, where it intersected with another <b>local</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|The highway {{follows the}} {{railroad}} tracks into Beekmantown until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short <b>local</b> <b>road,</b> County Route 58, formerly NY456, comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, Chazy, NY22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short <b>local</b> <b>road,</b> County Route 23, formerly NY191, in the hamlet of Sciota.|$|E

50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> (Lokalni putevi) - <b>local</b> <b>roads</b> {{connections}} {{of villages}} and other settlements of local communities. Quality of road infrastructure varies wildly between <b>local</b> <b>roads,</b> so {{these can be}} both unpaved dirt roads, as well as roads resembling regional roads in quality and appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> {{vary greatly}} in quality, from wide urban streets to very narrow, rural lanes, known as boreens in Ireland. There are {{three types of}} Local Road: <b>Local</b> Primary (<b>local</b> <b>roads</b> wider than 4 metres), <b>Local</b> Secondary (<b>local</b> <b>roads</b> {{narrower}} than 4 metres) and Local Tertiary (cul-de-sacs and other minor roads).|$|R
5|$|As of the 1960s {{or early}} 1970s, the only human {{inhabitants}} of the watershed of Black Creek reside either {{in the village of}} Mocanaqua in the southwestern part of the watershed or the small community of Lee. The watershed can be accessed from US Route 11, Pennsylvania Route 239, and a <b>local</b> <b>road</b> that runs from Mocanaqua to Glen Lyon.|$|E
5|$|From I-95, the Pineda Causeway Extension passes between {{developments}} to {{its north}} and south. After an intersection with a <b>local</b> <b>road,</b> the route curves {{to the northeast}} and later resumes its eastward course, reaching Wickham Road. The route turns {{to the east and}} moves across the Florida East Coast Railway.|$|E
5|$|Highway129 {{continues}} north {{alongside the}} Sudbury – White River CPR line. It {{ends at the}} southern town limits of Chapleau, continuing north as a <b>local</b> <b>road</b> through the town and into the Chapleau Crown Game Preserve, the largest game preserve in the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> are {{classified}} {{by the road}} authority for the area as local primary, local secondary or <b>local</b> tertiary <b>roads.</b> The <b>local</b> primary <b>roads</b> are numbered from L1000 - L4999. <b>Local</b> secondary <b>roads</b> are numbered from L5000 - L8999. <b>Local</b> tertiary <b>roads</b> are numbered from L10001 - L89999, with the first four digits representing the local primary or secondary road {{to which it is}} connected. <b>Local</b> tertiary <b>roads</b> which are unrelated to a local primary or secondary road are numbered from L90000 upwards. <b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> are divided into segments of two to three kilometres maximum. For this reason they serve a limited function as the applicable L road number generally ends at junctions with other <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> The numbering systems are not widely known to the public, however, they must be made available to the public on request in accordance with section 10 of the Roads Act 1993.|$|R
50|$|The Staatsstraße 2055 (Dießen - Greifenberg) {{runs through}} Schondorf. Into this Staatsstraße the Staatsstraße 2346 lead at the railway {{crossing}} {{on the northern}} outskirts. The remaining streets are <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> All <b>local</b> <b>roads</b> are Zones 30.|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> {{vary greatly}} in quality, from wide urban streets to very narrow, rural lanes, known as boreens in Ireland. There are {{three types of}} local road: <b>local</b> primary (<b>local</b> <b>roads</b> wider than four metres), <b>local</b> {{secondary}} (<b>local</b> <b>roads</b> narrower than four metres) and local tertiary (cul-de-sacs and other minor <b>roads).</b> <b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> are subject to a general speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour (km/h) or 50 km/h in built-up areas. These roads, with sharp turns and low visibility, barely wide enough for two cars to pass each other, have the same speed limit as many sections of dual carriageways, with physical segregation of and multiple lanes for each direction, only very light turns and excellent visibility.|$|R
5|$|M-221 {{is a short}} state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula (UP) of the US state of Michigan that connects M-28 with the community of Brimley and Brimley State Park. The highway was originally part of M-28 until the 1940s when it was briefly a <b>local</b> <b>road.</b> It has been a state highway again since it was designated as M-221 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoreline}} of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} {{surrounded by a}} paved road, which is atypical for a lake shoreline. Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development {{has occurred in the}} vicinity of the lake. A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale <b>local</b> <b>road</b> flooding.|$|E
5|$|With the Hudson River to its west, US4 heads northward once again, leaving NY197 behind. Not far after Fort Edward, {{the highway}} enters Hudson Falls, where {{it turns into}} a <b>local</b> <b>road.</b> There, it heads through downtown, {{intersecting}} with NY196, and soon afterwards, NY254. US4 makes a sudden curve to the northeast, heading through the rural regions for the rest of its length.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2013, the NZTA {{has used}} the One Network Road Classification (ONRC) system to {{classify}} state highways and <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> There are five categories for state highways, with an additional sixth category (Access) used only by <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> The categories are as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Several <b>local</b> <b>roads</b> and {{facilitate}} internal communication.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, the Florida Department of Transportation {{slowed down}} the {{addition}} of new state roads and began to classify roads into primary, secondary, and <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> Primary roads {{would continue to be}} state-maintained, while Secondary roads would have an S before the number, and would only be state-maintained during a construction project. <b>Local</b> <b>roads</b> would be completely removed from the system.|$|R
5|$|After {{passing the}} {{community}} of Rockhurst, the route intersects Assembly Point Road, another <b>local</b> <b>road</b> serving a minor peninsula and Assembly Point on its tip. Past this point, NY9L tightly parallels the southern shore of Lake George southwest into the town of Lake George. The route {{comes to an end}} at a junction with US9 and NY9N south of the village of Lake George at the southwestern extent of the lake.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The <b>local</b> <b>Road</b> 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|In Elbridge, NY321 intersects {{with several}} county routes, {{including}} Halfway Road (CR107; former NY368), a connector highway {{leading to the}} hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a <b>local</b> <b>road</b> that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E

5|$|M-27 has the <b>local</b> <b>road</b> name of Main Street in Cheboygan and Straits Highway {{outside of}} the city. State Street (US23) and Main Street (M-27) form the two major streets in the Cheboygan street grid. The main {{downtown}} businesses are located along Main Street south to the city limits. The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E
5|$|NY252A {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33A and NY386 in Chili Center, a hamlet {{located within the}} town of Chili. The route proceeded eastward from the commercial community and passed through largely residential neighborhoods on its way across Chili. As it approached the Greater Rochester International Airport, the homes were gradually replaced by industrial factories and warehouses. It crossed the Rochester and Southern Railroad {{in the community of}} Maplewood just before intersecting Beahan Road, a <b>local</b> <b>road</b> that serves as the western extent of the airport property.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route38 (NY38) is a north–south {{state highway}} in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. Its {{southern}} terminus {{is at an}} intersection with NY96 {{in the town of}} Owego in Tioga County. The northern terminus is at a junction with NY104A in the town of Sterling in Cayuga County. NY38 is a two-lane <b>local</b> <b>road</b> for most of its length. The route is the main access road to parts of Auburn, Dryden, Newark Valley and Port Byron. It passes through mountainous terrain in Tioga and Cortland counties, but the terrain levels out as it heads through the Finger Lakes area and Cayuga County.|$|E

5|$|Route163 begins {{north of}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route46 and Roy Ace Road {{in the community}} of Delaware. The highway heads to the north along Lackawanna Road. Route163 passes several residences to the north and a short stretch of homes to the south. There is a short intersection with an unnamed <b>local</b> <b>road.</b> After that intersection, Route163 passes a truck stop that is visible on both Route46, which parallels to the south, and the short state highway. There is another short truck stop before an intersection with a return ramp to Route46. Route163 officially terminates at a barricaded dead-end near Hemlock Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|Route172 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} {{with the local}} lanes of Route18 {{in the city of}} New Brunswick. The highway heads northward and passes through the Douglass Campus of Rutgers University. Route172 then intersects with a <b>local</b> <b>road,</b> which serves the purposes of the university. The highway then progresses towards County Route617 (CR617; Ryders Lane), which heads southward from a roundabout with Route172. Route172 then turns to the west along George Street. After the roundabout, the highway intersects with Nichol Avenue and Route172 continues into downtown New Brunswick. There, the highway intersects with Bishop Street, and terminates at an intersection with Commercial Avenue and CR527 continues along George Street, the right-of-way.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} place names in Chadderton {{suggests}} that the ancient Britons once inhabited the area. Remains of Roman roads have been discovered running through the town, and the <b>local</b> <b>road</b> name Streetbridge {{suggests that the}} Romans once marched along it on a path which {{may have led to}} Blackstone Edge. Relics found at a tumulus in Chadderton Fold date from the Early Middle Ages, probably from the early period of Anglo-Saxon England, when Angles settled in the area and Chadderton emerged as a manor of the hundred of Salford.|$|E
