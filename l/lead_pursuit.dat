50|$|The {{primary purpose}} for <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> {{is to provide}} closure, even when chasing a faster opponent. The high AOT {{presented}} during <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> allows the attacker to quickly decrease the forward, lateral, and vertical separation between aircraft, simply by traveling a shorter path. However, <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> causes the AOT to increase at a rapid rate. This causes the closure rate to increase as well, and, {{in an attempt to}} prevent an overshoot, the attacker will have to pull an increasingly tighter turn upon nearing the defender.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> is {{used during}} gun attacks, because the fast motion of combat {{requires}} that the aircraft's cannons be aimed {{at a point in}} space ahead of the defender, where the enemy will be when the bullets arrive. This is called [...] "leading the target". <b>Lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> presents the attacker with difficulty in maintaining sight of the opponent, as the nose of the attacking aircraft becomes an obstruction to the pilot's view.|$|E
50|$|A {{company called}} <b>Lead</b> <b>Pursuit</b> {{which has been}} formed around many known names of the Falcon modding {{community}} has gained a license from Atari to continue Falcon 4.0 development. <b>Lead</b> <b>Pursuit,</b> Inc. has been updating the game with new patches, considerably enhancing the functionality of the simulation, particularly in the multiplayer aspect which now allows smooth close-up formation flying for players across the world. Falcon 4.0: Allied Force was released on 28 June 2005 and is largely a compilation, and unification, of existing community-made modifications of the original Falcon 4.0.|$|E

5000|$|A lag {{displacement}} roll, {{also called}} a [...] "lag roll", is a maneuver {{used to reduce}} the angle off tail by bringing the attacker from <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> to pure, or even lag pursuit. The maneuver is performed by rolling up {{and away from the}} turn, then, when the aircraft's lift vector is aligned with the defender, pulling back on the stick, bringing the fighter back into the turn. This maneuver helps prevent an overshoot caused by the high AOT of <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit,</b> and {{can also be used to}} increase the distance between aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Turn circle geometry. Even though {{depicted}} as flying {{at the same}} turn rate and turn radius, closure occurs during <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> and then reverses during lag pursuit, with the greatest nose/tail separation {{at the moment the}} attacker pulls lead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> is {{the basis}} of all the dogfights since the World War II era. It {{describes}} when a chasing pilot has to gun down the bandit (or the target) it is following. It is the most common way of air-to-air dogfight where many a times pilots feel it to be the most natural way to hit a target.|$|E
5000|$|... "Anomaly" [...] (2003), {{episode of}} Star Trek: Enterprise written by Mike Sussman.

During the episode Tucker reports to sickbay with an injury, {{where he is}} offered a treatment that uses Aldebaran mud leeches. The regimen requires {{the placement of the}} creatures on the chest and abdomen, and that the patient sleep supine to avoid angering them. But Tucker declines the treatment.|$|R
5000|$|In 1847 Gilbert & Co. erected new granite-front warerooms at 400 Washington street, {{opposite}} Boylston Market. According {{to their}} {{entry in the}} The Stranger's Guide in the City of Boston published in 1848 the new facilities cost about $20,000 and together with two buildings in the rear occupied over 8000 sq ft, the whole being powered and heated by steam, and in a brief and not entirely reliable retrospective of the Boston piano industry published by the Boston Globe in 1915, Arthur Brayley described that the warerooms were connected by bridges with the factory across the yard, and an underground passage connected the machine shop with the boiler room, [...] "which {{was said to be}} a refuge for runaway slaves". The sketch of the firm for Edwin Freedley's <b>Leading</b> <b>Pursuits</b> and <b>Leading</b> Men of 1856 described that they manufactured every part of their pianos except the cases on their own premises, and although their operations were conducted in from twenty-five to thirty rooms they went on [...] "with the most perfect order and system." [...] The 1848 article also stated the firm employed about sixty workers, and had manufactured between 3,000 and 4,000 pianos, upwards 500 of them with the Aeolian attachment.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the release}} of Falcon 4.0: Allied Force was meant {{to raise funds for}} a new version, dubbed [...] "Falcon 5" [...] to be developed, nothing eventuated from it.

[...] Further {{development}} on the original Falcon 4.0 source code has continued under two development communities: FreeFalcon and Benchmark Sims (BMS).|$|E
50|$|An {{attacker}} in <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> is {{well within}} the defender's rear view. Unless the defender has enough of a speed advantage to escape by relaxing the turn and dropping into a shallow dive, the defender will likely turn sharply {{in an effort to}} increase the AOT, forcing the attacker to turn even harder, to overshoot, or to perform a maneuver out of the horizontal plane to compensate.|$|E
50|$|Pure pursuit {{is a type}} of pursuit curve used in aerial {{combat in}} which an {{aircraft}} pursues another aircraft by pointing its nose directly towards it. This is in contrast with <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit,</b> in which the chasing aircraft points ahead of the aircraft it is following (typically used when attempting a gun attack) and lag pursuit, in which the chasing aircraft points behind the aircraft it is following (typically used when attempting a rear-aspect missile attack).|$|E

5000|$|Another highly fictionalized {{version of}} Johnson's story {{appeared}} in Charles Bronson's 1981 movie Death Hunt.

Furthermore, bush pilot Wop May is represented as a Royal Canadian Air Force captain, Hank Tucker, who is shot down and killed by the posse after Tucker wildly shoots up members of the posse.|$|R
50|$|Falcon 4.0: Allied Force (F4AF) is an F-16 based combat flight {{simulator}} released by <b>Lead</b> <b>Pursuit</b> on 28 June 2005. The game is based around a realistic simulation of the Block 50/52 F-16 Fighting Falcon {{in a series}} of missions in the Balkans. The game engine is based on the source code of the original 1998 Falcon 4.0 from MicroProse, and consists largely of a collection of improvements from the official patches and extensive Falcon modding community. Allied Force also introduced several major new features and significant improvements in realism and stability.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit,</b> pure pursuit is used {{to provide}} closure. However, closure is not as rapid, nor is the rate of {{increase}} in AOT. This is not as effective against a faster moving opponent, so the attacker may need to accelerate to maintain pure pursuit. Pure pursuit is used when acquiring a missile lock. It both places the attacker further aft of the defender and presents the defender with the smallest amount of surface area to see. This complicates evasive action, since only the front of the attacking aircraft is in view.|$|E
50|$|An out-of-plane {{maneuver}} enhances this effect, by diverting {{the fighter}} {{into a new}} plane of travel. Increasing the pitch or slice can quickly provide a change in speed, which can just as quickly be reversed by returning to the original plane of travel. Out-of-plane maneuvers are not only used to provide a reduction in turn radius, but also causes the fighter to fly a longer path {{in relation to the}} direction of travel. A maneuver such as a high Yo-Yo is used to slow closure and to bring the fighter into lag pursuit, while a low Yo-Yo is used to increase closure and to bring the fighter into <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thomas James Mathias {{followed}} Coleridge’s <b>lead</b> in The <b>Pursuits</b> of Literature, a poem in the 18th-Century satiric tradition, but {{takes a step}} {{farther than}} Coleridge by claiming that a specific passage made the novel indictable under law. The passage, found in Chapter Seven Volume II, discusses {{an interpretation of the}} Bible as too lewd for youth to read.|$|R

50|$|Players do {{combat in}} mostly space {{missions}} {{using one of}} four Colonial Navy starfighters. Each starfighter carries a certain combination of energy weapons, missiles or torpedoes, {{and a number of}} units are equipped with nonlethal EMP cannons. The player can also use countermeasures to shake off inbound enemy missiles or use a grapple gun to capture targets of importance. The game introduces the ability to upgrade the starfighters' attributes in terms of engine power, maneuverability, shield capacity, and afterburner duration through points collected after every mission. The game's heads-up display also introduces a <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> indicator to assist the player in targeting the enemy with cannon shots.|$|E
50|$|The game is the {{ultimate}} development in the Falcon series from Spectrum HoloByte that began in 1984. HoloByte had acquired MicroProse in 1993, and started using that name {{for all of its}} titles in 1996. After MicroProse was purchased by Hasbro, official development ended. In April 2000, a source code leak allowed continued development of the game by members of the gaming community, including bug fixes and new campaigns. Many of these additions were collected by <b>Lead</b> <b>Pursuit,</b> which arranged an official license of the original code base from the owner Atari; these were published as Falcon 4.0: Allied Force on 28 June 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{inside the}} defender's bubble, the {{attacker}} {{will be in}} <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> and may have {{an opportunity for a}} lucky [...] "snapshot" [...] hit. If the attacker can maneuver onto the defender's flight path before an overshoot occurs, the attacker will be able to stop or reverse closure rate. The most desirable position is, following the defender's flight path, a distance equal to one turn radius behind the opponent. This position, from which the attacker will be able to safely maintain command of the fight, is termed the [...] "control point." [...] The control point lies in the heart of an imaginary, cone-shaped area, called the [...] "control zone," [...] and it is within this zone that the attacker will have both sufficient time and range to react to the defender's countermeasures.|$|E
40|$|In 1900 US {{business}} corporations were {{dominated by}} plutocratic family owners, while British and French quoted companies more commonly divorced ownership from control. 'Democratic' corporate governance rules explain some of Europe's precocity and London's exceptional listing requirement of large free floats was an important initial factor in manufacturing. Later in the twentieth century, the United States overtook France by further divorcing ownership from control. Business historians should direct their efforts to understanding why Britain was an early pioneer, with persistently wide shareholding, why America took decades to catch up, and why other countries did not build on their earlier <b>lead.</b> The <b>pursuit</b> of alternative (largely imagined) histories of national ownership differences could usefully be curtailed. ...|$|R
5000|$|... 56th Division {{returned}} to Italy on 17 July 1944 and {{was assigned to}} V Corps for {{the attack on the}} Gothic Line (Operation Olive). When the offensive opened on 25 August 1944, V Corps was still moving up, and 56th Division was its reserve, but its artillery was sent on ahead to strengthen the Corps artillery. Once the Corps had broken into the German positions, 56th Division was used to widen the breach on 1 September, and then on 3 September to <b>lead</b> the <b>pursuit,</b> taking Monte Maggiore before opposition increased at the Gemmano-Coriano high ground. There followed hard methodical fighting to clear the Germans off successive ridge lines (the Battle of San Marino).|$|R

5000|$|An {{attacker}} {{is confronted}} with three possible ways {{to pursue an}} enemy, {{all of which are}} vital during chase. [...] "Lag pursuit" [...] happens in a turn when the nose of the attacker’s aircraft points behind an enemy’s tail. Lag pursuit allows an attacker to increase or maintain range without overshooting. [...] "Lead pursuit" [...] in a turn occurs when the nose of the attacking aircraft points ahead of the enemy. <b>Lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> is used to decrease the distance between aircraft, and during gun attacks where the cannons must be aimed, not at where the defender is, but where he will be when the bullets get there. [...] "Pure pursuit" [...] happens when the nose of the attacker points directly at the defender. Pure pursuit is when most missiles will be fired, and is the hardest position to maintain. These are known as pursuit curves.|$|E
5000|$|To {{prevent an}} overshoot, an {{attacker}} in <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> {{may need to}} correct with an out-of-plane maneuver. If the lateral separation is excessively high, the attacker will probably use a displacement roll. However, if the lateral separation is low enough, the attacker will likely use a high Yo-Yo. The high Yo-Yo defense {{can be a good}} tactic in these situations. The maneuver is performed when the attacker rolls away from the turn to begin the correction. The defender will begin to relax the turn by easing off of the stick, called [...] "unloading", which causes both turn radius and speed to increase, restoring the fighter's lost energy. If the defender maintains the same angle of bank, the subtle maneuver will be very difficult for the attacker to spot. When the attacker completes the out-of-plane maneuver, the defending fighter has regained some of its energy. This allows the defender to, once again, turn harder into the attack, regaining an angular advantage over the higher energy attacker. If the attacker is surprised by the maneuver, a high Yo-Yo defense might even cause an overshoot.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the one-on-one aerial combat encounter are generated {{under the control}} of specified guidance laws. Given an initial state, the vehicle and atmospheric characteristics, and the guidance laws, the aerial combat encounter is simulated by forward integration of the two vehicles' motions. The development of a combat guidance law which converts positional advantage into an improved firing opportunity is reported. A combination of lag, line of sight, and <b>lead</b> <b>pursuit</b> steering paths are followed in the guidance law. The law is based on steering error, target angle-off and the relative velocities. It readily is automated either as an onboard aid to manned aircraft pilots or as a combat guidance law for unmanned vehicles...|$|E
