40|$|Most {{research}} on the interpretability of machine learning systems focuses {{on the development of}} a more rigorous notion of interpretability. I suggest that {{a better understanding of the}} deficiencies of the intuitive notion of interpretability is needed as well. I show that visualization enables but also impedes intuitive interpretability, as it presupposes <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>technical</b> pre-interpretation: dimensionality reduction and regularization. Furthermore, I argue that the use of positive concepts to emulate the distributed semantic structure of machine learning models introduces a significant human bias into the model. As a consequence, I suggest that, if intuitive interpretability is needed, singular representations of internal model states should be avoided.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{the large amount of}} {{information}} about the events occurred on 15 th February 2012 off the coast of Southern India the fragmented and unverifiable data coming from various sources make very difficult to carry out <b>technical</b> <b>surveys</b> having legal validity. It is obvious that both the expert of each party and the assessor need to have access to all documents and exhibits. In the Italian judicial system and legal proceedings both assessors and experts of the claimant and of the defendant take part in the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> process because the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> can have probative force and tend to prove a matter at issue. In the case of the jailed Italian marines issue, the unilateral decision of the Indian authorities not to allow the Italian forensic experts (the experts of the defendant) {{to take part in the}} <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> process preventing them in this way from carrying out the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> together with the Indian experts (the experts of the claimant) violates the principles of a fair process. The Italian forensic experts were allowed to be just “observers ” of the survey and were excluded from decision-making. Against this background, I think that it is useful to carry out a technical analysis of the events based on the available information reported in the press, being aware that some elements may have been misrepresented and misreported in the available sources. In {{spite of the}} mentioned shortcoming, the method I used for the analysis is valid. This means that if one day you have access to verifiable evidences and exhibits coming from reliable sources other than those I took into consideration, it will be possible to replace the ones I used with the more reliable ones and repeat the analysis and the survey without changing the methodological structure of my analysis. Each <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> follows a reliable method of inquiry and analysis.

40|$|Abstract: The widely {{automated}} {{analysis and}} evaluation of measurement processes is a still unsolved task in <b>technical</b> <b>surveying.</b> Complex measurement systems, increasing time pressure {{and more and more}} operators with non-academic background require the development of new strategies for a comprehensive and user-friendly presentation and explanation of quality information as part of the process. To solve these tasks, a possible way is the application of knowledge-based systems. The paper describes the development of a knowledge-based system for the automated evaluation of the quality of free stationing processes. One special focus is set on the complex knowledge acquisition and evaluation phase. A software prototype is presented that processes quality relevant information from hybrid sources and automati-cally reports the evaluation and explanation to the user. 1. AUTOMATION OF TECHNICAL SURVEYING PROCESSES- A DILEMMA When we look at the typical surveying processes taking place in many areas of <b>technical</b> <b>surveying,</b> we see reached a quite high degree of automation in data acquisition. But when we consider the whole process, including project preparation and data processing and evaluation, real life <b>technical</b> <b>surveying</b> processes are still far from being automated.

40|$|Background. The large {{increase}} {{in the size of}} patent collections has led to the need of efficient search strategies. But the development of advanced text-mining applications dedicated to patents of the biomedical field remains rare, in particular {{to address the needs of}} the pharmaceutical & biotech industry, which intensively uses patent libraries for competitive intelligence and drug development. Methods. We describe here the development of an advanced retrieval engine to search information in patent collections in the field of medicinal chemistry. We investigate and combine different strategies and evaluate their respective impact on the performance of the search engine applied to various search tasks, which covers the putatively most frequent search behaviours of intellectual property officers in medical chemistry: 1) a prior art search task; 2) a <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task; and 3) a variant of the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task, sometimes called known-item search task, where a single patent is targeted. Results The optimal tuning of our engine resulted in a top-precision of 6. 76 % for the prior art search task, 23. 28 % for the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task and 46. 02 % for the variant of the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task. We observed that co-citation boosting was an appropriate strategy to improve prior art search tasks, while IPC classification of queries was improving retrieval effectiveness for <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> tasks. Surprisingly, the use of the full body of the patent was always detrimental for search effectiveness. It was also observed that normalizing biomedical entities using curated dictionaries had simply no impact on the search tasks we evaluate. The search engine was finally implemented as a web-application within Novartis Pharma. The application is briefly described in the report. Conclusions We have presented the development of a search engine dedicated to patent search, based on state of the art methods applied to patent corpora. We have shown that a proper tuning of the system to adapt to the various search tasks clearly increases the effectiveness of the system. We conclude that different search tasks demand different information retrieval engines' settings in order to yield optimal end-user retrieval...|$|R
