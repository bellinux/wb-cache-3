40|$|AbstractWith the {{implementation}} of environmental protection, sustainable development and conservation-oriented policies, components and parts of thin-walled <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> have gained increasing application in the aircraft and automotive industries because of their advantages: easily achieving forming and manufacturing process at low cost and in a short time. The current research on <b>welded</b> <b>tube</b> plastic forming is mainly concentrated on tube internal high-pressure forming, tube bending forming, and tube spinning forming. The focuses are on the material properties and characterization of <b>welded</b> <b>tubes,</b> finite element modeling for <b>welded</b> <b>tube</b> forming, and inhomogeneous deformation behavior and the mechanism and rules of deformation coordination in <b>welded</b> <b>tube</b> plastic forming. This paper summarizes the research progress in <b>welded</b> <b>tube</b> plastic forming from these aspects. Finally, {{with a focus on}} the urgent demand of the aviation, aerospace and automotive industries for high-strength and light-weight tubes, this paper discusses the development trends and challenges in the theory and technology of <b>welded</b> <b>tube</b> plastic forming in the future. Among them, laser tailor-welded technology will find application in the manufacture of high-strength steel tubes. Tube-end forming technology, such as tube flaring and flanging technology, will expand its application in <b>welded</b> <b>tubes.</b> Therefore, future studies will focus on the FE modeling regarding how to consider effects of welding on residual stresses, welding distortions and microstructure, the inhomogeneous deformation and coordination mechanism of the plastic forming process of tailor-welded tubes, and some end-forming processes of <b>welded</b> <b>tubes,</b> and more comprehensive research on the forming mechanism and limit of <b>welded</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes.</b> Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions. Moment - curvature and curvature - ovalisation relationships are presented and compared with theoretical prediction...|$|R

40|$|Thin walled {{calandria}} tubes for pressurised {{heavy water}} reactors are manufactured either by seam welding of Zircaloy- 4 sheets or by seamless route. In the present study, {{the effect of}} processing on the critical properties such as texture, microstructure, hydriding behaviour and residual stress for both the routes {{as well as the}} mechanical anisotropy developed due to seam welding are investigated. The properties of the seam <b>welded</b> <b>tube</b> in the fusion and adjoining region are markedly different from the base material and from the seamless tube. Residual stress measurements indicate that heat affected zone (HAZ) of seam <b>welded</b> <b>tubes</b> have longitudinal tensile residual stress and the seamless tubes have uniform compressive stress along the circumference. The phase transition in the presence of residual stresses due to thermal gradient is found to modify the texture in the HAZ. The hydride orientation and mechanical anisotropy in these regions are found to be dependent on the texture of the material. © Elsevie...|$|R
