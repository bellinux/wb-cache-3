40|$|The {{legislation}} and the jurisprudence provide many {{cases where the}} (continued) existence or performance of an agreement depends on the (continued) existence or performance of another agreement. If a consumer revokes a purchase contract, {{he is no longer}} bound to <b>linked</b> <b>credit</b> <b>agreements.</b> The termination of a purchase agreement between the supplier and the lessor causes the end of the financial leasing agreement between the lessor and the lessee due to the disappearance of its object. In the Laundry judgment of 14 March 2008, the Court of Cassation judged that the termination of a contract can eliminate the cause of a second contract retroactively, thereby bringing about its nullity. This research maps the different occurences of "linked contracts" and identifies how these are dealt with in the {{legislation and}} the jurisprudence. It investigates to what extent the parties can modulate the (inter) dependence of agreements through clauses. It draws up a general framework for the terminology, the foundations, the conditions of application and the legal consequences for linked contracts. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} possible impact certain {{requirements of the}} National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (hereafter NCA) has on reckless credit lending by credit providers. The dissertation will identify problem areas created by {{the provisions of the}} NCA and the impact thereof on security or partial performances <b>linked</b> to the <b>credit</b> <b>agreement.</b> “Reckless <b>credit</b> lending” used to be a new terminology introduced in the credit market to increase consumer spending, but it is currently a well-known practice in the credit industry. The NCA aims at protecting consumers, especially against present everincreasing reckless-credit practices. However, certain provisions relating to reckless credit are mostly ambiguous and vague. The NCA is silent on {{the development and implementation of}} guidelines and policies relating to the prevention of reckless credit and the consequences of such an order on security and/or performances (whether there was partial or full performance). This study will discuss the prevention and consequence of reckless credit by referring to the NCA, articles written by various authors, as well as court decisions where related concerns were addresses by the judges concerned with this issue. Although the provisions stipulated in the amended NCA improve the position of the consumer in the credit market, the legislature should have drafted certain applicable provisions with more care and detail. A more detailed draft could circumvent vagueness in particular areas of concern. Private LawLL. M...|$|R

(Commercial Law) The National Credit Act {{replaced}} the <b>Credit</b> <b>Agreements</b> Act and the Usury Act and introduced new concepts and classifications with new parameters to South African credit law.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to present the most {{important}} Polish regulations concerning consumer credits. They are contained in the Act on Consumer Credit which was adopted on 20 th July 2001. Its aim was to approximate Polish law with the EU requirements predicted in the Council Directive 87 / 102 /EEC of 22 December 1986 on consumer credit. As a result the Polish legislator regulates the most important aspects of such <b>credit</b> <b>agreements.</b> First of all, the <b>credit</b> <b>agreement</b> is defined. This definition is quite wide – “credit agreement means an agreement whereby a creditor grants or promises to grant to a consumer a credit in any form”. However, it is narrowed by the list of exceptions which {{are discussed in the}} paper. Secondly, the form and content of <b>credit</b> <b>agreements</b> are regulated (with special care of the questions of total credit costs and real annual percentage rate). Thirdly, consumers are protected in relation to bills of exchange and cheques and also {{in the case of the}} assignment of the creditors rights under a <b>credit</b> <b>agreement</b> to a third person. Fourthly, the Act predicts consumer rights to discharge his obligations under a <b>credit</b> <b>agreement</b> before the time fixed by it and to withdraw from the agreement. Finally, the provisions of the Act are binding on the creditor and he cannot exclude or limit consumer rights in the agreement. One the whole it can be said that Polish consumers are quite well protected against the unfair practices of different creditors. Now, everything depends on their readiness to use their rights as creditors can try to diminish the role of the provisions of the Act. consumer <b>credit,</b> <b>credit</b> <b>agreement,</b> total costs of the credit, real annual percentage rate, consumer rights to withdraw from the agreement and to discharge his obligations under a <b>credit</b> <b>agreement</b> before the time fixed by it...|$|R

To examine this reporting bias, we distinguish between “published” and “non-published” announcements in Australia.
