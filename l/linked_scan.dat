40|$|Patients with methylmalonic aciduria have an {{excessive}} intramitochondrial accumulation of acylcoenzyme A compounds that {{may reduce the}} availability of free coenzyme A (CoA) for normal metabolic requirements, producing profound metabolic disturbances. Giving carnitine to a patient with methylmalonic aciduria produced an increase in hippurate excretion (an index of intramitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and CoA availability), a large increase in short chain urinary acylcarnitines, {{and a reduction in}} excretion of methylmalonate and methylcitrate.

40|$|A {{series of}} eight novel bidentate ligands, {{designed}} {{for use in the}} construction of nickel-selective molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP's), have been prepared. The synthetic pathway was established by retrosynthetic analysis of the target molecules to the readily available precursors, pyridine- 2 -carbaldehyde (or 6 -methylpyridine- 2 -carbaldehyde) and ethyl bromoacetate. The ligands were designed to contain an allyl group for co-polymerisation and amine and pyridyl nitrogen donors, located to permit the formation of 5 -membered nickel chelates. The eight novel ligands and their respective precursors were characterized by elemental (high-resolution MS) and spectroscopic (IR and ¹H and ¹³C NMR) analysis. High resolution electron-impact mass spectrometry has also been used, together with B/E <b>linked</b> <b>scan</b> data, to explore the fragmentation patterns of selected ligands. The various nickel(ll) complexes were analyzed using spectroscopic techniques and, in some cases, elemental analysis; computer modelling has also been used to explore conformational effects and complex stability. Numerous MIP's, containing nickel(II) complexes of the bidentate ligands, have been prepared, using ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker, azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AlBN) as the polymerization initiator and MeOH as the porogenic solvent. The template nickel(II) ions were leached out with conc. HCI, and the nickel(II) selectivity [in the presence of Fe(Ill) ] of the nickel-imprinted polymers was examined by ICP-MS analysis.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of specially prepared salicylaldehyde benzyl ethers with the activated alkenes, methyl acrylate or acrylonitrile, {{in the presence}} of the catalyst, DABCO, has afforded Baylis-Hillman products, which have been subjected to conjugate addition with either piperidine or benzylamine. Hydrogenolysis of these conjugate addition products {{in the presence of}} a palladium-on-carbon catalyst has been shown to afford the corresponding 3 -substituted coumarins, while treatment of O-benzylated Baylis-Hillman adducts with HCl or HI afforded the corresponding 3 -(halomethyl) coumarins directly, in up to 94 %. The 3 -(halomethyl) coumarins have also been obtained in excellent yields (up to 98 %) and even more conveniently, by treating the unprotected Baylis-Hillman products with HCl in a mixture of AcOH and Ac 2 O, obtained from tert-butyl acrylate and various salicylaldehydes. The generality of an established route to the synthesis of coumarins via an intramolecular Baylis-Hillman reaction, involving the use of salicylaldehyde acrylate esters in the presence of DABCO, has also been demonstrated. Reactions between the 3 -(halomethyl) coumarins and various nitrogen and carbon nucleophiles have been shown to proceed with a high degree of regioselectivity at the exocyclic allylic centre to afford 3 -substituted coumarin products. The electronimpact mass spectra of selected coumarin derivatives have been investigated using high-resolution and B/E <b>linked</b> <b>scan</b> data. Fragmentation pathways have been proposed and fragmentation modes associated with different coumarin-containing analogues have been compared. A series of coumarin-containing analogues of ritonavir (a clinically useful HIV- 1 protease inhibitor) have been prepared and characterized.

The use of fast atom bom-bardment mass spectrometry and <b>linked</b> <b>scanning</b> at con-stant magnetic (B) to electric (E) field ratio identified the acylcarnitine as propionylcarnitine in patients with pro-pionic acidemia.

Loss of SO 2 from the molecular ion is observed for all substrates, but only in the case of 1, 1 -bis(benzenesulphonyl) cyclopropane is this followed by loss of the second SO 2 unit; the first loss of SO 2 is probably accompanied by rearrangement since the fragmentation pattern of [M − SO 2]+˙ ions from this compound is different than that of the isobaric molecular ions of 1 -phenyl- 1 -(benzenesulphonyl) cyclopropane...|$|R

Consideration of such diagrams leads to an understanding of the noted phenomena and allows the derivation of an expression for the effective parent ion resolution. Furthermore, the approach predicts that parent ion resolution varies during constant neutral loss scans and that the relatively poor resolution (and its variation) can provide particularly misleading data.
