40|$|The {{growth in}} single-person {{households}} is a pervasive behavioral {{phenomenon in the}} United States in the post-war period. In this paper we investigate determinants of the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone,</b> using 1970 data across states for single men and women ages 25 to 34 and for elderly widows. Income level {{appears to be a}} major determinant of the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> The estimated cross-state equations track about three-quarters of the increase in the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> between 1950 â€” 1976 and suggest that income growth has been the principal identified influence. Other variables found to affect (positively) the propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> include mobility, schooling level, and for young people a measure of social climate; non-whites appear to have a somewhat lower propensity to <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh <b>lived</b> <b>alone</b> in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E

Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to complain to Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng {{spent most of his}} free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged: even though he could not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed {{to the members of the}} Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of.

The Omak area has a relatively high percentage of people of American Indian and Mexican ancestries; there were over 80 American Indians and over 535 Mexican immigrants, with a combined percentage of 28 percent of residents.

5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and <b>lived</b> <b>alone</b> in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The notch first {{appears in}} {{recorded}} history in 1784, when an expedition led by Jeremy Belknap camped in the notch before ascending {{to the summit}} of Mount Washington through Huntington Ravine. Pinkham Notch was far more isolated than neighboring Crawford Notch; as a result, the first settler of Pinkham Notch came in 1827, 43years after habitation of Crawford Notch. The first settler, Hayes Copp, built a homestead in the then-uninhabited area, near where the Dolly Copp campground stands today. Copp and his wife <b>lived</b> <b>alone</b> in the wilderness until Daniel Pinkham completed the first road through the notch between in 1836, finally providing {{a link between the}} Copp homestead and civilization. In 1851, a railroad was built to Gorham, and a hotel, the Glen House, was constructed to accommodate passengers. Mount Washington was the main attraction in the area; a bridle path was constructed from the Glen House to hotels on the summit, which was later improved into what would become the Mount Washington Auto Road. Completion of the road in 1861 led to a massive increase in tourism.|$|E

40|$|Describes {{the trends}} in living alone and {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} people who <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> Introduction <b>Living</b> <b>alone</b> is increasingly on the public radar. One in four Australian households is a lone-person household, and rates have increased sharply since the 1970 s. Throughout the Western world lone-person households have become increasingly common, and this trend is spreading to non-Western countries. In some quarters these developments have been interpreted as signifying a decline of commitment to family living, increasing social fragmentation and a rise in loneliness. For others, the growth in living alone has been celebrated as reflecting the greater choice that people have in their living arrangements and lifestyle. But to appreciate the meaning and significance of living alone we must understand more about the make-up of those living alone. Who is living alone? Which social groups are driving this change? We also must understand more {{about the nature of}} living alone, its duration, where it fits into the life course and its links with social connection and wellbeing. Do people tend to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> for short periods, or is it a long-term arrangement? To what extent do people choose to <b>live</b> <b>alone</b> and like living alone? How lonely are those who <b>live</b> <b>alone?</b> Why do they commence living alone and why do they stop? It is only when we can answer these questions that we can begin to understand its significance. This paper describes the trends in living alone and describes the characteristics of people who <b>live</b> <b>alone.</b> It will show that within this single category of "living alone" there is tremendous diversity and that living alone has very different meanings within the various sub-groups. It will show that any characterisation of living alone as "fragmentation" or as "freedom" is simplistic. To explore the nature of living alone, a second paper will look at how long people <b>live</b> <b>alone,</b> when they <b>live</b> <b>alone,</b> and how moving into and out of living alone arrangements affects the wellbeing and social connection of those living alone.  ...|$|R
