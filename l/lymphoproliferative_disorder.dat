40|$|AbstractPost-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> {{comprise}} {{a spectrum of}} reactive to neoplastic lymphoid proliferations that occur in organ transplant recipients {{as a result of}} the iatrogenic immuno-suppression. They usually appear within 1 year after the transplant, although they can sometimes occur after a long interval. Most cases are B-cell proliferations that are driven by Epstein-Barr virus, and the major types are 1. early lesions (plasmacytic hyperplasia and infectious mononucleosis-like lesion), which are usually polyclonal; 2. polymorphic post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders,</b> which are usually oligoclonal or monoclonal; and 3. monomorphic post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders,</b> which are morphologically identical to conventional lymphomas, are monoclonal, and commonly exhibit structural alterations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Early lesions and a proportion of polymorphic post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> regress with reduction in immunosuppressants, whereas almost all monomorphic post-transplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> progress and require lymphoma-type treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background. Chronic <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{considered}} rare in Oriental patients and {{are thought to}} constitute only 2 % of all leukemias in these patients, compared to 20 - 30 % in Western patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of Chinese patients with chronic <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> to define the frequency and spectrum of these disorders. Methods. A consecutive series of Chinese patients with leukemia and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> seen at two regional hospitals in Hong Kong were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of chronic <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> was based on morphologic and immunologic criteria proposed by the French- American-British Cooperative Study Group. Results. Sixty-four Chinese patients with chronic <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> were identified, and these patients constituted 19 % {{of a total of}} 342 cases of leukemia diagnosed in 3 years. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common form, occurring at a frequency of 12. 5 % of all leukemias. The clinicopathologic features of these patients were similar to those of Western patients, except that Chinese patients tended to present with more advanced (Rai's Stages III and IV; Binet's Stage C) and bulky (splenomegaly > 9 cm) disease, and expressed λ light chain about six times more frequently. Other chronic <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> identified in this study included prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, large granular lymphocyte leukemia, and Sezary syndrome. The authors did not identify any case of human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I-related <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> within the study period. Conclusion. In addition to providing the frequencies of various chronic <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> in southern Chinese people, this study also showed that these disorders no longer should be considered rare in this population. Inherent biologic differences between <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> in Chinese and Western patients also may exist. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

We evaluatedMR imaging including DWI and contrast-enhancedMR imaging for differentiating orbital lymphoma from benign orbital <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders.</b> MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Forty-seven histopathologically proved orbital <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> (29 orbital lymphomas and 18 benign orbital <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders)</b> were evaluated. Two board-certified radiologists reviewed visual features on T 1 -weighted, fat-suppressed T 2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and contrast-enhanced MR images. For quantitative evaluation, ADC and contrast-enhancement ratio of all lesionsweremeasured andoptimal cutoff thresholds and areas under curves for differentiating orbital lymphoma from benign orbital <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> were determined using receiver operative characteristic analysis; corresponding sensi-tivities and specificities were calculated. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ill-defined tumormargin (P. 003) had a significant associationwith orbital lymphoma whereas the “flow void sign ” (P. 005) and radiologic evidence of sinusitis (P. 0002) were associated with benign orbital <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders.</b> The mean ADC and contrast-enhancement ratio of orbital lymphomas were significantly {{lower than those of}} benign orbital <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> (P. 01). An ADC of less than 0. 612 103 mm 2 /s and a contrast-enhancement ratio of less than 1. 88 yielded areas under curves of 0. 980 and 0. 770, sensitivity of 94. 1 % and 95. 5 %, and specificities of 93. 3 % and 80. 0 % for predictin...|$|R

In this study, we used flow cytometry to evaluate the effect of interferon-free antiviral treatment on peripheral blood lymphocytes in HCV-infected patients with or without associated <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders.</b> Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed at baseline {{and at the end of}} treatment. In HCV-infected patients with <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders,</b> we evaluated immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain κ/λ ratio variations as a measure of monoclonal B-cell response to antiviral therapy. Healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls. A total of 29 patients were included, nine with and 20 without <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders.</b> Sustained virological response was achieved in 29 of 29 patients. We observed a significant reduction in the B-cell compartment (39 % global reduction) in eight of nine HCV-infected patients with <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> after viral clearance. We recognized the same trend, even if less pronounced, in HCV-infected patients without <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> (9 % global reduction). Among HCV-infected patients with <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders,</b> three showed an improvement/normalization of the immunoglobulin light chain ratio, whereas in the remaining six patients monoclonal B cells persisted to be clonally restricted even 1  year after the end of treatment.
