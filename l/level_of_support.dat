We find higher overall turnout rates when polls inform the electorate about the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the candidates, than when polls are prohibited. Distinguishing be-tween allied and floating voters, our data show that this increase in turnout is entirely due to floating voters. When polls indicate equal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the candidates, turnout is high and welfare is low (compared to the situation without polls). In contrast, when polls reveal more unequal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> turnout is lower with than without this information, while the effect of polls on welfare is non-negative.

5|$|In the 1995 local {{elections}} the Progress Party regained the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> {{seen at the}} 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been {{as a result of}} a focus on Progress Party core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, as well as the party dominating the media picture as a result of the controversy around the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino. The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, and for the first time became the second largest political party in Norway. The 1999 {{local elections}} resulted in the party's first mayor as a direct result of an election, Terje Søviknes in Os. 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from the Progress Party.|$|E
5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time.

40|$|Objective: Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} support services supplementing methadone maintenance programs vary in their cost-effectiveness. This study examined the cost-effective-ness <b>of</b> varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> supplementary <b>support</b> services to determine whether the relative cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> alternative <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> is sustained over time. Method: A group of 100 methadone-maintained opiate users were randomly assigned to three treatment groups receiving different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> services during a 24 -week clinical trial. One group received methadone treatment with a minimum of counseling, the second received methadone plus more intensive counseling, and the third received methadone plus enhanced counseling, medi-cal, and psychosocial services. The results {{at the end of the}} trial period have been published elsewhere. This article reports the results of an analysis at a 6 -month follow-up. Results: The follow-up analysis reaffirmed the preliminary findings that the methadone plus counseling level provided the most cost-effective implementation of the treatment program. At 12 months, the annual cost per abstinent client was $ 16, 485, $ 9, 804, and $ 11, 818 for the low, interme-diate, and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed to}} investigate the relationship between posture and reaching in both healthy and pathological conditions, approaching the trunk as a multi-segmented structure. For this purpose, neuromuscular and kinematic profiles were recorded from trunk and arm during seated reaches providing mid-rib vs pelvic <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> trunk <b>support.</b> Healthy adults with mature postural and reaching abilities displayed invariant arm kinematics during the reach. However, participants displayed increased anticipatory control and earlier activation of cervical muscles with mid-rib support. Participants also presented increased compensatory responses of paraspinal muscles when responding to the increased trunk balance demands with pelvic support. Children with moderate/severe cerebral palsy (CP) cannot maintain an upright sitting position and thus cannot create a stable postural frame around which upper limb movements are planned and executed. A second set of studies examined postural and reaching characteristics in these children, while applying axillae, mid-rib or pelvic <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Participants were classified according to their intrinsic <b>level</b> <b>of</b> trunk control as mild, moderate and severe. With higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> children with moderate to severe impairments in trunk control showed improvements of head and trunk control along with enhanced reaching performance. Participants with mild trunk dysfunction were able to sit independently and thus did not demonstrate significant changes in postural and reaching proficiency across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> external trunk <b>support.</b> 	Electromyographic profiles were more variable depending on the severity of intrinsic trunk control. Overall, participants in the mild group presented more refined timing mechanisms for both anticipatory (closer to reaching onset) and compensatory (reduced latency) postural adjustments during the reach across all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Participants in the moderate group displayed earlier muscle onsets and more efficient arm/trunk muscle amplitudes with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Participants in the severe group showed very limited capability of anticipatory control of paraspinal muscles, delayed muscle onsets and variable muscle amplitudes across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> These results emphasize the complex neuro-anatomical nature of trunk control during reaching. Also, they highlight that inefficient postural control while sitting significantly impacts children with CP and trunk dysfunction.
