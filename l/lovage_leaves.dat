[...] "Borș/ciorbă de perişoare" [...] (a broth with meatballs) is quite common. One ingredient required in all recipes by Romanian tradition is <b>lovage</b> <b>leaves,</b> which has a characteristic flavour and significantly improves the soup's aroma.|$|E
40|$|The plant Levisticum officinale (Lovage) is {{commonly}} used as a condiment. It is traditionally used as an anti-flatulent, anti-dyspepsic, spasmolytic and anti-inflammatory agent to relieve rheumatic pain. The main reason for examining Lovage {{in this study was}} to determine its potential anti-inflammatory 1 properties in human monocytes (THP- 1 cells) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Solvent extracts (methanol/water 1 : 1 and hexane) of <b>Lovage</b> <b>leaves</b> were used in this study. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Volatiles of five {{different}} parts of <b>lovage</b> (<b>leaves,</b> stems, flowers, seeds, and roots) were isolated by dynamic headspace (DHS) method and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-olfactometry (GC-O) techniques. In total, 98 compounds were identified in the samples, of which 41 are reported as lovage volatiles for the first time. Qualitative differences {{in the composition of}} DHS constituents of various anatomical parts of the plants were not significant, whereas the amounts of a number of identified volatile compounds were different in leaves, stems, flowers, seeds, and roots. Seasonal variations in the composition of headspace volatiles were also determined. Except for roots, -phellandrene was found to be the most abundant headspace component in all anatomical parts of lovage constituting from 36. 50 ␝o 79. 28 ␘f the total GC peak area. The sniffing panel characterized effluents from the GC column, and odor descriptors were attributed to the recognized constituents. -Pinene and -phellandrene/myrcene were the most frequently recognized constituents among 11 GC effluents constituting 12 identified compounds and 1 unknown compound, which were detected by the members of the sniffing panel. None of the detected constituents was recognized as a lovage character impact aroma compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} alterations on the yield of CO 2, extracts from different anatomical parts of lovage (Levisticum officinale Koch.) and celery (Apium graveolens L.) was studied. It {{was found that}} by applying frequent pressure changes in the extraction vessel {{it is possible to}} increase the rate of the isolation of CO 2 soluble materials from <b>lovage</b> seeds and <b>leaves,</b> <b>lovage</b> and celery roots. However, after passing a sufficient amount of the supercritical solvent, the yields were similar both for constant and pulsing extraction pressures. The composition of the extracts was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and {{it was found that the}} phthalides were very important constituents in the extracts from all the anatomical parts of lovage, while linoleic acid was the most abundant component in the celery root extracts.

30|$|Multitarget {{phytotherapy}} {{may become}} relevant {{in the treatment}} of uncomplicated UTI. The herbal triad combination - centaury, <b>lovage,</b> and rosmary <b>leaves</b> (CLR 1) - has been used for decades for the supportive treatment of acute and recurrent UTI. CLR shows a broad spectrum of pharmacological activity. In addition to antiphlogistic effects, acute spasmolytic and antinociceptive properties also {{play an important role in}} acute therapy. Burning during micturition and spasms in the lower abdomen diminish. Additional anti-adhesive effects can prevent adherence and penetration of bacteria into the bladder mucosa. All these findings support the faster elimination of the pathogens and protect against recurrent infection.|$|R
30|$|Until {{recently}} the generally accepted paradigm implied that urine of healthy people is sterile. In the meantime {{several studies have}} established also a microbiome in the bladder with many different species. Whether bacteria cause damage in the bladder depends not only on their virulence, {{but also on the}} inflammatory response of the host. Under certain circumstances asymptomatic bacteriuria can even protect from recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). Some bacteria in the gut microbiome, such as Oxalobacter formigenes, are protective for calcium oxalate stone formation. The rapid rise of bacterial antibiotic resistance also among uropathogens due to wrong and often unreflected use of antibiotics has become a great concern. Instead of combating the pathogens, it appears to be more useful in many cases to treat the inflammatory host reaction - and to preserve the protective bacterial flora. Due to its antiphlogistic, spasmolytic and antinociceptive properties in a pilot study the herbal triad combination - centaury, <b>lovage,</b> and rosmary <b>leaves</b> (CLR (Canephron® N (Bionorica SE, Neumarkt, Germany))) – showed very good results in the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis. In the meantime a phase 3 study with CLR in comparison with fosfomycin trometamol has started. Analysing microbiome profiles in mice showed that even a single dose of fosfomycin as well as daily application of nitrofurantoin resulted in massive microbiome shifts, whereas phytotherapy with CLR largely preserved the gut microbiota.|$|R
