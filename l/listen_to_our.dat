She also said that while their first album was about finding out who they were as everything about recording was new to them, on The Big Room they knew exactly what they wanted, stating [...] "We {{wanted to make a}} 'real' album. With a live band in the studio, with our songs and a producer we knew would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Binaural {{opens with}} three up-tempo songs before growing more diverse. [...] Vedder explained, [...] "We'd rather {{challenge}} our fans {{and make them}} <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> songs than give them something that's easy to digest. There {{is a lot of}} music out there that is very easy to digest but we never {{wanted to be part of}} it." [...] As described by critic Jon Pareles on his review for Rolling Stone, Pearl Jam distances itself from the grunge that made them famous and [...] "delve elsewhere: jumpy post-punk and somber meditations, tightly wound folk rock and turbulent, neopsychedelic rockers that sound like they boiled out of jam sessions." ...|$|E
500|$|In a June 2009 {{post on the}} Evanescence website, Lee {{wrote that}} the band {{was in the process}} of writing {{material}} for an album planned for release the following year. According to Lee, the music would be an evolution of previous work and [...] "better, stronger, and more interesting". She described Evanescence music as epic, dark, big, beautiful and desperate. In a Spin interview, Lee called the record [...] "fun", which, according to her, was a [...] "totally new thing" [...] for the band: [...] "When I <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> old music I see that's where I was in my life at that time. This has been a long trip and parts have been hard. But it's about not taking everything so seriously this time." ...|$|E

500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{completion}} of Hello Hurricane, the band had concluded {{a season of}} independence and artistic freedom that hadn't been experienced since the band recorded The Beautiful Letdown independently. Once this season was concluded, the band began shopping around for a distribution label, [...] "looking for the best partner to give these songs a large platform that is respectful {{to the people that}} <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> music." [...] On August 7, 2009, Switchfoot announced that their independently-owned label, lowercase people records, would be partnering with Atlantic Records to distribute Hello Hurricane globally. EMI CMG would meanwhile retain the rights to release Switchfoot's material to the Christian market.|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles' {{return to}} Hamburg {{was viewed as}} a {{homecoming}} due to their past connections with the city. On 26 June, the band played two shows at the 5600-seat Ernst-Merck-Halle and reunited with old friends such as Astrid Kirchherr and with Bert Kaempfert, a German arranger and composer who had briefly worked as the Beatles' producer. Lennon was heard to say during one of the Ernst-Merck-Halle concerts: [...] "Don't <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> music. We're terrible these days." [...] A scheduled group outing to St Pauli, the area of Hamburg where the Beatles had been based in the early 1960s, was cancelled due to the potential security risk. Lennon and McCartney nevertheless made a late-night visit to familiar sites along the Reeperbahn in St Pauli.|$|E

2500|$|Amberian Dawn {{classified}} {{themselves as}} [...] "melodic, dramatic and powerful metal with female classical vocals," [...] and ex-lead singer Heidi Parviainen has called their music [...] "fast tempo, guitar driven metal with purely classical female vocals", while several other sources classify them as symphonic power metal, which the band has agreed sums it up, but {{also points out}} that there are many different styles that vary from song to song. In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s and maybe {{a little bit of the}} '90s. There are a lot of technical skills within the band, so everyone who's not scared of serious guitar and keyboard shredding should <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> music." ...|$|E
