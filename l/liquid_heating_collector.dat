40|$|Research {{concerning}} {{the field of}} <b>Liquid</b> <b>Heating</b> <b>Collectors</b> (SLHCs) cannot be directly transferred to the large area of applications for Solar Air <b>Heating</b> <b>Collectors</b> (SAHC). Larger cross sections for transporting the air are necessary. This results in rather complicated fluid distributions within the products. In this paper we combine simulation and experimental techniques providing {{a high level of}} detail. Highly resolved three dimensional fluid dynamic simulations contain all the relevant heat transfer mechanisms in a plate SAHC: Heat conduction, convection patterns and radiation are modelled in the two air gaps. In all solid materials of the <b>collector</b> only <b>heat</b> conduction has to be accounted for. For the exchange of heat between the two air zones the heat transfer through the absorber is modelled. Nevertheless careful simplification is needed to be able to concentrate on the important details. Furthermore we shed light on numerical instabilities observed in the air gap between absorber and glass in the simulated example. A consistent numerical description is given, concluding, that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an appropriate tool for design and optimisation of SAHC concepts. The effects of collector tilting, insulation level and heat transfer surface increase have been assessed as a prove of applicability. The performance of these models will finally be compared to the experimental data obtained using a high-precision SAHC testing facility. For the experimental data base refined local measurement techniques, which meet highest accuracy requirements, are developed and employed...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program simulating a whole heating system for space heating in large multifamily houses or small district heating systems is presented. The system {{consists of an}} ambient-air natural convective <b>heat</b> <b>collector,</b> a <b>heat</b> store with vertical pipes in the ground, and an electrically driven heat pump. The most important design parameters from both a technical and an economical point of view are the sizes of the storage, the ambient-air <b>heat</b> <b>collector,</b> and the <b>heat</b> pump. The influence of these parameters on the technical result is discussed. With the aid of computer simulations it is shown how this influence can be presented in a generalized way. From this presentation a method to optimise this kind of system is outlined. Using typical costs for Sweden the total annual cost for some designs is calculated and a cost comparison is made with an oil fired burner. In the optimisation calculations optimum values for the main parts were determined. For the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> and the storage size flat optimums were found.

40|$|NoThis paper aims to {{investigate}} experimentally {{the effects of}} circulating coolant flow rate, groundwater table fluctuations, infiltration of rainwater, {{on the amount of}} thermal energy that can be recovered from the near surface soil layers. A comprehensive experimental investigation was carried out on a fully equipped tank filled with sand. A <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> panel was embedded horizontally at the mid-height of the tank. Measurements of the temperature at various points on the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> panel, adjacent soil, inlet and outlet were continuously monitored and recorded. After reaching a steady state, it was observed that increasing water saturation in the adjacent soil leads to a substantial increase on the amount of heat recovered. A model was proposed for the estimation of temperature along the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> panel based on steady state conditions. It accounted for thermal resistance between pipes and the variability of water saturation in the adjacent soils. This model showed good agreement with the data. Whilst increasing the flow rate of the circulating fluid within the panel did not cause noticeable improvement on the amount of heat energy that can be harnessed within the laminar flow regime commonly found in ground source heat panels. Infiltration of rainwater would cause a temporary enhancement on the amount of extracted heat. Measurement of the sand thermal conductivity during a cycle of drying and wetting indicates that the thermal conductivity is primarily dependent upon the degree of water saturation and secondary on the flow path...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTyphoon {{is one of}} {{the major}} natural {{disasters}} in Taiwan. The solar water heater system installed in the house roof has the most serious damage caused by typhoon invasion. Because the wind blows into the backward of the solar water heater system, the heat collecter is damaged by the stronger wind pressure gradient induced between the upper and lower. This study was using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method to investigate the flowfield over a suspended and ground solar water heater during the wind speed about 30 m/s, and compared the results with the experimental data for validation. Simulations of 60 % solar water collector model with different tilt angles and 40 % model with different guiding plate were also done in this study to investigate the effect of the guide plate. The result shows that the 3 D flowfield effect is clear, and 2 D model can not simulated the flowfield. The <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> erected away from the ground can be reduced to the uplift, and the separation bubbles are induced behind the bucket of the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> surface. The cornner vortices generated and interacted from the collector-side, and the separation bubbles is extending in spanwise. The larger tilt angle of the solar collector causes the larger pressure difference in the leading edge. The guiding plate avoids the inflow directly hit the bottom of the solar collector, and it can efficiently reduce the leading edge pressure difference. Nevertheless, when the cross-sectional area of the guiding plate increase, the uplift force acted on <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> decreases and the drag force would be increased...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{a liquid}} {{undergoes}} boiling by homogeneous nucleation during non-equilibrium heating {{is very important}} as {{the characteristics of the}} system before and after the occurrence of homogeneous boiling explosion is significantly different. In the present study, we studied homogeneous boiling explosion condition from an energy point of view: how much energy is required to boil the liquid by homogeneous nucleation from a given initial temperature. As a representative one, water heating at atmospheric pressure has been considered under three different heating conditions namely; i) linear heating at the boundary ii) high heat flux pulse <b>heating</b> and iii) <b>liquid</b> contact with high temperature surface. The analytical formulations for cumulative energy distribution in the liquid under various <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> conditions have been derived and the cumulative energy density within the liquid are calculated. It has been found that the instantaneous cumulative energy density very near to the liquid boundary is several times higher than that corresponding to the thermal penetration depth for all <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> cases. The present study shows that, the cumulative energy density at the boiling explosion over a characteristic liquid cluster being equal {{to the size of a}} critical embryo is independent of the heating parameter and for a given initial condition, it has been found to be almost constant for all <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> conditions. However, the cumulative energy density at the boiling explosion decreases as the liquid initial temperature increases for all <b>liquid</b> <b>heating</b> cases. The obtained results are compared with other numerical results reported in the literature for water subjected to uniform volumetric heating at atmospheric pressure...|$|R
