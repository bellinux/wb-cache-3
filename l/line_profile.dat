40|$|Abstract. Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) {{are close}} binary systems where mass is {{transferred}} from a red dwarf star to a white dwarf star via an accretion disk. The flickering is observed as stochastic variations in the emitted radiation both in the continuum and in the emission <b>line</b> <b>profiles.</b> The main goal of our simulations is to compare synthetic Doppler maps with observed ones, aiming to constrain the flickering properties and wind parameters. A code was developed which generates synthetic emission <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> of a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk. The simulation allows us to include flares in a particular disk region. The emission line flares may be integrated over arbitrary “exposure ” times, producing the synthetic <b>line</b> <b>profiles.</b> Flickering Doppler maps are created using such synthetic time series. The presence of a wind inside the Roche lobe was also implemented.

Given the importance of the atmospheric composition of white dwarfs to studies of stellar evolution, extra-solar planetary systems and the interstellar medium, we examine the effect of including circumstellar <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> in the abundance estimates of photospheric metals in six DA stars. The photospheric C and Si abundances are reduced in five cases where the circumstellar contamination is strong, though the relative weakness of the circumstellar Si IV absorption introduces minimal contamination, resulting in a small change in abundance. The inability of previous, approximate models to reproduce the photospheric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> here demonstrates the need for a technique that accounts for the physical <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> of both the circumstellar and photospheric lines when modelling these blended absorption features.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{resonance}} <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> predicted by radiation driven disk wind models which extend radially one {{order of magnitude}} farther out than our previous models. Our main {{result is that the}} inclusion of a disk wind at larger radii changes qualitatively and quantitatively the <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> predicted by the models. Our new models predict line absorption that is significantly stronger than those predicted by old models. Some of the previous <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> exhibit a doubled-humped structure near the line center which is now replaced by a more plausible single, blueshifted minimum. We emphasize that the improvements in the shape as well as the strength of the absorption were achieved without changing the gross properties of the wind. In particular, our new models do not predict a higher mass-loss rate than the previous models. The main changes in the <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> are {{due to the fact that}} the ratio between the rotational velocity and poloidal velocity of the wind decreases downstream. The new <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> reproduce well the line absorption of the nova-like variable, IX~Vel, and promise to reproduce observations of other cataclysmic variables.
