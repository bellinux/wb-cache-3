Methods We studied 574 incident lymphoma cases and 616 hospital controls in a multicentric study in Spain. Information on hair dye use was obtained through a personal interview together with information on other known or putative risk factors for lymphoma. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). All ORs were adjusted for pathology center, sex, age, and house ownership. Results Ever use of hair dyes was associated with a non-significant 20 % increased risk of lymphoma (OR = 1. 2, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 7) with a slightly higher risk observed for those using permanent hair dyes (OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 9). No association was observed with duration of use or <b>lifetime</b> <b>doses</b> of hair dyes. Among all lymphomas categories, only chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was significantly {{associated with the use of}} hair dyes (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 4. 7).

50|$|Wildlife {{contraceptives}} {{are largely}} in the experimental phase as of this writing. These include such products as Gonacon, an adjuvant vaccine which delivers a high dosage of a competitor ligand of the hormone GnRH to female mammals (e.g. whitetail deer). The complex formed of GnRH and the Gonacon molecule promotes production of antibodies against the animal’s own GnRH, which themselves complex with GnRH. This encourages an extended duration of the drug’s effects (namely, reduction of active/unbound GnRH in the animal’s system). Though the endocrinology behind Gonacon is sound, the need for multiple <b>lifetime</b> <b>doses</b> for full efficacy make it a less-guaranteed and less-permanent solution for wildlife than lethal culls. Even among domestic animals in controlled conditions, Gonacon cannot ensure 100% reduction in the occurrence of pregnancies.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{original}} estimates (and some later figures) concerning {{the activity of}} the injected solution were erroneous, modern research indicates that Stevens (who weighed 58 kg) was injected with 3.5 μCi 238Pu, and 0.046 μCi 239Pu, giving him an initial body burden of 3.546 μCi total activity. The fact that he had the highly radioactive Pu-238 (produced in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Crocker Laboratory by deuteron bombardment of natural uranium) contributed heavily to his long-term dose. Had all of the plutonium given to Stevens been the long-lived Pu-239 used as in similar experiments of the time, Stevens's <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> would have been significantly smaller.

5000|$|In {{accordance}} with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) {{in one year}} or a <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> of 10 rem (100 mSv) above that received from natural sources. Doses from natural background radiation in the United States average about 0.3 rem (3 mSv) per year. A dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem (250 mSv) in a lifetime of 80 years. Estimation of health risk associated with radiation doses that are of similar magnitude as those received from natural sources should be strictly qualitative and encompass a range of hypothetical health outcomes, including the possibility of no adverse health effects at such low levels.|$|E
50|$|This {{policy is}} based on the {{principle}} that any amount of radiation exposure, no matter how small, can increase the chance of negative biological effects such as cancer. It is also based on the principle that the probability of the occurrence of negative effects of radiation exposure increases with cumulative <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose.</b> These ideas are combined to form the linear no-threshold model. At the same time, radiology and other practices that involve use of radiations bring benefits to population, so reducing radiation exposure can reduce the efficacy of a medical practice. The economic cost, for example of adding a barrier against radiation, must also be considered when applying the ALARP principle. Computed Tomography, better known as C.T. Scans or CAT Scans have made an enormous contribution to medicine, however not without some risk. They use ionizing radiation which can cause cancer, especially in children. When caregivers follow proper indications for their use and child safe techniques rather than adult techniques, downstream cancer can be prevented.|$|E

The annual UV dose did not significantly correlate with age but the variation in annual UV dose was high (median 166 SED (standard erythema dose), 95 % range: 37 – 551 SED). The annual UV dose did correlate with days with risk behavior (sunbathing/exposing upper body) (r= 0. 51, p< 0. 001) and in adults also with hours performing outdoor sports (r= 0. 39, p< 0. 001), gardening, and sun-bed sessions (r= 0. 26, p= 0. 02). Teenagers had significantly more days with risk behavior than adults (21 vs 13 d, p= 0. 006) but not than children (15 d). No differences in UV dose among the age groups were found on workdays.

40|$|Hunters {{and their}} {{families}} {{were one of the}} most exposed subpopulations in Sweden after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986. In this pilot study we used existing registries and whole-body measurements to develop algorithms to calculate <b>lifetime</b> effective <b>doses</b> and collective doses to some hunters in Sweden. Ten hunters and their family members were randomly selected from each of the three most contaminated counties in Sweden (Västernorrland, Uppsala, Gävleborg) using the register for hunting weapons from the Police Authority in 1985. Hence, this design can be regarded as a closed cohort only including hunters and their family members living in these three counties {{at the time of the}} accident. Statistics Sweden matched these individuals (n = 85) with their dwelling coordinates onto the digital map produced by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority after aerial measurements of 137 Cs (kBq m− 2). Internal effective doses were estimated using aggregated transfer factors from ground deposition to in-vivo body concentration for 134 Cs and 137 Cs in hunters (Bq kg− 1). External effective doses were also calculated on the dwelling coordinate for 134 Cs, 137 Cs and short-lived nuclides in these three counties. Annual effective doses for external and internal doses were then cumulated up to a life expectancy of 80 years for men and 84 years for women, respectively. The total <b>lifetime</b> effective <b>doses</b> to the members of the hunter families in this cohort were on average 8. 3 mSv in Västernorrland, 4. 7 mSv in Uppsala and 4. 1 mSv in Gävleborg.

In all counties the internal dose was about 75 % of the total <b>lifetime</b> effective <b>dose.</b> The collective dose for all hunters with family members, in total about 44, 000 individuals, in these three counties could be approximated at about 256 manSv.

40|$|Abstract Background An ad hoc peer-review {{committee}} was jointly appointed by Drug Authorities and Industry in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in 1999 / 2000 {{to review the}} evidence for a causal relation between phenacetin-free analgesics and nephropathy. The committee found the evidence as inconclusive and requested a new case-control study of adequate design. Methods We performed a population-based case-control study with incident cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) {{under the age of}} 50 years and four age and sex-matched neighborhood controls in 170 dialysis centers (153 in Germany, and 17 in Austria) from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2004. Data on lifetime medical history, risk factors, treatment, job exposure and intake of analgesics were obtained in a standardized face-to-face interview using memory aids to enhance accuracy. Study design, study performance, analysis plan, and study report were approved by an independent international advisory committee and by the Drug Authorities involved. Unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed. Results The analysis included 907 cases and 3, 622 controls who had never used phenacetin-containing analgesics in their lifetime. The use of high cumulative <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> (3 rd tertile) of analgesics in the period up to five years before dialysis was not associated with later ESRD. Adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were 0. 8 (0. 7 – 1. 0) and 1. 0 (0. 8 – 1. 3) for ever- compared with no or low use and high use compared with low use, respectively. The same results were found for all analgesics and for mono-, and combination preparations with and without caffeine. No increased risk was shown in analyses stratifying for dose and duration. Dose-response analyses showed that analgesic use was not associated with an increased risk for ESRD up to 3. 5 kg cumulative <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> (98 % of the cases with ESRD). While the large subgroup of users with a <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> up to 0. 5 kg (278 cases and 1365 controls) showed a significantly decreased risk, a tiny subgroup of extreme users with over 3. 5 kg lifetime use (19 cases and 11 controls) showed a significant risk increase. The detailed evaluation of 22 cases and 19 controls with over 2. 5 kg lifetime use recommended by the regulatory advisors showed an impressive excess of other conditions than analgesics triggering the evolution of ESRD in cases compared with controls. Conclusion We found no clinically meaningful evidence for an increased risk of ESRD associated with use of phenacetin-free analgesics in single or combined formulation. The apparent risk increase shown in a small subgroup with extreme <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> of analgesics is most likely an indirect, non-causal association. This hypothesis, however, cannot be confirmed or refuted within our case-control study. Overall, our results lend support to the mounting evidence that phenacetin-free analgesics do not induce ESRD and that the notion of "analgesic nephropathy" needs to be re-evaluated. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} by {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) the difference in muscle signal intensities between alcoholics and control subjects. Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects and 46 alcohol-dependent individuals were assessed. MRI was carried out using a low-field magnet (0. 2 Tesla) and a limb-dedicated coil. The presence of muscle changes was evaluated by measuring signal intensities at the medial (MG) and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle by T 1 -/T 2 -weighted and gradient-echo short tau inversion recovery sequences. The mean signal intensities of the two sample groups were compared by ANCOVA with age as a covariate. In the alcohol-dependent group, correlations between signal intensities and plasma levels of muscular and hepatic enzymes, in addition to years of high-risk consumption and <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> of ethanol consumed, were assessed. The mean signal intensities were also compared with the different degrees of pain by ANOVA. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, the alcohol-dependent group had mean higher signal intensities in both gastrocnemius heads in all sequences. The difference in the MG in T 2 -weighted sequences was significant (F = 48. 28,p < 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{survey the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} hand-arm vibration syndrome symptoms (HAVS), and to estimate past and current exposure to hand held vibrating tools {{in a sample of}} gas distribution operatives breaking and re-instating road surfaces. METHODS: 153 gas distribution operatives (participation rate 81 %) from three company districts were assessed by an administered questionnaire, a clinical examination, and a simple cold challenge test to the hands. Exposure histories were taken aided by a picture album of past and current tools. Information was obtained from several sources on the likely vibratory characteristics of those tools. Estimates were thus obtained of the frequency of blanching and neurological complaints in operatives, and of their lifetime hours of exposure and <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> of vibration. RESULTS: On average, the sample had spent 16 years in employment involving use of vibratory tools. 24 % had symptoms or signs of blanching after use of tools in the industry; 46 % had troublesome persistent complaints of paraesthesiae or numbness, and these symptoms extended into the hands or arms in 18 % of workers. In 5. 9 % the distribution of symptoms was suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome; and of ulnar nerve entrapment in a further 3. 9 %. The risks of blanching and neurological complaints rose significantly with lifetime hours of use of vibrating tools and <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> of vibration. Symptoms were generally mild and apparent only after a prolonged interval, but there were exceptions, and cases had occurred after lower recent exposures.

By contrast our data suggest that symptoms of HAVS do occur, given sufficient exposure, a finding relevant not only to gas supply workers, but also to workers from other industries who break and repair road surfaces...|$|E

ConclusionsLong-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} is evaluated as a novel decay prevention {{treatment for}} waterlogged archaeological wood. A dose of 15 kGy {{was found to}} be sufficient to inactivate a large number of wood biodeteriogens, including fungi, bacteria and invertebrates, at various stages of development. For timbers excavated from polluted sites, a dose of 25 kGy is suggested to inactivate human pathogens. The dose spread required for such treatments are 1. 33 : 1 and 1. 2 : 1, respectively, in timbers up to 150 mm thickness and density not exceeding 1590 kg/m 3. No adverse effects on the physical properties of slightly or heavily degraded waterlogged archaeological wood were detected at doses of up to 100 kGy. This is the maximum recommended single or cumulative <b>lifetime</b> <b>dose</b> for any timber. Gamma irradiation offers far greater efficacy over currently used decay prevention treatments and, a step-wise procedure for evaluating timbers for treatment and dosimetry is presented. | Gamma irradiation is evaluated as a novel decay prevention treatment for waterlogged archaeological wood.

40|$|Bone {{mineral content}} in spinal trabecular and {{peripheral}} cortical bone {{was measured in}} 75 unselected patients with small and/or large intestinal inflammatory bowel disease. Osteoporosis, defined as a bone mineral content greater than 2 SD below the age and sex matched normal mean value was present in 23 patients (30. 6 %). Three amenorrhoeic females aged 34, 38, and 42 years had severe clinical osteoporosis and a further three patients had one or more vertebral crush fractures. Eighteen of the 23 patients with osteoporosis had small intestinal disease {{with one or more}} resections and the mean <b>lifetime</b> steroid <b>dose</b> in those with osteoporosis was significantly higher than in those with normal bone mineral content. Bone mineral content in spinal trabecular bone showed significant negative correlations with <b>lifetime</b> steroid <b>dose</b> and serum alkaline phosphatase and a significant positive correlation with serum albumin. Peripheral cortical bone mineral content was positively correlated with body weight, height and body mass index. We conclude that the prevalence of osteoporosis is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, severe clinical osteoporosis developing in some relatively young patients. The pathogenesis of this bone loss is probably multifactorial; steroid therapy is likely to be an important contributory factor...|$|R
2500|$|Claims {{that many}} {{commercial}} brands of sunscreen increase, rather than decrease, {{the likelihood of}} contracting skin cancer with high UV exposure, and instead advocating the use of natural sunscreens, some of which he markets on his website. This view is not held by mainstream medical science; in 2011, the National Toxicology Program stated that [...] "Protection against photodamage by use of broad-spectrum sunscreens is well-documented as {{an effective means of}} reducing total <b>lifetime</b> UV <b>dose</b> and, thereby, preventing or ameliorating the effects of UV radiation on both the appearance and biomechanical properties of the skin." ...|$|R
40|$|Excess carrier {{lifetime}} {{variations in}} proton and °-ray irradiated MCz Si have been examined. The linear decrease of recombination <b>lifetime</b> with <b>dose</b> in °-ray irradiated material shows a dose-independent defect introduction rate, while protons of high uence induce {{changes of the}} type of the dominant radiation defects. The simultaneous recombination and trapping components in the carrier decay transients were revealed by microwave absorption technique. Two peaks were separated in recombination and trapping lifetime variations with temperature. Trap activation factors were extracted. The dominant defects acting as recombination and trapping centres are discussed...|$|R
