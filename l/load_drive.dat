50|$|Because DOS {{applications}} {{use these}} drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in Unix-like systems), {{they can be}} disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is {{the addition of a}} new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives.This problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them.Under DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical drive. The assignment of this drive would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts. Under some versions of Concurrent DOS, as well as under Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32, the reserved drive letter L: will automatically be assigned to the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>drive</b> whenever an application starts.|$|E

40|$|This review aims {{to explain}} the {{inevitable}} imbalance between respiratory <b>load,</b> <b>drive,</b> and muscular force that occurs in the natural aging of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and that predisposes these patients to sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In DMD, SDB is characterized by oxygen desaturation, apneas, hypercapnia, and hypoventilation during sleep and ultimately develops into respiratory failure during wakefulness. It can be present in all age groups. Young patients risk obstructive apneas because of weight gain, secondary to progressive physical inactivity and prolonged corticosteroid therapy; older patients hypoventilate and desaturate because of respiratory muscle weakness, in particular the diaphragm. These conditions are further exacerbated during REM sleep, the phase of maximal muscle hypotonia during which the diaphragm has to provide most of the ventilation.

40|$|The {{information}} about how wheel loaders are used by costumers is not well documented, but large quantities of sensor signal data are recorded. This data makes the starting point to develop a robust automatic pattern recognition algorithm to identify repetitive driving operations. The algorithm is composed by models of events that appear in cycles. The cycles are pre-defined as short loading cycle and load and carry. They consist of the phases; <b>load,</b> <b>drive</b> loaded, unload and drive unloaded. In the load and carry cycle, the driving forward loaded phase can last up to 400 meters. Beyond these two is something called sub cycle defined. It contains cleaning cycle and reloading. A cycle is identified by transition automata of events. To make the identification more robust against disturbances, a probability function {{is connected to the}} cycle identification. The developed algorithm uses signals from sensors available in series production wheel loaders. These signals are used to identify cyclic behaviour in the shape of short loading cycle, load and carry and sub cycle. After removal of completely standing still events, the algorithm calculates the characteristic parameters for the identified cycles and for their phases and present them in an excel file. Validation showed that the algorithm can find 75 % or more of cyclic behaviour for bucket handling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations of the magnitude and nature of change loads drive of mine shuttle car used to deliver ore to extraction chambers in PAO “Uralkaliy” potash mines. The design of recording complex software “VATUR” developed by the staff of the Mining Electrical Engineering department, Perm National Research Polytechnic University, was described. In the course of research of the drive modes of self-propelled mine wagons measurements of instantaneous values of current and voltage motors were carried out. The values of active and apparent power consumed by electric pumping stations and conveyors of mine shuttle car were calculated. Modes and changes in loads on components and parts drives were studied. It was proved that the operation modes of mine shuttle car motors with increased lift capacity are characterized by a systematic overload. Outdated system controlling the rotational speed of shafts drive motor gives rise to considerable dynamic loads on components of mechanical transmissions for shuttle cars. Significant loss of time causing the reduction in technical performance longwall set of equipment of potash mines arises during the maneuvering operations and unloading ore from shuttle cars. Based on the analysis of <b>load</b> <b>drive</b> graphs and emergency failure statistics the technical solutions were justified to improve the reliability of mine shuttle cars.

40|$|Sympatric speciation, the {{divergence}} of one lineage {{into two}} or more lineages within one geographic range, is often driven by disruptive selection on niche utilization. While niche specialization is found in sympatrically speciated groups, it is often reinforced by other strong selective pressure. This dissertation examines the role of predation, morphology, mate choice, and parasite load in maintaining reproductive isolation in two sympatrically speciated species flocks of pupfish (Cyprinodon). The role that predation, morphology and male and female mate choice play in reproductive isolation is examined in the Bahamian species flock. To examine the role of predation, we focus on two species, a generalist detritivore and a predator/scale-eater. We show that premating isolation is based primarily on visual cues and is asymmetrical. It is well developed in the less abundant scale-eater but is much less well developed in the more abundant detritivore. Responses of detritivore females from three lakes to conspecific and scale-eater males suggest that abundance of the predator also affects development of premating isolating mechanisms in the prey species. These results highlight the importance of frequency-dependent selection and predators {{in the evolution of}} premating isolating mechanisms. The three species, a detritivore, an ostracod-eater, and a scale-eater which preys upon the other two, inhabit distinct trophic niches. We use geometric morphometrics to examine variation in body shape among these three species. Results show that there are significant differences in male, but not female body shape. These results suggest that male body shape, specifically nuchal hump height, is under sexual selection and may contribute to reproductive isolation between species. Female mate choice reinforces reproductive isolation in sympatrically speciated species. Male mate choice, while not as strong a selective pressure as female mate choice, could also act as a reproductive isolation mechanism in sympatric species. Using a binary choice design, we examine the importance of visual and olfactory cues in female mate choice and focus on the ostracod-eater, the least abundant of the three sympatric species of pupfish. We also examine male mate choice in the scale-eater and the detritivore. Females use visual and not olfactory cues and prefer conspecific males. Males also preferentially associate and court conspecific females. Thus, mutual mate choice acts a strong premating isolation mechanism in these sympatrically speciated pupfish. Recognition and behavioral avoidance of parasitized conspecifics or individuals with slightly different immunities, either due to differences in genotype and/or regional parasite load, would be favored by natural selection to maintain a healthy phenotype. This avoidance of parasitized conspecifics {{may play a role in}} species differentiation in two ways: 1) rapidly changing genes that encode for immune function, such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex may lead to small, localized differences in immune function. If small differences in immune function and parasite <b>load</b> <b>drive</b> behavioral avoidance of conspecifics, then reproductive barriers within a population are effectively formed through non-random mating. If such nonrandom mating barriers persist, they may lead to isolation of gene pools and subsequently, sympatric speciation; 2) Changes in parasite resistance may be tightly coupled with trophic differentiation as parasitic infection often occurs when organisms are foraging. To address this question, we performed two experiments to examine how parasites affect female choice in sympatrically speciated pupfish (Cyprinodon spp.) from the Yucatan, Mexico. We infected and sham infected male C. labiosus and C. maya with Ichthyophonus hoferi. In a series of binary choice trials, we presented female C. labiosus and C. maya with olfactory cues from infected and non-infected conspecific males. Then we presented the females with odors from infected conspecific males and non-infected heterospecific males. Results indicate that infection was successful in both species but varied in infectivity. Our findings show that females preferred non-infected conspecific males and suggest that reproductive barriers may be formed by female preference for healthy male conspecifics. Additionally, reproductive barriers between species are strong and prevent mating with heterospecific males. Overall this dissertation shows that multiple selective pressures contribute to and reinforce reproductive isolation. Future studies should take care to examine the roles of sexual selection, frequency dependence, ecological pressures beyond trophic niche usage, mate choice, morphology and other common methodologies such as genetic inference. Realistic models of sympatric speciation likely include a non-random collection of these and similar variables.
