40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{factors associated with}} <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength in adolescents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study involving 601 adolescents, aged 14 to 17 years, enrolled in {{public schools in the}} western region of Santa Catarina State - Southern Brazil. Lumbar strength was analyzed by the lumbar extension test developed by the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, which proposes different cutoffs for boys and girls. Independent variables were sex, age, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aerobic fitness. For data analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used, with significance <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 5 %. RESULTS: The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength was 27. 3 %. The population subgroups most likely to present <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength were females (OR: 1. 54, 95 % CI : 1. 06 to 2. 23), adolescents with <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> aerobic fitness (OR: 2. 10, 95 % CI: 1. 41 to 3. 11) and the overweight (OR: 2. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 35 to 3. 81). CONCLUSION: Almost one-third of the studied students have <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength. Interventions in the school population should be taken with special attention to female adolescents, those with <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> aerobic fitness, and those with overweight, as these population subgroups were most likely to demostrate <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength...|$|R

C-type soils are the most common, and occur in the eastern and central parts of the watershed. B-type soils primarily occur {{in the western part of}} the watershed.

5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E

The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January. The watch area, however, continued to expand and encompassed areas as far east as Denham. As the storm made its closet approach to Western Australia on 13 January, the watches and warnings area were gradually discontinued, with all advisories being discontinued that afternoon.|$|E

By November8, three days prior to Karen's arrival, this was raised to level three, prompting residents and military personnel {{to stock up on}} supplies. A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised to level one, the highest level of warning. At this time, the USS Haverfield, USS Brister, USS Wandank, and USS Banner sought refuge from the storm over open waters. All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage. Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island. Roughly 24hours after the typhoon's passage, all warnings were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Other {{sections}} of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and the peasants, {{although they did}} not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas {{they were no longer}} divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son. The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions. Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords. Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people. Knights were the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> nobility; they controlled but did not own land, and had to serve other nobles.|$|E
