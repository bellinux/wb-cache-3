After Snake defeats him, Raven tells Snake that [...] "Anderson" [...] {{was in fact}} FOXHOUND disguise artist Decoy Octopus. Infiltrating Metal Gear's hangar, Snake overhears Liquid and Ocelot preparing the REX <b>launch</b> <b>sequence</b> and uses the PAL card, but this unexpectedly activates REX. Liquid reveals {{that he has been}} impersonating Snake's advisor Master Miller and that FOXHOUND has used Snake to facilitate REX's launch. He and Snake are the product of the Les Enfants Terribles project, a 1970s government program to clone Big Boss. He also reveals to Snake the government's true reason for sending him: Snake is unknowingly carrying a weaponized [...] "FoxDie" [...] virus that causes cardiac arrest in FOXHOUND members on contact, allowing the government to retrieve REX undamaged.|$|E
500|$|Although Century 21 had {{constructed}} a life-size Dove capsule in Slough, {{it could not}} be used for filming at Pinewood Studios due to an arrangement with the National Association of Theatrical Television and Kine Employees (NATTKE) to build and use such props exclusively on-site. Once the original had been incinerated, carpenters at Pinewood re-built the prop, although Anderson remained disappointed with the finished product, which he considered inferior. Reviewing the scale models of Doppelgänger, Martin Anderson of the entertainment website Den of Geek describes the Phoenix command module as [...] "beautifully ergonomic without losing too much NASA-ness", and the Dove lander module as [...] "a beautiful fusion of JPL gloss with classic lines". He argues that the Phoenix <b>launch</b> <b>sequence</b> stood as the finest example of Meddings' work until his contributions to the 1979 James Bond film Moonraker, and praises his efforts all the more for the absence of computer animation in the late 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Robotic {{missions}} do {{not require}} an abort capability or radiation minimization, and because modern launchers routinely meet [...] "instantaneous" [...] launch windows, space probes to the Moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance.

50|$|As {{the team}} watches the footage {{video of the}} crashed fighter jet, Dr. Stone {{suspects}} and considers the possibility that Andromeda did not attack until the <b>launching</b> <b>sequence</b> of the nuclear warhead has been halted, which means that it could probably think and so attack the jet to force the warhead to be detonated, hence accelerating its own growth.
