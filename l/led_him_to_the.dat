5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the mid-20th century, {{estimates}} of Pluto's mass were revised downward. In 1931, Nicholson and Mayall calculated its mass, {{based on its}} supposed effect on the giant planets, as roughly that of Earth; a value somewhat {{in accord with the}} 0.91 Earth mass calculated in 1942 by Lloyd R. Wylie at the US Naval Observatory, using the same assumptions. In 1949, Gerard Kuiper's measurements of Pluto's diameter with the 200 inch telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that its mass was most probably about 0.1 Earth mass.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in South Boston, Lynch {{is the son of}} an ironworker. He went into the trade after high school, working in an {{apprenticeship}} and later joining his father's union. He became the union's youngest president at age 30 while attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology. He received his J.D. from Boston College Law School in 1991. For several years he worked as a lawyer, primarily representing housing project residents and labor unions. Lynch was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, unseating an incumbent Democratic lawmaker, in 1994. His social views and advocacy for the South Boston neighborhood <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Senate in 1995, when he won a special election to succeed state Senator William M.

5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E
5|$|Despite its failure, Maslama's {{attempt to}} capture Constantinople became celebrated in later Muslim literature, with several {{surviving}} accounts, mostly semi-fictional, {{in which the}} historical defeat {{was transformed into a}} sort of victory: Maslama was said to have departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital on his horse accompanied by thirty riders; Leo received him with honour and <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hagia Sophia, where the emperor paid homage to the Arab general. The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in Arabic epic literature, where Maslama appears associated with another legendary Arab hero of the wars against Byzantium, Abdallah al-Battal. Furthermore, Byzantine tradition, as recorded in the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio, held that during the siege Maslama convinced the Byzantines to build Constantinople's first mosque, near the city's praetorium. Later Ottoman tradition also ascribed the building of the Arap Mosque (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s. In reality, the mosque near the praetorium was most likely erected in about 860, {{as a result of an}} Arab embassy in that year.|$|E

5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing {{if there are any}} clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Louis François Etienne Bergeret (1814–1893) was a French {{hospital}} physician, and was {{the first}} to apply forensic entomology to a case.

Nevertheless, these assumptions <b>led</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first application of forensic entomology in an estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI).
