This work presents a simplified mathematical approach based on grey and fuzzy methods to estimate the probability of gas breakdown, which differs from other grey-fuzzy methods. With {{the help of the}} data normalization process and a linear fuzzy membership function in determining the proper value of the distinguishing coefficient, the proposed approach outperforms other grey-fuzzy-based methods, the curve fitting method, and the neural network method in terms of estimation accuracy.
