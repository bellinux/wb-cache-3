5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
25|$|Also {{included}} in this phase is the Post Implementation Review. This is a vital phase of the project for the project team to learn from experiences and apply to future projects. Normally a Post Implementation Review consists of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> that went well and analyzing things that went badly on the project {{to come up with}} lessons learned.|$|E

He learned by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things.</b> He studied {{and drew the}} flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, {{the form of the}} rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed cadavers from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.|$|E

500|$|Fox {{expressed}} a robust attitude to his situation: {{he refused to}} regard himself as disabled, and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more [...] "rewarding and challenging" [...] since {{he had lost his}} leg. His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of the disabled in society. Fox's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities, and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities, by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light. Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability. [...] "What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities started <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> differently. They came away with huge pride", he wrote.|$|E
500|$|In November 2016, Madonna, who {{actively}} supported Hillary Clinton {{during the}} 2016 U.S. presidential election, performed an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park {{in support of}} Clinton's campaign. Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy {{when she said that}} she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House". The following day, she asserted she was [...] "not a violent person" [...] and that her quote had been [...] "taken wildly out of context", adding [...] "I spoke in metaphor and I shared two ways of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage". In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana was {{practical}} {{and had a}} natural talent for leadership. Her sisters gave her the nickname [...] "The Governess" [...] and sent her as their group representative when they wanted their parents to grant a favor. Though she was eighteen months Tatiana's senior, Olga had no objection when Tatiana decided {{to take charge of}} a situation. [...] She was also closer to her mother than any of her sisters and was considered by many who knew her to be the Tsarina's favorite daughter. Tatiana was the conduit of all her mother's decisions. [...] "It was not that her sisters loved their mother any less," [...] recalled her French tutor Pierre Gilliard, [...] "but Tatiana knew how to surround her with unwearying attentions and never gave way to her own capricious impulses." [...] Alexandra wrote Nicholas on 13 March 1916 that Tatiana {{was the only one of}} their four daughters who [...] "grasped it" [...] when she explained her way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been given {{to the development of the}} characters from the original book, 25 years on. One review opined that [...] " [...] characters are incapable of growth. They cannot credibly find Jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair. They are bound to be American psychos." [...] Their development, some critics have observed, illuminates the ways they have not developed as people; Clay is, for example, [...] "in mind and spirit if not quite in body, destined to remain unchanged, undeveloped, unlikable and unloved." [...] In Less Than Zero, though the characters of the novel compose for some [...] "the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine", they remained to other reviewers [...] "particularly sympathetic". Like the novel, its characters were equally cultural milestones, described by a reviewer as [...] "seminal characters" [...] (of American fiction). On the subject of the 1987 film, Clay describes that [...] "the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did". To Bill Eichenberger, this shows how [...] "the children have become the parents, writing scripts and producing movies, still imprisoned by Hollywood's youth and drug cultures – but now <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> from the outside in." [...] Eisinger comments for the New York Press, that while [...] "they're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind... their preoccupations are just the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{ideology}} {{is a set}} of ideas that constitute one's goals, expectations, and actions.

2500|$|A central idea in Poythress' thought has {{concerned}} {{the validity of}} multiple perspectives, or multiperspectivalism, a project that {{he shares with his}} teacher and collaborator John Frame. In Poythress's work Philosophy, Science, and the Sovereignty of God, he explored how the scientific concepts of wave, particle and field can be used analogically to demonstrate different ways of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things.</b> He argued that such a triadic structure is [...] "a means of avoiding unhealthy dualism", and he continued on this line of thought in Symphonic Theology, where he applied multiperspectivalism to theology.|$|E
