Although anecdotal information for this habitat {{is available for}} Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> (Melanerpes lewis), no study has previously examined the importance of aspen woodlands to this species 2 ̆ 7 breeding biology. From 2002 to 2004, we monitored 76 Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> nests in aspen riparian woodlands of south-central Idaho to describe nest-site characteristics and estimate the nests 2 ̆ 7 survival. We quantified the vegetation at nest sites and randomly selected other sites to determine habitat features important in the species 2 ̆ 7 selection of a nest site. We then related these features, {{as well as several}} time-specific covariates, to nest survival. Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> selected nest trees that were larger in diameter than random trees and selected nest sites with more trees, fewer woody stems, and less bare ground than random sites. However, nest-site characteristics were not important determinants of nest survival. Rather, nest-initiation date and daily maximum temperature had the strongest influence on nest survival, which was higher for early nesters and increased with increasing daily maximum temperature.

40|$|This familiar, eastern U. <b>S.</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is {{an active}} and vocal species, with a {{preference}} for humid forests dominated by pines or hardwoods, or a mixture of both. It seldom excavates wood for insects; instead, depending on season, it forages opportunistically {{for a wide range}} of fruit, mast, seeds and arboreal arthropods. It is also known to take small or young vertebrate prey as well. The Red-bellied Woodpecker has expanded its range northward and westward in the latter half of the twentieth century. Most populations are resident year-round, although northern birds show some seasonal movement by retreating south during cold winters. In the southeastern United States, it is the most abundant woodpecker; in. the northern half of its range, it is much less common.

40|$|Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> (Melanerpes lewis) {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as a possible breeder in Nebraska by Bruner (1901), who included it in a list of birds that breed in the state. None of the authorities he cited, however, had published conclusive evidence of breeding, {{and one of them}} (Bates 1900) cited only a winter record. The species was mentioned in reports from the University of Nebraska field parties that worked in the Pine Ridge in 1900 and 1901. Crawford (1901) reports the discovery of only a single empty nest, despite weeks of fieldwork concentrated specifically on gathering nesting data on western species found in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s Pine Ridge. The nest which they reported was investigated between 18 May and 1 June 1900. It was 2 ̆ 2 found about 60 feet from the ground in a dead tree, but contained no eggs. This same tree yielded a set of five Sparrow Hawk 2 ̆ 7 s eggs. 2 ̆ 2 He did not mention whether the nest was visited at a later date for proof of breeding. This remarkable absence of· nesting data might be explained in part because the species frequently chooses the tallest available dead pine snag for a nest site, a site dangerous to visit under the best of conditions, and usually difficult or impossible to reach without specialized tree climbing equipment...|$|R
40|$|First of all, I want {{to thank}} Joel Jorgensen for helping write these reports {{for the last few}} years. Joel has decided to spend his limited free time on Records Committee matters; he is {{currently}} Chairman. Over the last few years, Joel has made significant contributions to Nebraska ornithology, particularly through his! meticulous counts of shorebirds in the Rainwater Basin. This season proved interesting in terms of ranges of breeding birds, as discussed in the accounts. See, for example, Little Blue Heron, the dOWitchers. Black-billed Magpie, White-breasted Nuthatch, Sedge Wren, and the towhees. There seems to be an increasing number of 2 ̆ 2 displaced 2 ̆ 2 birds, either early or late 2 ̆ 7 migrants or birds just in the wrong places. Could this situation result from an increasingly unstable atmosphere? Very late in spring were Hudsonian Godwit and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, while very early in fall were Willet, Semipalmated Sandpiper. and Orange-crowned Warbler. Birds in the wrong places were numerous, but significant were a 2 ̆ 2 small race 2 ̆ 2 Canada Goose, ducks such as American Wigeon. Green-winged Teal, Bufflehead, and Common Goldeneye, Mississippi Kite away from Ogallala, adult Golden Eagle eastward, adult American Golden-Plover in July. westerly Least Terns, northerly Acadian Flycatcher, singing mid-June Blue-winged Warblers, Yellow-breasted Chats in Harlan Co, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow in the RWB.

40|$|Sixty-seven {{members and}} guests were in {{attendance}} at the 111 th Annual Meeting of the Nebraska Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union held at Camp Norwesca on May 14 – 16, 2010. The Camp Norwesca campus, located just south of Chadron State Park, {{proved to be an}} excellent birding location, providing good views of Evening Grosbeaks and Red Crossbills. Evening Grosbeaks were also found at Chadron State Park and at Beaver Wall in Sheridan Co. Field trips were led by Wayne Mollhoff, Kathy DeLara, Ann Duey, Alice Kenitz, and Bruce and Donna Walgren. Rain on Saturday morning caused some last-minute changes to the trip itineraries. Among the locations visited were Gilbert·Baker WMA, Fort Robinson State Park, White River, Chadron Creek Ranch WMA, Chadron State Park, Oglala National Grasslands, Beaver Wall, and Smith Lake WMA. The total tally for the weekend was 166 species, with Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpecker,</b> and Evening Grosbeak being among the most popular with the group. On Friday evening, Todd Nordeen, a district wildlife manager for Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, spoke about the bighorn sheep management program in the Nebraska Panhandle. Bighorn sheep were native to the area, but were extirpated in the early 1900 s due to disease, habitat loss and over-hunting. Over the past few years, bighorn sheep have been reintroduced, and herds can now be found at Fort Robinson State Park, Bighorn WMA, Cedar Canyon WMA, and Hubbard Gap. The total population of bighorn sheep in Nebraska is currently estimated at 250 to 300. On Saturday evening, Bart Bly, a biologist with the Nebraska Prairie Partners, gave a presentation on bird research in western Nebraska pine forests. The Nebraska Prairie Partners, a collaboration between the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, assists landowners with habitat development on private lands and designs projects to benefit wildlife, particularly species of conservation concern. Species studied recently in the Nebraska Panhandle include Ferruginous Hawk, Golden Eagle, Northern Saw-whet Owl, Common Poorwill, and Mountain Plover. The Nebraska Prairie Partners hopes to improve the long-term viability of native habitats and increase public awareness of the importance of conserving and maintaining habitats to keep common species common and to reverse the plight of threatened and endangered species...|$|R
40|$|This {{spring was}} a fairly normal, {{although}} I heard comments about warblers being rather tough to find. The reports did confirm that {{for many of the}} migrant northwoods species. There were a few rarities, none represented first state records, however. Foremost of these were White Ibis, Glossy Ibis, blue-morph Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Goos, Common Crane, Band-tailed Pigeon, Hammond 2 ̆ 7 s Flycatcher, and Black-throated Gray Warbler. The following birds may join these, although each may have fatal flaws, at least {{in the eyes of the}} NOURC: Red Phalarope and Slaty-backed Gull. Other interesting sightings included a Mississippi Kite in Lincoln; Gray Partridges in Scotts Bluff Co; 11 th state records for both Little Gull and Mew Gull; a 10 th location for Eurasian Collared-Dove; another (maybe?) White-winged Dove; Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widows in the Kearney area; Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> in West Ash Creek Canyon; Pileated Woodpeckers continuing in Fontenelle Forest; an Acadian Flycatcher in Dixon Co; Blue-winged and Prairie Warblers near each other in Carter Canyon; the 17 th spring record of Pine Warbler but still with none documented; the 9 th (!) Panhandle Hooded Warbler; and the 10 th eastern record of Lazuli Bunting. A note is in order about reports of rare birds, either rare on a state level, or rare at the location or season. Each season I receive several such reports, many with excellent details of how the bird was identified. Those without details present a dilemma. In this (and subsequent) reports I will note observers of such sightings and follow their initials with 2 ̆ 2 details 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 no details 2 ̆ 2. The latter implies that the report, while possibly correct, is unverifiably so. This information is important for researchers who follow us and might have difficulty deciding which reports are substantiated and thus useful on a scientific level.

40|$|The {{spring of}} 2001 {{will likely be}} remembered as the winter that wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t end, {{especially}} in central and western Nebraska. The last remnants of roadside snowbanks remained in the east until 10 April, but the last blizzard closed down the Panhandle on 21 - 22 April, and the last appreciable snowfall there was on 19 May. None of these dates represent late records, but are remarkably later than average for the past 10 - 15 years, and seemed especially burdensome following the long cold winter and the remarkably early spring the previous year. While I recognize the danger inherent in making generalizations when working with such a small sample size, I feel it worthwhile to comment on differences and similarities between the timing of the 2000 and 2001 nesting seasons. While only a few species allowed direct comparison by being found nesting again in the same location as last year, the following information is offered for what it 2 ̆ 7 s worth. It would have been interesting to compare data on more of the cavity nesters, but unfortunately, I did not locate any active nuthatch nests this year, nor take the time to search out more of the other cavity nesters. In the southern Panhandle, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, Western and Eastern Kingbirds, Bluegray Gnatcatcher, Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole (and Red-winged Blackbird in the east), all appeared to be 2 - 3 weeks later in their breeding cycle than last year. By contrast, also in the Panhandle, Great Blue Heron, Great Homed Owl, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Woodpecker,</b> Western Wood-Pewee, Lark Sparrow, and McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur seemed {{to be on the same}} schedule as last year, as were American Crow, Common Grackle, and House Finch in the east. While it seems intuitive that some species would respond to the late spring by nesting later, why didn 2 ̆ 7 t some other species? How much of the difference in timing was actually due to the weather, and how much was due to the randomness of the small sample size or other variables? Obviously, it will take more years of data collection and a much larger sample size, one that includes all species, before generalizations can be made. Witnessing a blizzard disrupt breeding by Pinyon Jays and Canada Geese makes the reason for those delays pretty apparent. But what about kingbirds and gnatcatchers that were not even present yet? Were they later because of delayed plant growth and insect development? More study and many more records are needed before we can speak with certainty...|$|R

Abstract: Although {{several studies have}} suggested that southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) may have a significant negative impact on red-cockades woodpeckers (Picoides borealsi) (Loeb and Hooper 1997, Laves and Loeb 1999), the nature of the {{interactions between}} the species remains unclear. Particularly lacking are data that address if southern flying squirrels directly usurp red-cockaded <b>woodpecker</b> <b>s</b> from cavities, or simply occupy cavities previously abandoned by red-cockaded woodpeckers. Ridley et al. (1997) observed the displacement of a red-cockaded woodpecker by a southern flying squirrel that was released after being captured. Observations of nocturnal displacements of red-cockaded woodpeckers by flying squirrels, however, are lacking. Due to the difficulty of observing interspecific interactions, determining the mechanisims by which flying squirrels impact red-cockaded woodpeckers is problematic...|$|R
