50|$|The holotype, CV OO722, {{was found}} in a layer of the late Upper Shaximiao Formation, {{probably}} dating from the early Kimmeridgian. It consists of a partial skeleton including a fragmentary skull, of an adult individual. It contains a number of individual dorsal vertebrae, a series of dorsal vertebrae found in articulation with the sacrum and pelvis, seven tail vertebrae, ribs, seven chevrons, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> scapulocoracoid, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> humerus, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> radius, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> second metacarpal, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> thighbone, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> shinbone, <b>a</b> <b>left</b> fibula, metacarpals, <b>a</b> phalanx, several back plates and <b>a</b> <b>left</b> shoulder spine. The main lacking parts are the neck and the tail end. The skull bones found are so fragmentary that they provide little relevant information. A 2006 paper by Susannah Maidment states that the only fossil specimen could not be located.|$|R

5|$|Although {{only one}} bomb {{fell on the}} Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War <b>left</b> <b>a</b> greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz, high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, {{destroying}} several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.|$|E

5|$|Bean {{was born}} in Handsworth, a suburb of Sheffield, which was then part of West Riding of Yorkshire (the County of South Yorkshire was created in 1974). He {{is the son of}} Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a {{fabrication}} shop that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which <b>left</b> <b>a</b> piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking and <b>left</b> <b>a</b> large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.|$|E

5|$|Following a short illness, on {{the night}} of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the {{relatively}} early age of 45, possibly due to chronic malaria.

This <b>left</b> <b>a</b> legal vacuum, and raised the question of who would lead the Empire's government.|$|E
