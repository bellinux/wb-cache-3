50|$|Home roasters {{can choose}} from various types of {{roasting}} equipment, {{each of which has}} certain attributes that can alter the flavor. A roasting profile describes the time the beans spend at each temperature during roasting including the final temperature prior to cooling. This greatly affects the flavor, aroma, and body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coffee. Home roasters {{go to great lengths to}} control these roasting parameters including using computers or programmable controllers for process control and data logging. Manually controlled equipment makes precise and repeatable profile control more difficult, though an experienced roaster can produce very good results. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobby is experimenting with the roasting profile to produce optimal tasting coffee, albeit subjective.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E

In 1994 Cecil and Noirin Carmody met with Sean Brennan, then-head of publishing at Virgin Interactive, and Virgin agreed to publish the game's PC version, but were not interested in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to publish the game for the console. Tony Warriner and David Sykes were the game's designer-programmer Carmody the executive producer. The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine, as do Revolution's previous two games.|$|E
40|$|In Burkina Faso, {{informal}} mining camps attract {{girls and}} women from rural areas because they {{offer a variety of}} income generating activities and access to urban consumer goods. Moreover, migration to the mines also allows for a different life-style and greater personal freedom. On the other hand, by going to the mining camps, {{girls and women}} risk acquiring a bad reputation in their communities because they are suspected of having illicit sexual relationships. In fact, relationships with gold miners and the material benefits connected with them are among <b>the</b> <b>lures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold mines. Thus, from a female perspective migration to the gold mines is fraught with ambivalence, which is expressed in songs performed by female day labourers.

50|$|As Ernest {{develops}} into a young man, {{he travels}} a bumpy theological road, reflecting the divisions and controversies in <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> England in <b>the</b> Victorian era.

He then falls for <b>the</b> <b>lures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Church (and is duped out of much {{of his own money}} by a fellow clergyman). He decides that the way to regenerate <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> England is to live among the poor, but the results are, first, that his faith in <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor he was hoping to redeem, and, second, that under <b>the</b> pressures <b>of</b> poverty and theological doubt, he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he has incorrectly believed to be of loose morals.|$|R
25|$|The {{events of}} {{the latter half of}} 1718 {{represent}} {{a turning point in the}} history of piracy in the New World. Without a safe base and in the growing pressure from naval forces, the rovers lost their momentum. The <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish treasures had faded, and the hunters gradually became the hunted. By early 1719, the remaining pirates were on the run. Most of them headed for West Africa, seizing poorly defended slavers.|$|E
25|$|Plato's philosopher, {{in search}} of the real and the true, must turn away from this {{transitory}} realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Sioux Falls {{revolves}} around the cascades of the Big Sioux River. The falls were created about 14,000 years ago during the last ice age.

Ho-Chunk, Ioway, Otoe, Missouri, Omaha (and Ponca at the time), Quapaw, Kansa, Osage, Arikira, Dakota, and Cheyenne people inhabited and settled the region previous to Europeans and European descendants. Numerous burial mounds still exist on the high bluffs near the river and are spread throughout the general vicinity. Indigenous people maintained an agricultural society with fortified villages, and the later arrivals rebuilt {{on many of the}} same sites that were previously settled. Lakota populate urban and reservation communities in the contemporary state and many Lakota, Dakota, and numerous other Indigenous Americans reside in Sioux Falls today.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2012, a {{crew from}} {{television}} networks NHK and Discovery Channel captured what they describe as [...] "the first-ever footage {{of a live}} giant squid in its natural habitat". The footage was revealed on a NHK Special on 13 January 2013, and was shown on Discovery Channel's show Monster Squid: The Giant Is Real on 27 January 2013, and on Giant Squid: Filming the Impossible – Natural World Special on BBC Two. The squid was about [...] long and was missing its feeding tentacles, likely from a failed attack by a sperm whale. It was drawn into viewing range by both artificial bioluminescence created to mimic panicking Atolla jellyfish and by using a Thysanoteuthis rhombus (diamond squid) as bait. The giant squid was filmed feeding for about 23 minutes by Tsunemi Kubodera until it departed.

25|$|The {{popular and}} {{successful}} balletic Dracula adaptation by Michael Pink and Christopher Gable premiered in 1997, {{to commemorate the}} centenary publication of the novel. It was created for the Northern Ballet Theatre in the United Kingdom. The production stays as faithful to the book as possible in non-verbal theatre. Original music was composed by Philip Feeney, the Naxos recording of the score has remained a top seller. Sets and costumes were designed by Lez Brotherston, whose career as a designer for dance began with NBT. Lighting was by Paul Pyant. The production has been seen throughout the world, most companies presenting the work more than once during the last decade. It is the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel that makes this as popular in the dance world as the film industry.

25|$|During June 1990, Graney, Hayward and Moore {{travelled}} to London {{and recorded}} I Was the Hunter... and I Was the Prey with Blair on bass guitar, Ross on guitar, and Vause on piano. The album {{was produced by}} Vinall at a Croydon home studio run by former Procol Harum organist Matthew Fisher. The cover by Western shows Graney with full 'Hickock' curled moustache and velvet pomp. It was not issued until May 1992, due to problems with the label, under the name Dave Graney with the Coral Snakes. In mid-1991, the band had moved back to Melbourne with a line-up of Blair, Graney, Moore, and Hayward; with Robin Casinader on keyboards (ex-the Wreckery). In July 1992, they released a live album, <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tropics on the Torn & Frayed label on Shock Records. It was recorded at St Kilda's Prince of Wales Hotel. A week earlier the group had performed their Little Big Horn Show and first presented the title track. The cover art was by Mahony, the album featured three other improvised tracks and was originally mixed by Phil McKellar – it was re-released in 1997 with extra tracks and remixed by Tony Cohen.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, when Cecil {{was still}} working at Activison, he decided to set up his own {{development}} studio. He contacted Tony Warriner, {{who had worked with}} him at Artic Computing and Paragon Programming, and Warriner brought in a fellow programmer, David Sykes. Together with Noirin Carmody, his then-partner and General Manager at Activision UK, they founded Revolution Software (March 1990). The company was originally located in Hull, but moved to York in 1994. Besides becoming Revolution's managing director, Cecil would focus from the start on writing and design. At that time the graphic adventure genre was dominated by LucasArts and Sierra On-Line, and they wanted to create something in between, an adventure game that didn't take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story. For Revolution's first title, Cecil conceived with others an innovative game engine, called Virtual Theatre, and the engine itself was designed by Tony Warriner. The result was <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress (1992), and though it was their first product, it became one of the successful games that would follow. For the second title, Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), often referred to as a cult classic, Cecil contacted comic book artist Dave Gibbons. He had met Gibbons when he was still at Activision, and he admired Gibbons's work on Watchmen. Gibbons became involved {{in the design of the}} game, and their collaboration would inspire Cecil's next move.|$|E

500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky {{became the}} second game to use Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, after <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress. According to Cecil, the {{original}} version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky, {{as the ability to}} issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create. <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event, whereas Beneath a Steel Sky had multiple threads. In one way this presented them with [...] "exciting gameplay opportunities, but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of multilinearity." [...] As a consequence, some of the engine's features were scaled back. Tony Warriner and David Sykes, both Revolution co-founders and programmers, had to update the engine, which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive. As an example of change in the updated engine, Virtual Theatre 2.0, Warriner explained that in <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress, the system controlled everything, for instance specific routines to a door. So if there was a door on-screen, the door-routine was called up to handle it. The consequence was that every door looked the same and acted the same, so if a door was somewhat different from the last one, it caused a problem. This was changed in the new system, as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key.|$|E
500|$|Cecil was the game's {{director}} and writer, Tony Warriner and David Sykes the designer-programmers, and Noirin Carmody the executive producer. The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine, as do <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress and Beneath a Steel Sky. [...] The game's final cost was one million pounds. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002, {{and to the}} Palm OS and Windows Mobile in 2006.|$|E
500|$|<b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temptress was {{the first}} game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which allowed in-game {{characters}} to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing [...] "every day life" [...] actions, which had not previously been featured in a game. It was later used for Beneath a Steel Sky and {{the first two games}} in the Broken Sword series. The title cost between 20 and 30 thousand pounds.|$|E
