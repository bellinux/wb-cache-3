5|$|A <b>Love</b> Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of <b>love,</b> including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A <b>Love</b> Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in <b>love.</b> They want their <b>love</b> to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure <b>love.</b> This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this <b>love.</b> As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to <b>love</b> himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his <b>love</b> secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly <b>love,</b> Troilus' <b>love</b> remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E
5|$|Courtly <b>love</b> was the eroticisation of <b>love</b> {{between the}} nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly <b>love</b> told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of <b>love</b> between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with <b>love</b> and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented <b>love</b> and the base, natural desires of man.
