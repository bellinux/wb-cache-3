40|$|Abstract. In identity-based (ID-based) cryptosystems, a <b>local</b> <b>registration</b> <b>authority</b> (LRA) is {{responsible}} for authentication of users while the key generation center (KGC) {{is responsible}} for computing and sending the private keys to users and therefore, a secure channel is required. For privacy-oriented applications, {{it is important to}} keep in secret whether the private key corresponding to a certain identity has been requested. All of the existing ID-based key issuing schemes have not addressed this anonymity issue. Besides, the separation of duties for authentication and private key computation has not been discussed as well. In this paper, based on a signature scheme similar to a short blind signature, we propose a novel separable and anonymous ID-based key issuing scheme without secure channel. Our protocol supports the separation of duties between LRA and KGC. The private key computed by the KGC can be sent to the user in an encrypted form such that only the legitimate key requester authenticated by LRA can decrypt it, and any eavesdropper cannot know the identity corresponding to the secret key.

40|$|International audienceWith a boom {{in online}} {{services}} generally accessed through a login/password couple, Internet users have an ever increasing number of digital identities. Indeed, Internet was not originally designed with the digital identity idea and, some solutions have been proposed to deploy digital-identity management architectures using existing standards and protocols such as InfoCard standard that is a user-centric approach or Liberty Alliance standard {{that is based on}} the notion of identity federation. Typical identity management architecture requires basic components like an identity provider (IDP) that authenticates the user in a secure manner allowing him/her to access to a service provider (SP) that provides services and an attribute provider (AP) to supply the user attributes to any authorized agent while not compromising privacy. Our presentation tries to bring a solution to some requirements by implementing a comprehensive platform that allows new secure electronic services while ensuring privacy within a transparent and interoperable federated identity management. The requirements are: - the user must have control on his personal data, - a great number of certificates must be provided to users with low cost, - privacy must be preserved, and - multiple services may belong to distinct spheres and accessible via various material supports like usb key, smart card or a mobile equipment. In this context, a new PKI-based protocol, called " 2. 0 ", has been proposed to guarantee secure access to electronic services at low cost. Based on three levels, PKI 2. 0 protocol integrates: - An international hierarchical PKI that delivers and manages server certificates for identity providers, service providers and attribute providers. - An internal hierarchical PKI deployed by each registration authority (associated to each circle of trust) for all its agencies. - A "user" PKI, non hierarchical (without Certification Authorities), that addresses final users. The first step of our contribution concerns the "user" PKI that integrates an entity called electronic notary used instead of a certification authority, allowing the registration of new users (citizen/consumer/professional) within a registration authority that may be a proximity agency (telecom agency, banking agency) viewed as a trust third party. The proposed crypto-system is based on the same principle whatever asymmetric algorithm is used. The <b>local</b> <b>registration</b> <b>authority</b> delivers a "public key certificate" to the user (not signed by a Certification Authority) along with a private key using his usb key, his smart card or his cell phone. The <b>local</b> <b>registration</b> <b>authority</b> also generates and uploads the "public key property certificate" of the user (not signed by a Certification Authority) to its central electronic notary server through a secure channel. Thus, anyone, any IDP, any application and any process can request this electronic notary server to authenticate the digital identity of the user, letting it access at any time services belonging to distinct circles of trust. The second step occurs after the authentication is completed, and enables the user to automatically preserve his privacy during his electronic transactions by comparing the privacy policy of the SP against his privacy preferences. That is, on one hand, the SP is required to express his policy into our own XPACML language (eXtensible Privacy Access Control Markup Language), i. e. its own list of required/optional data attributes according to their categories, along with the associated P 3 P basic tags proposed by the P 3 P platform: Purpose, Recipient, and Retention. On the other hand, the user defines his preference for each of his ID card, for each data category and for each data attribute. According to our newly defined P 3 P tag classification, upon receiving the SPs policy {{at the beginning of the}} transaction, the user is able to compare the XPACML policy sent by the SP against the preference of the user. In case each unitary negotiation relative to one piece of the policy is successfully done, then the whole negotiation is successful, otherwise, it fails...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen {{major change in}} {{agricultural}} technologies as a consequence to various programs for an agricultural development in rural areas of Sabah. Villagers in Sabah have always been receptive to new agricultural technologies that promises to improve {{their standard of living}} and as a reflection from the promotion of new agricultural technologies, many peoples in rural areas in Sabah now working with a mix of traditional and modern technologies. Along with the adoption of modern technologies, there has been a rapid transformation to cash economy among rural areas in Sabah (Marten, 1990). However, most villagers in Sabah are still produce almost entirely for home consumption, although the other economic activity of rural peoples in Sabah is small-enterprises as well as “kedai kampung” or rural shop that is registered under the <b>local</b> <b>registration</b> <b>authority.</b> This means, meeting basic household food needs is still the priority of most farmers in Sabah. Most also produced as much as surplus as possible to meet cash needs generated by expanding public education, rural electrification, modern communication (e. g. Radio and Television), and modern transport. It confirmed that most rural societies in Sabah still run their subsistence agricultural economy as compared to cash economy, which generally in farm activities, men do the major task and the women do the very minor task. Alongside with the fact that in this post-modern world most rural society in Sabah involved in agricultural economy, rural population especially among youth has declined. This means that human force for agricultural sector is declined as well. Rural population in Sabah was declining due to migration of younger-age groups. Outward migration among them was caused by the economic purposes such as to find non-agricultural financial resources (work in government sector either in the white or blue collar works). As according to Bryden (2000) villagers often migrated because the trend in agricultural income that is reported as lower than income from other economic activities. Some of them were migrated to the urban areas when they employed as the non-government professional executive level and further their education. Some other (female) moved to follow husband. In short, they were migrated because of work-related reason and to get social fulfillment in the form of further education, social amenities and the family reason. This phenomenon in the future, out migration of youth will leave the youngsters and old folks to maintain the village and at the end, population of rural areas in Sabah will be increasingly independent. Village-base economy especially agricultural production will suffer when the active youth have left for the town. In the other hand, rural poverty profile that is currently high will be increased. Hence, commercialization of agricultural sectors in rural areas assumed as the best resolution to improve villager’s standard of living that is bring about transformation of rural agrarian society from the traditional society to modern agrarian society through contract farming system. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} identity-based {{encryption}} (IBE) was proposed as an economical alternative to public-key infrastructures. IBE {{is also a}} useful building block in various cryptographic primitives such as searchable encryption. A generalization of IBE is attribute-based encryption (ABE). A major application of ABE is fine-grained cryptographic access control of data. Research on these topics is still actively continuing. However, security and privacy of IBE and ABE are hinged {{on the assumption that}} the authority which setups the system is honest. Our study aims to reduce this trust assumption. The inherent key escrow of IBE has sparkled numerous debates in the cryptography/security community. A curious key generation center (KGC) can simply generate the user’s private key to decrypt a ciphertext. However, can a KGC still decrypt if it does not know the intended recipient of the ciphertext? This question is answered by formalizing KGC anonymous ciphertext indistinguishability (ACI-KGC). All existing practical pairing-based IBE schemes without random oracles do not achieve this notion. In this thesis, we propose an IBE scheme with ACI-KGC, and a new system architecture with an anonymous secret key generation protocol such that the KGC can issue keys to authenticated users without knowing the list of users' identities. This also matches the practice that authentication should be done with the <b>local</b> <b>registration</b> <b>authorities.</b> Our proposal can be viewed as mitigating the key escrow problem in a new dimension. For ABE, it is not realistic to trust a single authority to monitor all attributes and hence distributing control over many attribute-authorities is desirable. A multi-authority ABE scheme can be realized with a trusted central authority (CA) which issues part of the decryption key according to a user's global identifier (GID). However, this CA may have the power to decrypt every ciphertext, and the use of a consistent GID allowed the attribute-authorities to collectively build a full profile with all of a user's attributes. This thesis proposes a solution without the trusted CA and without compromising users' privacy, thus making ABE more usable in practice. Underlying both contributions are our new privacy-preserving architectures enabled by borrowing techniques from anonymous credential...|$|R
