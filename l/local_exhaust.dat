40|$|The {{information}} concerning dispersed composition and concentration of dust particles which are caught by <b>local</b> <b>exhausts</b> {{is necessary for}} scientific proved choice of dust retaining devices. To receive this information {{it is necessary to}} apply the stochastic [1] and determinate methods [2]. The last ones are based on the studying of single dust particles behavior and on the determination of maximum diameter of the caught particles or on the composition of their bordering trajectories. The main objective of this scientific paper is to work out the methods of dispersed composition prediction and dust concentration in extracting <b>local</b> <b>exhausts</b> air in the areas of arbitrary geometry taking into account vortical transitional currents which occur as a result of abrupt modification of area configuration. The mentioned method is based on the introduction of finite number of different fractions dust particles into the stream at every design moment of definite time period and on the tracing of their behavior until they are caught or precipitated. The stream of air current is designed {{on the basis of the}} method of discontinuous vortexes. Vortical transitional currents are formed as a result of current isolation from sharp edges of area border, and also from smooth surface on the spot of tangential gear constituent change. The program of air- and coal currents calculation near the <b>local</b> <b>exhausts</b> of different kinds is worked out. The concentration calculation and the design of dispersed dust composition in aspirated air of rotating cylinder-exhaust placed in aspirated cover is carried out. The geometric and kinematics parameters at which the minimum carry-over of dust particles into aspiration net are revealed. The worked out computer program allows to determine the most optimum geometric and aerodynamic properties of <b>local</b> <b>exhausts</b> in aspiration system. The conducted researches of air- and coal currents of such program allowed to state the scheme of energy-efficient aspiration cover with the functions of dust precipitation chamber...|$|R

40|$|Many {{production}} technologies {{generate a}} variety of gas pollutants, which are unhealthy. The aim is therefore to minimize the content of such gas pollutants in the work environment. The highest capture efficiency of gas pollutants offers the <b>local</b> <b>exhausting.</b> Its disadvantage is the necessity to surround the source of pollutants, or to be {{as close as possible}} which is usually not technically or technologically possible. A possible alternative is to use a reinforced exhaust system that achieves greater capture distances. In the initial stage of the solution of the dissertation, a review of reinforced exhaust systems was carried out. Further, an existing measurement system was modified for measurements with the partition above the exhaust slot and the measurement system was partially automated. In order to investigate the case with pollutants having a lower density than the air, the workbench - the partition was moved above the exhaust slot. Based on of the literature review, a modification of the reinforced slot exhaust system was proposed. The modification consisted in the adjustment of the air inlet adjustment where a set of holes and a tube assembly were used instead of the slot. Such setup allowed for higher flow turbulence and thus for an increased exhaust efficiency. Subsequently, the inlet streams from the slot, holes and tubes were visualized by the smoke method. Further measurements were carried out by the tracer gas method for the determination of the exhaust efficiency. Measurements of velocity fields in front of the proposed configurations of the reinforced slot exhaust hood were also carried out. In conclusion, an energy performance assessment was carried out by means of the measurement of the electric power input to the fans with the determination of the electric loss power...|$|R
