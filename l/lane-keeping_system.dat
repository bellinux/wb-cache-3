40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{combining}} automatic lane-keeping and driver's steering for either obstacle avoidance or lane-change maneuvers for passing purposes or any other desired maneuvers, through a closed-loop control strategy. The automatic lane-keeping control loop is never opened, and no on/off switching strategy is used. During the driver's maneuver, the vehicle lateral dynamics are controlled by the driver himself through the vehicle steering system. When there is no driver's steering action, the vehicle center of gravity tracks the center of the traveling lane thanks to the automatic <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>system.</b> At the beginning (end) of the maneuver, the lane-keeping task is released (resumed) safely and smoothly.

40|$|In {{classical}} <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>systems</b> {{drivers are}} warned of lane-departures by acoustic, visual or haptic advices. Thus, {{an association between}} the signal and the desired action has to be established. Because this association is vulnerable to interference and decay, the functionality of cognitive systems is suboptimal. Our new approach uses behavioural strategies. By eliciting a steering-reflex, {{the attention of the}} driver is attracted and the correct reaction is initiated. This principle was explored with 28 participants in a driving simulator. First results already demonstrate the functionality of the principle. Eliciting the appropriate reaction prevented road departures...|$|R
40|$|Many {{systems have}} been created which can keep an {{autonomous}} vehicle within a driving lane, but little experimental work {{has been reported that}} describes methods to transition a vehicle between lanes. Three techniques to accomplish lane transition using the ALVINN lane keeping system are reported here. The most basic involves intelligently switching between two trained ALVINN networks. The other techniques use active control of virtual camera views to move the vehicle into the destination lane. Introduction Much progress has been made toward solving the autonomous lane keeping problem using vision-based methods. Systems have been demonstrated which can drive robot vehicles at high speeds for long distances. The current challenge for vision-based on-road navigation researchers is to create systems that maintain the performance of the existing <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>systems,</b> while adding the ability to execute tactical level driving tasks like transitioning from one lane to another.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{intelligent}} automated <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>system</b> is proposed and implemented on our vehicle platform, i. e., TAIWAN iTS- 1. This system challenges the online integrating heterogeneous {{systems such as}} a real-time vision system, a lat-eral controller, in-vehicle sensors, and a steering wheel actuating motor. The implemented vision system detects the lane markings ahead of the vehicle, regardless of the varieties in road appear-ance, and determines the desired trajectory based on the relative positions of the vehicle {{with respect to the}} center of the road. To achieve more humanlike driving behavior such as smooth turning, particularly at high levels of speed, a fuzzy gain scheduling (FGS) strategy is introduced to compensate for the feedback controller for appropriately adapting to the SW command. Instead of man-ual tuning by trial and error, the methodology of FGS is designed to ensure that the closed-loop system can satisfy the crossove...|$|E

This thesis briefly reviews different types of active safety systems designed to reduce the number of accidents. Focusing on lane departure, a leading cause of crashes involving fatalities, we examine a <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>system</b> proposed by Minoiu Enache et al. They proposed a switched linear feedback (LMI) controller and provided two switching laws, which limit driver torque and displacement of the front wheels from the center of the lane. 	In this thesis, a state feedback (LQR) controller has been designed. Also, a new switching logic has been proposed which is based on driver's torque, lateral offset of the vehicle from the center of the lane and relative yaw angle. The controller activates assistance torque when the driver is deemed inattentive. It is deactivated when the driver regains control. Matlab/Simulink modeling and simulation environment is used to verify the results of the controller. In comparison to the earlier switching strategies, the maximum values of the state variables lie very close to the set of bounds for normal driving zone. Also, analysis of the controller’s root locus shows an improvement in the damping factor, implying better system response...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology for mod- elling human lane keeping control by characterizing a unique concept of elementary steering pulses, which are motor primi- tives in man-vehicle systems. The novelty {{of the paper}} is the introduction of elementary steering pulses that have been evidently extracted from naturalistic driving data through machine learning techniques (data-driven modelling), and are incorporated into an alternative steering control scheme. This newly proposed hybrid- open-closed- loop (HOCL) control scheme, where an elementary steering pulse starts with an open loop, representing real human’s reflex responses triggered by human lane keeping errors, and is adjusted back with the traditional close-loop control, has shown a significant improvement on both the stability and matching performance to real driving events. Online measurement of the key metrics in the steering process provides a new tool for monitoring driver states, and the biofidelic steering model may provide human-like qualities for future automated <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>systems.</b> Both will add to the array of tools available for achieving autonomous and semi-autonomous driving systems, which greatly benefits the current vehicle industry...|$|R
40|$|Currently, new-build {{vehicles}} {{are more and}} more equipped with various driver assistance and automation systems, ranging from adaptive-cruise-control, stop-and-go, active brake assist and emergency-brake systems for longitudinal control, blind-spot monitoring and <b>lane-keeping</b> <b>systems</b> for lateral control to parking assistance and advanced navigation systems. Through new emerging technologies, the integration of nomadic devices, Vehicle- 2 -X Communication in existing and new driver assistance and automation systems are the near future. The rising complexity due to more integrated, interactive and cooperative future assistance systems leads to increasing demands on driving simulators, used to develop and evaluate these devices in a time and cost efficient way. Thus, a number of driving simulators of the DLR Institute of Transportation Systems have been built or were upgraded with the major goal to provide a flexible, modular and scalable infrastructure, concerning both software and hardware, which enables a flexible set-up of the driving simulator according to the requirements of the test case – and not vice-versa!

40|$|Lane-keeping control {{forms an}} {{integral}} part of fully automated intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) and its reliable operation is critical to the operation of an automated highway. In this paper, we present the design of a fault detection filter for the <b>lane-keeping</b> control <b>systems</b> onboard vehicles used by California-PATH, USA in its automated highways program. We use a Luenberger structure for the fault detection filters and tune the observer gains based on an H-infinity-based cost. Such a choice of cost was motivated by the need to explicitly incorporate frequency-domain-based performance objectives. The linear matrix inequality (LMI) -based formulation of an H-infinity optimization problem of Luenberger state observers does not allow for the augmentation with dynamic performance weightings in the optimization objective, since it makes the problem a nonconvex optimization problem. We present an algorithm to locally solve the problem of the design of Luenberger state observers using H-infinity optimization by transforming the problem into an H-infinity static output feedback controller problem. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the tuning methodology by comparing the fault detection performance of filters that use H. Luenberger observers versus those that use Kalman filters. Implementation issues of the observers are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Haptic shared {{control is}} {{expected}} to achieve a smooth collaboration between humans and automated systems, because haptics facilitate mutual communication. A methodology for sharing a given task is important to achieve effective shared control. Therefore, the appropriate cooperative relationship between a human operator and automated system should be considered. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the cooperative status between the operator and the automated system in the haptic shared control of a steering operation using a pseudo-power pair of torque from each agent and the vehicle lateral velocity as each agent's contribution to vehicle motion. This method allows us to estimate cooperative status based on two axes: the initiative holder and the intent consistency between the two agents. A control method for a <b>lane-keeping</b> assist <b>system</b> (LKAS) that enables drivers to change lanes smoothly is proposed based on the estimated cooperative status. A gain-tuning control method based on the estimated cooperative status is proposed to decrease the assistance system's pseudo-power when intent inconsistency occurs. A method for switching the followed lane to match the driver's and assistance system's intentions is also proposed. A user study using a driving simulator is conducted to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods facilitate smooth driver-initiated lane changes without significantly affecting the driver's torque or steering wheel angle while significantly improve lane-keeping performance.
