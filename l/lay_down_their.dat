Ferguson issued a {{challenge}} to the rebel militias to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms or suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson.|$|E

5|$|In late October 1813, Hurshid Pasha {{declared}} a general amnesty for the rebels that had survived, though Karađorđe and some senior Serbian religious leaders were specifically exempted. Many rebel leaders accepted Hurshid Pasha's offer of amnesty {{and agreed to}} <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms, the most notable of these being Miloš Obrenović, the rebel commander in Užice. A large number of Serb refugees subsequently returned to their homes, as did many of the Muslims that had been displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} Soviets and a civil war. Over {{the next few years}} the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E
5|$|The regiments of the Bar Confederation, whose {{executive}} board {{had been forced}} to leave Austria (which previously supported them) after Austria joined the Prusso-Russian alliance, did not <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms. Many fortresses in their command held out as long as possible; Wawel Castle in Kraków fell only at the end of April; Tyniec fortress held until the end of July 1772; Częstochowa, commanded by Kazimierz Pułaski, held until late August. In the end, the Bar Confederation was defeated, with its members either fleeing abroad or being deported to Siberia by the Russians.|$|E

50|$|Harold Coyle's novel The Ten Thousand (1993) {{shows the}} bulk of the US Forces in modern Europe {{fighting}} their way across and out of Germany, instead of <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons, after the Germans steal nuclear weapons that are being removed from Ukraine. The operational concept for the novel was based on Xenophon's account of the Ten Thousand.|$|R
60|$|At first, {{the news}} seemed too terrible to be true. People seemed stunned {{at the thought}} of a hundred {{thousand}} Frenchmen <b>laying</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms.

5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque. He also received a promise that his ailing mother would receive medical care.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1942 as a company, {{the unit}} {{consisted}} mainly of Yugoslav Volksdeutsche and recruits from South Tyrol. Although focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw {{action in the}} wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E

5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his victim, in close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked to death with a sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Germanicus reached Pannonia, Severus was {{attacked}} in Moesia, but successfully repelled the rebels. By the time Germanicus arrived the rebels had withdrawn to mountain fortresses {{from which they}} launched raids. The Romans were tactically unsuited at countering raids, so Tiberius had to utilize his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments to cover more ground. Tiberius {{appears to have been}} conducting a war of attrition against the rebels who were now occupying strong defensive positions. In addition, the Romans began working to drive the rebels out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any tribes that would <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms, and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have been hoping to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{deploying}} Belgian troops {{against the}} mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the Force Publique the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted {{by at least}} one rank. Victor Lundula was promoted directly from sergeant-major to major-general and head of the army, replacing Janssens. At the same time, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became deeply concerned by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees.|$|E

5|$|Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and a German {{battalion}} from Banja Lukaabout 10,000 soldiersattacked the Partisan-held {{territory in}} Kozara on 18August 1941. The enemy troops {{broke through the}} Partisan front line and penetrated into the area. They burnt houses and looted cattle and grain in the villages. Some of the villagers became demoralised, and blamed the Partisans for their losses; some placed white flags on their houses. The Partisan units retreated deeper into forested areas in the mountains. Stojanović led the Kozara Detachment toward Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara. In the evening, he assembled his men {{and told them that}} they were in the army of the KPJ and all peoples of Yugoslavia, so they could not allow themselves to be attached to any specific village or area. He advised those who could not detach themselves from their homes to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons and leave. Several men left the detachment, which then moved toward Lisina where they organised a camp and spent some time in military training and political indoctrination. The attack of 18August was the first counter-insurgency operation in Kozara, and the Partisans emerged from it without significant losses.|$|E
5|$|In 424 BC, Perdiccas {{began to}} play a {{prominent}} role in the Peloponnesian War by aiding the Spartan general Brasidas in convincing Athenian allies in Thrace to defect and ally with Sparta. After failing to convince Perdiccas II to make peace with Arrhabaeus of Lynkestis (a small region of Upper Macedonia), Brasidas agreed to aid the Macedonian fight against Arrhabaeus, although he expressed his concerns about leaving his Chalcidian allies to their own devices against Athens, as well as the fearsome Illyrian reinforcements arriving on the side of Arrhabaeus. The massive combined force commanded by Arrhabaeus apparently caused the army of Perdiccas II to flee in haste before the battle began, which enraged the Spartans under Brasidas, who proceeded to snatch pieces of the Macedonian baggage train left unprotected. Subsequently, Perdiccas II not only made peace with Athens but switched sides, blocking Peloponnesian reinforcements from reaching Brasidas via Thessaly. The treaty offered Athens economic concessions, but it also guaranteed internal stability in Macedonia since Arrhabaeus and other domestic detractors were convinced to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms and accept Perdiccas II as their suzerain lord.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions that specify land grants, {{rights and}} {{ownership}} were descriptive of {{the boundaries of}} demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included {{was the type of}} soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E

5|$|Daphnomeles {{participated in}} the {{subsequent}} conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, {{for which he is}} given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronista, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist. He rejected both bribes and threats from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, he climbed the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would not have come alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building crying for revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms and seek the emperor's pardon.|$|E
