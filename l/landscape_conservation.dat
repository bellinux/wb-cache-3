50|$|<b>Landscape</b> level <b>conservation</b> {{is carried}} out {{in a number of}} ways. A {{wildlife}} corridor, for example, is a connection between otherwise isolated habitat patches that are proposed as a solution to habitat fragmentation. In some <b>landscape</b> level <b>conservation</b> approaches, a key species vulnerable to landscape alteration is identified and its habitat requirements are assessed in order to identify the best option for protecting their ecosystem. However, lining up the habitat requirements of numerous species in an ecosystem can be difficult, which is why more comprehensive approaches to further understand these variations have been considered in <b>landscape</b> level <b>conservation.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Landscape</b> scale <b>conservation</b> is an {{emerging}} framework {{that refers to}} the ability to conceive, plan, finance and manage projects with significant natural conservation value while incorporating the cultural and economic activities of people situated in those landscapes. This framework is examined within the context of shifting conceptions of the mechanisms, scale, purpose and rationale behind land conservation, as well as in consideration of the concurrently evolving thought and practice of sustainable development. The goals of this exercise are twofold. First, drawing upon a literature review and three case studies this thesis seeks to introduce <b>landscape</b> scale <b>conservation</b> as {{an emerging}} field of expertise with relevance to issues of community growth and character, economic opportunity and environmental quality in Colorado. Second, this thesis seeks to glean insights, both positive and negative, from three case studies that may in turn lead to policy and/or programmatic recommendations for how <b>landscape</b> scale <b>conservation</b> efforts can achieve their ambitious goals. The central assertion of this thesis is that innovative projects consistent with <b>landscape</b> scale <b>conservation</b> are being undertaken in Colorado at the urban- rural interface. However, significant challenges remain and the cases examined in this thesis reveal limitations of <b>landscape</b> scale <b>conservation</b> and affirm ongoing efforts to address these limitations, and point to complimentary policies - such as growth management - that should be given consideration. The efficacy of these conservation efforts should be of interest to planners, conservationists, government agencies and private citizens who frequently have vested interests in the many environmental, economic and socio-political policies that <b>landscape</b> scale <b>conservation</b> implicates. by Peter Ericson.

2500|$|As {{a highly}} {{interdisciplinary}} field in systems science, landscape ecology integrates biophysical and analytical approaches with humanistic and holistic perspectives across {{the natural sciences}} and social sciences. [...] Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings. [...] The most salient characteristics of landscape ecology are its emphasis on the relationship among pattern, process and scale, and its focus on broad-scale ecological and environmental issues. These necessitate the coupling between biophysical and socioeconomic sciences. [...] Key research topics in landscape ecology include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, and <b>landscape</b> <b>conservation</b> and sustainability.|$|E
2500|$|Sheep grazing of the herding {{areas is}} {{necessary}} for the conservation of the semidry and dry meadows. However, encroachment of scrub such as blackthorne, rose, juniper, and ash has greatly increased at many places on the mountain despite the presence of herds belonging to two sheep farms (northern side: approx. 600 ewes, southern side: approx. 1000 ewes). Without additional mechanical maintenance the open space on the mountain will not remain open in the long term. Since 1997 the municipality of Ehingen has struck out in new directions to deal with the conservation of these vast herding areas on Hesselberg's northern slopes. Annual civil campaigns of important [...] "descrubbing" [...] and maintenance tasks are performed as a collaboration between the Landschaftspflegeverband Mittelfranken (Middle Franconian <b>Landscape</b> <b>Conservation</b> Association) and the shepherd Hans Goth.
