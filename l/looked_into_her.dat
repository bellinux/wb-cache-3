500|$|As the Fringe {{division}} {{sets out}} to Roland's home, Roland injects Amanda's body {{with more of the}} serum, and she is brought back to life. By the time Fringe arrives, Roland gives himself up willingly, and they find Amanda dead again. Roland explains that though she was alive, when he <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes, he realized she wasn't the same person and thus terminated the process. As Roland and Amanda's body are taken away, Olivia breaks down in front of Peter; she questions that if Roland could tell that Amanda wasn't the same person by looking at her eyes, why couldn't Peter do the same with Fauxlivia? Peter is unable to answer her, and a distressed Olivia leaves on her own. As Walter takes Peter to get a milkshake, the two are identified by an Observer, who reports on his phone that [...] "he is still alive".|$|E

[...] He won numerous honors for his college, but he soon fell a victim to Cupid's tackle. [...] There was no hope for Tom after he met that beautiful Kentucky thoroughbred, Miss Elizabeth Sherley.
