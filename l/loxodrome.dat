25|$|Historically, {{navigation}} by <b>loxodrome</b> or {{rhumb line}} {{refers to a}} path of constant bearing; the resulting path is a logarithmic spiral, similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic Möbius transformation makes.

25|$|Nunes, {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the greatest mathematicians of his time, is best known for his contributions in the nautical sciences (navigation and cartography), which he approached, for the first time, in a mathematical way. He was the first to propose the idea of a <b>loxodrome,</b> and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the nonius (from which Vernier scale was derived), named after his Latin surname.|$|E

He {{was the first}} to {{understand}} why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a <b>loxodrome.</b> [...] The later invention of logarithms allowed Leibniz to establish algebraic equations for the <b>loxodrome.</b> These lines —also called rhumb lines— maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection —also called navigator connection.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "loxodrome" [...] is {{from the}} Greek: [...] "λοξος (loxos), {{slanting}} + δρόμος (dromos), course". When sailing on a constant bearing – if you maintain a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the north pole in a logarithmic spiral. On the mercator projection such a course is a straight line, as {{the north and south}} poles project to infinity. The angle that the <b>loxodrome</b> subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the [...] "tightness" [...] of the spiral) is the argument of k. Of course, Möbius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.|$|E
2500|$|... 1537: Much of Portuguese {{mathematician}} and cosmographer Pedro Nunes' work {{related to}} navigation. He {{was the first}} to understand why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a <b>loxodrome.</b> [...] These lines —also called rhumb lines— maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection —also called navigator connection. In his Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart [...] (1537), Nunes argued that a nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used.|$|E

40|$|Bird {{migration}} and orientation at high latitudes are {{of special interest}} because of the difficulties associated with different compass systems in polar areas {{and because of the}} considerable differences between flight routes conforming to <b>loxodromes</b> (rhumblines) or orthodromes (great circle routes). Regular and widespread east-north-east migration of birds from the northern tundra of Siberia towards North America across the Arctic Ocean (without landmark influences) were recorded by ship-based tracking radar studies in July and August. Field observations indicated that waders, including species such as Phalaropusfulicarius and Calidris melanotos, dominated, but also terns and skuas may have been involved. Analysis of flight directions in relation to the wind showed that these movements are not caused by wind drift. Assuming possible orientation principles based on celestial or geomagnetic cues, different flight trajectories across the Arctic Ocean were calculated: geographical <b>loxodromes,</b> sun compass routes, magnetic <b>loxodromes</b> and magnetoclinic routes. The probabilities of these four alternatives are evaluated on the basis of both the availability of required orientation cues and the predicted flight paths. This evaluation supports orientation along sun compass routes. Because of the longitudinal time displacement sun compass routes show gradually changing compass courses in close agreement with orthodromes. It is suggested that an important migration link between Siberia and North American stopover sites 1000 - 2500 km apart across the Arctic Ocean has evolved based on sun compass orientation along orthodrome-like routes...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>loxodrome</b> on {{the surface}} of the earth is a curve of {{constant}} bearing: it meets every parallel of latitude at the same angle. Suppose its bearing is &theta; north of east, so, for example, due east is θ = 0; due north is θ = a right angle; due west is θ = a half circle. The loxodrome's whole length as it goes from the south pole to the north pole is fairly routinely seen to be R csc θ where R is the radius of the earth (in particular if the <b>loxodrome</b> goes straight east, it circles the earth infinitely many times without getting closer to either pole, so its length is ∞.

5000|$|A {{rhumb line}} (also {{known as a}} <b>loxodrome</b> or [...] "spherical spiral") is the curve on a sphere traced by a ship with {{constant}} bearing (e.g., travelling from one pole to the other while keeping a fixed angle {{with respect to the}} meridians). The <b>loxodrome</b> has an infinite number of revolutions, with the separation between them decreasing as the curve approaches either of the poles, unlike an Archimedean spiral which maintains uniform line-spacing regardless of radius.|$|E

Our registration method models the distances {{in between the}} tensors with Geode-sic– <b>Loxodromes</b> and employs a version of Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm to unfold the manifold described with this metric. Defining the same shape properties as tensors, the vector images obtained through MDS are fed into a multi–step vector–image registration scheme and the resulting deformation fields are used to reorient the tensor fields. Results on brain DTI indicate that the proposed method is very suitable for deformable fiber–to–fiber correspondence and DTI–atlas construction. ...|$|R

5000|$|In cartography, the loximuthal {{projection}} is a {{map projection}} introduced by Karl Siemon in 1935, and independently by Waldo R. Tobler, who named it. It {{is characterized by}} the fact that <b>loxodromes</b> (rhumb lines) from one chosen central point (the intersection of the central meridian and central latitude) are shown straight lines, correct in azimuth from the center, and are [...] "true to scale" [...] in the sense that distances measured along such lines are proportional to lengths of the corresponding rhumb lines {{on the surface of the}} earth. It is neither an equal-area projection nor conformal.|$|R
50|$|A {{misunderstanding}} could arise {{because the}} term “rhumb” had no precise meaning {{when it came}} into use. It applied equally well to the windrose lines as it did to <b>loxodromes</b> because the term only applied “locally” and only meant whatever a sailor did in order to sail with constant bearing, with all the imprecision that that implies. Therefore “rhumb” was applicable to the straight lines on portolans when portolans were in use, as well as always applicable to straight lines on Mercator charts. For short distances portolan “rhumbs” do not meaningfully differ from Mercator rhumbs, but these days “rhumb” is synonymous with the mathematically precise “loxodrome” {{because it has been}} made synonymous retrospectively.|$|R

The first approximation focusses on the curves traced on the dome by the wooden laminae, which appear to be <b>loxodromes,</b> cutting the meridians by a constant angle.

50|$|The Mercator {{projection}} is a cylindrical {{map projection}} {{presented by the}} Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because {{of its ability to}} represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or <b>loxodromes,</b> as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians. Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (which makes the projection conformal), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. So, for example, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are relative to land masses near the equator, such as Central Africa.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present note {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of metric connections with vectorial torsion, as already described by E. Cartan in 1925. We show that the geodesics of metric connections with vectorial torsion defined by gradient vector fields coincide with the Levi-Civita geodesics of a conformally equivalent metric. By pullback, this yields a systematic way of constructing invariants of motion for such connections from isometries of the conformally equivalent metric, and we explain in as much this result generalizes the Mercator projection which maps sphere <b>loxodromes</b> to straight lines in the plane. An example shows that Beltrami’s theorem fails for this class of connections. We then study the system of differential equations describing geodesics in the plane for vector fields which are not gradients, and show among others that the Hopf-Rinow theorem does also not hold in general. 1...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{directions}} of birds migrating at high geographic and magnetic latitudes {{can be used}} to test bird orientation by celestial or geomagnetic compass systems under polar conditions. Migration patterns of arctic shorebirds, revealed by tracking radar studies during an icebreaker expedition along the Northwest Passage in 1999, support predicted sun compass trajectories but cannot be reconciled with orientation along either geographic or magnetic <b>loxodromes</b> (rhumb lines). Sun compass routes are similar to orthodromes (great circle routes) at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make transoceanic flights to South America. The observations are also consistent with a migration link between Siberia and the Beaufort Sea region by way of sun compass routes across the Arctic Ocean...|$|R
