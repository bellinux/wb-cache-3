60|$|In {{the wild}} rabbit (figure 13, A a) this vertebra, viewed on the {{inferior}} surface, has a transverse process, which is directed obliquely backwards, {{and consists of}} a single pointed bar; in the fourth vertebra this process is slightly forked in the middle. In the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits this process (B a) is forked in the third vertebra, as in the fourth of the wild rabbit. But the third cervical vertebrae of the wild and <b>lop-eared</b> (A b, B b) rabbits differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular surfaces are compared; for the extremities of the antero-dorsal processes in the wild rabbit are simply rounded, whilst in the <b>lop-eared</b> they are trifid, with a deep central pit. The canal for the spinal marrow in the <b>lop-eared</b> (B b) is more elongated in a transverse direction than in the wild rabbit; and the passages for the arteries are of a slightly different shape. These several differences in this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention.|$|E
60|$|I have {{carefully}} examined skulls of ten large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits, and of five common domestic rabbits, which latter {{differ from}} the <b>lop-eared</b> only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both larger than in the wild rabbit. First for the ten <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits: in all these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its breadth. In a wild rabbit the length was 3.15 inches, in a large fancy rabbit 4.3; whilst {{the breadth of the}} cranium enclosing the brain was in both almost exactly the same. Even by taking as the standard of comparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch, the skulls of the <b>lop-eared</b> are proportionally to their breadth three-quarters of an inch too long. The depth of the head has increased almost in the same proportion with the length; it is the breadth alone which has not increased. The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are less arched, both in a longitudinal and transverse line, than in the wild rabbit, so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different. The surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the lines of sutures are more prominent.|$|E

60|$|Its neural spine {{varies in}} length {{in the wild}} rabbit; being {{sometimes}} very short, but generally more than half {{as long as that}} of the second dorsal; but I have seen it in two large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits three-fourths of the length of that of the second dorsal vertebra.|$|E

60|$|Although the skulls of {{the large}} <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits in {{comparison}} {{with those of the}} wild rabbit are much elongated relatively to their breadth, yet, relatively to the size of body, they are far from elongated. The <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits which I examined were, though not fat, more than twice as heavy as the wild specimens; but the skull was very far from being twice as long. Even if we take the fairer standard of the length of body, from the nose to the anus, the skull is not on an average as long as it ought to be by a third of an inch. In the small feral Porto Santo rabbit, on the other hand, the head relatively to the length of body is about a quarter of an inch too long.|$|E
6000|$|Looking to {{the lower}} half of Table 3, which gives the {{measurements}} of domesticated rabbits, we see that in all the capacity of the skull is less, but in very various degrees, than might have been anticipated according to the length of their skulls, relatively to that of the wild rabbit No. 1. In line 22 the average measurements of seven large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits are given. Now the question arises, has the average capacity of the skull in these seven large rabbits increased as much as might have been expected from the greatly increased size of body. We may endeavour to answer this question in two ways: in the upper half of the Table we have measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits (Nos. 5 to 10), and we find that on an average the skulls are [...] .18 of an inch shorter, and in capacity 91 grains less, than the average length and capacity of the three first wild rabbits on the list. The seven large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits, on an average, have skulls 4.11 inches in length, and 1136 grains in capacity; so that these skulls have increased in length more than five times as much as the skulls of the six small wild rabbits have decreased in length; hence we might have expected that the skulls of the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits would have increased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of the six small rabbits have decreased in capacity; and this would have given an average increased capacity of 455 grains, whilst the real average increase is only 155 grains. Again, the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits have bodies of nearly the same weight and size as the common hare, but their heads are longer; consequently, if the <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits had been wild, it might have been expected that their skulls would have had nearly the same capacity as that of the skull of the hare. But this is far from being the case; for the average capacity of the two hare-skulls (Nos. 23, 24) is so much larger than the average capacity of the seven <b>lop-eared</b> skulls, that the latter would have to be increased 21 per cent to come up to the standard of the hare. (4/23. This standard is apparently considerably too low, for Dr. Crisp ('Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1861 page 86) gives 210 grains as the actual weight of the brain of a hare which weighed 7 pounds, and 125 grains as the weight of the brain of a rabbit which weighed 3 pounds 5 ounces, that is, the same weight as the rabbit No. 1 in my list. Now the contents of the skull of rabbit No. 1 in shot is in my table 972 grains; and according to Dr. Crisp's ratio of 125 to 210, the skull of the hare ought to have contained 1632 grains of shot, instead of only (in the largest hare in my table) 1455 grains.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{posterior}} end of {{the posterior}} sternal bone in the wild rabbit (figure 15, A) is thin and slightly enlarged; {{in some of the}} large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits (B) it is much more enlarged towards the extremity; whilst in other specimens (C) it keeps nearly of the same breadth from end to end, but is much thicker at the extremity.|$|E
60|$|I {{have stated}} that in two cases there were eight instead of seven lumbar {{vertebrae}}. The third lumbar vertebrae in one skeleton of a wild British rabbit, {{and in one of}} the Porto Santo feral rabbits, had a haemal spine; whilst in four skeletons of large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits, and in the Himalayan rabbit, this same vertebra had a well developed haemal spine.|$|E

I resumed my hat, and the rabbit lolloped a lollop or so out of my way.|$|E
60|$|In four wild {{specimens}} this bone {{was almost}} absolutely identical in shape; but in several domesticated breeds shades of differences could be distinguished. In the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits, the whole {{upper part of}} the ilium is straighter, or less splayed outwards, than in the wild rabbit; and the tuberosity on the inner lip of the anterior and {{upper part of the}} ilium is proportionally more prominent.|$|E
60|$|In {{the large}} <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits the only {{difference}} in the lower jaw, in comparison {{with that of the}} wild rabbit, is that the posterior margin of the ascending ramus is broader and more inflected. The teeth in neither jaw present any difference, except that the small incisors, beneath the large ones, are proportionately a little longer. The molar teeth have increased in size proportionately with the increased width of the skull, measured across the zygomatic arch, and not proportionally with its increased length. The inner line of the sockets of the molar teeth in the upper jaw of the wild rabbit forms a perfectly straight line; but in some of the largest skulls of the <b>lop-eared</b> this line was plainly bowed inwards. In one specimen there was an additional molar tooth {{on each side of the}} upper jaw, between the molars and premolars; but these two teeth did not correspond in size; and as no rodent has seven molars, this is merely a monstrosity, though a curious one.|$|E

60|$|In {{the large}} <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits the {{relative}} proportional {{length of the}} bones of the same leg, and of the front and hind legs compared with each other, have remained nearly the same as in the wild rabbit; but in weight, {{the bones of the}} hind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion with the front legs. The weight of the whole body in the large rabbits examined by me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that of the wild rabbit; and the weight of the bones of the front and hind limbs taken together (excluding the feet, on account of the difficulty of cleaning so many small bones) has increased in the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits in nearly the same proportion; consequently in due proportion to the weight of body which they have to support. If we take the length of the body as the standard of comparison, the limbs of the large rabbits have not increased in length in due proportion by one inch and a half. Again, if we take as the standard of comparison the length of the skull, which, as we have before seen, has not increased in length in due proportion to the length of body, the limbs will be found to be, proportionally with those of the wild rabbit, from half to three-quarters of an inch too short. Hence, whatever standard of comparison be taken, the limb-bones of the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits have not increased in length, though they have in weight, in full proportion to the other parts of the frame; and this, I presume, may be accounted for by the inactive life which during many generations they have spent. Nor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion to the increased length of the body.|$|E
60|$|The {{capacity}} of the osseous case of the brain is a more interesting point, to which I was led to attend by finding, as previously stated, that with all domesticated rabbits {{the length of the}} skull relatively to its breadth has greatly increased in comparison with that of the wild rabbits. If we had possessed a large number of domesticated rabbits of nearly the same size with the wild rabbits, {{it would have been a}} simple task to have measured and compared the capacities of their skulls. But this is not the case: almost all the domestic breeds have larger bodies than wild rabbits, and the <b>lop-eared</b> kinds are more than double their weight. As a small animal has to exert its senses, intellect, and instincts equally with a large animal, we ought not by any means to expect an animal twice or thrice as large as another to have a brain of double or treble the size. (4/27. See Prof. Owen's remarks on this subject in his paper on the 'Zoological Significance of the Brain, etc., of Man, etc.' read before Brit. Association 1862: with respect to Birds see 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' January 11, 1848 page 8.) Now, after weighing the bodies of four wild rabbits, and of four large but not fattened <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits, I find that on an average the wild are to the <b>lop-eared</b> in weight as 1 to 2.17; in average length of body as 1 to 1.41; whilst in {{capacity of}} skull they are as 1 to 1.15. Hence we see that the {{capacity of the}} skull, and consequently the size of the brain, has increased but little, relatively to the increased size of the body; and this fact explains the narrowness of the skull relatively to its length in all domestic rabbits.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} {{cervical}} vertebra, or atlas, the anterior {{margin of the}} neural arch varies a little in wild specimens, being either nearly smooth, or furnished with a small supra-median atlantoid process; I have figured a specimen with the largest process (a) which I have seen; {{but it will be}} observed how inferior this is in size and different in shape to that in a large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbit.

60|$|The {{number is}} uniform {{in all the}} skeletons which I have examined, with two exceptions, namely, {{in one of the}} small feral Porto Santo rabbits and in one of the largest <b>lop-eared</b> kinds; both of these had as usual seven cervical, twelve dorsal with ribs, but, instead of seven lumbar, both had eight lumbar {{vertebrae}}. This is remarkable, as Gervais gives seven as the number for the whole genus Lepus. The caudal vertebrae apparently differ by two or three, but I did not attend to them, and they are difficult to count with certainty.|$|E
60|$|In {{the wild}} rabbit the neural {{spine of the}} ninth {{vertebra}} is just perceptibly thicker {{than that of the}} eighth; and the neural spine of the tenth is plainly thicker and shorter than those of all the anterior vertebrae. In the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits the neural spines of the tenth, ninth, and eighth vertebrae, and even in a slight degree that of the seventh, are very much thicker, and of somewhat different shape, in comparison with those of the wild rabbit. So that this part of the vertebral column differs considerably in appearance from the same part in the wild rabbit, and closely resembles in an interesting manner these same vertebrae in some species of hares. In the Angora, Chinchilla, and Himalayan rabbits, the neural spines of the eighth and ninth vertebrae are in a slight degree thicker than in the wild. On the other hand, in one of the feral Porto Santo rabbits, which in most of its characters deviates from the common wild rabbit, in a direction exactly opposite to that assumed by the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits, the neural spines of the ninth and tenth vertebrae were not at all larger than those of the several anterior vertebra. In this same Porto Santo specimen there was no trace in the ninth vertebra of the anterior lateral processes (see figure 14), which are plainly developed in all British wild rabbits, and still more plainly developed in the large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits. In a half-wild rabbit from Sandon Park (4/26. These rabbits have run wild for a considerable time in Sandon Park, and in other places in Staffordshire and Shropshire. They originated, as I have been informed by the gamekeeper, from variously-coloured domestic rabbits which had been turned out. They vary in colour; but many are symmetrically coloured, being white with a streak along the spine, and with the ears and certain marks about the head of a blackish-grey tint. They have rather longer bodies than common rabbits), a haemal spine was moderately well developed on the under side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, and I have seen this in no other specimen.|$|E

Any'ow, we couldn't turn ship round for him. We drew him out and took him out to Number One. 'Drown 'im,' 'e says. 'Drown 'im before 'e dirties my fine new decks.' But our owner was tenderhearted.

60|$|At last I {{made out}} that Samuel had stolen a large, <b>lop-eared</b> doe {{out of a}} bunch in the coal-house of the squint-eyed lady, had skinned it, buried the skin, and offered his booty to his mother as a wild rabbit, trapped. The doe had been the chief item of the Annables' Sunday dinner—albeit a portion was unluckily saved till Monday, {{providing}} undeniable proof of the theft. The owner of the rabbit had supposed the creature to have escaped. This peaceful supposition had been destroyed by the comb-bearer's seeing her cat, scratching in the Annables garden, unearth the white and brown doe-skin, after which the trouble had begun.|$|E
60|$|From {{the several}} facts above given,--namely, firstly, {{that the actual}} {{capacity}} of the skull in the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora breeds, is less than in the wild rabbit, though they are in all their dimensions rather larger animals; secondly, that {{the capacity of the}} skull of the large lop- eared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio as the capacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been decreased; and thirdly, that the capacity of the skull in these same large <b>lop-eared</b> rabbits is very inferior to that of the hare, an animal of nearly the same size,--I conclude, notwithstanding the remarkable differences in capacity in the skulls of the small Porto Santo rabbits, and likewise in the large <b>lop-eared</b> kinds, that in all long-domesticated rabbits the brain has either by no means increased in due proportion with the increased length of the head and increased size of the body, or that it has actually decreased in size, relatively to what would have occurred had these animals lived in a state of nature. When we remember that rabbits, from having been domesticated and closely confined during many generations, cannot have exerted their intellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements, either in escaping from various dangers or in searching for food, we may conclude that their brains will have been feebly exercised, and consequently have suffered in development. We thus see that the most important and complicated organ in the whole organisation is subject to the law of decrease in size from disuse.|$|E
60|$|The {{five other}} skulls of common {{domestic}} rabbits, {{some of which}} approach in size the above-described largest skulls, whilst the others exceed but little those of the wild rabbit, are only worth notice as presenting a perfect gradation in all the above-specified differences between the skulls of the largest <b>lop-eared</b> and wild rabbits. In all, however, the supra- orbital plates are rather larger, and in all the auditory meatus is larger, in conformity with the increased size of the external ears, than in the wild rabbit. The lower notch in the occipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild rabbit, but in all five skulls the upper notch was well developed.|$|E
