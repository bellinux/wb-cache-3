50|$|ImageWriter LQ (<b>Letter</b> <b>Quality)</b> was a 27-pin {{dot matrix}} printer {{introduced}} in 1987 by Apple Computer. The print quality was comparable to competing 24-pin dot-matrix printers, and offered graphics at 320 × 216 DPI. Unlike the ImageWriter II, the LQ was unreliable and noisy. Its printhead {{had a tendency to}} overheat with large multi-page prints and melt the glue holding the crystal that supported the pins.|$|E

50|$|The ImageWriter printer {{supported}} a higher resolution mode where bitmap fonts double {{the size of}} the screen resolution were automatically substituted for 'near letter quality' printing. (For example, a 24-point bitmapped font would be used for 12-point printing.) This feature was sometimes called two-times font printing. Some later Apple QuickDraw-based laser printers also supported four-times font printing where bitmaps quadruple the screen size were used for <b>letter</b> <b>quality</b> output.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the LaserWriter and support for PostScript-compatible printers, the Mac system software initially supported outline fonts for printing only. These outline fonts could be printed in <b>letter</b> <b>quality</b> at any size. PostScript fonts came with two files; a bitmap font was installed into the System file, and an outline font file was stored in the System Folder. Some of the bitmapped “city” fonts would be automatically replaced by PostScript fonts by the printer driver. Commercial typefaces such as Times and Helvetica began to be distributed by Apple, Adobe Systems, and others.|$|E
50|$|Xerox {{acquired}} Diablo {{that same}} year, following which Lee departed {{to set up}} Qume Corporation in 1973. Xerox's Office Product Division had already been buying Diablo printers for its Redactron text editors. After 7 years trying to make Diablo profitable, the OPD focused on developing and selling the Diablo 630 which was mostly bought by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation. The Diablo 630 could produce <b>letter</b> <b>quality</b> output as good as that produced by an IBM Selectric or Selectric-based printer, but at a lower cost. A further advantage was that it supported the entire ASCII printing character set. Its servo-controlled carriage also permitted the use of proportional spaced fonts, where characters occupy a different amount of horizontal space according to their width.|$|E

50|$|The printer was {{essentially}} a re-packaged 9-pin dot matrix printer from C. Itoh Electronics (model C. Itoh 8510, with a modified ROM and pinout), released the same year. It was introduced {{as a replacement for}} the earlier parallel-based Apple Dot Matrix Printer/DMP (also a C. Itoh model) and, while primarily intended for the Apple II, worked across Apple's entire computer product line. The ImageWriter could produce images as well as text, up to a resolution of 144 DPI and a speed of about 120 CPS (characters per second). In text mode, the printer was logic-seeking, meaning it would print with the head moving in both directions while it would print only in one direction for graphics and Near <b>Letter</b> <b>Quality.</b> The ImageWriter was also supported by the original Macintosh computer, the Macintosh 128K. Apple wanted a graphical printer for the Mac, and had introduced the ImageWriter primarily to support the new machine. This permitted it to produce WYSIWYG output from the screen of the computer, which was an important aspect for promoting the concept of the GUI and, later, desktop publishing. The ImageWriter could be supported by Microsoft Windows-based PC's by using the included C. Itoh 8510 compatible driver.|$|E
50|$|Text {{quality was}} a {{recurring}} issue with dot-matrix printers. Near <b>Letter</b> <b>Quality</b> mode - informally specified as almost {{good enough to}} be used in a business letter - endowed dot-matrix printers with a simulated typewriter-like quality. By using multiple passes of the carriage, and higher dot density, the printer could increase the effective resolution. For example, the Epson FX-86 could achieve a theoretical addressable dot-grid of 240 by 216 dots/inch using a print head with a vertical dot density of only 72 dots/inch, by making multiple passes of the print head for each line. For 240 by 144 dots/inch, the print head would make one pass, printing 240 by 72 dots/inch, then the printer would advance the paper by half of the vertical dot pitch (1/144 inch), then the print head would make a second pass. For 240 by 216 dots/inch, the print head would make three passes with smaller paper movement (1/3 vertical dot pitch, or 1/216 inch) between the passes. To cut hardware costs, some manufacturers merely used a double strike (doubly printing each line) to increase the printed text's boldness, resulting in bolder but still jagged text. In all cases, NLQ mode incurred a severe speed penalty. Not surprisingly, all printers retained one or more 'draft' modes for high-speed printing.|$|E
5000|$|Uniscope was a {{registered}} trade mark {{for a set of}} Sperry Univac dumb terminal products. The trademark was applied for October 13, 1969. Several models were produced: the Uniscope 100, Uniscope 200, Uniscope 300, the UTS 400, the UTS 10, the UTS 20, the UTS 30, the UTS 40 and the color UTS 60. The UTS 10, UTS 20, UTS 30, UTS 40 and the color UTS 60 were [...] "intelligent terminals" [...] powered by 8-bit microprocessors, predecessor of today's powerful chips that run today's PCs.

The UTS 4000 line had a COBOL compiler available that made it possible to do local processing in the cluster controller, and the UTS 60 was also capable of being programmed. This line of terminals roughly paralleled the similar IBM product, the IBM 3270. The UTS-400-TE was specialized terminal that had a powerful text editing program burned into firmware intended at first to allow for the editing of simple copy such as that for a newspaper, and later adapted as a prototype word processor with 8" [...] floppy disks and driving <b>Letter</b> <b>Quality</b> daisy wheel printers.|$|E

A new quality index suitable for MS imagery having four spectral bands is defined from {{the theory of}} hyper-complex numbers, or quaternions. Both spectral and radiometric distortion measurements are encapsulated in a unique measurement, simultaneously accounting for local mean bias, changes in contrast, and loss of correlation of individual bands, together with spectral distortion. Results are presented and discussed on very high-resolution QuickBird data, through comparisons between state-of-the-art and advanced MS+ Pan merge algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} factors which affect the perceived credibility of letters of reference. More specifically, two factors, those being length of the <b>letter</b> and <b>quality</b> of writing style, are examined. The study questions whether longer or shorter reference letters have different levels of perceived credibility. It also proposes that as the quality of writing style of reference letters improves, their perceived credibility increases. Participants in the study included a random sample of 110 recruiters from various companies in Canada, particularly in the Toronto, Ontario area. Each participant received one of six variations of reference letters representing either or a long or a short version of length and a good, average or poor version of quality. One standard questionnaire regarding the letters of reference was also received by each subject. Results of the empirical study suggest that the length of a letter does not affect perceived credibility. Findings also indicate that writing style does affect the perceived credibility of reference letters, although not exactly as predicted. Finally, additional analysis was conducted to determine whether <b>letter</b> length and <b>quality</b> of writing style affect a recruiter 2 ̆ 7 s overall assessment of a candidate. However, closer examination revealed that the analysis of overall assessment was measuring a similar construct to that of perceived credibility. Thus, the additional analysis was not examined to a greater extent. Implications of these findings and possible future research on this topic are discussed.

50|$|In the 1970s & 80s, {{dot matrix}} {{printers}} {{were one of}} the more common types of printers used for general use, such as for home and small office use. Such printers normally had either 9 or 24 pins on the print head (early 7 pin printers also existed, which did not print descenders). There was a period during the early home computer era when a range of printers were manufactured under many brands such as the Commodore VIC-1525 using the Seikosha Uni-Hammer system. This used a single solenoid with an oblique striker that would be actuated 7 times for each column of 7 vertical pixels while the head was moving at a constant speed. The angle of the striker would align the dots vertically even though the head had moved one dot spacing in the time. The vertical dot position was controlled by a synchronised longitudinally ribbed platen behind the paper that rotated rapidly with a rib moving vertically seven dot spacings in the time it took to print one pixel column. 24-pin print heads were able to print at a higher quality and started to offer additional type styles and were marketed as Near <b>Letter</b> <b>Quality</b> by some vendors. Once the price of inkjet printers dropped {{to the point where they}} were competitive with dot matrix printers, dot matrix printers began to fall out of favour for general use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel method for the objective quality evaluation of letterings at {{the example of}} laser markings. The proposed method enables an automated quality evaluation during random inspection of small quantities of frequently changing items. The markings are segmented from the image within a rst step and compared against a master piece in the second step. Each character and contour is evaluated with regard to completeness, contrast, edge width and homogeneity according to quality criteria based on the human visual perception. Thus our approach provides an user-independent evaluation method with high repeatability and reproducibility for its industrial application.

40|$|For {{spaceborne}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) systems operating at L-band frequencies or lower, the ionosphere may {{have a significant impact}} on the SAR images. The largest effect at L-band is caused by Faraday rotation (FR). Several studies have modeled the effect of FR and/or devised models to measure and correct FR. With the launch of the fully polarimetric L-band system Phased Array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR), it has become possible to test both models and measurement techniques on real SAR data. In this <b>letter,</b> the <b>quality</b> of calibrated polarimetric PALSAR data is assessed, and FR is measured. It is found that residual crosstalk and channel imbalance are small in the PALSAR data. Two methods are used to measure FR, the first using in-scene distributed targets and the second using large trihedrals. The two methods show very good agreement. The measurements are compared with values of the total electron content using a linear model. It is found that the model and measurements are in good agreement, with a root-mean-square error of 0. 3 ◦ or 15 % of the mean FR angle...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve on}} the quality of standards, FASB has taken certain initiatives. They include a plan to adopt a principles-based {{approach}} to standard setting, issue standards jointly with the IASB, and shorten the commentary period. These require participation from constituents. This study examines comment letters on five proposals, for an insight to the role of constituents in the due process and these initiatives. It points out significant limitations in prior research that claimed low participation among constituents. The manner in which FASB handles comment letters sometimes disaffects constituents. This can stall the quality initiative, and widen the expectations gap. From the comment letters, a majority of constituents accept a principles-based approach but apparently contradict themselves by requiring detailed guidance. The evidence shows that shorter commentary periods could hurt quality. Further, non-USA constituents addressed more questions and disagreed more with FASB's provisions. Implications for FASB's initiatives are explored. constituents, due process, comment <b>letters,</b> participation, <b>quality</b> initiatives, standard setting, Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, International Accounting Standards Board, IASB, commentary stage, expectations gap, principles-based, rules-based, standards quality, detailed guidance,...|$|R
