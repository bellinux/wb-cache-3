5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar <b>lenses</b> be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision <b>lenses.</b> To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection <b>lenses,</b> Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope <b>lenses</b> retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
5|$|When {{added to}} glass, thorium dioxide helps {{increase}} its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality <b>lenses</b> for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these <b>lenses</b> can darken them {{and turn them}} yellow {{over a period of}} years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed <b>lenses</b> may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|A {{stereoscopic}} camera had similar characteristics, but both <b>lenses</b> {{pointed in the}} same direction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lens</b> {{has three}} main parts: the <b>lens</b> capsule, the <b>lens</b> epithelium, and the <b>lens</b> fibers. The <b>lens</b> capsule forms the {{outermost}} {{layer of the}} <b>lens</b> and the <b>lens</b> fibers form {{the bulk of the}} interior of the <b>lens.</b> The cells of the <b>lens</b> epithelium, located between the <b>lens</b> capsule and the outermost layer of <b>lens</b> fibers, are found only on the anterior side of the <b>lens.</b> The <b>lens</b> itself lacks nerves, blood vessels, or connective tissue.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lens</b> epithelium, {{located in}} the {{anterior}} portion of the <b>lens</b> between the <b>lens</b> capsule and the <b>lens</b> fibers, is a simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells of the <b>lens</b> epithelium regulate most of the homeostatic functions of the <b>lens.</b> As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the <b>lens</b> from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in the <b>lens</b> epithelial cells pump ions out of the <b>lens</b> to maintain appropriate <b>lens</b> osmotic concentration and volume, with equatorially positioned <b>lens</b> epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the <b>lens</b> from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions.|$|R

5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical <b>lenses,</b> and explained that these <b>lenses</b> offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E
5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} <b>lenses,</b> as Bates recommended, or wearing <b>lenses</b> {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
50|$|Ectopia lentis is a {{displacement}} or malposition of the eye's crystalline <b>lens</b> from its normal location. A partial dislocation of a <b>lens</b> is termed <b>lens</b> subluxation or subluxated lens; a complete dislocation of a <b>lens</b> is termed <b>lens</b> luxation or luxated <b>lens.</b>|$|R

25|$|If the <b>lens</b> is {{biconvex}} or plano-convex, a {{collimated beam}} of light passing through the <b>lens</b> converges to a spot (a focus) behind the <b>lens.</b> In this case, the <b>lens</b> is called a positive or converging <b>lens.</b> The distance from the <b>lens</b> to the spot is the focal length of the <b>lens,</b> which is commonly abbreviated f in diagrams and equations.|$|R

5|$|Panavision is an American {{motion picture}} {{equipment}} company specializing in cameras and <b>lenses,</b> based in Woodland Hills, California. Formed by Robert Gottschalk {{as a small}} partnership to create anamorphic projection <b>lenses</b> during the widescreen boom in the 1950s, Panavision expanded its product lines {{to meet the demands}} of modern filmmakers. The company introduced its first products in 1954. Originally a provider of CinemaScope accessories, the company's line of anamorphic widescreen <b>lenses</b> soon became the industry leader. In 1972, Panavision helped revolutionize filmmaking with the lightweight Panaflex 35mm movie camera. The company has introduced other groundbreaking cameras such as the Millennium XL (1999) and the digital video Genesis (2004).|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive <b>lenses.</b> The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the <b>lenses</b> and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first <b>lenses</b> were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive <b>lenses</b> were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the <b>lenses,</b> the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E

5|$|While George Kistiakowsky's Explosives Division (X Division) {{developed}} the explosive <b>lenses,</b> G Division designed {{the rest of}} the weapon. There were numerous difficulties to overcome, {{not the least of which}} was devising a means of detonating the <b>lenses</b> with the required speed. Robert F.

5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive <b>lenses</b> {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive <b>lenses</b> arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|During the {{shooting}} in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact <b>lenses</b> that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster wished he {{had more time to}} work on the free-fall scene.|$|E

50|$|In photography, a <b>lens</b> hood or <b>lens</b> shade is {{a device}} {{used on the}} front end of a <b>lens</b> to block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and <b>lens</b> flare.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} the ocular <b>lens</b> {{in the context of}} contemporary developments in biological ideas. We attempt to reconcile <b>lens</b> biology with stem cell concepts and a dearth of <b>lens</b> tumors. Historically, the <b>lens</b> has been viewed as a closed system, in which cells at the periphery of the <b>lens</b> epithelium differentiate into fiber cells. Theoretical considerations led us to question whether the intracapsular <b>lens</b> is indeed self-contained. Since stem cells generate tumors and the <b>lens</b> does not naturally develop tumors, we reasoned that <b>lens</b> stem cells may not be present within the capsule. We hypothesize that <b>lens</b> stem cells reside outside the <b>lens</b> capsule, in the nearby ciliary body. Our ideas challenge the existing <b>lens</b> biology paradigm. We begin our discussion with <b>lens</b> background information, in order to describe our <b>lens</b> stem cell hypothesis in the context of published data. Then we present the ciliary body as a possible source for <b>lens</b> stem cells, and conclude by comparing the ocular <b>lens</b> with the corneal epithelium. </p...|$|R

This compromise in design {{results in the}} <b>lens</b> exhibiting the bokeh of an F2.8 <b>lens,</b> while having the light-gathering capabilities of an F5.6 <b>lens,</b> thus requiring good lighting conditions or flash in order to best use the <b>lens.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jones is a keen footballer (he {{supports}} Everton FC, and hosted on a 2009 DVD entitled 'My Everton'), {{tennis player}} and golfer. He is short-sighted and wore contact <b>lenses</b> or glasses, until he underwent a laser procedure to correct his shortsightedness on 17 June 2009.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact <b>lenses.</b> Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed <b>lenses</b> was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic <b>lenses</b> include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the <b>lenses.</b> The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} and apparently somewhat older {{meaning of the}} term prime <b>lens</b> is the main <b>lens</b> in a combination <b>lens</b> system. [...] When the camera <b>lens</b> is used with some other optical device, such as a close-up <b>lens,</b> teleconverter, or teleside converter, the camera <b>lens</b> itself is properly called the prime <b>lens.</b> Prime is here used in the sense of primary, chief, original, first in order, etc.|$|R
25|$|If the <b>lens</b> is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the <b>lens</b> is diverged (spread); the <b>lens</b> is thus called a negative or diverging <b>lens.</b> The beam, after passing through the <b>lens,</b> appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} <b>lens.</b> The distance from this point to the <b>lens</b> is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging <b>lens.</b>|$|R
25|$|Incoming {{parallel}} {{rays are}} focused by a converging <b>lens</b> onto a spot one focal length from the <b>lens,</b> {{on the far}} side of the <b>lens.</b> This is called the rear focal point of the <b>lens.</b> Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from the <b>lens</b> than the focal distance; the closer the object is to the <b>lens,</b> the further the image is from the <b>lens.</b>|$|R
