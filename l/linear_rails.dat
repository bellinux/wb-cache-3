These devices have been widely used within cycling research, however, they {{have been found to be}} difficult to set-up and adjust, particularly whilst in use as well as to replicate a force profile similar to that experienced when competing. This study details the development of a novel cycle ergometer that incorporates automatic bike set-up and adjustment. The ergometer was designed in accordance with a design specification developed through the use of needs analysis of elite cyclists and performance scientists. The user analysis identified a need for increased adjustability (seat height (SH), seat set back (SS), handlebar drop (HD) and handlebar reach (HBR)) and positioning accuracy, whilst maximising the stability and stiffness of the frame when conducting maximal effort trials particularly at the bottom bracket. The novel ergometer incorporates two lifting columns to provide HD adjustment from 411 mm to 868 mm and SH adjustment from 568 mm to 928 mm. The two lifting columns were mounted on two <b>linear</b> <b>rails</b> to provide horizontal adjustment of the handlebars relative to the seat, and seat relative to the bottom bracket. The motors on both the lifting columns and <b>linear</b> <b>rails</b> were fitted with HTL encoders, increasing the positioning accuracy to+/- 0. 1 mm. An anti-coast brake was also fitted to prevent the lifting columns or <b>linear</b> <b>rails</b> from slipping whilst in use. When comparing existing set up time, adjusting from the largest to smallest set-up, current ergometers can take up to 30 minutes, whereas the new ergometer takes 8 seconds. To minimise twisting of the frame during maximal effort cycling, the bottom bracket has been mounted on a 65 mm x 65 mm square column. Finite element analysis of the structure identified that it would remain stable whilst subjected to up to 800 Nm of torque. In conclusion the development of the novel ergometer allows for greater adjustability, speed of set-up and maximise frame stability during use...|$|E

As {{part of a}} facility capability upgrade, a dynamic actuation system (DAS) was fabricated to enhance the STOVL testing capabilities. The DAS serves as the mechanical interface between the 9 x 15 LSWT test section structure and the STOVL model to be tested. It provides vertical and horizontal translation of the model in the test section and maintains the model attitude (pitch, yaw, and roll) during translation. It also integrates a piping system to supply the model with exhaust and hot air to simulate the inlet suction and nozzle exhausts, respectively. Hot gas ingestion studies have been performed with the facility ground plane installed. The DAS provides vertical (ascent and descent) translation speeds of up to 48 in. /s and horizontal translation speeds of up to 12 in. /s. Model pitch variations of +/- 7, roll variations of +/- 5, and yaw variations of 0 to 180 deg can be accommodated and are maintained within 0. 25 deg throughout the translation profile. The hot air supply, generated by the facility heaters and regulated by control valves, provides three separate temperature zones to the model for STOVL and hot gas ingestion testing. Channels along the supertube provide instrumentation paths from the model to the facility data system for data collection purposes.

A light-weight design of the mirror and its mount was essential since the total mass of the whole assembly including the positioning system was limited to 50 kg while interferometric quality of the mirror surface was required for arbitrary orientation. The overall surface error was below 54 nm r. m. s. while 27 nm was achieved in the central part. The mirror was fabricated from low-expansion glass ceramics to avoid thermally induced deformations. By milling pockets into its rear surface the mass of the mirror was reduced by 70 %. The mirror is mounted kinematically via six solid-state hinges to three steel levers. The levers are connected to the mount frame at their centers via ball-and-sphere joints. This arrangement determines the position of the mirror uniquely while it allows for the thermal expansion of the mount frame. The position of the mirror as well as its tilt around an axis perpendicular to the optical one may be controlled a precision of 20 µm and 3 arcsec, respectively. The tilt axis is driven directly by two high-torque motors. To avoid an excessive power consumption of the motors the torque of the mirror had to be compensated for by a counterweight mechanism.

40|$|Recent {{development}} of the parallel mechanisms theory has resulted in an increase of the actual machines, which are built using the conceptual schemes of such mechanisms. The advantages of parallel kinematics over conventional open-chain design, such as increased stiffness or lower inertia of moving parts, allow, in theory, higher performance rates in pick-and-place or machining applications. However, the practical usage of parallel mechanisms may be problematic due to their drawbacks, such as restricted workspace area and presence of singularities. The paper discusses a modification of the milling machine “Tetra” developed in “Modular Mechanics”, ltd. (BMSTU), which consists of two identical modules based on planar parallel kinematics mechanism. The loss of module stiffness in certain positions of the end-effector was noticed after experiments on the prototype, thus indicating the presence of singularities. Since this problem is a manifestation of fundamental properties of the chosen kinematic scheme, {{it was decided to}} change it. A scheme with three <b>linear</b> <b>rails</b> and three drives, as well as a scheme with a single rail and with four drives were considered as alternative options. The first option was discarded because it requires manufacturing a massive base plate. The second option was selected for future development. In this case, as compared to the previously known design, a configuration of the intermediate links was changed. The use of “lambda”-shaped elements makes it possible to distance the drive supports from the end-effector. For a chosen scheme an inverse kinematics problem was solved. Using constraints associated with the placement of all four drive supports on a single rail and stiffness requirements as well, a one single solution was selected among sixteen possible solutions. The further investigation will include a workspace and singularity analysis and an optimization of geometric parameters of the mechanism. </p...|$|E

Trisha Annie Hamar 2009 Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Electronic Engineering Option California State University, Chico Fall 2009 A Proportional, Integral and Derivative controller, {{also known}} as a PID controller, was {{designed}} for a free-range inverted pendulum. The PID algorithm was compared to the Linear Quadratic Regulator, or LQR, on the inverted pendulum to quantify the merits of each algorithm based on performance. This study will present the controller designs, simulations, code and hardware implementation, as well as the results. The PID algorithm is a tuning process where the user adjusts gain values as needed. The LQR algorithm is a traditional digital control theory that utilizes state space design and weighting matrices. Simulations were performed on MATLAB and Simulink. Each algorithm was implemented in C programming into the ARM processor. Primary comparisons included ease of implementation, the complexity of the code, and the overall performance of the system. The PID algorithm performed better in trials and was easier to implement in the C programming language. The LQR algorithm was based on a linearized system and was not able to handle nonlinear components such as gear backlash.

The ship {{has a number}} of container-stacking compartments called bays, and only one quay crane can work on a bay at the same time. The objective of the scheduling problem is to find the work schedule for each quay crane which minimizes the ships stay time in port. Finding the optimal solution of the scheduling problem is computationally intractable and a heuristic is proposed to solve it. The heuristic first decomposes the difficult multi-crane scheduling problem into easier subproblems by partitioning the ship into a set of non-overlapping zones. The resulting subproblems for each possible partition are solved optimally by a simple rule. An effective algorithm for finding tight lower bounds is developed by modifying and enhancing an effective lower-bounding procedure proposed in the literature. Computational experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the heuristic on a set of test problems randomly generated based on typical terminal operations data. The computational results show that the heuristic can indeed find effective solutions for the scheduling problem, with the heuristic solutions on average 4. 8 % above their lower bounds. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Its primary drawback is that of narrow bandwidth, i. e., it is effective for attenuating only a very narrow range of frequencies about its design frequency. This {{has led to the}} inclusion of more pulses to improve robustness to frequency variation. However, one cost of adding pulses is extending the duration of the resulting motion. This paper presents several techniques whereby the basic twin-pulse motion profile can be expanded to reduce its frequency sensitivity while still preserving its advantages. These techniques include intentionally mis-aligning the null points of ideal twin pulses and a convolved boxcar function, then adding a trapezoidal profile component, finally culminating in what we term a misaligned boxcar / trapezoidal / twin pulse (M-BC:TZ:TP) motion profile. This expanded profile and a basic twin-pulse profile were both evaluated on a ten-pendula system with natural frequencies varying over a range of nearly 10 %. Simulation results showed an overall reduction of 97 % with the expanded twin-pulse profile, and notably all ten frequencies were attenuated; only one frequency was attenuated with the standard twin-pulse profile. Experiments using a <b>linear</b> <b>rail</b> transport system and the ten pendula device validated the simulation. These expanded profiles retain the simplicity and short duration of the twin-pulse with increased robustness to frequency variations. I...|$|R

I have engineered a versatile and automated control program from scratch for the base system and many subsystems. Its main features include a custom scripting language, a fully customizable graphical user interface, wireless and remote control, and a terminal-based interface. This control system has already been successfully used in the creation of many types of x-ray optics, including several thousand layer multilayer Laue lenses. Before reaching the point at which a deposition can be run, stencil-like masks for the sputtering cathodes must be created to ensure the proper distribution of sputtered atoms. Quality of multilayer Laue lenses can also be difficult to measure, given the size of the thin film layers. I employ my knowledge of software and algorithms to further ease these previously painstaking processes with custom programs. Additionally, I will give an overview of an x-ray optic simulator package I helped develop during the summer of 2010. In the interest of keeping my software free and open, I have worked mostly with the multiplatform Python and the PyQt application framework, utilizing C and C++ where necessary...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} Mini CNC Machine. This machine has 2 axes, namely the Xand Y axis. Mini CNC machine is a small CNC machine that can operate like a normal CNC machine with a limited area of the machining. The objectives of this project are to develop the mini CNC Machine and to develop the software to control the machine. This thesis describes {{the development of the}} machine and the criteria needed to build the machine. The Mini CNC Machine is initially sketched by referring to the criteria that was decided. The criteria are the travel path length, type of linear motion, type of linear drive, motor and controller, and type of material that used. This machine’s travel on the X axis is 15 cm and Y axis is 15 cm. The linear motion was used is a round <b>linear</b> <b>rail</b> and the <b>linear</b> drive used was a sliding element, lead nuts and lead screws. The motor used is a stepper motor with specification 2. 1 V and 3. 0 A. The frame material used is aluminium. This material is used because it is light in weight, easy to handle and machine and it is rust proof. The design was sketched using SolidWork software. For the next step is developing the wiring for motor and develop the program to control the stepper motor. The ULN 2803 is used to convert the signal from parallel port to specific winding energizing sequences to step the motor. The Visual Basic software is used to program the motor movement...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} automatic spraying on Hyphantria cunea larva nets, a spraying robot system with monocular hand-eye coordination and smart targeting abilities was designed {{according to the}} target net features. The system realized spatial two-dimensional motions driven by step motors on <b>linear</b> guide <b>rails.</b> Images were processed in real-time to extract the net curtain targets defined using the border area, and the optimal spraying position was then determined. An identification algorithm based on the global net image to distinguish targets before and after spray was proposed. A simulation environment was designed to verify the correctness of this method. Results showed that {{the highest rate of}} over spray is 288. 5 %, and the spray miss rate is 0...|$|R
40|$|Through-lossy-slab radar imaging will {{be shown}} at {{stand-off}} ranges using a low-power, ultrawideband (UWB), frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system. FMCW is desirable for through-slab applications because of the signal gain resulting from pulse compression of long transmit pulses (1. 926 - 4. 069 GHz chirp in 10 ms). The difficulty in utilizing FMCW radar for this application is that the air-slab boundary dominates the scattered return from the target scene and limits the upper bound of the receiver dynamic range, reducing sensitivity for targets behind the slab. A method of range-gating out the air-slab boundary by significant band-limiting of the IF stages facilitates imaging of low radar cross section (RCS) targets behind the slab. This sensor is combined with a 1 D <b>linear</b> <b>rail</b> and utilized as a rail synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging system. A 2 D model of a slab and cylinder shows that image blurring due to the slab is negligible when the SAR is located at a stand-off range of 6 m or greater, and thus, the two-way attenuation due to wave propagation through the slab is the greatest challenge at stand-off ranges when the air-slab boundary is range-gated out of the scattered return. Measurements agree with the model, and also show that this radar is capable of imaging target scenes of cylinders and rods 15. 24 cm in height and 0. 95 cm in diameter behind a 10 cm thick lossy dielectric slab. Further, this system is capable of imaging free-space target scenes with transmit power as low as 5 pW, providing capability for RCS measurement. United States.
