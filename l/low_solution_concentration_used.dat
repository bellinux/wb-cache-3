Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) {{is used as}} polymer matrix. Obtaining SWNT/PMMA composite with enhanced mechanical and electrical properties {{is one of the}} research goals. The first important step is to figure out a method for achieving uniform SWNT dispersion in PMMA. Eight different solvents were used to disperse SWNT in PMMA. It is found that the polar component of the solubility parameter (Â£_p) of the solvent affects SWNT dispersion in PMMA. SWNT dispersion in PMMA improves with increasing solvent Ãp value, and the most uniform dispersion is obtained in nitromethane, which is the most polar solvent employed in this study. SWNT/PMMA composite films at various SWNT concentrations were processed employing nitromethane as the solvent. Mechanical and electrical property enhancements are observed. Processing, structure, morphology, and properties of these composites are discussed. A comparison between reinforcement efficiency of SWNT, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT), and vapor grown carbon nano fibers (VGCNF) in PMMA is also discussed. In order to electrospin SWNT/PMMA/nitromethane solution into composite nanofibers successfully, first PMMA was electrospun.

30|$|The {{effective}} diameter of nanoparticles was equal to 260 nm at the <b>lowest</b> <b>solution</b> <b>concentration</b> of 0.05 vol.%. At higher particle concentrations, the increased interparticle interactions result in larger clusters. This increases {{the possibility of}} clusters to deposit {{on the surface of}} solid and form a new hydrophilic surface. Due to their larger size, these clusters are less possible to deposit on the three-phase contact line, and thus a heterogeneous surface will form: within the wedge film and away from the three-phase contact line, deposition of TiO 2 clusters results in a hydrophilic surface with higher surface energy (approximately 2.2 J/m 2 [34]) than the three-phase contact line where the bare borosilicate glass is present (approximately 0.11 J/m 2 [35]). The higher surface energy inside the droplet shrinks the wetted area by increasing the equilibrium contact angle (denser solutions are more hydrophilic inside than outside). As a result, solidâliquid interfacial tension increases which on the other hand enhances the equilibrium contact angle [21]. Surface tension of these solutions decreases with particle concentration that is in accordance with Gibb's adsorption isotherm. The shear thinning viscosity of the solutions is due to strong interparticle interaction of the nanoparticle clusters [19, 23, 36]. Other nanofluids such as ethylene glycol-based ZnO nanofluid [23] and CuO nanofluid [37] also exhibited shear thinning viscosity at low shear rates.|$|R

Here, we investigate whether stapled peptides are intrinsically membrane permeable, by performing a case study on a stapled 12 -mer peptide named NYAD- 1. We found that the native peptide CAI (an HIV- 1 inhibitor) does not bind to lipid bilayers, however NYAD- 1 indeed permeates through lipid bilayers even at <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> <b>concentrations.</b> To understand {{the reason for the}} membrane permeability, we investigated the physical properties of NYAD- 1 as a function of bound peptide/lipid molar ratio P/L. We found that NYAD- 1 spontaneously binds to a lipid bilayer. At low P/L, the peptide primarily binds on the polar-apolar interface with its helical axis parallel to the bilayer, which has the effect of stretching the membrane area and thinning the membrane. The membrane thinning reaches its maximum at P/L â¼ 1 / 15 â 1 / 12 in DOPC bilayers. Additional bound peptides have little thinning effect and their helical axes are normal to the plane of bilayers. Thus, the stapled peptide has a membrane interaction behavior similar to helical antimicrobial peptides, such as magainin and melittin. We emphasize that not all peptides that bind to lipid bilayers in the Î±-helical form behave this way...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} the molecular interactions of magainin 2 with model cell membranes using sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Symmetric 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -[Phospho- rac-(1 -glycerol) ] (POPG) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers, which model the bacterial and mammalian cell membranes, respectively, {{were used in}} the studies. It was observed by SFG that magainin 2 orients relatively parallel to the POPG lipid bilayer surface at <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> <b>concentrations,</b> around 200 nM. When increasing the magainin 2 concentration to 800 nM, both SFG and ATR-FTIR results indicate that magainin 2 molecules insert into the POPG bilayer and adopt a transmembrane orientation with an angle of about 20 Â° from the POPG bilayer normal. For the POPC bilayer, even at a much higher peptide concentration of 2. 0 Î¼M, no ATR-FTIR signal was detected. For this concentration on POPC, SFG studies indicated that magainin 2 molecules adopt an orientation nearly parallel to the bilayer surface, with an orientation angle of about 75 Â° from the surface normal. This shows that SFG has a much better detection limit than ATR-FTIR and can therefore be applied to study interfacial molecules with a much lower surface coverage. This magainin 2 orientation study and further investigation of the lipid bilayer SFG signals support the proposed toroidal pore model for the antimicrobial activity of magainin 2...|$|R

40|$|Forward osmosis (FO) has {{attracted}} wide interest for its many potential applications. Recent developments suggest that double-skinned FO membranes may perform superiorly over conventional single-skinned ones. In this design, a dense rejection skin facing the draw solution {{is responsible for}} the separation, while a second skin facing the feed solution is designed to prevent foulants entering into the porous support layer sandwiched between the two skins. For the first time, an analytical model is developed for double-skinned FO membranes and is verified experimentally. Model simulations suggest that an optimal double-skinned membrane shall have a feed skin similar to that of a low rejection nanofiltration membrane to minimize the overall hydraulic resistant and to reduce internal concentration polarization. On the other hand, the optimization of the draw skin calls for a compromise between its water permeability and solute rejection. FO water flux is greater for support layers with higher mass transfer coefficients. In addition, it decreases with decreasing draw <b>solution</b> <b>concentration</b> and increasing feed <b>solution</b> <b>concentration.</b> While membrane orientation plays an important role for applications with <b>low</b> feed <b>solution</b> <b>concentrations</b> (with the denser skin preferentially facing the draw solution), this effect becomes negligible at high feed <b>solution</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Â© 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Twelve {{cultivar}}s of cassava and one cultivar each of sunflower and maize {{were grown}} for 27 days at eight constant <b>solution</b> potassium <b>concentrations</b> ranging from 0. 5 to 8024 Î¼M. All species and cultivars required a minimum <b>solution</b> <b>concentration</b> of 2 to 6 Î¼M K to produce maximum yield. At <b>solution</b> potassium <b>concentrations</b> greater than 122 Î¼M the yield of most cassava cultivars declined and at 8024 Î¼M K all cultivars displayed magnesium deficiency symptoms. A limited variation among species and cultivars {{was observed in}} the minimum tissue concentration necessary for healthy growth. Large differences in dry matter percentage existed among species, plant parts and potassium treatments. Because of these differences, trends in potassium concentration expressed on a dry weight basis in some instances did not accurately reflect trends in potassium concentration in the fresh tissue. Although all three species produced maximum dry matter yield at similar <b>solution</b> potassium <b>concentrations,</b> at suboptimal concentrations cassava regulated its growth more successfully in relation to potassium supply than did sunflower or maize. At 0. 5 Î¼M K cassava continued to grow slowly with less reduction in relative yield, less pronounced deficiency symptoms and a smaller gradient in tissue potassium concentrations from older to younger leaves than the other species. Continued slow growth of cassava at <b>low</b> <b>solution</b> potassium <b>concentrations</b> was aided by greater increase in the relative size of the root system...|$|R
