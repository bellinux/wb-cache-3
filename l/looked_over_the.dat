5|$|On Thursday, 21 October 1948, Boeing {{engineers}} George S. Schairer, Art Carlsen and Vaughn Blumenthal {{presented the}} design of a four-engine turboprop bomber to the chief of bomber development, Colonel Pete Warden. Warden was disappointed by the projected aircraft and asked if the Boeing team could come up with a proposal for a four-engine turbojet bomber. Joined by Ed Wells, Boeing vice president of engineering, the engineers worked that night in the Hotel Van Cleve in Dayton, Ohio, redesigning Boeing's proposal as a four-engine turbojet bomber. On Friday, Colonel Warden <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> information and asked for a better design. Returning to the hotel, the Boeing team was joined by Bob Withington and Maynard Pennell, two top Boeing engineers who were in town on other business.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
25|$|After {{the civil}} {{engineer}} <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the agrimensores went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a groma, which helped them obtain right angles. The gromatici, the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the rigor. As they did not possess anything like a transit, a civil engineering surveyor tried to achieve straightness by looking along the rods and commanding the gromatici to move them as required. Using the gromae they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road.|$|E

25|$|In 2014 NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories {{announced}} that they had successfully validated {{the use of a}} Quantum Vacuum Plasma Thruster which makes use of the Casimir effect for propulsion. In 2016 a scientific paper by the team of NASA scientists passed peer review for the first time. The paper suggests that the zero-point field acts as pilot-wave and that the thrust may be due to particles pushing off the quantum vacuum. While peer review doesn’t guarantee that a finding or observation is valid, it does indicate that independent scientists <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> experimental setup, results, and interpretation and that they could not find any obvious errors in the methodology and that they found the results reasonable. In the paper, the authors identify and discuss nine potential sources of experimental errors, including rogue air currents, leaky electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic interactions. Not all of them could be completely ruled out, and further peer reviewed experimentation is needed in order to rule these potential errors out.|$|E

After he takes Marge's hair out of his ear, her hair would originally be covered with earwax, but it was removed when the animators <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> episode's storyboard. The second segment originally had many more shots of buffalo being shot, but some were changed so that the deaths were off-camera.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, {{following}} the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, Barbree placed {{a telephone call}} to a friend and retired employee of NASA, who—as a favor to Barbree—went to Kennedy Space Center, <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> accident information and analysis being done, and later reported the early findings to Barbree. Consequently, Barbree was the first journalist {{to report on the}} source of the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger: Faulty O-rings. [...] He was also part of the NBC News Space Unit that won an Emmy award for NBC's coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Following the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, Barbree was the first reporter to break the news of an internal NASA memo expressing concerns about foam striking the orbiter's left wing during ascent.|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky {{began to}} develop other films. When he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> books he used to {{research}} for The Fountain, he {{decided to return to}} The Fountain, feeling closer to it creatively than the other possible projects. Without a studio and an actor, he decided to write a [...] "no-budget" [...] version of the film, using his experiences filming Pi and Requiem for a Dream with small budgets. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected Aronofsky's project and began to court actor Hugh Jackman to replace Pitt in the lead role. The film received a second greenlight with a budget of $35 million, {{in part because of the}} director's willingness to leave costly set pieces out of the screenplay. In August, actress Rachel Weisz joined Hugh Jackman for the film, filling the vacancy left by Blanchett. Filming lasted 60 days in early 2005 and took place mainly on a sound stage in Montreal.|$|E

500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of anhedral and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|E
500|$|In April 1853, Meeker {{heard that}} the lands north of the Columbia would become a {{separate}} territory (named Washington Territory), with its capital on Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific. He decided to travel north with his brother to scout for lands to claim around the waterway. There were as yet only about 500 European-descended inhabitants in the Puget Sound region, of which 100 were {{in the village of}} Olympia, which would become the territorial (and later state) capital. Despite there only being a few settlers, there was considerable activity in the area—the lumber of Puget Sound fueled San Francisco's building boom. The Meekers' first view of Puget Sound was unprepossessing; the tide was out, exposing mud flats. [...] Nevertheless, they pressed on, building a skiff to travel by water. They were met by friendly Indians, who sold them clams and taught them how to cook the shellfish. Engaging one of the Native Americans as guide, they explored the area, looking for good, well-located farmland. At one point, they entered the Puyallup River, in a region where no white settlers lived, and camped on the present site of Puyallup, but were deterred by the large number of huge trees, which would make it difficult to clear land for farming. They decided on tracts on McNeil Island, not far from the thriving town of Steilacoom, where the farm's produce could be sold. Oliver remained on the island to build a cabin while his brother went back to fetch family and possessions, and sell their old claims at Kalama. He returned to a cabin in which they installed a glass window that <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water to Steilacoom, with a view of Mount Rainier. The Meeker claim was later the site of McNeil Island Corrections Center.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' second {{recording}} {{session with}} Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded [...] "How Do You Do It", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin {{thought was a}} sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney {{did not want to}} release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by [...] "From Me to You". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded [...] "Love Me Do" [...] with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely [...] "not pleased". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him [...] "probably... the finest rock drummer in the world today". As [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded [...] "Please Please Me", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mixing desk and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record". Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote [...] "Love Me Do", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to Dick James.|$|E

He and forty-one other settlers departed England for Upper Canada {{in the summer of}} 1798. It was expected that this expedition would pave the way for the emigration of thousands of French loyalists. On 22 November 1798, the Executive Council of Upper Canada approved land grants for the settlers in Uxbridge, Gwillimbury, Whitchurch and an unnamed county north of Whitby, all in Ontario.
