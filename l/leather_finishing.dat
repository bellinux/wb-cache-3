The sol gel process for the production of water based multifunctional coating materials makes use of silanes, alkoxides, sol, and wet films and provides advantages of low temperature process, high purity materials, molecular composites/transparency, and easy shaping processes.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the leather}} {{industry}} needs {{to produce a}} very wide range of finished articles with different levels of performance to increase their competitiveness while minimizing their environmental impact. To reduce the negative effects on the environment a strong shift from solvent to water-based recipes {{has taken place in}} <b>leather</b> <b>finishing.</b> However, most of the water-based high-performance articles require the addition of a cross-linker to improve wet-fastness properties. The aim of the present work is to study the cross-linking reaction between an epoxy cross-linker and both acrylic binders and polyurethanes. A comparison of results shows that epoxy resin improves wet rub fastness significantly. The cross-linking reaction evolves with time within 31 days storage. Moreover, different amounts of epoxy resin are required to obtain optimum values {{depending on the type of}} leather used and on the physical characteristics of the binders employed.

Gelatin is a protein-based material isolated from chrome-tanned collagenic wastes. A comparison between a commercial protein-based product, extracted gelatin and a mixture of extracted gelatin/glycerol was carried out. Based on the results obtained in previous studies, two fixing agents were used to fix the finishing: 5 -ethyl- 1 -aza- 3, 7 -dioxabicyclo [3, 3, 0] octane (oxazolidine II) and ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE). The mixture gelatin/glycerol (using glycerol as a plasticiser) presented satisfactory results, compared with the commercial product, for the abrasion, gloss and flex resistance, although a poor performance under wet rub fastness (assessment of 1 on the grey scale (ISO 105 -A 02, A 03) and adhesion tests were found due to the hygroscopic nature of glycerol. The formulation for potential further studies was the extracted gelatin fixed with EGDE, which showed the best performance on dry rub fastness (4 - 5 on the grey scale) and finish adhesion, and a good performance on resistance to abrasion and to flex (low loss of finishing and no cracking observed).

40|$|Abstract: Cow leather {{coated with}} {{polyurethane}} film that contains various organic photosensitizers was investigated {{to demonstrate the}} antimicrobial properties {{in the application of}} the material to protective clothing and home appliances. To prepare the antimicrobial coating on leather surfaces with high potency against microbes, photoactive agents, such as benzophenone (BP), 4, 4 ’-bis(dimethylamino) benzophenone (MK), 4, 4 ’-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP) and methylene blue (MB), were incorporated into polyurethane-based coating solutions. The photoactive antimicrobial agent treated leather samples were characterized by SEM, color appearance, color fastness against abrasion, and antimicrobial tests. The optical properties of organic photosensitizers indicated that active UV absorbance ranges were different: BP (around 250 nm), MK (around 360 nm), DHBP (around 305 nm) and MB (around 295 nm & 570 nm- 685 nm). The intensity of the UV absorbance curve at the UVA light wavelength for the antimicrobial test showed the highest value with MK; subsequently, this was followed by MB, DHBP and BP in decreasing order. The treated-leather samples demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity under UVA light. The antimicrobial effects for the Staphylococcus aureus were superior to Escherichia coli. Moreover, the polyurethane finishing showed an effective durability to abrasion. The overall results indicated that DHBP is the most suitable PU coating additive to provide antimicrobial properties to leather as well as color and surface appearance than MK, MB, and BP.
