500|$|Michael Nader {{was fired}} from All My Children in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off. This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor's return. To {{partially}} appease them, the show's executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis. He rejected this offer because [...] "after being a major character for so long, it didn't {{make any sense to}} me. So I declined.

500|$|Tim Schafer left LucasArts {{shortly after}} Grim Fandango release, and created his own company, Double Fine Productions, in [...] {{along with many}} of those {{involved}} in the development of Grim Fandango. The company has found similar critical success with their first title, Psychonauts. Schafer stated that while there is strong interest from fans and that he [...] "would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and spend time with the characters from any game [...] worked on", a sequel to Grim Fandango or his other previous games is unlikely as [...] "I always want to make something new." [...] With the help of developers such as Double Fine and Telltale Games, adventure games saw a resurgence in the 2010s, with financially successful titles such as Broken Age, The Walking Dead, and The Wolf Among Us.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E

Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E

2500|$|More recently, Girtonians {{have become}} {{known for their}} chant of We are Girton – super Girton! No one likes us, but we don't care!, in {{imitation}} of the Millwall fans' famous song: No one likes us, we don't care. The reference to no one likes us is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison {{to many of the}} other colleges. The college song I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a-bicycling, sung with the tune of I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a-wandering also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre.

2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff.

2500|$|To {{explain the}} {{establishment}} of syntactical speech, Richman cites English [...] "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned {{in the first instance}} not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination— the melodic sound people make to express [...] "feeling homesick". Someone might sing [...] "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with [...] "I need to go home", [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home", [...] "Let's go home" [...] and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate moment with a fragment of the [...] "we're collecting honey" [...] song. [...] Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle— that of recursive embedding.|$|E
2500|$|When Kelly {{returned}} to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was {{already beginning to}} feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture Brigadoon (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing {{him to make the}} film on studio back lots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the celebrated I <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> Swimmin' with Wimmen routine in Deep in My Heart. MGM's refusal to loan him out for Guys and Dolls and Pal Joey put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract which involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, It's Always Fair Weather (1956) co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to I Like Myself, and a dance trio with Michael Kidd and Dan Dailey that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of Cinemascope. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result It's Always Fair Weather [...] "premiered" [...] at seventeen drive-in theatres around the Los Angeles metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, Les Girls (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg. It too sold few movie tickets. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film, The Happy Road, set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly {{returned to}} stage work.|$|E
