2500|$|The {{position}} of the Cross of Sacrifice in Commonwealth war cemeteries varies depending {{on a wide range}} of factors. [...] Many cemeteries were laid out haphazardly during the war. The role of the junior designing architect was to determine the {{position of}} the Cross (and Stone of Remembrance) in relationship to the graves. Most cemeteries had two axes—a main axis and an entrance axis, or a main/entrance axis and a <b>lateral</b> <b>axis.</b> An overriding guiding principle was that the War Stone should be the focus of the cemetery. The Cross of Sacrifice, however, usually functioned as the primary orienting feature of the cemetery for visitors, due to its height. In hilly areas, the architect had to ensure that the cross was visible from the road or path. (This was far less important in flat areas, obviously.) When a road passed directly by the cemetery, the cross usually was placed near the road and the entrance to the cemetery associated with the cross. [...] These design considerations meant that the Cross of Sacrifice could be placed in a wide variety of places. [...] Sometimes it was situated next to the War Stone, and sometimes in opposition to it. [...] In some cases, the Cross of Sacrifice was placed in a distant corner of the cemetery, so that its relationship to the Stone of Remembrance was not clear.|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{external}} fixation, where deformity correction is done gradually and lengthening occurs along the mechanical axis, the deformity correction in lengthening over nails (LON) and, more recently, implantable motorized lengthening nails is done acutely, and lengthening occurs along the nail axis coincident with the anatomical {{axis of the}} bone.

50|$|Most {{aerobatic}} maneuvers involve {{rotation of}} the aircraft about its longitudinal (roll) <b>axis</b> or <b>lateral</b> (pitch) <b>axis.</b> Other maneuvers, such as a spin, displace the aircraft about its vertical (yaw) axis. Maneuvers are often combined to form a complete aerobatic sequence for entertainment or competition. Aerobatic flying requires a broader set of piloting skills and exposes the aircraft to greater structural stress than for normal flight. In some countries, the pilot must wear a parachute when performing aerobatics.|$|R

30|$|Sixth {{mode shape}} shows {{oscillation}} of {{the interface between}} pad 3 and pad 4 about <b>lateral</b> (z) <b>axis.</b> As a result some draft pads exhibit third modal behaviour of individual draft pad. In the seventh mode shape, interfaces between pads 2 and 3, 4 and 5 remains fixed and interfaces between pads 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis causing every single pad to execute motion in accordance to first mode shape. The eight mode shape of draft gear is oscillation of all draft pad interfaces about <b>lateral</b> (z) <b>axis.</b> This oscillation results in fifth mode shape for all pads. For the ninth mode shape of draft gear, the interface between pads 3 and 4 remains fixed while the adjacent interfaces (i.e. interface between pads 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between pads 4 and 5, 5 and 6) oscillate in opposite direction. This mode thus causes all pads to behave in accordance to first mode shape. For the tenth mode shape of draft gear, interface between pads 2 and 3 and pads 4 and 5 oscillate between about vertical (y) axis in opposite phase. The resulting effect is that all pads execute second modal behaviour.|$|R
40|$|During linear accelerations, {{compensatory}} reflexes should continually {{occur in}} order to maintain objects of visual interest as stable images on the retina. In the present study, the three-dimensional organization of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in pigeons was quantitatively examined during linear accelerations produced by constant velocity off-vertical axis yaw rotations and translational motion in darkness. With off-vertical axis rotations, sinusoidally modulated eye-position and velocity responses were observed in all three components, with the vertical and torsional eye movements predominating the response. Peak torsional and vertical eye positions occurred when the head was oriented with the <b>lateral</b> visual <b>axis</b> of the right eye directed orthogonal to or aligned with the gravity vector, respectively. No steady-state horizontal nystagmus was obtained with any of the rotational velocities (8 - 58 degrees /s) tested. During translational motion, delivered along or perpendicular to the <b>lateral</b> visual <b>axis,</b> vertical and torsional eye movements were elicited. No significant horizontal eye movements were observed during lateral translation at frequencies up to 3 Hz. These responses suggest that, in pigeons, all linear accelerations generate eye movements that are compensatory to the direction of actual or perceived tilt of the head relative to gravity. In contrast, no translational horizontal eye movements, which are known to be compensatory to lateral translational motion in primates, were observed under the present experimental conditions...|$|R

The perspective vehicle symbol motions are successful in forward velocity control without affecting path-following performance.

30|$|Femoral {{lengthening}} with {{or along}} intramedullary (IM) nails will occur along {{the axis of}} the nail coincident with the anatomical axis of the bone. In the femur particularly, such lengthening often creates <b>lateral</b> mechanical <b>axis</b> deviation as the knee is driven medially. In cases where shortening is associated with frontal plane deformity the surgeon needs to correct the deformity intra-operatively, however, subsequent lengthening along the anatomical axis will create deformity. Thus, planning for lengthening of the femur with or along IM nails, whether shortening is associated with frontal plane deformity or not, requires a completely different planning strategy. The author questioned if a resolution anatomical axis can be identified and used for planning when lengthening the femur along or with IM nails while still applying the same classic CORA deformity analysis method.|$|R
