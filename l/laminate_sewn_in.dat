40|$|This work devotes to the {{theoretical}} investigations of spin-electromagnetic waves (<b>SEW)</b> propagating <b>in</b> a thin-film multiferroic structures that were {{composed of a}} slot-line and structures with several ferrite films. In contrast to earlier works, the spin-electromagnetic waves in the investigated structures are originated from two different electrodynamics coupling. The first one is coupling of the electromagnetic wave localized mainly in the slot-line with the spin wave excited mostly in the ferrite film. The second one is coupling of two spin waves in the different ferrite films separated by a thin ferroelectric film. For theoretical analysis of <b>SEWs</b> propagation <b>in</b> such kind of structures theories of their eigen-wave spectra were developed. Spectra of <b>SEW</b> <b>in</b> the investigated structures were calculated and analyzed. The range of electric and magnetic tunability of dispersion characteristic were investigated. Spectra of <b>SEW</b> <b>in</b> the investigated multiferroic structures are used for investigation of transfer function of periodic structures...|$|R
5|$|China's {{economic}} policies laid {{the basis of}} the industrialization drive in export-oriented development, and its reliance on low-wage manufacturing to produce consumer goods for the world market.
