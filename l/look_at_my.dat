500|$|Emma Thomas has co-produced all of {{his films}} (including Memento, in which she is {{credited}} as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E

500|$|The {{period from}} 1866 to 1884 is {{characterized}} by his major illustrated stories, such as Helen Who Couldn't Help It. These stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period. The life of his characters start well, but disintegrate, as in Painter Squirtle (Maler Klecksel); someone sensitive who becomes a pedant. Others concern recalcitrant children or animals, or make the great or significant foolish and ridiculous. The early stories follow the pattern of children's books of orthodox education, such as those by Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter, that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour. Busch did not assign value to his work, as he once explained to Heinrich Richter: [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> things for what they are, as Nuremberg trinkets , as Schnurr Pfeiferen [...] whose value {{is to be found}} not in its artistic content, but in public demand (...)".|$|E
500|$|... t all {{looks like}} reporting, but {{everything}} underscores (indique à l'évidence) {{that it is}} the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami shot the film several months after the 1990 earthquake), and that it is rather a document about [...] "fiction": not in the sense of imagining the unreal, but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the art of constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens a world and precedes himself in it (s'y prédède) is not pregiven (donnée toute faite) (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be invented, cut and edited. Thus it is evidence, insofar as, if one day I happen to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> street on which I walk up and down ten times a day, I construct for an instant a new evidence of my street.> ...|$|E

Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

I don't want them to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> flaws and be like, 'oh, that's the flaws of Islam'." [...] His mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 featured a remix of Kanye West's [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] entitled [...] "Muhammad Walks", which went on to become very popular in the Muslim community. He can be heard using Islamic recitals in [...] "Hurt Me Soul", [...] "Little Weapon", [...] "Hi-Definition" [...] as well as the intro and outro tracks to Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. Most recently, Lupe Fiasco claimed to believe Islam will one day take over the world.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Los Angeles, Cartwright won {{the lead}} role in the {{television}} movie Marian Rose White. Janet Maslin, a critic for The New York Times, described Cartwright as [...] "a chubby, lumbering, slightly cross-eyed actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film's impact". Cartwright replied by sending Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed, and included a photograph. Later, Cartwright auditioned {{for the role of}} Ethel, a girl who becomes trapped in a cartoon world in the third segment of [...] She met with director Joe Dante and later described him as [...] "a total cartoon buff, and once he took a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> resume and noticed Daws Butler's name on it, we were off and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation. After about twenty minutes, he said, 'considering your background, I don't see how I could cast anyone but you in this part! It was her first role in a feature film. The segment was based on The Twilight Zone television series episode [...] "It's a Good Life", which was later parodied in The Simpsons episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] (1992).|$|E
500|$|... "Lotus Intro" [...] is an {{electronic}} music song which lasts for a duration {{of it was}} inspired by Aguilera's passion for electronica. It has a [...] "hypnotic" [...] yet [...] "dark, serious" [...] tone which develops and matures as it progresses, depicting Aguilera's rebirth, similar to {{the life cycle of}} a Lotus Flower. The track opens with tribal chant by Aguilera, who sings the line [...] "Rise up lotus, rise/ This is the beginning" [...] over a [...] "heavy" [...] hip hop beat. Aguilera sings the lyrics [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> reflection and embrace the woman I've become/ The unbreakable lotus in me, I now set free" [...] over electronic [...] "bleeps and beeps". Some of the opening lyrics, including [...] "Rise up/ This is the beginning" [...] and [...] "Leave the past behind", serve as a mission statement {{for the rest of the}} album. Despite claiming to [...] "submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces" [...] and [...] "leave the past behind/ say goodbye to the scared child inside," [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard felt that the singer [...] "still has a few scores to settle." [...] According to Robert Copsey for Digital Spy, the singer explains how the a Lotus Flower is [...] "the unbreakable flower" [...] in the lyrics [...] "To the sky I rise/ Spread my wings and fly". He further wrote that the listener could be fooled by the title [...] "Lotus Intro", as it is a full length song and not a short introduction. Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post was critical of Aguilera's vocal performance, writing that although the singer's strength is her voice, she sounds [...] "modulated beyond recognition".|$|E

500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tom Wills, Australia's most revered cricketer of {{the mid-19th}} century, was also its most {{controversial}} {{and he was}} often accused of (and admitted to) throwing.

The umpire would look at Tom's feet, and Tom would let go a throw for all he was worth."
