40|$|Public health {{trends are}} {{currently}} monitored and diagnosed based on large studies that often rely on pen-and-paper data methods {{that tend to}} require a large collection campaign. With the pervasiveness of smart-phones and -watches throughout the general population, we argue in this paper that such devices and their built-in sensors {{can be used to}} capture such data more accurately with less of an effort. We present a system that targets a pan-European and harmonised architecture, using smartphones and wrist-worn activity loggers to enable the collection of data to estimate sedentary behavior and physical activity, plus the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. We report on a unified pilot study across three countries and four cities (with different languages, locale formats, and data security and privacy laws) in which 83 volunteers were asked to log beverages consumption along with a series of surveys and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data. Our system is evaluated in terms of compliance, obtained data, and first analyses. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{indirect}} {{tire pressure}} monitoring system uses the wheel rolling radius {{as an indicator}} of low tire pressure. When extra load is put in the trunk of a car, the load distribution in the car will change. This will affect the rolling radius which in its turn will be confused with a change in the tire pressure. To avoid this phenomenon, the load distribution has to be estimated. In this thesis methods for estimating the pitch angle of a car and an offset in the pitch angle caused by changed load distribution are presented and when an estimate is derived, a load distribution can be derived. Alot of available signals are used but the most important are the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>accelerometer</b> signal and the acceleration at the wheels derived from the velocity of the car. A few ways to detect or compensate for a non-zero road grade are also presented. Based on the estimated offset, a difference between the front and rear axle heights in the vehicle can be estimated and compensating for the changed load distribution in an indirect {{tire pressure monitoring system}} will be possible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Large, {{heterogeneous}} datasets {{are required}} to enhance understanding of the multi-level influences on children’s physical activity and sedentary behaviour. One route to achieving this is through the pooling and co-analysis of data from multiple studies. Where this approach is used, transparency of the methodology for data collation and harmonisation is essential to enable appropriate analysis and interpretation of the derived data. In this paper, we describe the acquisition, management and harmonisation of non-accelerometer data in a project to expand the International Children’s Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Method Following a consultation process, ICAD partners were requested to share accelerometer data and information on selected behavioural, social, environmental and health-related constructs. All data were collated into a single repository for cataloguing and harmonisation. Harmonised variables were derived iteratively, with input from the ICAD investigators and a panel of invited experts. Extensive documentation, describing the source data and harmonisation procedure, was prepared and made available through the ICAD website. Results Work to expand ICAD has {{increased the number of}} studies with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data, and expanded the breadth of behavioural, social and environmental characteristics that can be used as exposure variables. A set of core harmonised variables, including parent education, ethnicity, school travel mode/duration and car ownership, were derived for use by the research community. Guidance documents and facilities to enable the creation of new harmonised variables were also devised and made available to ICAD users. An expanded ICAD database was made available in May 2017. Conclusion The project to expand ICAD further demonstrates the feasibility of pooling data on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and potential determinants from multiple studies. Key to this process is the rigorous conduct and reporting of retrospective data harmonisation, which is essential to the appropriate analysis and interpretation of derived data. These documents, made available through the ICAD website, may also serve as a guide to others undertaking similar projects...|$|E
50|$|Automotive yaw {{sensors can be}} {{built around}} {{vibrating}} structure gyroscopes. These are used to detect error states in yaw compared to a predicted response when connected as an input to electronic stability control systems {{in conjunction with a}} steering wheel sensor. Advanced systems could conceivably offer rollover detection based on a second VSG but it is cheaper to add <b>longitudinal</b> and vertical <b>accelerometers</b> to the existing lateral one to this end.|$|R
30|$|From {{existing}} research {{we know that}} especially secondary tasks diminish drivers’ ability to control the vehicle safely. Thus a research area was dedicated to looking into attention selection mechanisms and the willingness of drivers to engage in secondary tasks. This area aims to understand why drivers are distracted and how they adapt when distracted. Video data will be used assessing the situation {{in front of the}} driver as well as identifying safety-critical events. A close view of the driver face is needed to see the gaze direction and a view inside the vehicle to identify whether and which secondary tasks are performed. A smart camera measures the distance to potential crash objects and pedal positions, vehicle speed, <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>accelerometers</b> will be used to identify driver reactions such as avoidance manoeuvres. Positioning data will be used to determine road type and other environmental variables.|$|R

Change in the proportion of registered time spent sedentary was used as the outcome variable in cross-classified linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and baseline sedentary time.
