Now a green sky in open and illumined distance is very frequent, and very beautiful; but rich olive-green clouds, as far as I am acquainted with nature, are a piece of color in which she is not apt to indulge.

60|$|Hence shadows are in reality, {{when the}} sun is shining, the most {{conspicuous}} thing in a landscape, next to the highest lights. All forms are understood and explained chiefly by their agency: the roughness of the bark of a tree, for instance, is not seen in the light, nor in the shade: it is only seen between the two, where the shadows of the ridges explain it. And hence, if we have to express vivid light, our very first aim must be to get the shadows sharp and visible; and this is not to be done by blackness, (though indeed chalk on white paper is the only thing which comes up to the intensity of real shadows,) but by keeping them perfectly flat, keen, and even. A very pale shadow, if it be quite flat--if it conceal the details of the objects it crosses--if it be gray and cold compared to their color, and very sharp edged, will be far more conspicuous, and make everything out of it look a great deal more like sunlight, than a shadow ten times its depth, shaded off at the edge, and confounded with the color of the objects on which it falls. Now the old masters of the Italian school, in almost all of their works, directly reverse this principle: they blacken their shadows till the picture becomes quite appalling, and everything in it invisible; but they make a point of losing their edges, and carrying them off by gradation; in consequence utterly destroying every appearance of sunlight. All their shadows are the faint, secondary darknesses of mere daylight; the sun has nothing whatever to do with them. The shadow between the pages of the book which you hold in your hand is distinct and visible enough, (though you are, I suppose, reading it by the ordinary daylight of your room,) out of the sun; and this weak and secondary shadow is all that we ever find in the Italian masters, as indicative of sunshine. Even Cuyp and Berghem, though they know thoroughly well what they are about in their foregrounds, forget the principle in their distances; and though in Claude's seaports, where he has plain architecture to deal with, he gives us something like real shadows along the stones, the moment we come to ground and foliage with <b>lateral</b> <b>light,</b> away go the shadows and the sun together. In the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca, in our own gallery, the trunks of the trees between the water-wheel and the white figure in the middle distance, are dark and visible; but their shadows are scarcely discernible on the ground, and are quite vague and lost in the building. In nature, every bit of the shadow would have been darker than the darkest part of the trunks, and both on the ground and building would have been defined and conspicuous; while the trunks themselves would have been faint, confused, and indistinguishable, in their illumined parts, from the grass or distance. So in Poussin's Phocion, the shadow of the stick on the stone in the right-hand corner, is shaded off and lost, while you see the stick plain all the way. In nature's sunlight {{it would have been the}} direct reverse--you would have seen the shadow black and sharp all the way down, but you would have had to look for the stick, which in all probability would in several places have been confused with the stone behind it.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{printing}} troubles on print quality is non-uniformity of printing density called print mottle. The causes of print mottle are various. As far as paper, {{it has been}} thought that surface roughness of paper, absorption of ink and fountain solution cause non-uniformity of ink transfer. As the results of evaluation on commercial coated paper, print mottle did not occur in solid area and non-uniformity of ink transfer also did not arise. But print mottle occurred in halftone dots, and it was thought another factor except ink transfer affect print mottle in halftone dots. This was confirmed because print mottle was also observed in halftone dots which shape and density were quite even on the paper (chemical proof). The purpose {{of this research is}} to clarify the cause affecting print mottle in halftone dots. It is known that apparent dot gain (optical dot gain) arises in halftone dots due to <b>lateral</b> <b>light</b> scattering of printing medium, and optical dot gain affects printing density. We set up a hypothesis that non-uniformity of optical dot gain causes print mottle in halftone dots. Therefore, we investigated the non-uniformity of <b>lateral</b> <b>light</b> scattering of paper that was thought to bring about the non-uniformity of optical dot gain. In the past researches to measure the <b>lateral</b> <b>light</b> scattering, ruled-lines were formed on the paper, the modulation arisen in amplitude of microdensity profile of ruled-lines due to light scattering, and light intensity distribution against distance was calculated from the modulation. We measured the modulation using printed ruled-lines on paper.

In order to keep light well confined within the slot, it is necessary to maintain the strip thin enough, but on the other hand, a too thin strip will not induce an appreciable change of effective index of the slot mode.

40|$|ABSTRACT Phototropic bending can be {{initiated}} without the transient changes in growth speed that characterize a light-growth response. The conditions required are {{a change from}} a symmetric to an asymmetric illumination pattern while the cell receives a constant radiant flux. Phototropism is thus basically a steady state process. It cannot be founded on differential lightgrowth responses as in Blaauw's theory. A possible model system for the unequal partition of growth during steady bending is discussed. The fact that lightgrowth responses show adaptation while phototropic bending does not follows from the different natures of the two responses. Phototropic curvature results from differences in growth rate across the diameter of a plant organ. These differences are caused by unequal light absorption due to an external illumination pattern asymmetric about the axis of structure and of growth. Bending is usually experimentally initiated by a single abrupt change in the illumination pattern from symmetrical to asymmetrical. For instance: (a) plant in darkness, then <b>lateral</b> <b>light</b> on; or (b) overhead light off, <b>lateral</b> <b>light</b> on; or (c) growth between two equal and opposite light sources, then one off. Cohen and Delbr/ick (1959) have cogently noted that in such phototropic experiments two variables are commonly changed simultaneously: first, the general level of light intensity; second, the distribution of light intensity about and within the plant. Two complexly associated effects then follow: (a) a transient change in the basic rate of growth, the so called light-growth response, and (b) a persisting growth rate difference across the plant manifested as bending. The connection between these two aspects of the phototropic response has been much debated since Blaauw (1918) forthrightly concluded that phototropic curvature was caused by unequal light-growth responses on the "near " and "far " sides of the curving organ.
