25|$|In May 1940, the franc was pegged to the German Reichsmark {{at a rate}} of 4 francs = 1 Reichsmark. This {{was changed}} to 10 francs = 1 Reichsmark in July 1940. On 26 August 1940, the Reichsmark was {{declared}} legal tender in Luxembourg and on 20 January 1941, the Reichsmark was declared the only legal tender and the franc was abolished. The <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>franc</b> was reestablished in 1944, once more tied to the Belgian franc at par.|$|E
25|$|Between 1944 and 2002, 1 <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>franc</b> {{was equal}} to 1 Belgian franc. Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg and Luxembourg francs were legal tender in Belgium. Nevertheless, {{payments}} in Luxembourg banknotes were commonly refused by shopkeepers in Belgium, either through ignorance or from fear that their other customers would refuse the banknotes (again, either through ignorance or from {{fear of being}} denied payment with it later), forcing them {{to go through the}} hassle of a trip to their bank to redeem the value of the banknote.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1840s, several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to obtain permission to open a casino in Mondorf-les-Bains. It was, however, only in 1977 that the Luxembourg parliament approved a bill authorizing gambling in Luxembourg. In September 1977, Mondorf-les-Bains was chosen as the only location in the country where a casino could operate. After the establishment of a company called Casino de jeux du Luxembourg, Mondorf-les-Bains/Luxemburgische Spielbank Bad Mondorf, the cornerstone of the building was laid in May 1982. Costing 350 million <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>francs,</b> the casino was opened at an inauguration ceremony on 16 April 1983.|$|R
2500|$|... 1 Luxembourgish franc {{was equal}} to 1 Belgian franc. Belgian francs were legal tender inside <b>Luxembourg,</b> and Luxembourgish <b>francs</b> were legal tender {{in the whole}} of Belgium.

2500|$|The Luxembourgish franc (more {{commonly}} <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Franc</b> or LUF, , , [...] ) was {{the currency}} of Luxembourg between 1854 and 1999 (except during the period 1941-44). The franc remained in circulation until 2002, when it {{was replaced by the}} euro. During the period 1999–2002, the franc was officially a subdivision of the euro (1 euro = 40.3399 francs) but the euro did not circulate.|$|E

5000|$|The Bellelli Family {{remained}} with Degas until his last move in 1913, {{at which time}} he left it with his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel. [...] The painting was not seen again publicly until after Degas's death, when it was put up for sale in 1918 {{as part of the}} painter's estate. Its unexpected appearance created a sensation, and The Bellelli Family was immediately purchased by the Musée du <b>Luxembourg</b> for 400,000 <b>francs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, Belgium, {{as well as}} France, {{experienced}} depreciation and {{an abrupt}} collapse of confidence, leading {{to the introduction of}} a new gold currency for international transactions, the Belga worth 5 francs, and the country's withdrawal from the monetary union, which ceased to exist {{at the end of the}} year. The Belga was tied to the British pound at a rate of 35 belgas (175 francs) = 1 pound and was thus put on a gold standard of 1 Belga = 209.211 mg fine gold. The 1921 monetary union of Belgium and Luxembourg survived, however, forming the basis for full economic union in 1932. In 1935, the Belgian franc was devalued by 28% to 150.632 mg fine gold and the link between the <b>Luxembourg</b> and Belgian <b>francs</b> was revised to 1 Luxembourgish franc = [...] Belgian francs.|$|R
2500|$|Alexandre Dumas {{reported}} that [...] "there {{is always a}} group {{in front of the}} picture..., painters of every school engaged in heated discussion". Both Dumas and Stendhal remarked that they thought the picture was a depiction of a plague, which in part it was. Gros, from whose Plague of Jaffa Delacroix had noticeably borrowed, called it [...] "the massacre of painting". Ingres said the painting exemplified the ‘fever and epilepsy’ of modern art. Critics Girodet and Thiers were, however, more flattering, and the painting was sufficiently well regarded for the state to purchase it the same year for the Musée du <b>Luxembourg</b> for 6000 <b>francs.</b> The purchase provoked internal conflicts in the Restoration arts administration, however, when the Comte de Forbin, director of the royal museums, bought the painting without the King's official approval, an irregular and politically risky procedure. In November 1874 it was transferred to the Musée du Louvre.|$|R

5000|$|Luxembourg's {{exit from}} the customs union with Germany brought about a {{profound}} restructuring of the Luxembourgish economy, especially with regards to currency. Until 1918, it was mostly German money that circulated in <b>Luxembourg,</b> while Luxembourgish <b>francs</b> only played a small role. The government took advantage of its {{exit from the}} Zollverein to create a proper national currency, a symbol of its sovereignty. A decree of 11 December 1918 regulated the exchange of the 200 million German marks in circulation, for Luxembourgish francs. This transaction brought about several logistical problems. The printing of new notes did not proceed fast enough, and the exchange rate of 1,25 was considered by some as an unjustified generosity towards investors by the state. The new franc was not backed by any gold reserves, and had no value abroad. The government also had the intention of creating a monetary union with Luxembourg's new economic partner. This partner's currency would be legal tender in the Grand Duchy. The question of currency occupied a central place in the negotiations {{which led to the}} Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union. In 1921, the Grand Duchy borrowed 175 million Belgian francs.|$|R

Under {{the terms of the}} treaty, the economic frontier was lifted and the Belgian franc and <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>franc</b> were set at a fixed parity (though revised in 1935 and 1944) establishing a monetary union, which existed up until the introduction of the Euro. The original treaty lasted for fifty years, expiring in 1972; this was extended for ten years in 1982 and again in 1992. On 18 December 2002, the two countries and the three regions of Belgium signed a new convention.|$|E
