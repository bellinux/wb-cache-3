40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} stream filtering scenario, there usually exist many filtering {{rules that}} specify the filtering objectives and many <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> that estimate the filtering rules. A filtering rule may connect to several different <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> and a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> may connect to several different filtering rules. An open problem {{in such a}} filtering scenario is how to order the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods {{are based on a}} greedy strategy which orders the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> according to three factors of the <b>filtering</b> <b>units,</b> i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn’t been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set empirically, which is unable to adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive ordering framework (AOF) which executes an adaptive ordering strategy. In AOF, all the temporal filtering results are preserved in each sliding window. Accordingly, the selectivity can adjust automatically and thus all the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> can be ordered with respect to the adapted selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AOF method outperforms other simple filtering methods. Keywords- multimedia streams, adaptivity ordering, filtering rules. I...|$|R

50|$|MERV 14 {{filters are}} capable of {{reducing}} smoke particles by approximately 80% when operating at the filter's design velocity, so a CADR smoke rating on a simple <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> that uses a MERV 14 filter will be approximately 0.80 times the fan flow rate in CFM. If the <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> does not mix the test room's air very well, it may receive a lower CADR measurement {{because it does not}} operate as efficiently as it should. If a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> uses a MERV 12 filter that removes roughly 40% of the smoke particles, then it may still obtain a smoke CADR of 80 by filtering 200 cubic feet per minute instead of 100 CFM. Conversely, a 99.97% HEPA filter (MERV 17) that removes over 99.9% of the smoke particles needs to filter 80 cubic feet per minute to get a CADR of 80. This shows the CFM airflow of a unit is always equal to or greater than the CADR rating.|$|R
