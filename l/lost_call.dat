40|$|AN {{important}} aspect of wireless system is {{the maintenance of a}} reliable and good radio link quality between the mobile station and the fixed system. When the mobile station crosses the cell boundary, handoff is required to switch the link from one base-station to another to preserve the quality and existence of the call. As cell size shrinks for more capacity, handoff becomes a critical issue. Unnecessary handoff not only increase the system burden, but also jeopardize voice quality and increase the change of <b>lost</b> <b>call.</b> In this thesis, a handoff algorithm referred to as the Fuzzy Adaptive Averaging-interval and Hysteresis-threshold handoff (FAAH) is introduced. FAAH utilizes the soft decision of fuzzy logic to control the handoff parameters. The fuzzy logic controller takes into the account for signal variation and to change the averaging interval accordingly, and dynamically adapts the hysteresis level with signal differences between the base-stations. Conventional algorithms with fixed signal averaging interval and/or fixed hysteresis level are lack of flexibility under changing mobile environment. The FAAH is designed to minimize handoff frequency, averaging delay, and the chance of <b>lost</b> <b>call.</b> FAAH is shown to enhance the system handoff performance over convent ion al algorithms under various mobile velocity and channel fading...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a handoff {{algorithm}} {{referred to}} as the Fuzzy Adaptive Averaging-interval and Hysteresis-threshold handoff (FAAH) is introduced. The design of the algorithm is intended to be used under lognormal fading environment. The algorithm consists of two fuzzy logic controllers. The first controller takes into the account for signal variation and to change the averaging interval (AVG) accordingly. The second controller dynamically adapts the hysteresis level (HYS) with signal differences between two stations. Conventional algorithms with fixed signal averaging interval and/or fixed hysteresis level are lack of flexibility under changing mobile environment. The FAAH is designed to strike a balance among handoff frequency, averaging delay, and the chance of <b>lost</b> <b>call.</b> Four experiments were performed: Constant AVG and HYS, Fuzzy controls on AVG and constant HYS, Fuzzy controls on HYS and constant AVG, and FAAH. The experimental results demonstrated that FAAH enhances the system handoff performance over conventional algorithms by about 50 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAll-optical circuit {{switching}} prevents contention by forbidding multiplexing beyond the wavelength granularity. The drawbacks {{of such a}} coarse granularity can be reduced thanks to translucent architectures with MSPPs (Multi-Service Provisioning Platforms). Another switching paradigm of interest is offered by the Optical Burst Switching (OBS) that manages finer granularity transfers but that encounters contentions, potentially entailing high loss rates. In this paper, {{within the context of}} core networks, we describe a translucent OBS architecture that performs intermediate re-aggregation and allows the reduction of the loss rate by interceding at two levels: Firstly, it provides sparse electrical buffering accessibility and, secondly, it uses aggregation grooming {{in order to reduce the}} aggregation delay and the traffic contention probability. A careful analysis of the traffic behavior in core networks leads us to propose an accurate traffic model, called LCH+, i. e., an enhanced <b>Lost</b> <b>Call</b> Held (LCH) model. Data plane transparency is then exploited to modulate the traffic at its emission. Extensive experiments show that re-aggregation helps reducing the loss probability thanks to electrical buffers whereas the aggregation grooming mitigates the drawbacks induced by electrical buffering on the delay and on the network cost. In addition, we show that the proposed translucent architecture can be highly valuable in clustered large core networks...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} the problem of {{evaluating}} deterministic EMS location models via simulation. For deterministic set covering location models, the performance of the model is typically determined by an objective function representing a certain type of coverage. After determining the location of EMS stations by deterministic models, we propose to conduct a simulation analysis to evaluate the performance by estimating the ''real'' coverage of the population. We compare 4 different deterministic models, Maximum Coverage Location Model (MCLM), Single Period Backup Double Covering Model (SPBDCM) which is a variant of MCLM, Maximum Service Restricted Set Covering Location Model (MSRSCLM) and finally Centralized Final Ratio Model (CFRM). By using optimization tools, we find the location of ambulances for each model by sıolving the mathematical models and then we simulate each setting for 2 different policies under the same parameters. The models' overall performance is firstly tested on Istanbul data and then followed up with extensive experimental study with different problem size, different layout and different arrival rates with two distinct policies. The tested policies include first come first serve with zero line capacity and <b>lost</b> <b>call</b> approach, and dispatching the closest idle station whether the call origin is served at the moment of the call or not. The study is then extended by a myopic heuristic, which basically tries to improve the performance of the system by relocating ambulances...|$|E
