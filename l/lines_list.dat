40|$|The Vitelline {{membrane}} {{outer layer}} protein 1 (VMO 1) was first {{identified in the}} Vitelline membrane of the chicken egg. This membrane almost entirely protein that separates the egg white from the yolk in amniotic eggs and acts as the last defensive barrier between pathogens and the egg yolk with the developing embryo. Since its discovery in the vitelline membrane, VMO 1 has been isolated {{from a number of}} different tissues and animals. The one that would appear to have the largest impact on human health would be its discovery in the Reissner’s membrane of mice, whose auditory system has high structural homology to humans. The Reissner’s membrane maintains the electrolyte level in the compartments of the inner ear as well as the resting electrochemical potential which are both critical for correct hearing function. The main aims of the research undertaken in this thesis was to 1) determine the tissues in which VMO 1 is or is not expressed in humans and 2) create a genetically modified expression clone of human VMO 1 to use in further downstream protein-protein interaction studies. Our hypothesis is that we can amplify VMO 1 from human cell lines based on available bioinformatics data. The first objective was to determine the gene expression of VMO 1 in multiple human cell lines. RNA was extracted from three commercial cell <b>lines</b> (<b>list)</b> and the integrity of RNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis by the observation of two rRNA bands. From this cDNA Abstract iii was made, and PCR analysis performed to identify the expression, or not, of VMO 1 in these tissues. Successful amplification of VMO 1 from lung cells (A 549) lead {{to the creation of a}} human VMO 1 expression clone, by transforming competent Escherichia coli cells with ligated VMO- 1 insert/pPLUG vector. White colonies were selected for DNA extraction and confirmed as positive using colony PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA seuqencing of the positive clone confirmed the nucleotide sequence as VMO 1. The second objective was to validate the commercial antibody for human VMO 1 using physiological and immunohistochemical methodology. The immunohistochemistry data suggests that the VMO 1 protein is a secreted protein since signal was detected in the P 5 mouse inner ear and mouse adult lung. However, multiple bands were observed in the western blot. Futher investigation is required to validate the VMO 1 antibody to demonstrate that it is indeed specific to recognising its target epitope. The production of recombinant VMO 1 protein would be benefical to address this question...|$|E
40|$|Molecular <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> are {{important}} for modelling absorption and emission processes in atmospheres of different astronomical objects, such as cool stars and exoplanets. In order to be applicable for high temperatures, <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> for molecules like methane must contain billions of transitions, which makes their direct (line-by-line) application in radiative transfer calculations impracticable. Here we suggest a new, hybrid <b>line</b> <b>list</b> format to mitigate this problem, {{based on the idea}} of temperature-dependent absorption continuum. The <b>line</b> <b>list</b> is partitioned into a large set of relatively weak lines and a small set of important, stronger lines. The weaker lines are then used either to construct a temperature-dependent (but pressure-independent) set of intensity cross sections or are blended into a greatly reduced set of super-lines. The strong lines are kept in the form of temperature independent Einstein A coefficients. A <b>line</b> <b>list</b> for methane is constructed as a combination of 17 million strong absorption lines relative to the reference absorption spectra and a background methane continuum in two temperature-dependent forms, of cross sections and super-lines. This approach eases the use of large high temperature <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> significantly as the computationally expensive calculation of pressure dependent profiles only need to be performed for {{a relatively small number of}} lines. Both the <b>line</b> <b>list</b> and cross sections were generated using a new 34 billion methane <b>line</b> <b>list</b> (34 to 10), which extends the 10 to 10 <b>line</b> <b>list</b> to higher temperatures (up to 2000 K). The new hybrid scheme can be applied to any large <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> containing billions of transitions. We recommend to use super-lines generated on a high resolution grid based on resolving power (R = 1, 000, 000) to model the molecular continuum as a more flexible alternative to the temperature dependent cross sections...|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} {{and responses to}} emerging public health threats rely {{on the availability of}} timely surveillance data. During the early stages of an epidemic, the ready availability of <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> with detailed tabular information about laboratory-confirmed cases can assist epidemiologists in making reliable inferences and forecasts. Such inferences are crucial to understand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or control the outbreak.

In this paper, we motivate Guided Deep List, the first tool for building automated <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> (in near real-time) from open source reports of emerging disease outbreaks. Specifically, we focus on deriving epidemiological characteristics of an emerging disease and the affected population from reports of illness.

Received XXXX; in {{original}} form XXXX A revised rotation-vibration <b>line</b> <b>list</b> for the combined hydrogen cyanide (HCN) / hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) system is presented. The <b>line</b> <b>list</b> uses ab initio transi-tion intensities calculated previously (Harris et al., ApJ, 2002, 578, 657) and extensive datasets of recently measured experimental energy levels (Mellau, J. Chem. Phys. and J. Mol. Spectrosc. 2010 - 2011). The resulting <b>line</b> <b>list</b> has significantly more accurate wavelengths than previous ones for these systems. An improved {{value for the}} sepa-ration between HCN and HNC is adopted leading to an approximately 25 % lower predicted thermal population of HNC {{as a function of}} temperature in the key 2000 to 3000 K region. Temperature-dependent partition functions and equilibrium constants are presented. The <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> are validated by comparison with laboratory spectra and are presented in full as supplementary data to the article and at www. exomol. com.

40|$|Hot <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> for two isotopologues of water, and, are presented. The {{calculations}} employ newly constructed {{potential energy}} surfaces (PES) which {{take advantage of}} a novel method for using the large set of experimental energy levels for to give high quality predictions for and. This procedure greatly extends the energy range for which a PES can be accurately determined, allowing accurate prediction of higher-lying energy levels than are currently known from direct laboratory measurements. This PES is combined with a high-accuracy, ab initio dipole moment surface of water in the computation of all energy levels, transition frequencies and associated Einstein A coefficients for states with rotational excitation up to J= 50 and energies up to 30 000. The resulting HotWat 78 <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> complement the well-used BT 2 <b>line</b> <b>list</b> (Barber et. al, 2006, MNRAS, 368, 1087).

40|$|Comprehensive vibration-rotation <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> {{for eight}} isotopologues of carbon monosulphide (CS) (^ 12 C^ 32 S, ^ 12 C^ 33 S, ^ 12 C^ 34 S, ^ 12 C^ 36 S, ^ 13 C^ 32 S, ^ 13 C^ 33 S, ^ 13 C^ 34 S, ^ 13 C^ 36 S) in their ground {{electronic}} states are calculated. These <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> {{are suitable for}} temperatures up to 3000 K. A spectroscopically-determined potential energy curve (PEC) and dipole moment curve (DMC) are taken from literature. This PEC is adapted to suit our method prior to the computation of ro-vibrational energies. The calculated energies are then substituted by experimental energies, where available, to improve {{the accuracy of the}} <b>line</b> <b>lists.</b> The ab initio DMC is used without refinement to generate Einstein A coefficients. Full <b>line</b> <b>lists</b> of vibration-rotation transitions and partition functions are made available in an electronic form as supporting information to this paper and at .

40|$|New {{rotational}} line strengths for the C 2 Swan {{system have}} been calculated for vibrational bands with v'= 0 - 10 and v"= 0 - 9, and J {{values up to}} J= 34 - 96, based on previous observations in 30 vibrational bands. Line positions from several sources were combined with the results from recent deperturbation studies of the v'= 4 and v'= 6 states, and a weighted global least squares fit was performed. We report the updated molecular constants. The line strengths {{are based on a}} recent ab initio calculation of the transition dipole moment function. A <b>line</b> <b>list</b> has been made available, including observed and calculated line positions, Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths (f-values). The <b>line</b> <b>list</b> will be useful for astronomers and combustion scientists who utilize C 2 Swan spectra. Einstein A coefficients and f-values were also calculated for the vibrational bands of the Swan system.
