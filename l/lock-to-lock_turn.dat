25|$|Another handling-related {{improvement}} was optional variable-ratio power steering. Rather than a fixed ratio of 17.5:1, requiring four <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock,</b> {{the new system}} varied its ratio from 14.6:1 to 18.9:1, needing 3.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b> <b>Turning</b> diameter was reduced from 40.9feet (12.5m) to 37.4feet (11.4m).|$|R
50|$|Fast ratio {{steering}} arms: 3 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> (without reducing <b>turning</b> radius). Stock {{steering arms}} are modified by cutting and rewelding into shortened arms. The arms are then magnafluxed.|$|R

The arms are then magnafluxed and painted blue. Short throw gearshift assembly: Reduces shift travel {{to give a}} sportscar-like feel.|$|R
5000|$|The WRX STi {{receives}} the same increase in wheelbase as the Spec C. All STis received additional rear arch flaring {{in order to}} allow an increase in wheel size. The wheel size changed from 17" [...] x 7.5" [...] to 17" [...] x 8". In accordance with the increased wheel width, steering <b>lock-to-lock</b> <b>turns</b> have been reduced. Wheel hub strength was improved. The P.C.D. was changed from 5 x 100 mm to 5 x 114.3 mm. The interior was vastly improved as well. A whole new center console now brings out a very high grade interior feel.|$|R

5000|$|Major {{changes were}} made to the S-Type's {{steering}} system. The Burman power steering system in the Mark 2, with its 4.3 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock,</b> was regarded as being excessively low geared and lacking in road feel. In the S-Type it was replaced by a higher-geared Burman unit of 3.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock,</b> which linked the input shaft and hydraulic valve by a torsion spring to improve its [...] "feel".|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} Japanese-spec C models, US-spec STis {{received}} additional rear fender flaring {{in order to}} allow an increase in wheel size. The wheel size went from 17" [...] x 7.5" [...] to 17" [...] x 8". In accordance with the increased wheel width, steering <b>lock-to-lock</b> <b>turns</b> have been reduced. Wheel hub strength was improved. The P.C.D. was changed from 5 x 100 to 5 x 114.3. The Suretrac front LSD in the 2004 model was replaced with a helical unit, the rear differential remains the same clutch type unit. Torque split is set at 35/65. In the interior, the Stereo became standard. The badging has been revised and different look was given to the steering wheel, shift knob, HVAC controls, and center console.|$|R
5000|$|Rack and pinion, a small {{quantity}} of cars also had hydraulic power assistance. Steering wheel diameter 14 in, 1.8 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock,</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Requires minimal {{physical}} exertion - In the SM {{the steering}} wheel can be <b>turned</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> with one finger when the car is standing ...|$|R
50|$|The lighter Roadster (3) was {{slightly}} taller geared; while the heavier New Drophead also (3) {{was slightly}} lower geared. Other differences to the Conquest saloon (1) include 1/2 in brakes, and steering that was 2½ <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> instead of 3¼.|$|R
50|$|The power {{steering}} {{was driven by}} a Hobourn-Eaton pump, operating at 600-650 psi. It {{was attached to the}} back of the generator and allowed the steering to be geared up to 3.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> as against the 4.5 turns for the Mark VII and VIII models.|$|R
25|$|Major {{criticisms of}} the GTO {{continued}} to center on its slow steering (ratio of 17.5:1, four <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock)</b> and subpar brakes. Car Life was satisfied with the metallic brakes on its GTO, but Motor Trend and Road Test found the four-wheel drum brakes with organic linings to be alarmingly inadequate in high-speed driving.|$|R
5000|$|Features include 900° {{steering}} (2.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock),</b> {{with force}} feedback, via a full-sized (diameter 28 cm), Momo-styled steering, full-sized throttle and brake pedals, standard PlayStation 3 gamepad buttons ( [...] , , [...] and [...] ), a D-pad, an R3 and L3 button, {{both sets of}} shoulder buttons, both Start and Select buttons, and a PS button.|$|R
2500|$|Steering is {{rack and}} pinion, {{with an overall}} {{steering}} ratio of 14.9:1, giving 2.65 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> and a [...] turning circle. DMC-12s are fitted with cast alloy wheels, measuring [...] in diameter by [...] wide {{on the front and}} [...] in diameter by [...] wide on the rear. These were fitted with Goodyear NCT steel-belted radial tires. Because the DeLorean is a rear engine vehicle, the DMC-12 has a 35%–65% front–rear weight distribution.|$|R
50|$|The monocoque, {{according}} to Zenvo, {{is made of}} lightweight steel and aluminum. The suspension has been improved, which now includes a hydraulic lift system (HLS). It is also installed with front and rear double-wishbones, and 3-way power adjustable shock absorbers. The front and rear Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes are now larger, measuring 395 mm at the front and 380 mm at the rear, both including 6-piston calipers. The steering is rack-and-pinion with a 2.2 <b>turn</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced <b>lock-to-lock</b> <b>turns</b> from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|R
50|$|Steering is {{rack and}} pinion, {{with an overall}} {{steering}} ratio of 14.9:1, giving 2.65 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> and a 35 ft turning circle. DMC-12s are fitted with cast alloy wheels, measuring 14 in in diameter by 6 in wide {{on the front and}} 15 in in diameter by 8 in wide on the rear. These were fitted with Goodyear NCT steel-belted radial tires. Because the DeLorean is a rear engine vehicle, the DMC-12 has a 35%-65% front-rear weight distribution.|$|R
50|$|The Civic {{is based}} on an all-new {{platform}} which utilizes higher grade steel, the unit body is 68 lb lighter than the prior model and the center of gravity has been reduced 0.6 in. The sedan's wheelbase is 1.2 in longer with rear disc brakes made standard. To minimize NVH the Civic adds fluid-filled suspension bushings. A dual pinion steering system is introduced along with a thicker and more rigid 30 mm diameter steering column for improved steering feel, additionally the steering gear ratio is variable, with 2.2 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> compared to 3.1 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> from the previous model and a quicker 10.93:1 steering ratio. The exterior features standard LED DRLs and C-shaped LED taillights. Headlamps with LED low and high beams along with amber LED turn signals are optional. US models went on sale in November 2015 as 2016 model year vehicles. Models include a choice of two engines: a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter I4 engine paired to either a six-speed manual or CVT transmission, or 1.5-liter turbocharged direct injected I4 engine with only a CVT transmission. The sedan's 2.0-liter engine paired with the CVT has an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 31/40/34 mpg (city/highway/combined).|$|R
5000|$|Released on December 13, 2007, the Logitech Driving Force GT is a PlayStation 3 racing wheel {{peripheral}} {{intended for}} use with racing games. It is manufactured and distributed by Logitech International S.A of Romanel-sur-Morges, Switzerland. It features include 900° steering (2.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock),</b> with force feedback, via a full-sized (diameter 45 cm), MOMO-styled steering wheel and full-sized throttle and brake pedals. It also features PlayStation 3 standard gamepad buttons (with gray colored , , [...] and [...] symbols), a PS/Home button (labeled PS), L3/R3 buttons, individually sprung to simulate real pedal efforts.|$|R
50|$|Super S trim was {{available}} in 1993-1997, then the name was changed to SR (Facelift); Differences include a slightly faster 3.6 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> rack, over the standard 3.8 turns, different colour coded front and rear bumpers, colour coded wing mirrors and bump strips, rear wrap around spoiler, front fog lights, remote fuel flap opening, wider 175/60/r13 tyres, rear ash tray, tachometer, more heavily bolstered seats, split folding rear seats and rear speaker shelf as standard. Features such as electric windows and power steering were still optional extras. The only engine available for the Super S was the 75 bhp CG13DE/ 1.3 twin cam 16v engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} has a {{capacity}} of 70 L. The battery {{is located in the}} passenger compartment, behind the seats, in the Spider, whereas it is located the boot in the GTV. The optional CD auto changer is located in the boot, and the fuel tank is ahead of the rear axle line, behind the rear seats for increased safety. The power assisted steering has a very high ratio, giving 2.2 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b> The bonnet and bootlid are supported on nitrogen filled struts. A spacesaver spare wheel was supplied, and there was a no-cost option of an aerosol can of tyre repair sealant. This was a factory standard from 1998 as it increased the usable size of the very small boot to 155 L.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{advanced}} for its time, the Hydrosteer {{system did}} have certain drawbacks, {{in common with}} all variable ratio steering systems of the era. It was more complicated and expensive than a constant ratio power assisted system. The Hydrosteer system was also criticised for feeling far too light under most circumstances. An article in Car magazine in January 1968 on the Rover P5B was particularly scathing about the lightness and lack of feel of Hydrosteer steering. Similar criticism appeared in other contemporary road test articles on the Rover and Vanden Plas 4-Litre R. Much {{of the blame for}} this may lie with the cars' manufacturers, who would have instructed Hydrosteer what to supply in terms of number of <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock</b> and degree of power assistance.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} Riviera {{was introduced}} on October 4, 1962, as a 1963 model, Its distinctive bodyshell was {{unique to the}} marque, unusual for a GM product. It rode a cruciform frame similar to the standard Buick frame, but shorter and narrower, with a [...] narrower track. Its wheelbase of [...] and overall length of [...] were [...] and [...] shorter, respectively, than a Buick LeSabre, but slightly longer than a contemporary Thunderbird. At , it was about [...] lighter than either. It shared the standard Buick V8 engines, with a displacement of either [...] or , and the unique continuously variable design twin turbine automatic transmission. Power brakes were standard, using Buick's massive [...] "Al-Fin" [...] (aluminum finned) drums of [...] diameter. Power steering was standard equipment, with an overall steering ratio of 20.5:1, giving 3.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} Auburn's [...] L-head Lycoming inline 8 from the Auburn 120, with the {{crankshaft}} pushed {{out through the}} front of the block and the flywheel mounted there, driving a three-speed transmission. Gearing in both transmission and front axle was inadequate, and the 4700 lb car was underpowered, limited to a trifle over 80 mph, inadequate even at the time, and readily exceeded by the less expensive Auburn. Still, the styling was lovely, and despite the 137.5 in wheelbase and steering demanding fully four <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock,</b> handling was reportedly superb. Priced around US$3,000, it was competitive with Cadillac, Marmon, Lincoln, Packard, Franklin, and Stutz; the 1930 Chrysler copied several styling elements. It could not outrun the Great Depression, and by 1932, it was discontinued, with just 4,400 sold. Wheelbase was 137.5" [...] and the height of the sedan was 61".|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} Riviera's distinctive bodyshell {{was unique}} to it, {{unusual for a}} GM product. It rode a cruciform frame similar to the standard Buick frame, but shorter and narrower, with a 2.0 in narrower track. Its wheelbase of 117 in and overall length of 208 in were 6.0 in and 7.7 in shorter, respectively, than a Buick LeSabre, but slightly longer than a contemporary Thunderbird. At 3998 lb, it was about 390 lb lighter than either. It shared the standard Buick V8 engines, with a displacement of either 401 cuin L or 425 cuin L, and the unique continuously variable design twin turbine automatic transmission. Power brakes were standard, using Buick's massive [...] "Al-Fin" [...] (aluminum finned) drums of 12 in diameter. Power steering was standard equipment, with an overall steering ratio of 20.5:1, giving 3.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ladder-type chassis used 2 in tubing for {{the front}} and rear sub-structures. Front {{suspension}} was by equal-length upper and lower A-arms. The early tubular steel arms were replaced by forged aluminum in later cars. At the rear were two trailing links per side and a de Dion axle with a 3.73:1 ratio Salisbury differential that received a finned aluminum cover made by Devin. A Woodhead-Monroe coil-over-shock-absorber at each wheel handled springing and damping. Brakes were by Girling, with 12 in disks at the front and 11 in disks mounted inboard at the rear. Dunlop tires were mounted on Dunlop knock-off wire wheels. Steering was by a BMC rack-and-pinion unit with 2.5 <b>turns</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b> The interior had two bucket seats and was trimmed in carpet. The dash, designed for either left- or right-hand drive builds, had Stewart-Warner gauges, including a 200 mile-per-hour speedometer and a 10,000 RPM tachometer.|$|R
5000|$|A Racing wheel, {{essentially}} a larger {{version of a}} paddle, is used in most racing arcade games {{as well as more}} recent racing simulators such as Live for Speed, Grand Prix Legends, GTR2, and Richard Burns Rally. While most arcade racing games have been using steering wheels since Gran Trak 10 in 1974, the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on fifth-generation consoles such as the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Many are force feedback (see Force Feedback Wheel), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the Logitech Driving Force Pro, Logitech G25 and Logitech G27 can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 <b>turns,</b> <b>lock-to-lock.</b> The Namco Jogcon paddle was available for the PlayStation game R4: Ridge Racer Type 4. Unlike [...] "real" [...] video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a soda can's) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some VCRs. The Nintendo Wii game Mario Kart Wii is bundled with the Wii Wheel: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the Wii Remote is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the kart during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the Nintendo 3DS game Mario Kart 7. When the steering wheel is placed {{on the back of the}} console, then it will have the same ability as in Mario Kart Wii by using the gyroscope in first-person mode.|$|R
