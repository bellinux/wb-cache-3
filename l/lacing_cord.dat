The use of graphite dope was not publicized and I doubt if its use was widely known at the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.|$|E

25|$|People {{who choose}} to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as poplin, grosgrain, percale, cotton, wool, cassimere, broadcloth, Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types {{including}} artificial silk/rayon, Ottoman (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), taffeta, satin, alpaca, true silk, shot silk, or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive. Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp <b>lace,</b> <b>cords,</b> buttons, {{or other forms of}} decoration.|$|R
50|$|The art {{and history}} of tassels are known by its French name, passementerie, or Posamenten {{as it was called}} in German. The {{military}} output of the artisans called passementiers (ornamental braid, <b>lace,</b> <b>cord,</b> or trimmings makers) is evident in catalogs of various military uniform and regalia makers of centuries past. The broader art form of passementerie, with its divisions of Decor, Clergy and Nobility, Upholstery, Coaches and Livery, and Military, is covered in a few books on that subject, none of which are in English.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative and adaptive perturbation technique {{for the analysis}} of nonuniform transmission lines. Place-dependent variations of the per-unit-length parameters are interpreted as perturbations with respect to their average values along the line. This allows casting the governing equations for the corresponding perturbations of the voltages and currents as those of a uniform transmission line with distributed sources. Therefore, standard transmission line theory is used to calculate these perturbation terms. Specifically, perturbations of increasing order are computed iteratively starting from the solution of the unperturbed line. The accuracy is adaptively adjusted by setting a threshold on the convergence of the solution. The algorithm turns out to be simple to implement and very accurate, yet faster than traditional approaches based on the discretization of the line into uniform sections. The technique is validated through the analysis of several nonuniform transmission line structures of relevance in EMC applications, namely uniformly and nonuniformly twisted wire pairs as well as a cable bundle with <b>lacing</b> <b>cords...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{uniform of}} the corps was dark blue tunics and trousers, the latter with broad scarlet stripes. The tunic had a scarlet collar with silver grenades embroidered on both sides, blue cuffs, five rows of black <b>cord</b> <b>lace</b> on the breast, and black cord shoulder cords and Austrian knot. The head-dress was a busby, a round forage-cap with red band being worn in undress, and the belts were black. The 2nd Midlothian at first had scarlet cuffs and collar and white belts, but on amalgamation conformed to the dress of the 1st Corps.|$|R

The upper part--consisting of narrow planks <b>laced</b> {{together}} with <b>cords</b> of sinnate--had in many places fallen off, and lay decaying upon the ground. Still, there were ample accommodations left for sleeping; and in we sprang--the doctor into the bow, and I into the stern. I soon fell asleep; but waking suddenly, cramped in every joint from my constrained posture, I thought, for an instant, that I must have been prematurely screwed down in my coffin.|$|R
50|$|Consisting of a {{stack of}} tiny, nested boxes, inrō were most {{commonly}} used to carry identity seals and medicine. The stack of boxes is held together by a <b>cord</b> that is <b>laced</b> through <b>cord</b> runners down one side, under the bottom, and up the opposite side. The ends of the cord are secured to a netsuke, a kind of toggle that is passed between the sash and pants and then hooked {{over the top of}} the sash to suspend the inrō. An ojime, or bead, is provided on the cords between the inrō and netsuke to hold the boxes together. This bead is slid down the two suspension cords to the top of the inrō to hold the stack together while the inrō is worn, and slid up to the netsuke when the boxes need to be unstacked to access their contents. Inrō were made of a variety of materials, including wood, ivory, bone, and lacquer. Lacquer was also used to decorate inro made of other materials.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{the day was}} out {{the whole}} {{enterprise}} was planned. They decided at first that they would call themselves the Naval Mr. O's, a plagiarism, and not perhaps a very good one, from {{the title of the}} well-known troupe of [...] "Scarlet Mr. E's," [...] and Bert rather clung {{to the idea of a}} uniform of bright blue serge, with a lot of gold <b>lace</b> and <b>cord</b> and ornamentation, rather like a naval officer's, but more so. But that had to be abandoned as impracticable, it would have taken too much time and money to prepare. They perceived they must wear some cheaper and more readily prepared costume, and Grubb fell back on white dominoes. They entertained the notion for a time of selecting the two worst machines from the hiring-stock, painting them over with crimson enamel paint, replacing the bells by the loudest sort of motor-horn, and doing a ride about to begin and end the entertainment. They doubted the advisability of this step.|$|R
50|$|For the {{composition}} of the flammable material used in a carcass, 18th century philosopher Christian Wolff prescribed 10 parts of pounded gunpowder, 2 of nitre, 1 of sulfur, and 1 of colophony; or 6 of gunpowder, 4 of nitre, 4 of sulfur, 1 of beaten glass, 0.5 of antimony 0.5 of camphor, 1 of sal armoniac, and 0.25 of common salt. For the shell, he started with two iron rings (others used plates), fitting one at one extreme, near the aperture at which the carcass was to be fired, and the other at the other. These he braced with cords drawn lengthwise; and across these, at right angles, <b>laced</b> other <b>cords,</b> making a knot at each intersection. Between the folds of the cords, he made holes, inserted copper tubes, and filled them half full of powder and lead bullets, packing it in with a tow. The internal shell's aperture was then plugged up, and it was immersed in a mixture of 4 parts of melted pitch, 20 of rosin, 1 of oil of turpentine, and as much ground gunpowder as was needed to reduce it to the consistency of a paste. After immersion, the shell was to be covered with tow, and immersed again, until it was the proper size for the mortar.|$|R
60|$|He {{was aware}} of his good looks, and his dress not only showed that he was single, but that he hoped to be married soon. He wore brown trousers, which fitted him very well, and a dark-blue shirt, which had a gay <b>lacing</b> of red <b>cord</b> in front, {{and a pair of}} {{suspenders}} that were a vivid green. On his head he wore a Chinese straw helmet; which was as ugly as anything could conceivably be, but he was as proud of it as he was of his green suspenders. In summer he wore no coat at all, and even in pretty cold weather he left his vest on his wagon seat, not being able to bring himself to the point of covering up the red and green of his attire.|$|R

5000|$|Crazy quilts are {{so named}} because their pieces are not regular, and they are {{scattered}} {{across the top of}} the quilt like [...] "crazed" [...] (cracked or crackled) pottery glazing. They were originally very refined, luxury items. Geometric pieces of rich fabrics were sewn together, and highly decorative embroidery was added. Such quilts were often effectively samplers of embroidery stitches and techniques, displaying the development of needle skills of those in the well-to-do late 19th-century home. They were show pieces, not used for warmth, but for display. The luxury fabrics used precluded frequent washing. They often took years to complete. Fabrics used included silks, wools, velvet, linen, and cotton. The mixture of fabric textures, such as a smooth silk next to a textured brocade or velvet, was embraced. Designs were applied to the surface, and other elements such as ribbons, <b>lace,</b> and decorative <b>cording</b> were used exuberantly. Names and dates were often part of the design, added to commemorate important events or associations of the maker. Politics were included in some, with printed campaign handkerchiefs and other preprinted textiles (such as advertising silks) included to declare the maker's sentiments.|$|R
60|$|The first {{object that}} met his eye, {{as he moved}} into the room, was Elizabeth in her riding-habit, richly <b>laced</b> with gold <b>cord,</b> her fine form bending toward him, and her face expressing deep anxiety {{in every one of}} its {{beautiful}} features. The enormous knees of the physician struck each other with a noise that was audible; for, in the absent state of his mind, he mistook her for a general officer, perforated with bullets, hastening from the field of battle to implore assistance. The delusion, however, was but momentary, and his eye glanced rapidly from the daughter to the earnest dignity of the father’s countenance; thence to the busy strut of Richard, who was cooling his impatience at the hunter’s indifference to his assistance, by pacing the hall and cracking his whip; from him to the Frenchman, who had stood for several minutes unheeded with a chair for the lady; thence to Major Hartmann, who was very coolly lighting a pipe three feet long by a candle in one of the chandeliers; thence to Mr. Grant, who was turning over a manuscript with much earnestness at one of the lustres; thence to Remarkable, who stood, with her arms demurely folded before her, surveying, with a look of admiration and envy, the dress and beauty of the young lady; and from her to Benjamin, who, with his feet standing wide apart, and his arms akimbo, was balancing his square little body with the indifference of one who is accustomed to wounds and bloodshed. All of these seemed to be unhurt, and the operator began to breathe more freely; but, before he had time to take a second look, the Judge, advancing, shook him kindly by the hand, and spoke.|$|R
5000|$|A few demos {{produced}} by them {{were sent to}} songwriter Jenson Vaughan, who liked the lyrics and the [...] "bass-driven" [...] sound. Vaughan added the top-line on a demo and returned it to Moxey, who shared it with Benassi's European co-manager Paul Sears, who in-turn shared the demo with Oseary. Upon listening, Madonna {{was impressed with the}} demos and requested the Benassi Bros. to come to London for a recording session. Moxey commented that the singer [...] "loved producer. Benny is such a quality person; I think that made it all flow so much easier." [...] Two tracks from those sessions, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] and [...] "I'm Addicted", were included on the final track list of the album, named MDNA. Madonna spoke about her experience of collaborating with the Benassi Bros.:Benny was a tricky one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It was a little bit frustrating at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.A day after Madonna's halftime show performance on the Super Bowl XLVI, the singer confirmed to Ryan Seacrest that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] would be released as the second single from the album.
