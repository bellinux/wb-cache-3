5|$|After Marius, {{the legions}} were drawn largely from {{volunteer}} citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers {{came forward and}} were accepted not from citizens {{of the city of}} Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as veterans, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. The <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> the late Republic remained, unlike the <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Senate grew {{increasingly}} alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Crassus, and {{the realization that the}} <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E

5|$|Even {{according}} to the more conservative estimate, the auxilia were by this time significantly larger than the legions, which contained c. 155,000 effectives (28 <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> 5,500 men each) at this time, of which just 3,360 were cavalry.

5000|$|The Philippine <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Honor (Lehiyong Pandangal ng Pilipinas) was {{established}} by President Manuel Roxas, through Philippine Army Circular No. 60 dated July 3, 1947. The Philippine <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Honor was patterned after the <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Merit of the United States of America, and was meant to honor both civilians {{and members of the}} military, Filipino or foreign. Originally, like the U.S. <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Merit, the Philippine <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Honor only had four classes, known as Degrees, with Legionnaire being the basic rank, and Chief Commander being the highest. With the reform of the Philippine system of orders and decorations in 2003, the Philippine <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Honor's classes were renamed [...] "ranks" [...] instead of [...] "degrees," [...] and the ranks expanded.|$|R
5|$|Recruitment {{was thus}} heavy {{throughout}} the Augustan period, {{with a steady}} {{increase in the number}} of units formed. By AD 23, the Roman historian Tacitus records that there were roughly the same numbers of auxiliaries in service as there were legionaries. Since at this time there were 25 <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> c. 5,000 men each, the Auxilia thus amounted to c. 125,000 men, implying c. 250 auxiliary regiments.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Merit {{is similar}} to the French <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Honor in both its design, a five armed cross, and in that it is awarded in {{multiple}} degrees. Unlike the <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Honor, however, the <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Merit is only awarded to military personnel.

The division took 13,351 enemy {{prisoners of war}} on its own. Members of the division won three Medals of Honor, seven Distinguished Service Crosses, five <b>Legions</b> <b>of</b> Merit, 492 Silver Star Medals, 23 Soldier's Medals, 5,156 Bronze Star Medals, and 90 Air Medals.

5|$|Though Madonna {{is often}} overshadowed by her producers, {{she has her}} moments, and she is never more {{inspired}} than on the so-silly-it's-great 'Impressive Instant', yet another homage to the music that leaves her and <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> followers 'spinning, baby, out of control'. She deserves credit for allowing her latest interpretation of that music to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm to Sacramento going bonkers with her.|$|E

5|$|Triarii (singular: Triarius) {{were one}} of the {{elements}} of the early Roman military manipular <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> the early Roman Republic (509 BC – 107 BC). They were the oldest and among the wealthiest men in the army and could afford high quality equipment. They wore heavy metal armor and carried large shields, their usual position being the third battle line. They were equipped with spears and were considered to be elite soldiers among the legion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 49 BC, the {{hardened}} <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Caesar crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar {{turned his attention to}} the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E
