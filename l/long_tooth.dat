5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and <b>long</b> <b>tooth</b> rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
500|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} from isolated, low-crowned (brachydont) teeth and {{possibly}} a fragment of a lower jaw. Ferugliotherium is estimated to have weighed 70g (2.5oz). The incisors are long and [...] and contain a band of enamel on {{only part of the}} tooth. The jaw fragment contains a <b>long</b> <b>tooth</b> socket for the incisor and bears a bladelike fourth lower premolar, resembling those of multituberculates. The premolar of Argentodites is similar. Two upper premolars also resemble multituberculate teeth, but whether these premolars are referable to Ferugliotheriidae is controversial. Molariforms are rectangular and brachydont and consist of longitudinal rows of cusps, connected by transverse crests and separated by transverse furrows. Lower molariforms have two cusp rows, and the single known putative upper molariform has three. Low-crowned and bladelike teeth as seen in ferugliotheriids may have been evolutionary precursors of the high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth of the other gondwanathere family, Sudamericidae.|$|E
500|$|Though incompletely known, {{the skull}} of Giganotosaurus {{appears to have been}} low. The maxilla of the upper jaw had a [...] <b>long</b> <b>tooth</b> row, was deep from top to bottom, and its upper and lower edges were almost parallel. The maxilla had a {{pronounced}} process (projection) under the nostril, and a small, ellipse-shaped fenestra (opening), as in Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. The nasal bone was very rugose (rough and wrinkled), and these rugosities continued backwards, covering the entire upper surface of this bone. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye had a prominent, rugose crest (or horn) that pointed up at a backwards angle. The crest was ridge-like, and had deep grooves. The postorbital bone behind the eye had a down and backwards directed jugal process that projected into the orbit (eye opening), as seen in Tyrannosaurus, Abelisaurus, and Carnotaurus. The supraorbital bone above the eye that contacted between the lacrimal and postorbital bones was eave-like, and similar to that of Abelisaurus. The quadrate bone {{at the back of the}} skull was [...] long, and had two pneumatic (air-filled) foramina (holes) on the inner side.|$|E
50|$|Similar to Mary Norton's earlier novel The Borrowers, The Littles {{features}} {{a family of}} tiny, intelligent humanoid creatures with mouse-like features (the Littles) {{who live in a}} house owned by the Bigg family. The mouse-like features include a long, furry tail, <b>long</b> <b>teeth</b> and mouse-like ears (in the books the Littles have a tail but not the <b>long</b> <b>teeth</b> and mouse-like ears). Their height is 4-6 inches (10 - 15.25 cm).|$|R

500|$|In 1910, Arthur Smith Woodward named Megalosaurus bradleyi {{based on}} a skull from the Middle Jurassic, the {{specific}} name honouring the collector F. Lewis Bradley. In 1926, this was made a separate genus Proceratosaurus. In 1920, Werner Janensch named Megalosaurus ingens, [...] "the enormous", based on specimen MB R 1050, a twelve centimetre <b>long</b> <b>tooth</b> from German East Africa. It possibly represents a large member of the Carcharodontosauridae; Carrano e.a. saw it as an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 1923, von Huene renamed Poekilopleuron bucklandii Eudes-Deslongchamps 1838 into Megalosaurus poikilopleuron. Today, the genus Poekilopleuron is generally seen as valid. In the same publication, von Huene named two additional Megalosaurus species. The first was Megalosaurus parkeri, its specific name honouring William Kitchen Parker and {{based on a}} pelvis, leg bones and vertebrae from the Late Cretaceous. This was made the separate genus Metriacanthosaurus in 1964. The second was Megalosaurus nethercombensis, named after its provenance from Nethercombe and based on two dentaries, leg bones, a pelvis and vertebrae from the Middle Jurassic, which von Huene himself in 1932 made the separate genus Magnosaurus. In 1925, Depéret, based on two teeth from Algeria, named Megalosaurus saharicus. In 1931/1932 this was made the separate genus Carcharodontosaurus. In 1956 von Huene by mistake named the same species as Megalosaurus africanus, intending to base it on remains from Morocco but referring the Algerian teeth; this implies that M. africanus is a junior objective synonym of M. saharicus. In 1926, von Huene named Megalosaurus lydekkeri, its specific name honouring Richard Lydekker, based on BMNH 41352, i.e. the same specimen {{that had already been}} made the holotype of M. woodwardi (Lydekker, 1909). This implies that M. lydekkeri is a junior objective synonym of M. woodwardi. It is likewise seen as a nomen dubium. In the same publication von Huene named Megalosaurus terquemi based on three teeth found near Hettingen, its specific name honouring Olry Terquem. It is seen as a nomen dubium, the fossil material probably representing some member of the Phytosauria or some other archosaur. In 1932, a work by von Huene mentioned a Megalosaurus (Magnosaurus) woodwardi, a synonym of Magnosaurus woodwardi named in the same book. Its type specimen is differing from the earlier Megalosaurus woodwardi (Lydekker, 1909), the two names are not synonyms. In 1954 Samuel Welles named Megalosaurus wetherilli. This species is exceptional in being based on a rather complete skeleton, found in Arizona, from the Early Jurassic. Its specific name honours John Wetherill. In 1970, Welles made this the separate genus Dilophosaurus. In 1955, Albert-Félix de Lapparent named Megalosaurus mersensis based on a series of twenty-three vertebrae found near Tizi n'Juillerh in a layer of the El Mers Formation of Morocco. This probably represents a member of the Mesosuchia. In 1956, Alfred Sherwood Romer renamed Aggiosaurus nicaeensis Ambayrac 1913, based on a lower jaw found near Nice, on the authority of von Huene into Megalosaurus nicaeensis. Originally it had been considered to be some crocodilian; present opinion confirms this. In 1957, de Lapparent named Megalosaurus pombali based on three teeth found near Pombal in the Jurassic of Portugal. Today it is seen as a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic louse combs {{use a small}} {{electrical}} charge to kill lice. The metal teeth of the comb have alternating positively and negatively charged tines, which are powered by a small battery. When the comb is used on dry hair, lice make contact with multiple tines of the fine-toothed comb, thereby closing the circuit and receiving an {{electrical charge}}.

50|$|The story {{features}} both {{individuals as}} they grown, highlighting the differences and similarities between both. Strong One as a juvenile is already {{able to eat}} from {{the tops of the}} trees. Meanwhile, <b>Long</b> <b>Tooth</b> hasn't had much of a growth spurt and is hunting insects. She even eats some vegetation at this age, but as she develops into an adult, plants will be wiped out from the menu. A familiar face by now, an Unenlagia the narrator calls Sharp Feathers, appears to devour an insect <b>Long</b> <b>Tooth</b> had been chasing and she drives it off a cliff. The narrator then explains that even though Sharp Feathers had feathers (as his name indicates) and resembled a bird, it could not fly.|$|E

50|$|Rodolfo Coria also {{intervenes}} {{to answer}} {{a number of questions}} about the two species, such as whether the Giganotosaurus hunted in packs (yes, they did). The narrator explains that they derived this conclusion from research around the site where the Giganotosaurus was discovered, where several Mapusaurus were also found. The viewers are then witness to one of these hunting parties, as we go back to 90 million years B.C. to see <b>Long</b> <b>Tooth</b> fully-grown. She now lives in a pack and is stalking the Argentinosaurus herd. The victim chosen is Strong One and he gets wounded, but stands back and stops the Giganotosaurus pack from hunting. One of them is killed in the process and, displaying the cruelty of life, is eaten by <b>Long</b> <b>Tooth</b> and the others. Sharp Feathers (or another Unenlagia) briefly interrupts, but is scared off by the giganotosaurs.|$|E

Of these species, the narrator presents two individuals Strong One (an Argentinosaurus) and <b>Long</b> <b>Tooth</b> (a Giganotosaurus).|$|E
5000|$|Compared {{with other}} therapsids, the Venyukoviamorpha were {{distinguished}} by comparatively <b>long</b> <b>tooth</b> rows with large incisors.

Post-canine teeth could be spatulate (Otsheria), bluntly conical (Venyukovia) for grinding, or leaf-shaped for shredding (Suminia). The mixed dentition of Suminia is claimed to represent the first evidence of the efficient processing of food by chewing.|$|E
