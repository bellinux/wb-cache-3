50|$|The {{terminal}} building {{is situated in}} the Western part of the terminal. Two sets of locks, beyond the seaport, keep the canal navigable towards Caen. The lock is composed to two <b>lock</b> <b>basins</b> and a <b>lock</b> keeper's tower.|$|R
50|$|The lock was rebuilt {{of brick}} with pozzuolana mortar, faced with Bramley Fall stone - after {{rebuilding}} the lock was 120.75 by 38 ft long by wide, with 24.5 ft height above the sills; {{the depth of}} water being between 15 and 20 ft depending on the tide. At {{the entrance to the}} dock a double drawbridge, counterbalanced for ease of use, of the Dutch type, allowed people to cross the lock. The main part of the bridge was cast iron, built by Ayden and Etwell of the Shelf Iron Works (Bradford). The <b>lock</b> <b>basin</b> was rebuilt at the same time, to the same design as used in the new Humber dock—the new basin was 213 ft long, narrowing from 80.5 to 71 ft wide from top to bottom. Both lock and basin were re-opened on 13 November 1815.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the work}} proved inadequate, {{requiring}} reconstruction later: Issues with weak ground led to displacement bulging of {{the walls of the}} dock in 1776, before the dock had been completed, both Holt and Berry had recommended extra piling at the softer ground areas, but had been overruled. Subsequently, movement of the walls proved additional piling necessary. By 1778 some parts of the dock walls were displaced from their proper position by 3 ft, exacerbated by poor design of the wall and its buttresses. Further issues occurred on the lock to the River Hull, and the north wall of the <b>lock</b> <b>basin</b> collapsed before construction had been completed. Despite these setbacks the dock was formally opened on 22 September 1778. The lock required rebuilding in the 1780s to prevent total collapse, and in 1814 the lock and basin were rebuilt under the guidance of John Rennie the Elder with George Miller as resident engineer.|$|E
40|$|Locks are key {{structures}} for {{the accessibility of}} ports and navigable waterways. The filling of the lock chamber {{has to be done}} with special precautions, taking into account the forces experienced by the moored vessels during the levelling process. In case of filling through lock gate openings, one of the potential methods to minimize the hydrodynamic forces on the ships, is to insert breaking logs at the downstream side of the gate openings, aiming at an enhanced spreading and energy dissipation of the filling jets. In order to investigate the influence of the breaking log configuration on the induced flow patterns and their role in the energy dissipation of a turbulent filling jet, Flanders Hydraulics Research has defined a project in which both physical model research (phase 1) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (phase 2) are applied. This report pertains to phase 2 of the project and concerns the CFD modelling of schematic <b>lock</b> <b>basin</b> with and without breaking logs using the OpenFOAM CFD package. The results of the CFD model are compared with data from the physical model experiments of phase 1 {{on the one hand and}} with data from literature on the other hand. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to studying study the influence of the grid resolution and the influence of different turbulence models on the solution. The model is shown to give good results. However, some differences between the results of the CFD simulations and the physical model experiments are noticed. The data from the CFD model are used to study the influence of breaking logs on the flow patterns in the lock gate during the filling of a lock. nrpages: 53 + 14 (appendices) status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|The Hull Dock Act of 1861 sanctioned the {{building}} of a new dock on the Humber foreshore. While the dock was under construction two further acts were enacted: the 1866 act allowed the extension of the dock westwards, and the 1867 act allowed further expansion to the west and south. The dock sanctioned in 1861 was to be 2500 ft long, the 1866 act increased the length to 3350 ft and the enclosed area to 22.8 acre, and water depth of 29 to 24.5 ft from high spring to neap tides. The total land area including <b>locks,</b> <b>basins</b> and reclaimed land to the west was 76 acre. The engineer was John Hawkshaw and the site engineer J.C. Hawkshaw.|$|R

40|$|The Caspian Sea, {{the largest}} land <b>locked</b> <b>basin</b> in the world, {{isolated}} from ParaTethys {{at the end}} of Messinian. Since that time sedimentation there took place under conditions of isolated basin temporarily connected with Black Sea in Upper Pliocene (Akchagyl). For the first time very detailed study (centimeter scale) of outcrop was carried out for stratigraphy and paleoecology of the Upper absheron substage deposits cropped out in the Western flank of the South Caspian depression (Shikhovo exposure) of the Azerbaijan Republic. The data obtained demonstrated the high-frequency cyclicity in sedimentation accompanied by rapid lateral and vertical depositional environment change. Most of these system tracts have not yet been studied in detail. The depositional setting during accumulation of this succession has changed within shore face-shelf environment. On the background of these cycles, the depositional series of a higher order containing sediments deposited during very small-scale sea level fall and rise occur. Some information contained in this document is the new data, due to more recent observations and interpretations...|$|R

5000|$|The Uttoxeter Canal [...] was a thirteen-mile {{extension}} of the Caldon Canal running from Froghall as far as Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, England. It was authorised in 1797, but did not open until 1811.

The railway has since been dismantled and there are plans to reinstate the canal.|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentation}} {{pattern in}} the Kolhans reflects a change from braided fluvial-ephemeral pattern to a fan delta lacustrine type. Repeated fault controlled uplift of the source followed by subsidence and forced regression, generated multiple sediment cyclicity {{that led to the}} fluvial-fan delta sedimentation pattern. Intermittent uplift of the faulted blocks exposed fresh bedrock to mechanical weathering that generated a large amount of detritus and resulted to forced regressions, repeatedly disrupting the cycles which may reflect a stratigraphic response of marine-connected rift basins at the early stage of extension. The marked variations in thickness of the fan delta succession and the stacking pattern in different measured profiles reflect the overriding tectonic controls on fan-delta evolution. The accumulated fault displacement created higher accommodation and thicker delta sequences. Intermittent uplift of fault blocks exposed fresh bedrock to mechanical weathering, generated a large amount of detritus, and resulted in forced closure of the land <b>locked</b> <b>basin,</b> repeatedly disrupting the fining upward pattern. The controls of source rock lithology or climate were of secondary importance to tectonic effects. Such a retrograding fan delta could be a stratigraphic response of connected rift basins at the early stage of extension...|$|R
