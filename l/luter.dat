5|$|Immediately {{after the}} War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter {{and the nearby}} Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars {{because of a lack}} of space; these {{included}} the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude <b>Luter,</b> Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.|$|E

25|$|At {{its annual}} {{convention}} in 2012, the Southern Baptist Convention elected as president Fred <b>Luter</b> Jr., the first African American {{to hold the}} position. He was re-elected president for a second (and final) term at the 2013 meeting. The current president in 2016 is Steve Gaines. At its 2017 annual meeting, after several days of controversy, the convention passed a resolution condemning the alt-right movement, white nationalism, and white supremacy.|$|E
5000|$|In total {{there were}} 7,543 {{partisan}} casualties, {{more than a}} third of the initial force. The German field commander, General Rudolf <b>Lüters</b> in his final report described the so-called [...] "communist rebels" [...] as [...] "well organized, skillfully led and with combat morale unbelievably high".|$|R
50|$|German {{divisions}} were {{reinforced with}} the 202nd Tank Battalion and 2nd and 3rd Home Guard Mountain Brigade. Italian divisions used the Lika, Dalmatia and Herzegovina Chetnik auxiliaries, three Ustasha (31st, 32nd and 34th) and one (2nd Jäger) Home Guard battalions. On 8 January the 2nd and 5th Krajina Brigades moved to Kozara {{and launched a}} series of attacks on the NDH garrisons and posts in Lijevče polje. Since these activities coincided with the attacks of the 1st Proletarian Division in central Bosnia, Gen. <b>Lüters</b> decided to exclude the 714th division from the operation Weiss and {{to use it for}} the defense of the Banja Luka area. As the 718th Division was already engaged in fighting the Partisans in central and eastern Bosnia, <b>Lüters</b> reinforced the 369th Division with one regimental combat group of the 187th Reserve Division.|$|R

25|$|J.W. <b>Luter,</b> Jr. of {{the local}} Smithfield Packing Company rerouted his trucks via a smaller, cheaper bridge owned by a Norfolk car dealer. Tolls were {{eventually}} dropped to 10 cents per axle, and later removed on June 3, 1976; the state paid off the remaining bonds at that time. Simultaneously, the parallel Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel opened, and tolls were removed from that facility, the Coleman Bridge, and the Robert O. Norris Bridge. Many considered this {{an important step in}} the development of the area. The former toll building and parking area was used for maintenance workers, police, and tow truck drivers until 2002, when asbestos was discovered. Despite the efforts of preservationists, who argued the building had historic significance, it was torn down in 2004.|$|E

500|$|Although {{originally}} {{intended for use}} on the Eastern Front, the division did not deploy there {{and returned to the}} NDH in May 1943 due to the need to combat the communist-led Partisans in the territory of the NDH. The division left its training area in Austria over the period 1–12 May 1943, travelling by train via the route Vienna–Graz–Marburg–Zagreb. It was known as the [...] "Tiger Division" [...] (...) , and was subordinated to the Croatia Command (...) of General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Rudolf <b>Lüters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In just a {{few years}} under <b>Luter's</b> leadership, Smithfield Foods {{returned}} to financial health and even began to expand. In 1981, it announced its first major acquisition - the purchase of Gwaltney of Smithfield, its local rival and a well-established pork products company. It was a bold move, leveraging up at a time when interest rates were north of 20 percent. But it doubled Smithfield Foods' size, enlarged its family of brands, and catapulted the company from being a local packer and processor to becoming a major regional force along the East coast of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The German Command was {{confused}} and worried by the successful Partisan attack at Gornji Vakuf. On {{the assumption that}} the Partisans would continue their advance towards Bugojno, General <b>Lüters</b> ordered the 369th Division to the area on 6 March, noting in the War diary that [...] "the key error (was) G.Vakuf". However, Tito was not pleased with the prospects of the advance/retreat to the Vrbas valley, fearing the Partisans would thus merely exchange one cauldron for another. In light of these considerations, and much to the surprise of his closest associates, Tito ordered a 180-degree turn and re-directed the bulk of his army back to the Neretva.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 21st century, there were {{increasing}} numbers of ethnically diverse congregations within the convention. [...] In 2008, almost 20 percent were estimated to be majority African American, Asian or Hispanic. [...] The SBC had an estimated one million African-American members. The convention has passed a series of resolutions recommending the inclusion of more black members and appointing more African-American leaders. [...] In the 2012 annual meeting, the Southern Baptist Convention elected Fred <b>Luter</b> Jr. as its first African-American president. He had earned respect by his leadership skills shown in building a large congregation in New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} post-war period, {{immediately}} after World War II, the Saint-Germain-des-Pres neighborhood {{and the nearby}} Saint-Michel neighborhood became home to many small jazz clubs. They were mostly located in cellars, due to the shortage of any suitable space, and because the music at late hours was less likely to disturb the neighbors. The first to open in 1945 was the Caveau des Lorientais, near Boulevard Saint-Michel, which introduced Parisians to New Orleans Jazz, played by clarinetist Claude <b>Luter</b> and his band. It closed shortly afterwards, but was soon followed by other cellars; Le Vieux-Columbier, the Rose Rouge, the Club Saint-Germain; and Le Tabou. [...] The jazz clubs The clubs attracted students from the nearby university, the Paris intellectual community, and celebrities from the Paris cultural world. They soon had doormen who controlled who was important or famous enough to be allowed inside into the cramped, smoke-filled cellars. A few of the musicians went on to celebrated careers; [...] Sidney Bechet was {{the star of the}} first jazz festival held at the Salle Pleyel in 1949, and headlined at the Olympia music hall in 1955.|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to criticism [...] regarding {{the environmental impact}} of Smithfield's concentrated animal feeding operation facilities under <b>Luter's</b> leadership, Smithfield has attempted a new approach to environmental stewardship. The company is committed to various environmental enhancement initiatives, including a comprehensive environmental management system (EMS), developed to meet the internationally accepted and respected ISO 14001 standard. In 2005, Smithfield announced that it had become the first in its industry to achieve ISO 14001 certification for all its U.S. hog production and processing facilities. Smithfield companies have been honored with five Virginia Governor's Environmental Excellence Awards, a Wisconsin Governor's Award for Excellence in Environmental Performance, and 48 Environmental MAPS Awards from the American Meat Institute.|$|R
5|$|In September, it {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} the newly formed XV Mountain Corps led by <b>Lüters.</b> That month, the {{division}} concluded a collaboration agreement with the 260-strong Chetnik detachment of Mane Rokvić, who was in control of an area which included parts of both western Bosnia and Lika. The division utilised the Chetniks to protect railway lines and key industries in their area, as well as for scouting against the Partisans and attacks on the rear of Partisan formations. Desertions worsened particularly after the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943. For example, during October 1943, 334 men deserted from the division. It handled thousands of Italian prisoners {{in the aftermath of the}} surrender, feeding them and marching them under guard towards the Reich.|$|R

50|$|The XV Mountain Corps was a German {{military}} formation that commanded German forces conducting counter-insurgency {{operations against}} the Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II. It {{was formed in}} the Balkans from {{the staff of the}} German commander in Croatia (Militärbefehlshabers in Kroatien) on 12 August 1943. It was subordinated to the 2nd Panzer Army, and from its formation until 1 November 1943 the corps was commanded by General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Rudolf <b>Lüters,</b> and between 1 November 1943 and July 1944 it was commanded by General der Infanterie Ernst von Leyser, who was replaced in August 1944 by General der Panzertruppe (Lieutenant General) Gustav Fehn who commanded the corps {{for the rest of the}} war. In May 1944, the corps was responsible for the conduct of Operation Rösselsprung, which was aimed at killing the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito. The corps surrendered to the Partisans on 8 May 1945, and Fehn and many of the remaining men of the corps were subsequently killed by the Yugoslav authorities.|$|R
500|$|On 10 May 1943, Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Heinz, {{commander}} of the 4th Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, met Đurišić at Kolašin {{with the intent of}} engaging him to help the Germans against the Partisans. Đurišić said he was willing to do this, and once the Partisans were defeated he said he would be ready to fight alongside the Germans on the Russian Front. During the meeting, Đurišić told Heinz that Mihailović had left Kolašin at the end of 1942 and that he refused to accept Mihailović's current policy. Đurišić said Mihailović had been distracted by propaganda and was over-rated, and described him as [...] "an unsteady visionary wandering through the land". Đurišić also said Josip Broz Tito and his Partisans were the only serious enemy. On 11 May 1943, Heinz submitted a proposal to General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Rudolf <b>Lüters,</b> the German Commanding General in Croatia, regarding the Chetniks who had been [...] "legalised" [...] by the Italians. He suggested the Germans also [...] "legalise" [...] Đurišić's Chetniks and use them to disarm [...] "non-legalised" [...] Chetniks groups. Heinz also proposed that after the Partisans had been destroyed, the Germans [...] "legalise" [...] only weak detachments of Đurišić's Chetniks. Subsequent events indicate Heinz's approach to Đurišić may not have been authorised by his superiors and that his suggestions were not acted upon.|$|R
50|$|The 717th Division {{encountered}} difficulties {{while trying}} to reach Bosanski Petrovac from Sanski Most. The Division launched its attack on 20 January with the 749th Regiment and elements of the 202nd Tank Battalion. Despite air support, it was halted by the 1st Krajina and one battalion of the 7th Krajina Brigade some 10 km south of Sanski Most. The division’s 737th Regiment was in reserve, standing ready to exploit a breakthrough, but the 749th Regiment failed to make one. Over the following days both sides stepped up their efforts, building up strength at the key point; the Partisans remained successful in blocking German attacks, while launching fierce night counterattacks. The 717th Division tried a diversionary attack from Sanski Most westwards with the 2nd Mountain Home Guard Brigade. On 25 January this battle group of two Home Guard battalions and one German company were attacked by the 1st Battalion of the 6th and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Krajina Brigade, and were routed with heavy losses. The Partisans seized weaponry including 40 light and 10 heavy machine guns and four mountain and one anti-tank cannons. Gen. Dippold, commander of the 717th Division, reported to Gen. <b>Lüters</b> that on 26 January the 2nd Home Guard Brigade was completely shattered, and that {{the remnants of the}} 2nd and 4th battalions were absorbed into 749th Grenadier Regiment. The more ambitious attack heading west was launched on 27 January with the reinforced 737th Regiment. It reached Benakovac before being halted by the 6th Krajina Brigade. In the meantime, the 2nd and 5th Krajina Brigades arrived from Kozara as reinforcements, and the 737th Regiment suddenly found itself in a difficult situation. Seeing no alternative, the regiment set up an all-around defense; it remained cut off and under attack until 3 February.|$|R
