Para tanto, coe¬lhos jovens, Nova Zelândia, machos, divididos em grupos, receberam, por via oral, durante quinze dias consecutivos Tween 20 (1 %, controle; n= 5), <b>levamisol</b> (25 mg/Kg/PV; n= 4) ou extrato etanólico de M. charantia (EE, 10 mg/Kg/PV, n= 6) a partir do 15 º dia inoculação por Microsporum canis. Foram {{realizadas}} as contagens total e diferencial de leucócitos do sangue periférico, cultivo do raspado de pele e avaliação histopatológica das lesões. O <b>levamisol</b> e o EE reduziram os escores de avaliação histológica das lesões provocadas pelo M. canis e não induziram modificação dos leucócitos circulantes. O tratamento com <b>levamisol</b> provocou alterações na pele infectada em relação ao controle (p< 0, 01), mas não diferiu do tratamento com EE, o qual não diferiu do controle que recebeu o veículo. Os resultados demonstraram que o <b>levamisol</b> teve melhor desempenho no tratamento da dermatofitose, enfatizando seu potencial imu¬nomodulador, enquanto o EE de M. charantia apresentou um efeito bastante promissor, indicando uma alternativa de tratamento da dermatofitose provocada pelo M. canis. &# 13; &# 13; PALAVRAS-CHAVES: Cucurbitaceae, imunomodulação, <b>levamisol,</b> Microsporum canis, Momordica charantia. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate the effect of levamisole and ethanolic extract of Momordica charantia leaves on experimental dermatophytosis. Young rabbits, New Zealand, males, were divided in groups that received by via oral during 15 days Tween 20 (1 %, control; n= 5), levamisole (25 mg/kg/LP; n= 4) or ethanolic extract of M. charantia leaves (EE, 10 mg/kg/LP; n= 6), beginning at 15 th day of Microsporum canis inoculation.

MÉTODOS: Quatorze pacientes receberam doses decrescentes de <b>levamisol</b> por via oral por seis meses (dose inicial de 150 mg três vezes por semana). Dez pacientes receberam placebo. As avaliações foram mensais. RESULTADOS: Houve tendência à diminuição do número de crises nos dois grupos, mas sem diferenças entre ambos. O número de lesões diminuiu significantemente nos grupos <b>levamisol</b> e placebo, mas na comparação entre eles a diferença não foi significante. A duração das lesões diminuiu significantemente no grupo placebo, porém ao compará-lo com o grupo <b>levamisol</b> a diferença não foi significante durante todo o tratamento. A intensidade da dor foi significantemente menor nos dois grupos, mas ao compará-los a dor foi significantemente menor no grupo placebo. A avaliação global final mostrou melhora em 50 % dos pacientes do grupo <b>levamisol</b> e em 70 % do Placebo, sem diferença significante entre os dois tratamentos. Não foi observada diferença na frequência de efeitos colaterais entre os grupos. CONCLUSÃO: <b>Levamisol,</b> como usado nesse protocolo, é uma droga segura. Comparado ao placebo, <b>levamisol</b> não é efetivo no tratamento profilático da afta recorrente. O efeito placebo é importante em desordens nas quais fatores emocionais afetam a recorrência ou a expressão de sintomas. OBJECTIVE: {{to utilize}} a {{double-blind}} protocol to provide clarification {{about the safety}} and effectiveness of levamisole {{in the treatment of}} recurrent aphthous stomatitis. METHODS: Fourteen patients took a decreasing dose of oral levamisole for six months (initial dose 150 mg three times a week) and ten others were placebo control patients. All were evaluated monthly. RESULTS: The number of crises had a tendency to decrease in both groups, but without a difference between groups. The number of lesions diminished significantly in the two groups, but upon comparison the difference was not significant. Duration of the lesions diminished significantly in the placebo, however when compared to the levamisole group, difference was not significant during treatment. The intensity of pain was significantly lower in the two groups, but upon comparison, pain was significantly lower in the placebo group. The final global evaluation showed improvement in 50 % of patients of the levamisole group and in 70 % of the placebo, without a significant difference between treatments. No difference in the frequency of collateral effects was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Levamisole, as used in this protocol, is a safe drug. When compared with the placebo, levamisole is not effective in the prophylactic treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

Title of diploma thesis: Drug-resistance in {{parasitic}} helminths The {{development of}} drug resistance in parasitic helminths poses a large threat to productivity in livestock {{and the control}} of human helminths in future. Currently there are three broad spectrum classes of anthelmintics: the benzimidazoles, the imidazothiazoles (levamisole) and the tetrahydropyrimidines (pyrantel, morantel), the macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycins).

Resistance to <b>levamisol</b> or pyrantel, drugs which act as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, is probably caused by amount reduction or by loss of affinity in these receptors. Macrocyclic lactones mode of action is not fully understood, but there appears to be relation with modulating glutamate-gated chloride channels present on muscle membranes of the parasites.

Para tanto, em um primeiro momento, foram avaliados 126 isolados de Candida, sendo 19 C. albicans, 17 C. famata, 5 C. guilliermondii, 8 C. krusei, 29 C. parapsilosis, 48 C. tropicalis, dos quais 22 foram isolados de rapinantes, 32 de periquitos do sertÃo, 56 de papagaios, 7 de araras canindÃ e 3 de um ouriÃo-cacheiro. Todas as cepas foram submetidas ao teste de microdiluiÃÃo em caldo, ante a anfotericina B, itraconazol, fluconazol, segundo metodologia padronizada pelo Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (documento M 27 -A 3). As concentraÃÃes inibitÃrias mÃnimas (CIMs) variaram de 0, 03125 a 2 Âg/mL, 0, 125 a 250 Âg/mL e de 0, 03125 a 125 Âg/mL para anfotericina B, fluconazol e itraconazol, respectivamente. Dos 126 isolados avaliados por microdiluiÃÃo, 33 (26, 2 %) foram resistentes aos azÃlicos, sendo 7 (5, 6 %) resistentes somente a fluconazol, 1 (0. 8 %) resistente somente ao itraconazol e 24 (19 %) resistentes a ambas as drogas. Em um segundo momento, todas estas cepas resistentes aos derivados azÃlicos, mais 20 C. albicans e 3 C. tropicalis resgatadas da nossa coleÃÃo de leveduras resistentes de origem veterinÃria, foram submetidas ao teste de inibiÃÃo de bomba de efluxo com prometazina, perfazendo um total de 56 cepas resistentes a azÃlicos.

Monitoring of the antifungal susceptibility of Candida species from veterinary sources {{is a recent}} practice and the mechanisms involved in antifungal resistance have not been completely elucidated. Considering that the antifungal arsenal is limited and that antifungal resistance has become more frequent, the comprehension of this phenomenon and the pursuit for therapeutic alternatives are necessary. Thus, the present work aimed at monitoring the in vitro susceptibility of Candida spp. isolated from animals, with emphasis on efflux pump-mediated azole resistance and on {{the evaluation of the}} effect of the imidazole levamisole on the growth of these yeasts. For such, in a first approach, 126 Candida isolates (19 C. albicans, 17 C. famata, 5 C. guilliermondii, 8 C. krusei, 29 C. parapsilosis, 48 C. tropicalis), out of which 22 were recovered from raptors, 32 from cactus parakeets, 56 from Amazon parrots, 7 from blue-and-gold macaws and 3 from a Brazilian porcupine. All isolates were submitted to broth microdilution test against amphotericin B, itraconazole and fluconazole, according to the methodology recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (document M 27 -A 3). The MICs ranged from 0. 03125 to 2 Âg/mL, 0. 125 to 250 Âg/mL and 0. 03125 to 125 Âg/mL for amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. Out of 126 evaluated isolates, 33 (26. 2 %) were resistant to azoles, with 7 (5. 6 %) isolates resistant to fluconazole, 1 (0. 8 %) isolate resistant to itraconazole and 24 (19 %) resistant to both drugs. In a second approach, all these azole resistant isolates, plus 20 C. albicans and 3 C. tropicalis that were recovered from our collection of resistant yeasts from veterinary sources, were submitted to the efflux pump inhibition assay with promethazine, with a total of 56 azole resistant isolates. Thus, MICs for fluconazole and itraconazole significantly reduced from 2 to 250 times for fluconazole and from 16 to 4000 times for itraconazole. The antifungal activity of levamisole against 12 C. albicans, 12 C. krusei, 12 C. parapsilosis and 12 C. tropicalis, was also evaluated, and MICs and minimum fungicidal concentrations varying from 0. 58 to 2. 34 mg/mL and from 2. 34 to 9. 37 mg/mL were obtained, respectively. Parallelly, it was demonstrated that levamisole significantly inhibits biofilm formation and interferes with the maintenance of mature biofilms. These data show that azole resistance is partially mediated by efflux-pumps and demonstrate the antifungal potential of the imidazole levamisole and its capacity of inhibiting the biofilm of strains of Candida spp. from animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} nematodes (GIN), {{in domestic}} animals, especially in bovines {{are a very}} important factor that affects their productivity, because cattle production systems have intervened {{in the relationship between}} gastrointestinal parasites (PGI) and the host, breaking therefore the ecological balance between them. In many opportunities the development of parasitic populations have been favored or a parasitic population have been led to extinction, it has made that these populations express genes that would not express under normal conditions, favoring thus, resistance to medications that were made to their destruction. NGI are highly important in all cattle exploitations, but their inappropriate handling, mainly in the pharmacological aspect, has created vermifuge resistance by some parasitic populations. This article will determine the importance of the vermifuge resistance in cattle exploitations, as a factor of risk for the control of parasitic populations. The most important antihelmintic groups used in bovine are Benzimidazoles, <b>Levamisol</b> and Ivermectine and with these products resistance has been reported by parasitic populations such as in Haemochus contortus, Trichostrongylus. colubriformis, Ostertagia circumcicta, Ostertagia ostertagi. Different risk factors were classified in extrinsic (which don’t depend on the gastrointestinal parasite) and intrinsic (which depend directly on gastrointestinal parasites related with genetics) which occupy a great importance {{in the development of the}} vermifuge resistance...|$|E
40|$|HBV {{infection}} in {{chronic renal failure}} (CRF) becomes chronic in 30 to 60 % compared with less than 10 % in nonuremic patients. Immunological dysfunction in patients on hemodialysis {{may be related to}} imbalanced cytokine systems, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-|α|) and interleukin (IL) 6, 1 by retention of renal metabolite in uremia and chronic inflammation and have a poor immunological reaction to T-cell-dependent antigens, like hepatitis B vaccination. Immunocompromised patients who are unresponsive to hepatitis B vaccination seem to be unable to enhance IL- 10 synthesis for control of monokine overproduction. Moreover, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which {{play a major role in}} the antigen presentation to immunocompetent cells, have also been shown to modulate this immune response. Unfortunately, seroconversion to anti-HBS has been reported to occur in only 40 to 50 % of the vaccine, a significantly lower rate than that observed in healthy adults. Various methods including adjutants such as zinc, gamma interferon, thymopentine, GM-CSF and <b>Levamisol</b> for improving immune responses have been advised. Experience with Pres 1 /s 2, third-generation vaccines is limited and they have not been proven more effective than intradermally (ID) administered second-generation S antigen vaccines. Both intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) vaccinations against hepatitis B have variable efficiency in hemodialysis and non-responders should be retreated by ID route...|$|E
40|$|The aims of this multicentre, {{randomised}} phase III trial were to evaluate: (1) {{the role}} of <b>levamisol</b> (LEV); and (2) {{the role of}} folinic acid (FA), added to 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) in the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer. Patients with histologically proven, radically resected stage II or III colon or rectal cancer were eligible. The study had a 2 × 2 factorial design with four treatment arms: (a) 5 FU alone, (b) 5 FU+LEV, (c) 5 FU+FA, (d) 5 FU+LEV+FA, and two planned comparisons, testing the role of LEV and of FA, respectively. From March 1991, to September 1998, 1327 patients were randomised. None of the two comparisons resulted in a significant disease-free (DFS) or overall (OAS) survival advantage. The hazard ratio (HR) of relapse was 0. 89 (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 0. 73 – 1. 09) for patients receiving FA and 0. 99 (95 % CI 0. 80 – 1. 21) for those receiving LEV; corresponding HRs of death were 1. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 80 – 1. 30) and 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 73 – 1. 20). Nonhaematological toxicity (all grade vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, congiuntivitis, skin, fever and fatigue) was significantly worse with FA, while all other toxicities were similar.

30|$|The {{extent of}} AChE {{inhibition}} and paralysis was studied as indices of the toxic effect of sub-lethal concentrations of monocrotophos in C. elegans. Assessment of AChE activity in whole body homogenate revealed that monocrotophos possessed the propensity to cause AChE inhibition even at low doses. The sensitivity of AChE activity in C. elegans to exposure to OPI in vivo clearly establishes that the worm is a reliable model {{for studying the}} toxicity of OPIs. AChE-inhibiting OPI and carbamate insecticides {{have been known to}} induce paralysis in infective juveniles of the entomogenous nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae (Hara & Kaya, 1983). Further, previous reports from our laboratory have demonstrated paralyzing effects of OPIs in C. elegans (Jadhav & Rajini, 2009 b; Leelaja & Rajini, 2013). This suggests that cholinergic overstimulation may result in paralysis in C. elegans. Further, <b>levamisol</b> (acetylcholine receptor agonist) is reported to induce paralysis in C. elegans (Lewis, Wu, Levine, & Berg, 1980; Nonet, Saifee, Zhao, Rand, & Wei, 1998). Aldicarb, an AChE inhibitor, has also been demonstrated to induce paralysis in C. elegans (Nonet et al., 1998). Together, these studies lend strong support to the view that AChE inhibition and consequent cholinergic stress may be the chief mechanism underlying the paralyzing effects of monocrotophos in C. elegans. Our study reveals a negative correlation between AChE activity and extent of paralysis caused by monocrotophos in C. elegans. The work of Melstrom and Williams clearly demonstrated the propensity of pharmacological AChE inhibition to alter the movement behavior in C. elegans as evidenced by the correlation between the extent of AChE inhibition and a decrease in movement in worms exposed to each tested carbamate (Melstrom & Williams, 2007). These observations are supportive of the fact that paralysis manifests in C. elegans as a result of AChE inhibition and ensuing cholinergic stress after exposure to OPI.|$|E

Drugs that uncompetitively modulate NMDA receptor-mediated [Ca 22 ̆ 07 a]i influx are potential leads for development to treat NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal damage since these drugs spare NMDA receptor normal functions. Ligands to 3 ̆b 12 ̆ 082 -adrenoceptors and imidazoline I 2 ̆ 082 receptors confer neuroprotection possibility through modulating NMDA receptor-mediated [Ca 22 ̆ 07 a]i influx.

In contrast to MK 801, which non-reversibly blocks NMDA receptor-mediated [Ca 22 ̆ 07 a]i influx, imidazoline I 2 ̆ 082 receptor antagonists, Idazoxan, and 2 -(2 -benzofuranyl) - 2 - imidazoline (2 -BFI) -mediated inhibition of [Ca 22 ̆ 07 a]i influx can be rapidly reversed when removed, {{in a manner similar}} to that of memantine, an uncompetitive antagonist to NMDA receptors. Interestingly, ligands to 3 ̆b 12 ̆ 082 -adrenoceptors, including agmatine sulfate and yohimbine, and a ligand to the nicotinic receptor, <b>levamisol,</b> neither inhibited NMDA receptor-mediated [Ca 22 ̆ 07 a]i influx, nor provided neuroprotection against glutamate toxicity, suggesting selective inhibition of NMDA receptor activities. The inhibition of NMDA receptor by Idazoxan and 2 -BFI also led to the suppression of NMDA receptor-mediated calpain activity as a result of blocking NMDA receptor activity, rather than through direct inhibition of calpain activity. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that imidazoline I 2 ̆ 082 receptor antagonists transiently and reversibly block NMDA receptor-mediated [Ca 22 ̆ 07 a]i influx. These compounds are leads for further development as uncompetitive antagonists to NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} has been {{designed}} to detect multiple anthelmintic resistance against gastrointestinal nematodes in small ruminants reared at central and northern Punjab, Pakistan. The potential production of small ruminants is greatly affected by the development of anthelmintic resistance. The rates of appearance of anthelmintic resistance against gastrointestinal nematodes all over the world appear to differ geographically and in accord with the current climate, parasites type and treatment regime adopt in the region. Various in vivo and in vitro methods were used to detect multiple anthelmintic drugs resistance. First of all, to conduct a comprehensive studies on selected sheep and goat herds to evaluate the reliability of treatment with wide spectrum anthelmintic drugs using faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and, concurrently, to undertake in vitro egg hatch assays (EHA) to evaluate the susceptibility of nematode to anthelmintic drugs. Mean faecal egg count, percentage reduction and 95 per cent confidence interval were calculated by using the formula recommended by the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) for detecting multiple anthelmintic resistant gastrointestinal nematodes of ruminants. Multiple anthelmintic resistance was found in selected goats and sheep flocks. All flocks were found resistance against the albendazol; six were resistance against <b>levamisol,</b> two suspected for resistance. Seven flocks were susceptible against Ivermectin while one is suspected for resistance. The results revealed that a significant difference (P< 0. 05) of FECRT were found on pretreatment and after post-treatment with different anthelmintic drug as compared to control group in all the flocks. The results against albendazol were also confirmed by the Egg Hatch Assay (EHA). Results of EHT revealed that all the eight flocks found positive for resistance against albendazol.

Selection of the regimen depended upon the clinical characteristics of the disease. Each regime was tried for at least 4 months and if a patient didnot improve with one regime, he was shifted to another regime. A patient was considered to have improved, if the lesions started regimenting or the previously progressive lesions stopped increasing further. Regime I consisted of 150 mg <b>levamisol</b> orally on two consecutive days per week, given to 13 cases, it resulted in improvement in 7 (53. 80 /o). Regime II consisted of levamisole in the same dose combined with once a day topical massage with 0. 1 % fluocinolone acetonide acetate cream; it led to improvement in 27 (81. 8 %) of the 33 cases. Regime III consisted of 3 mg betamethasone orally on alternate days combined with levamisole and topical fluocinolone; given to 32 cases, it was successful in 28 (87. 50 /o). A combination of 2 mg betamethasone orally alternating with 20 mg 8 -methoxypsoralen and sun exposure (regime IV) caused improvement in 17 (85 %) of the 20 cases.

40|$|Purpose and background: We {{examined}} whether {{patients with}} colon cancer undergoing surgery {{with or without}} adjuvant chemotherapy change the internal standards on which they base their quality-of-life (QL) estimation, and, if they do so, whether this reframing alters interpretation of QL findings. These questions were addressed within a randomized clinical trial of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK 40 / 93). Patients and methods: After radical resection of adenocar-cinoma of the colon (pT 1 - 4 pN> 0 M 0 and pT 3 - 4 pN 0 M 0) and perioperative chemotherapy, patients were randomized to three treatment arms: observation only (A), 5 -FU 450 rag/m 2 plus <b>Levamisol</b> (B), or 5 -FU 600 mg/m 2 (C). QL was measured by linear analogue self-assessment indicators. Patients estimated their pre-surgery QL both before surgery and retrospectively thereafter, and their pre-adjuvant QL both {{at the beginning of}} randomly assigned chemotherapy or observation and retrospectively about two months later. Thereafter, current QL was assessed. Paired t-tests were used to test the hypotheses of no change. Results: Overall, 187 patients with at least one pair of corresponding questionnaires were analyzed. Patients estimated their pre-surgery QL after surgery significantly lower than before and their pre-adjuvant QL under treatment or observation also lower than at the beginning. In the adjuvant phase, in contradiction to our hypothesis, chemotherapy had almost no impact on these changes attributed to reframing. Conventionally assessed changes indicated an improvement in QL. Patients with treatment C reported less improvement in functional performance than those with B or those under observation (P = 0. 04). Patients with treatment B indicated a greater worsening in nausea/vomiting than those with C, whereas patients with observation only showed an improvement (P = 0. 0009). After adjustment of current QL scores under treatment or observation to patients' retrospective estimation, the treatment effects were diluted but the overall improvement was substantially amplified in most QL indicators. Conclusions: Patients with colon cancer substantially re-frame their perception in estimating QL both under radical resection and under adjuvant chemotherapy or observation. This effect {{is an integral part of}} patients' adaptation to disease and treatment. An understanding of this phenomenon is of particular relevance for patient care. Its role in evaluating QL endpoints in clinical trials needs further investigatio...|$|E

In vitro a rotenona mostrou ação acaricida nas larvas e nas teleóginas, e nas larvas nos animais estabulados. Três tratamentos com endectocida, no período seco, diminuiram significativamente a contagem de ovos por grama de fezes (OPG) e o número de teleóginas, e, aumentou significativamente o ganho médio de peso. Os animais tratados com uma aplicação de <b>levamisol</b> estavam nesse período com médias de OPG intermediárias e significativamente diferentes dos grupos controle e tratados com endectocida.

In the second trial, the effects of grazing systems associated with endo and ectoparasite treatments on parasite burden and weight gain of naturally parasited animals were evaluated. Rotenone showed acaricide action on larvae and engorged ticks during in vitro tests and on larvae in experimentally infected calves. Three treatments with endectocide decreased (P <. 05) the number of EPG and ticks and increased (P <. 05) the weight gain in the dry season. Animals treated with only one application of levamisole showed EPG intermediate and different (P <. 05) from the groups treated with endectocide (lower) and control (higher) in the dry season, but the weight gain obtained with this treatment {{did not differ from}} the control group.

40|$|A púrpura trombocitopênica idiopática (PTI) é uma patologia adquirida que leva à redução da contagem de plaquetas, mediada por mecanismo imunológico. O tratamento inicial é a corticoterapia e, se caracterizada a falência ou dependência desta, a esplenectomia é a segunda opção. Autores recomendam que a esplenectomia seja realizada antes de se completarem 12 meses do diagnóstico, apesar de estudos sugerirem que a resposta após este período é semelhante. Neste estudo, pesquisaram-se a eficácia da esplenectomia tardia, as complicações da manutenção da terapia imunossupressora e as complicações hemorrágicas na população com esplenectomia tardia. Analisaram-se prontuários de 39 pacientes com idade de 4 a 64 anos (mediana de 27 anos) ao diagnóstico, submetidos à esplenectomia como procedimento terapêutico de PTI. Classificaram-se as respostas à esplenectomia, observadas na última visita, após 6 meses da cirurgia, em resposta completa (RC) (mais de 150. 000 plaquetas/ l) parcial (RP) (de 50. 000 a 150. 000 plaquetas/ l) ou sem resposta (SR) (menos de 50. 000 plaquetas/ l ou necessidade de medicação para controle da PTI). No período {{anterior}} à esplenectomia, a prednisona causou efeitos colaterais em 18 % dos pacientes. Uma paciente que utilizou azatioprina desenvolveu carcinoma ductal de mama. Outros efeitos colaterais da azatioprina, danazol, colchicina, <b>levamisol</b> e vincristina reverteram após a suspensão das drogas. Não houve mortalidade relacionada à PTI nem às esplenectomias, mas houve mais hemorragias graves (21 %) no período pré-operatório. As esplenectomias foram realizadas após 1 a 174 meses (mediana 36 meses) do diagnóstico e a última visita ocorreu depois de 9 a 300 meses (mediana 25, 5 meses) da cirurgia. As respostas finais à esplenectomia foram: 16 (44 %) RC, 10 (28 %) RP, 10 (28 %) SR. A comparação entre as respostas dos pacientes que realizaram a esplenectomia antes e as dos que a realizaram após 36 meses não mostrou diferença significativa (p= 0, 687). A esplenectomia tardia tem eficácia, aferida pela soma das RC e RP, comparável à citada pela literatura.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is {{an acquired}} immunologic disorder associated with reduction of platelet count. The primary treatment is prednisone {{in the majority}} of cases, and if it fails or if there is a dependence of it, the splenectomy is performed. The surgery is usually indicated within 12 months after diagnosis because of presumed better results. Nevertheless, clinical studies suggest that splenectomy is effective when performed after this 12 months. In this study the hemorrhagic complications of ITP, the side effects of immunossupressive therapy during preoperative period and the efficacy and safety of the procedure were studied in a population with late splenectomy. Thirty nine patients were included with median age of 27 years (range 4 to 64 years) at the diagnosis of ITP. The response to splenectomy were classified as complete response (CR) (platelets counts above 150. 000 / l), partial response (PR) (platelet counts of 50. 000 to 150. 000 / l), and no response (NR) (less than 50. 000 / l or use of drugs to maintain platelet count). In the preoperative period, prednisone caused side effects in 18 % of patients. One patient who received azathioprine had breast cancer. Other side effects of azathioprine, danazol, colchicin, levamisole and vincristine remitted after drugs withdrawal. The surgeries were performed after 1 to 174 months of diagnosis (median of 36 months). Of the 39 patients, 36 had assessment of response to splenectomy after 9 to 300 months: 16 patients had CR (44 %), 10 PR (28 %), and 10 NR (28 %). The responses of the patients with period of diagnosis to splenectomy of 36 months or more were not different from the patients with this period of less than 36 months (p= 0. 687). During the preoperative period, 21 % of patients had severe hemorrhagic complications of ITP, but there were no death caused by ITP or splenectomy. Although, the favorable response (sum of CR and PR) of late splenectomy was similar, there were more side effects of immunossupressive therapy and severe hemorrhagic complications than the reported in the literature. Splenectomy is a therapeutic option for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), usually recommend before 12 months after diagnosis.

40|$|Livestock {{production}} contributes substantially to the livelihoods of poor rural {{farmers in}} Pakistan; strengthening pastoral communities plays an imperative {{role in the}} country’s thrive for poverty alleviation. Intestinal helminths constitute a major threat for pastoral livestock keepers {{in the whole country}} because chronic infestation leads to distinct losses in livestock productivity, particularly the growth of young animals. Synthetic anthelmintics have long been considered the only effective way of controlling this problem but high prices, side effects and chemical residues/toxicity problems, or development of resistance, lead to their very limited use in many pastoral systems. Additionally, poor pastoralists in remote areas of Pakistan hardly have access to appropriate anthelmintic drugs, which are also relatively expensive due to the long routes of transportation. The search for new and more sustainable ways of supporting livestock keepers in remote areas has given rise to studies of ethno-botanicals or traditional plant-based remedies to be used in livestock health care. Plant-based remedies are cheap or free of cost, environmentally safe and generally create no problem of drug resistance; they thus might substitute allopathic drugs. Furthermore, these remedies are easily available in remote areas and simple to prepare and/or administer. Cholistan desert is a quite poor region of Pakistan and the majority of its inhabitants are practicing a nomadic life. The region’s total livestock population (1. 29 million heads) is almost twice that of the human population. Livestock husbandry is the primordial occupation of the communities and traditionally wealth assessment was {{based on the number of}} animals, especially goats and sheep, owned by an individual. Fortunately, about 60 % of this desert region is richly endowed with highly adapted grasses, shrubs and trees. This natural flora has a rich heritage of scientifically unexplored botanical pharmacopoeia. Against this background, the present research project that was conducted under the umbrella of the International Center for Development and Decent Work at Kassel University, focused on a development aspect: in the Cholistan desert region it was firstly examined how pastoralists manage their livestock, which major health problems they face for the different animal species, and which of the naturally occurring plants they use for the treatment of animal diseases (Chapter 2). For this purpose, a baseline survey was carried out across five locations in Cholistan, using a structured questionnaire to collect data from 100 livestock farmers (LF) and 20 local healers (LH). Most of LF and LH were illiterate (66 %; 70 %). On average, LH had larger herds (109 animals) than LF (85 animals) and were more experienced in livestock husbandry and management. On average LF spent about 163 Euro per year on the treatment of their livestock, with a huge variability in expenditures. Eighty-six traditional remedies based on 64 plants belonging to 43 families were used. Capparaceae was the botanical family with the largest number of species used (4), followed by Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae and Zygophyllaceae (3). The plants Capparis decidua (n= 55 mentions), Salsola foetida (n= 52), Suaeda fruticosa (n= 46), Haloxylon salicornicum (n= 42) and Haloxylon recurvum (n= 39) were said to be most effective against the infestations with gastrointestinal parasites. Aerial parts (43 %), leaves (26 %), fruits (9 %), seeds and seed oils (9 %) were the plant parts frequently used for preparation of remedies, while flowers, roots, bulbs and pods were less frequently used (< 5 %). Common preparations were decoction, jaggery and ball drench; oral drug administration was very common. There was some variation in the doses used for different animal species depending on age, size and physical condition of the animal and severity of the disease. In a second step the regionally most prevalent gastrointestinal parasites of sheep and goats were determined (Chapter 3) in 500 animals per species randomly chosen from pastoral herds across the previously studied five localities. Standard parasitological techniques were applied to identify the parasites in faecal samples manually collected at the rectum. Overall helminth prevalence was 78. 1 % across the 1000 animals; pure nematode infestations were most prevalent (37. 5 %), followed by pure trematode (7. 9 %), pure cestode (2. 6 %) and pure protozoa infestations (0. 8 %). Mixed infestations with nematodes and trematodes occurred in 6. 4 % of all animals, mixed nematode-cestode infestations in 3. 8 %, and all three groups were found in 19. 1 % of the sheep and goats. In goats more males (81. 1 %) than females (77. 0 %) were infested, the opposite was found in sheep (73. 6 % males, 79. 5 % females). Parasites were especially prevalent in suckling goats (85. 2 %) and sheep (88. 5 %) and to a lesser extent in young (goats 80. 6 %, sheep 79. 3 %) and adult animals (goats 72. 8 %, sheep 73. 8 %). Haemonchus contortus, Trichuris ovis and Paramphistomum cervi were the most prevalent helminths. In a third step the in vitro anthelmintic activity of C. decidua, S. foetida, S. fruticosa, H. salicornicum and H. recurvum (Chapter 2) was investigated against adult worms of H. contortus, T. ovis and P. cervi (Chapter 3) via adult motility assay (Chapter 4). Various concentrations ranging from 7. 8 to 500 mg dry matter/ml of three types of extracts of each plant, i. e. aqueous, methanol, and aqueous-methanol (30 : 70), were used at different time intervals to access their anthelmintic activity. <b>Levamisol</b> (0. 55 mg/ml) and oxyclozanide (30 mg/ml) served as positive and phosphate-buffered saline as negative control. All extracts exhibited minimum and maximum activity at 2 h and 12 h after parasite exposure; the 500 mg/ml extract concentrations were most effective. Plant species (P< 0. 05), extract type (P< 0. 01), parasite species (P< 0. 01), extract concentration (P< 0. 01), time of exposure (P< 0. 01) and their interactions (P< 0. 01) had significant effects on the number of immobile/dead helminths. From the comparison of LC 50 values it appeared that the aqueous extract of C. decidua was more potent against H. contortus and T. ovis, while the aqueous extract of S. foetida was effective against P. cervi. The methanol extracts of H. recurvum were most potent against all three types of parasites, and its aqueous-methanol extract was also very effective against T. ovis and P. cervi. Based on these result it is concluded that the aqueous extract of C. decidua, as well as the methanol and aqueous-methanol extract of H. recurvum have the potential to be developed into plant-based drugs for treatment against H. contortus, T. ovis and P. cervi infestations. Further studies are now needed to investigate the in vivo anthelmintic activity of these plants and plant extracts, respectively, in order to develop effective, cheap and locally available anthelmintics for pastoralists in Cholistan and neighboring desert regions. This will allow developing tangible recommendations for plant-based anthelminthic treatment of sheep and goat herds, and by this enable pastoralists to maintain healthy and productive flocks at low costs and probably even manufacture herbal drugs for marketing on a regional scale. Die Tierhaltung in Pakistan trägt wesentlich zum Lebensunterhalt von armen Bauern bei; die Stärkung der pastoralen Gemeinschaften spielt dabei eine unerläßliche Rolle bei der Bekämpfung von Armut. Gastrointestinale Helminthen sind ein wichtiges gesundheitliches Problem für pastorale Nutztierherden im ganzen Land und können daher die Lebensgrundlage von Tierhaltern wesentlich beeinträchtigen. Ein chronischer Befall der Tiere mit Helminthen führt zu deutlichen Verlusten der Produktivität, besonders des Wachstums von Jungtieren. Synthetische Entwurmungsmittel wurden lange als die einzig wirksamen Mittel betrachtet um den Befall zu kontrollieren. Hohe Produktpreise, unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen, chemische Rückstände/Toxizität oder die Entwicklung von Resistenzen haben jedoch zu einer begrenzten Verwendung dieser Anthelmintika in vielen pastoralen Systemen geführt. Darüber hinaus haben arme Hirten in abgelegenen Gebieten Pakistans kaum Zugang zu geeigneten Medikamenten, welche zudem aufgrund langer Transportwege auch relativ teuer sind. Auf der Suche nach neuen und nachhaltigeren Ansätzen zur Unterstützung von Tierhaltern bei der Erhaltung der Herdengesundheit in abgelegenen Gebieten wurde daher in den vergangenen 20 Jahren die wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit verstärkt auf ethno-botanische oder traditionell genutzte pflanzliche Heilmittel gelenkt. Pflanzliche Heilmittel sind billiger oder gar kostenlos, umweltfreundlich und rufen in der Regel keine Resistenzprobleme hervor; somit können diese allopathische Medikamente ersetzen. Darüber hinaus sind diese Mittel in abgelegenen Gebieten leicht verfügbar und einfach zuzubereiten und zu verabreichen. Die Wüstenregion Cholistan ist eine sehr arme Region in Südwest Pakistan; die Mehrheit ihrer Bewohner führt ein Nomadenleben. Der Gesamtnutztierbestand (1. 29 Millionen) in der Region ist fast doppelt so hoch wie die Zahl der Einwohner. Nutztierhaltung ist die traditionelle Tätigkeit der Bevölkerung und Reichtum wird anhand der Anzahl an Tieren (v. a. Ziegen und Schafe) bemessen, die sich im Besitz einer Person befinden. Erstaunlicher Weise sind etwa 60 % dieser Wüstenregion mit sehr angepaßten Gräsern, Sträuchern und Bäumen bewachsen. Diese natürliche vorkommende Flora dürfte ein reiches Spektrum an wissenschaftlich unerforschten pflanzlichen Arzneimitteln beinhalten. Die vorliegende Doktorarbeit wurde unter der Schirmherrschaft des Internationalen Zentrums für Entwicklung und menschenwürdige Arbeit (international Center for Development and Decent Work – ICDD – www. icdd. uni-kassel. de‎) an der Universität Kassel durchgeführt, wobei der Entwicklungsaspekt im Mittelpunkt der Arbeit stand. Zunächst wurde in der Wüstenregion Cholistan untersucht, wie Hirten ihre Tiere managen, welches die häufigsten Gesundheitsprobleme der verschiedenen Tierarten sind und welche natürlich vorkommenden Pflanzen sie für die Behandlung von Tierkrankheiten verwenden (Kapitel 2). Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine Erhebung in fünf Ansiedlungen durchgeführt; mit Hilfe eines strukturierten Fragebogens wurden 100 Viehzüchter (VZ) und 20 lokalen Heiler (LH) individuell befragt. 	 Die meisten VZ und LH waren Analphabeten (66 % bzw. 70 %). Im Durchschnitt hatten LH größere Herden (109 Tiere) als VZ (85 Tiere) und mehr Erfahrung in der Tierhaltung. Durchschnittlich investierten VZ 163 Euro pro Jahr in die Behandlung ihres Viehs, jedoch mit starken individuellen Abweichungen. Sechsundachtzig traditionelle Heilmittel wurden aus 64 Pflanzenarten hergestellt und genutzt; die Arten konnten 43 Pflanzenfamilien zugeordnet werden. Capparaceae stellten die größte Anzahl der verwendeten Arten (4), gefolgt von Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae und Zygophyllaceae (jeweils 3). Die Pflanzenarten Capparis decidua (n= 55 Nennungen), Salsola foetida (n= 52), Suaeda fruticosa (n= 46), Haloxylon salicornicum (n= 42) und Haloxylon recurvum (n= 39) sollten nach Angaben der VZ und LH am effektivsten gegen den Befall mit Magen-Darm-Parasiten wirken. Oberirdische Pflanzenteile (43 %), Blätter (26 %), Früchte (9 %), Samen und Samenöl (9 %) waren die am häufigsten verwendeten Pflanzenteile für die Heilmittelherstellung, während Blüten, Wurzeln, Zwiebeln und Hülsen weniger häufig verwendet wurden (jeweils < 5 %). Die übliche Art der Zubereitung bestand aus Abkochen, Kandieren und Drehen von kleinen Pillen; die orale Verabreichung der Medikamente war die häufigste. Die Dosierung eines Heilmittels variierte zwischen Tierarten, Alter, Größe und Kondition der Tiere und Schwere der Erkrankung. In einem zweiten Schritt wurden die regional am häufigsten vorkommenden Magen-Darm-Parasiten von Schafen und Ziegen bestimmt (Kapitel 3). In den Herden an den fünf bereits untersuchten Standorten wurden insgesamt 500 Tiere pro Art zufällig ausgewählt. Es wurden Standardtechniken angewendet, um die Parasiten in rektal gewonnenen Kotproben zu identifizieren. 	 Insgesamt lag die Prävalenz gastrointestinaler Parasiten bei 78, 1 % aller 1000 Tiere; reiner Fadenwurmerbefall war am häufigsten verbreiteten (37, 5 %), gefolgt von reinem Trematoden- (7, 9 %), reinem Cestoden- (2, 6 %) und reinem Protozoenbefall (0, 8 %). Ein Mischbefall mit Nematoden und Trematoden fand sich bei 6, 4 % aller Tiere, ein Mischbefall mit Fadenwürmern und Cestoden bei 3, 8 %. Ein Befall mit allen drei Helminthentaxa wurde bei 19, 1 % der Schafe und Ziegen nachgewiesen. Bei Ziegen waren eher die männlichen (81, 1 %) als die weiblichen Tiere (77, 0 %) befallen, im Gegensatz zu den Schafen (männlich: 73, 6 %; weiblich: 79, 5 %). Parasiten wurden besonders häufig bei Kitzen (85, 2 %) und Lämmern (88, 5 %), in geringerem Maße bei Jungtieren (Ziegen: 80, 6 %; Schafe: 79, 3 %) und adulten Tieren (Ziegen: 72, 8 %; Schafe: 73, 8 %) gefunden. Haemonchus contortus, Trichuris ovis und Paramphistomum cervi waren die am weitesten verbreiteten Helminthenarten. In einem dritten Schritt wurde die in vitro Aktivität von C. decidua, S. foetida, S. fruticosa, H. salicornicum und H. recurvum (Kapitel 2) gegen adulte H. contortus, T. ovis und P. cervi (Kapitel 3) getestet, mit Hilfe des Adult Motility Assays (Kapitel 4). Pro Pflanze wurden unterschiedliche Konzentrationen an Pflanzenmaterial (zwischen 7. 8 und 500. 0 mg Trockensubstanz pro ml) mit drei unterschiedlichen Lösungsmitteln erstellt (Wasser, Methanol, und Wasser-Methanol 30 : 70). Diese wurden mit unterschiedlich langer Wirkzeit eingesetzt (2 – 24 Stunden), um ihre Helminthentoxizität zu bestimmen. Levamisolhydrochlorid (0, 55 mg/ml) und Oxyclozanid (30, 00 mg/ml) dienten als Positivkontrolle, phosphatgepufferte Kochsalzlösung als Negativkontrolle. 	 Alle Extrakte zeigten minimale und maximale Toxizität nach 2 und 12 Stunden der Exposition; die Extraktkonzentration von 500 mg/ en war dabei jeweils am effektivsten. Pflanzenart (P< 0, 05), Extraktionsmittel, Parasitenart, Extraktkonzentration, Zeit der Exposition und deren Wechselwirkungen hatten einen signifikanten Einfluß (jeweils P< 0, 01) auf die Anzahl an immobilen/toten Helminthen. Der Vergleich der LC 50 -Werte zeigte, dass wässrige Extrakte von C. decidua stärker gegen H. contortus und T. ovis wirkten als jene von S. foetida gegen P. cervi. Die Methanolextrakte von H. recurvum waren am wirkungsvollsten gegen alle drei Arten von Parasiten wobei auch der Methanol-Wasser-Extrakt sehr effektiv gegen T. ovis und P. cervi wirkte. Aus diesen Ergebnissen kann geschlossen werden, dass das wässrige Extrakt von C. decidua sowie das Methanol- und Wasser-Methanol-Extrakt von H. recurvum das Potential besitzen, als Entwurmungsmittel gegen H. contortus, T. ovis und P. cervi zu wirken. Weitere Studien sind nun erforderlich, um die anthelmintische Wirkung dieser Pflanzen bzw. Pflanzenextrakte in vivo zu untersuchen. Darauf aufbauend können dann effektive, kostengünstige und lokal verfügbare Anthelmintika für die regelmäßige Entwurmung der kleinen Wiederkäuer von Viehhaltern in Cholistan und den angrenzenden Wüstenregionen entwickelt werden. Viehhalter könnten so die Gesundheit und Produktivität ihrer Herden mit geringen Kosten sicherstellen und eventuell sogar selbst zubereitete, effektive pflanzliche Medikamente auf regionaler Ebene vermarkten um zusätzliches Einkommen zu schöpfen. The financial support of the International Center for Development and Decent Work (ICDD) at Kassel University, funded through the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in the framework of the ex) /(ceedprogram, is worthy of high tribute...|$|E
