50|$|In acute cases, {{drugs and}} {{procedures}} which cause vasodilation {{are effective in}} reducing pain experienced by patient. For example, prostaglandins like <b>Limaprost</b> are vasodilators and give relief of pain, but do not help in changing the course of disease. Epidural anesthesia and hyperbaric oxygen therapy also have vasodilator effect.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Compression of {{the spinal}} nerve roots by lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is a major}} clinical problem associated with intermittent claudication, pain and numbness. The pathological mechanism is reduced blood flow in nerve roots and degeneration of nerve roots. Prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) is used for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) to increase capillary flow around the main artery and improve symptoms; however, the ankle-brachial index (ABI) does not change after treatment. Lumbar spinal nerve roots contain somatosensory, somatomotor, and unmyelinated autonomic nerves, and improved blood flow in these spinal nerve roots may improve the function of nerve fibers innervating muscle, capillary, and main vessels in the lower leg, resulting in an increased ABI. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the hypothesis that <b>limaprost,</b> a PGE 1 analog, improves blood flow in compressed and degenerated spinal nerve roots, leading to improved function of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in spinal nerve roots innervating the lower leg and a resultant increase in the ABI. Methods: <b>Limaprost</b> (15 Î¼g 3 times a day for 3 months) was administered orally to 49 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. Low back pain and leg pain scores, walking distance, and ABI were measured before treatment and after 3 months of <b>limaprost</b> treatment. Results: Low back pain, leg pain, and maximum walking distance significantly improved after <b>limaprost</b> treatment (P< 0. 05). ABI was also significantly increased by <b>limaprost</b> treatment (P= 0. 003). Conclusions: This is the first investigation of changes in ABI in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis after treatment with a PGE 1 analog. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider the role of the autonomic nervous system in spinal nerve roots associated with blood supply to the lower leg in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the bleeding complications induced by the administration of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Methods: After a deletion of duplicated submissions and the revision of arbitrary drug names, AERs involving warfarin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl icosapentate, <b>limaprost</b> alfadex, sarpogrelate, and ticlopidine were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools {{were used for the}} quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: Based on 22, 017, 956 co-occurrences, i. e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 736 adverse events were listed as warfarin-associated adverse events, and 147 of the 736 were bleeding complications, including haemorrhage and haematoma. Both aspirin and clopidogrel were associated with haemorrhage, but the association was more noteworthy for clopidogrel. As for bleeding complications related to the gastrointestinal system, e. g., melaena and haematochezia, the statistical metrics suggested a stronger association for aspirin than clopidogrel. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare the association with bleeding complications for the other 5 antiplatelets. Conclusions: The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to antiplatelet-associated bleeding complications. </p...|$|E
