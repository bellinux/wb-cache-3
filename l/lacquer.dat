5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, {{but it can also}} be of paper or leather. Next is the application of <b>lacquer,</b> which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of <b>lacquer</b> are applied. The <b>lacquer</b> is then decorated with a variety of methods. In the maki-e technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the <b>lacquer</b> before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around this time is the earliest <b>lacquer</b> artist known by name.|$|E

5|$|Japanese lacquerware {{has a long}} history, {{back as far as}} the Jōmon period, {{because of}} {{decorative}} value and the quality as protective finish. Initially <b>lacquer</b> was used to enhance properties of utilitarian objects such as watertight drinking vessels, cooking and household goods. The oldest extant decorated item dates to the 6th century; in the medieval and early modern period <b>lacquer</b> was used in the manufacture of many products such as toiletry boxes, inkstone cases, eating utensils, plates, bowls, containers, furniture, saddles, stirrups or armour.|$|E
50|$|Paints that dry {{by solvent}} {{evaporation}} and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent {{are known as}} <b>lacquers.</b> A solid film forms when the solvent evaporates. Because no chemical crosslinking is involved, the film can re-dissolve in solvent; as such, <b>lacquers</b> are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important. Classic nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> fall into this category, as do non-grain raising stains composed of dyes dissolved in solvent. Performance varies by formulation, but <b>lacquers</b> generally tend to have better UV resistance and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence.|$|R

50|$|Processed <b>lacquers</b> {{can have}} oil added {{to them to}} make them glossy, for example, shuai-urushi (朱合漆) is mixed with linseed oil. Other {{specialist}} <b>lacquers</b> include ikkake-urushi (釦漆) which is thick and used mainly for applying gold or silver leaf.|$|R
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} <b>lacquer</b> covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective <b>lacquer</b> and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos was {{mastered}} at Precision <b>Lacquer</b> in Los Angeles by Stephen Marcussen {{and finally}} released as LP and CD on July 1988, almost {{eight years after}} the work on it had begun and twenty-three years after the concept of Imaginos was created. A limited edition of the album was also released in blue vinyl.|$|E
5|$|The listed items {{consist of}} {{materials}} such as wood over clay or to bronze. Often the articles were decorated {{using a variety of}} artistic techniques like gilding of precious metals, line engraving, maki-e, mother of pearl inlay or <b>lacquer.</b> The objects are housed in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines or museums.|$|E
50|$|Wooden {{baseboard}} can {{be available}} in untreated, <b>lacquered</b> or prepainted versions.

5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or <b>lacquer</b> boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E

5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when <b>lacquer</b> {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases. The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter Ogata Kōrin. He {{was the first to}} use mother of pearl and pewter in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.|$|E

5|$|Ritual bronzemaking: During the Shang dynasty, China {{became one}} of the most skilled bronze-working civilizations in the ancient world, as people heated, melted, and cast metal to making cooking utensils, tools, weapons, and other {{household}} items. Modern archaeologists see such preservation of how the ancient Chinese lived by interpreting from <b>lacquer</b> paintings on wood which helped preserve ancient Chinese bronze artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Sitalaphirom (พระที่นั่งสีตลาภิรมย์) {{is a small}} open {{pavilion}} made of wood, {{built by}} King Rama VI. The pavilion is situated on {{the northern edge of}} the lawn south of the Boromphiman palace. The pavilion is decorated with a flame motif in gilded black <b>lacquer.</b> The gables bear the insignia of King Rama VI. The king used the pavilion as a place of rest and as a seat during garden parties.|$|E
5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, <b>lacquer</b> and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E

5|$|Female virtue {{was tied}} to {{literary}} knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century {{they had come to}} symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of <b>lacquer</b> boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kanō Tan'yū as a wedding gift in 1649.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried <b>lacquer.</b> Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Young {{became an}} {{industrial}} research chemist, {{working in the}} <b>lacquer</b> industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became {{an assistant professor of}} chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Bushka rings, various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated, including various colored plastics (often marbleized), and silver and contrasting wooden rings. For decoration, Balabushka often inlaid small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common {{to many other}} cuemakers' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used. One side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray <b>lacquer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of <b>lacquer.</b> Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged <b>lacquer</b> gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPharmaceutical nail <b>lacquers</b> {{are used}} to topically treat nail fungal infections. The film's {{residence}} on the nail is an important factor, and in the laboratory, rapid in vitro adhesion and water resistance tests are often used to indicate their likely in vivo residence. However, the predictivity of such in vitro tests is unknown. The aim of this work was thus to determine whether, and to what extent, such in vitro tests can correctly predict the in vivo fate of nail <b>lacquers.</b> The in vivo residence of four commercially available nail <b>lacquers</b> (three pharmaceutical and one cosmetic) was determined in 16 volunteers.

40|$|In This research, {{the scratch}} {{strength}} (Cross-Cut Test) of clear paints (nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> and acid catalyst <b>lacquers)</b> of wood species Beech, Elm, Alder and spruce were studied {{as a function}} of moisture content (MC) of the samples. For this purpose, lumbers (550 × 110 × 12 mm) were cut from sapwood in tangential surfaces and were air dried for one month according to wood drying procedures. Then, for pre-conditioning of moisture content, at the levels of 8 %, 12 % and 15 %, the samples were placed in three clima rooms. Then, finish applied and strength tests were performed. The results revealed that for acid catalyst <b>lacquers</b> the highest scratch strength (10. 4 %) belongs to Elm wood with 8 % moisture content, and the lowest scratch strength (53. 6 %) belongs to Spruce wood with nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> having 15 % moisture content...|$|R
