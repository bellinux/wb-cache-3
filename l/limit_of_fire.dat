50|$|When direct {{communication}} began, the 11th Airborne Division and the XIV Corps quickly co-ordinated artillery fire plans {{and established a}} <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> line to demark their support zones about midway between Nichols Field and the Manila city limits. Under the provisions of this plan XIV Corps Artillery fired sixteen 155mm and 8-inch howitzer concentrations {{in support of the}} airborne division's attack at Nichols Field before the division passed to XIV Corps control about 1300 on 10 February. For the time being, Griswold directed Swing, the 11th Airborne Division would continue to exert pressure against the Japanese at Nichols Field but would mount no general assault. Instead, the division would ascertain the extent and nature of the Japanese defenses at and east of the airfield and prepare to secure the Cavite naval base area, which the division had bypassed on its way north from Nasugbu. Further orders would be forthcoming once XIV Corps itself could learn more about the situation south of Manila.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine the cost {{structure}} and risk associated with wheat production in the eastern area of El-Sawalem Village, Etai-El-Barood County, Egypt, for the year 1998 / 99. Primary data is collected through personal interviews with farmers at the study area during August 1999. Some of the study results are: (1) Total variable production costs (TVC) and total fixed costs (TFC) represent approximately 57. 7 % and 42. 4 % of total production cost (TC) per feddan, respectively. This TC per feddan is estimated at L. E. 1304. 4. (2) The optimal output size of 20. 7 Ardeb exceeds that of the actual one by nearly 8. 4 Ardeb, or equivalently L. E. 821. 2, taking the prevailing farm price of L. E. /Ardeb 98 into consideratio. It is estimated that the minimum acceptable farm price which makes the farmer continues wheat production is in the neighborhood of L. E/Ardeb 45. 74 (3) The profit-maximizing level of output of 26. 1 Ardeb exceeds that of the actual one by nearly 13. 8 Ardeb, or equivalently L. E. 1347. 5 at existing price levels. (4) The actual net farm income for wheat which is estimated at L. E. 524 is found to be lower than that of the optimum output level and the profit-maximizing level of output by L. E. 605 and L. E. 765. 1, respectively. (5) The price-elasticity of supply for wheat is found to be relatively low due to the impossibility of controlling output levels and wheat auto-consumption. (6) Unfavorable weather conditions, diseases, weed, and the utilization of traditional seeds are considered to be the major sources of production risk for wheat. The upper limits of their occurrence at the study area at a confidence level of 99 % are: 78. 7 %, 68. 9 %, 81. 6 %, and 58. 7 %, respectively. Whereas the high prices of input requirements, rental of machinery, wages, and lack of information are found to be the major sources of price risk for wheat. The upper limits of their occurrence at the same-above confidence level are 94. 8 %, 87. 7 %, 81. 6 %, and 75. 5 %, respectively. (7) Difficulty of providing funds and loan servicing are considered to be the two major sources of financial risk. Their corresponding upper limits of occurrence at the 99 % confidence level are estimated at 79. 9 % and 90. 4 % respectively. And (8) fire is considered to be the major source of losses for wheat. The upper <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> occurrence is estimated at 24. 7 % at the 99 % confidence level...|$|E
