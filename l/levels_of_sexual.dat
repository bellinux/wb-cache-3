5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E

One relationship that was an addition to those already found in the literature was sexual knowledge as an antecedent to sexual satisfaction. Six questions were formulated for the study: 1. 	How do females perceive their global sexual functioning? 2. 	How do females perceive their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> satisfaction? 3. 	How accurately do females answer questions regarding female and male anatomy and physiology, sexual arousal and response, and sexual technique? 4.

25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is school culture, as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how school culture can lead students to perceive themselves as having varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within individual schools can influence the ways students think about their own sexuality and sexual experiences.|$|E

25|$|Boys {{are less}} willing to state they have {{negative}} feelings about sex than girls when they describe their sexual self-schemas. Boys are not divided into positive and negative sexual self-concepts; they are divided into schematic and non-schematic (a schema is a cluster of ideas about a process or aspect of the world; see schema). Boys who are sexually schematic are more sexually experienced, have higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> arousal, and are more able to experience romantic feelings. Boys who are not schematic have fewer sexual partners, a smaller range of sexual experiences and are much less likely than schematic men {{to be in a}} romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|Menopause is the {{permanent}} cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity. Menopause {{can be divided}} into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms. It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness. The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> desire.|$|E
25|$|Each season {{consists}} of {{seven to eight}} people, aged 18–25 (a reflection of the network's target demographic), usually selected from thousands of applicants from across the country, with the group chosen typically representing different races, genders, sexual orientations, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences, and religious and political beliefs. Should a cast member decide to move out, or be asked {{to do so by}} his or her roommates, the roommates will usually cast a replacement, dependent on how much filming time is left. Cast members are paid a small stipend for their participation in the show. The cast of the first season, for example, was given $2,500. However, because cast members are not actors playing characters, they do not receive residuals routinely paid to actors whenever a TV show on which they appear is aired and replayed.|$|E

40|$|Casual sex (i. e., sex outside committed, romantic relationships) {{has become}} a {{normative}} experience among college students. Researchers and practitioners have expressed concerns about the potential negative physical and psychological consequences of casual sex. However, empirical evidence is inconsistent, pointing towards potential moderating factors. This study examined the moderating role <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> assertiveness {{in the relationship between}} casual sex and sexual self-esteem. A sample of 58 Dutch female college students completed an online survey measuring casual sex, sexual assertiveness, and sexual self-esteem. Results revealed that sexual assertiveness moderated the relationship between casual sex and sexual self-esteem. Specifically, the relationship between casual sex and sexual self-esteem was negative in women with a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> assertiveness. This relationship was not significant in women with a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> assertiveness, although the trend suggests that, in these women, having casual sex is related to a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> self-esteem. These results emphasize the importance for emerging adults to stand up for their needs and desires when it comes to sexuality...|$|R

25|$|Based in {{a survey}} with about 10,000 respondents, IFOP {{estimated}} that 90% of French people are heterosexual, 3% identify as bisexual, and 4% consider themselves homosexual. Two percent say they have not embraced a definition for their sexuality, and 1% {{did not wish to}} respond. More women than men are heterosexual (93% v. 86%), whereas more men than women identify as homosexual (7% v. 1%) {{and to a lesser extent}} bisexual (4% v. 2%). A homosexual or bisexual identity was more common in people aged 18–49 (9%) than among those aged 50–64 (6%) or over 65 (4%). More singles than people in relationships identified as homo- or bisexual (11% v. 6%). An LGB identity is also more common among people who said they have had more than 10 sex partners or none at all compared to those who have had intermediary <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> experience. Catholics are more likely to identify as heterosexual (91%) than people who said they had some other religion or no religion whatsoever (88% each).|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
500|$|There is {{significant}} {{debate over whether}} or not asexuality is a sexual orientation. It has been compared and equated with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone; HSDD has been used to medicalize asexuality, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a sexual dysfunction (such as anorgasmia, anhedonia, etc.), because it does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially. Unlike people with HSDD, asexual people normally do not experience [...] "marked distress" [...] and [...] "interpersonal difficulty" [...] concerning feelings about their sexuality, or generally a lack of sexual arousal; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic. One study found that, compared to HSDD subjects, asexuals reported lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> desire, sexual experience, sex-related distress and depressive symptoms. Researchers Richards and Barker report that asexuals do not have disproportionate rates of alexithymia, depression, or personality disorders. Some people, however, may identify as asexual even if their non-sexual state is explained by {{one or more of the}} aforementioned disorders.|$|E

2500|$|The {{estimates}} for the United States vary widely.

The US Department of Health and Human Services reported 83,600 substantiated reports of sexually abused children in 2005.

2500|$|Alcohol myopia causes {{individuals}} to become increasingly aware of sexual arousal {{and more likely}} to respond rashly to the arousal stimulus. The decision about how to respond to sexual arousal involves cognitive function that synthesizes both impelling cues (those that draw attention to the benefits of an action) and inhibiting cues (those that focus on the consequences of an action). The alcohol myopia theory suggests that intoxicated individuals {{will be more likely to}} engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males subject to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> arousal were more likely to engage in unprotected sex [...] than sober males subject to the same levels of arousal. [...] This is because the impelling cues (sexual arousal) are often more imminent than inhibitory cues (safety precautions), and those affected by alcohol myopia are limited to cognitive processing of the more immediate cues and often ignore the inhibitory cues.|$|E
2500|$|Paleoanthropological {{estimates}} of the time frame {{for the evolution of}} monogamy are primarily based on the level of sexual dimorphism seen in the fossil record because, in general, the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism. [...] According to Reno et al., the sexual dimorphism of Australopithecus afarensis, a human ancestor from approximately 3.9–3.0 million years ago, was within the modern human range, based on dental and postcranial morphology. [...] Although careful not to say that this indicates monogamous mating in early hominids, the authors do say that reduced <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism in A. afarensis “do not imply that monogamy is any less probable than polygyny”. [...] However, Gordon, Green and Richmond claim that in examining postcranial remains, A. afarensis is more sexually dimorphic than modern humans and chimps with levels closer to those of orangutans and gorillas. [...] Furthermore, Homo habilis, living approximately 2.3 mya, is the most sexually dimorphic early hominid. [...] Plavcan and van Schaik conclude their examination of this controversy by stating that, overall, sexual dimorphism in australopithecines is not indicative of any behavioral implications or mating systems.|$|E
