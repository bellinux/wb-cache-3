40|$|Anglerfish (Lophius spp.) is {{consumed}} worldwide {{and is an}} important economic resource though its seven species are often fraudulently interchanged due to their different commercial value, especially when sold {{in the form of}} fillets or pieces. Molecular analysis is the only possible mean to verify traceability and counteract fraud. We developed two multiplex PCRs, one end-point and one real-time with melting curve post-amplification analysis, which can even be run with the simplest two-channel thermocyclers. The two methods were tested on seventy-five reference samples. Their specificity was checked in twenty more species of those most commonly available on the market and in other species of the <b>Lophiidae</b> family. Both methods, the choice of which depends on the equipment and budget of the lab, provide a rapid and easy-to-read response, improving both the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of existing methods for identifying Lophius species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Seven {{species of}} Lophius are known worldwide, {{six in the}} Atlantic Ocean and just one in the Northwest Pacific. The genus {{supports}} valuable fisheries (except for Lophius vaillanti), most for a long time, though the exploitation of Lophius gastrophysus {{along the coast of}} Brazil is relatively recent. The manuscript reviews the current knowledge of phylogeographic and biological traits of Lophius species, pointing out common aspects in the life histories. Within the <b>Lophiidae,</b> the genus Lophius is phylogenetically the most derived, vicar-iance and dispersal having {{played a significant role in}} driving speciation. Life histories seem to have followed similar adaptive processes from a common ancestor along with similar environmental characteristics. The genetic structure of populations is poorly known, and usually, genetic differentiation is limited. Life-history aspects (age, growth, reproductive cycle, early stages, and feeding ecology) are addressed, and fisheries are reviewed. However, knowledge of many aspects of the biology and ecology (e. g. validation of the growth pattern, maturation processes, spawning areas and periodicity, recruitment processes, mortality, stock identification, and habitat needs) remains limited...|$|E
40|$|From 1992 to 2001, {{by-catch}} {{that was}} landed from the Spanish deepwater trawl fishery for black hake off Mauritania was closely monitored. This {{is a highly}} specialised fishery, with two species of black hake (Merluccius senegalensis and Merluccius polli) constituting between 77 – 99 % of total land-ings, which have annually averaged 9 300 tons {{over the past two}} decades. Landings of Sparidae were highest among by-catch species of commercial value, with the large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthal-mus being the most important until 1996, after which the family <b>Lophiidae</b> and others predominated. Next were the Elasmobranchii, including large demersal squalids and several species of rays, although their annual landings fell from 182 tons in 1992 to only 4 tons in 1999, rising to 37 tons in 2001. The present paper analyses these changes using by-catches retained in the black hake fishery. We believe that the decline could be due to a set of different factors: a change in depths fished, economic reasons and probable over-exploitation of both targeted species and by-catch. Elasmobranchs constituted only 0. 1 % of total landings in 1999, compared to 1. 9 % in 1992, although their contribution to total com-mercial by-catch was constant. Seasonality was clearly evident, with an absolute and proportional rise in elasmobranch by-catch during warm periods, reaching 75 % of by-catch landings in some months, coinciding with a drop in total by-catch. These seasonal variations could be related to the migratory habits of the fishery's target species, black hake...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Anglerfishes, order Lophiiformes, {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} fishes living today and are widely known for their modified first dorsal-fin spine that serves as a luring apparatus. They comprise 351 living species placed in 73 genera, 18 families, and five suborders found world-wide from tropical near-shore habitats to the deep ocean. Previous studies using mitogenomes and morphological characters conflict, especially within the deep-sea suborder Ceratioidei, requiring that an independent line of evidence be examined to estimate the species tree. To this end, fragments from the protein coding nuclear loci ENC 1, Glyt, myh 6, and zic 1 were analyzed from 68 species of lophiiforms representing all five suborders and 17 of the 18 families. Partitioned Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses recovered monophyly for the order and all suborders. The concatenated nuclear genes strongly support the most basal position of the <b>Lophiidae,</b> supporting previous morphological and mitogenome studies. In addition, strong support for a clade comprising Chaunacoidei + Ceratioidei was also recovered, lending support to the previous mitogenome study. An unexpected relationship was recovered with regard to the Ogcocephaloidei, being recovered {{for the first time as}} basal to a clade comprising Antennarioidei + (Chaunacoidei + Ceratioidei). In addition, novel relationships were recovered within the Antennarioidei, rendering the family Antennariidae paraphyletic. While these relationships have not been recovered in previous morphological studies, some life history characters appear to lend support to these relationships. Relationships recovered within the Ceratioidei in this study conflict with both morphological and mitogenome studies and highlight the need for faster evolving nuclear loci to be analyzed to better understand these relationships. Additionally, evidence is presented to support at least three species within the Antennarias striatus complex. The results of this study are presented in a revised classification of the Lophiiformes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe West African {{continental}} slope {{is an important}} theatre for geological survey prospecting and drilling for hydrocarbons but {{little is known about}} local deep-sea biological communities at these depths. While shallow-water reefs are common and well-known features in the tropics, only few records of deep-water corals exist at low latitudes, and most of them have been reported by historical oceanographic cruises undertaking circum-navigations of the world. This study, based on a multi-disciplinary approach, presents a description of newly discovered deep-water coral reef communities along the Angola margin. Data from ROV, multibeam bathymetry, side-scan sonar and seismics from a deep-towed acoustic system (SAR) were used to describe the morphology of the coral mounds and their relationship with the local geological setting. The reef-building scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa has colonised carbonate mounds that reach heights of ca. 30 in and follow an orientation that is correlated with salt tectonic processes. Recent erosion is suggested as a process that influences the shape of the mounds. Sixteen fish taxa were identified during the ROV video surveys, with some of them likely to have a strong affinity with dense-living corals. The species observed belong to families commonly associated with deep-water corals (i. e. Sebastidae, Berycidae, <b>Lophiidae</b> and Chaunacidae), except an abundant species belonging to the family Zoarcidae, rarely observed in this type of environment. Lucinidae shells were found around mounds. As this bivalve family is indicative of reduced sediment and generally associated with cold-seep environments, this finding could revive the debate over the relationship between the distribution of cold-water coral habitat and gas seeps. However, there is no present-day nutritional relationship between living coral and chemosynthetic-derived biomass. The possible role of fluid expulsion in carbonate precipitation acting as the first step for coral colonisation is nevertheless discusse...|$|E
