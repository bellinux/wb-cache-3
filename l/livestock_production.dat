5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. <b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. <b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from <b>livestock</b> <b>production),</b> which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E

The results showed that Jiroft and Kerman regions had the highest and Rafsanjan had the lowest agronomical planting area. The highest planting area of horticultural plants was observed in Jiroft and Rafsanjan and the lowest amount of the trait was gained in Baft. The highest and lowest livestock population was related to Jiroft and Ravar, respectively. Jiroft and Kerman regions were contained the highest species richness of agronomical (20 and 22 species, respectively) and horticultural (34 and 31 species, respectively) productions.

40|$|In France, as in {{many other}} countries, the gap between farmer’s reality and citizen’s {{expectations}} is increasing. As citizens and consumers are more and more concerned with livestock farm evolutions, decreasing this gap is of importance, and this should start at school level. However, information on feelings and knowledge of young people about <b>livestock</b> <b>productions</b> are scarce. Surveys and analysis were then performed by 32 master’s level students from Agrocampus-Ouest. They conducted their work from 13 th to 24 th January 2014, to collect such informations. A closed-questionnaire was full-¿ lled by French secondary school pupils (SSP) who will get their ‘baccalauréat’ (GCE A-levels) in June 2014. SSP were selected since they are soon becoming adult consumers and citizens (around 18 years of age). A total of 1, 083 SSP from 28 different general (77 %), farming (21 %) and technical (7 %) high-schools, located almost everywhere in France, were inquired. 46 % of them lived in rural area, and 78 % of them visited at least once a livestock farm (dairy or beef cattle, mainly). Knowledge on livestock originated from media (25 %), family or neighbourhood (23 %) or school (18 %). Their opinion about livestock farming was good (25 %) or neutral (45 %). Two third of SSP estimated that faming is a good job. Regarding animal well-fare, they considered that broilers conditions are the worst (35 %), whereas 38 % of SSP thought that horses had the best living conditions. According to them, livestock has a negative effect on water (72 %) and air (57 %) quality, but a positive impact on tourism (38 %) and landscape (37 %). For them, eating meat is important and has to be regular (94 %).

25|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> {{is by far}} {{the biggest}} cause of land use, as it {{accounts}} for 30% of the global land surface.

Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity.

30|$|The {{decrease}} in <b>production</b> of some <b>livestock</b> animals {{was responsible for}} the reduced VWC in 2010. Camel production was decreased by 25 % since 2006 and the corresponding VWC was reduced by 26.8 %. Production of cow was increased by 6.0 % and the related VWC was increased by 6.3 %. Production of dairy cow and VWC was increased by 48.5 and 50.4 %, respectively. During the same period, VWC for sheep, goat, poultry, and egg were changed by − 36.3, − 54.6, − 12.4, and + 26.7 %, respectively, which were reflecting the changes in their productions (Table  1). The changes in <b>livestock</b> <b>productions</b> showed minimal variation with respect to the changes in VWC, indicating that significant technological improvements might have not been taken place during this period. However, it is to be noted that the temporal changes in farming practices were not considered in this study. The five regions (Riyadh, Eastern region, Qaseem, Hail, and Makkah) consumed 83.6 – 84.6 % of total VWC during 2006 – 2010. In Riyadh, Eastern region, Qaseem, and Makkah, VWC were decreased by 8.8, 15.7, 24.3, and 29.5 %, respectively, during this period. In Madinah and Al-Baha, VWC were increased from 2006 to 2010. In Madinah, camel and egg productions were increased, while in Al-Baha, camel, and cow productions were increased.
