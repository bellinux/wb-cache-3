5000|$|By {{comparing}} the depth in Earth at which particular minerals crystallize and the elevation {{at which they}} were sampled, the age of minerals {{can be used to}} determine the rate which the strain zone moved material vertically. Various dating methods on specific fluid inclusions and minerals were used in order to provide chronological data of the exhumation rate of rocks in the area. The age dates were used to reconstruct the history of exhumation and thermal regimes by {{comparing the}}m to pressure and temperature crystallization boundaries of the minerals. Uranium-thorium and uranium-helium [...] cooling ages of samples of apatite indicate the timing of 70 °C cooling. Higher closure temperatures were dated using Argon-Argon methods for biotite samples (300 °C) [...] and zircon fission-track (230 °C - 250 °C) methods. By analyzing the ages of minerals with various closure temperatures, researchers can infer the speed at which they moved through the isotherms. When the difference between the age of a mineral that cooled at a high temperature and one that cooled at a low temperature are relatively similar, then exhumation is inferred to be rapid. The geothermobarometry is obtained using garnet-biotite plagioclase in order to constrain higher pressure metamorphic regimes. Shallower exhumation rates (<b>low-temperature</b> <b>cooling</b> ages) alone can not realistically be used to describe tectonic aneurysms as deep isothermal gradient changes may not significantly affect shallower depths. Furthermore, shallow <b>low-temperature</b> <b>cooling</b> can be more largely related to erosion dominated exposure rather than tectonic driven uplift. Sample ages from minerals with higher cooling temperatures signify exhumation of deeper material which is the modeled function of a tectonic aneurysm.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{use of an}} {{absorption}} {{refrigeration system}} is a promising way to utilize waste heat from industrial processes. Ammonia–water absorption refrigeration system is commonly used for freezing applications with temperatures lower than 0 °C. When the refrigeration temperature is lower than - 30 °C, the performance dramatically decreases. We proposed a new absorption–compression refrigeration system to produce cooling energy at - 30 °C to - 55 °C. The proposed system comprised three subsystems, namely, a power generation subsystem using an ammonia–water mixture as the working fluid, an ammonia–water absorption refrigeration subsystem, and a CO 2 compression refrigeration subsystem. The system utilized the heat source in a cascade manner. The power subsystem converted the high-temperature portion of heat into power to drive the CO 2 compression refrigeration subsystem, thereby resulting in the generation of <b>low-temperature</b> <b>cooling</b> energy. The low-temperature portion of heat is converted into cooling energy to offer the heat sink of the CO 2 compression refrigeration subsystem. A simulation study was conducted, and {{results showed that the}} coefficient of performance of the proposed system was 0. 277, which was approximately 50 % higher than that of a conventional two-stage absorption refrigeration system.

The cooling rate indicator {{is based on}} the relationship between the size of the island phase in the cloudy zone, which abuts the outer taenite rim (clear taenite I), and the cooling rate of the host meteorite as obtained by conventional metallographic techniques. The size of the island phase was measured by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in 26 meteorites and decreases from 470 nm to 17 nm, while the cooling rate of the host meteorite increases from 0. 5 K/Ma to 325 K/Ma.

40|$|We {{present results}} from {{two-dimensional}} numerical simulations {{of the interactions}} between magnetized shocks and radiative clouds. Our primary goal is to characterize the dynamical evolution of the shocked clouds. We perform runs in both the strong and weak magnetic field limits and consider three different field orientations. For the geometries considered, we generally find that magnetic fields external to, but concentrated near, {{the surface of the}} cloud suppress the growth of destructive hydrodynamic instabilities. External fields also increase the compression of the cloud by effectively acting as a confinement mechanism driven by the interstellar flow and local field stretching. This can have a dramatic effect on both the efficiency of radiative cooling, which tends to increase with increasing magnetic field strength, and on the size and distribution of condensed cooled fragments. In contrast, fields acting predominately internally to the cloud tend to resist compression, thereby inhibiting cooling.

In the compression stage, electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are strongly {{dependent on the}} internal stress related to stress-controlled regions and to closure domains associated with defects. The contribution of internal stress to the low-temperature {{magnetic properties}} of magnetite was tested using annealed and unannealed multi-domain (MD) magnetites. During <b>low-temperature</b> <b>cooling,</b> a room temperature-induced saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) increased abruptly at the Verwey transition (Tv 122 K). In particular, the absolute intensity jump (?VJ, defined as the jump in SIRM at Tv upon cooling) resulted from the high-coercivity fraction of MD grains. We observe that annealing significantly reduces internal stress and thus decreases the average microcoercivity. Comparison of the alternating field (AF) demagnetization spectra of ?VJ both for annealed and unannealed magnetites directly links ?VJ to the internal stress. It is likely that removal of the closure domain associated with stress-controlled regions was dominant when the peak AF was less than the average micromagnetic coercivity hc, resulting in a net increase of ?VJ with increasing AF. However, when the AF exceeded the hc threshold, ?VJ decreased because the stress-controlled regions were demagnetized.

40|$|If a rock is {{to retain}} a geologically {{meaningful}} magnetic record of its history, {{it is essential that}} it contains magnetic minerals which are capable of carrying stable magnetic remanence. Of the natural occurring magnetic minerals, magnetite is the most important because of its abundance and strong magnetic signature. The stability, i. e., the resistance to demagnetisation or reorientation, of magnetic remanence is related to grain size; in smaller grains the magnetic moments align to have single domain (SD) structures, in larger grains complex magnetic patterns are formed (multidomain (MD)). “Classical” domain theory predicts that SD remanence is stable, whilst MD remanence is not. However experimental evidence has shown that both SD and MD grains can have stable remanences. In this thesis the origin of stable MD remanence is examined. There are two opposing theories; one suggests that the stability is due to independent SD-like structures, the other postulates that the stability is due to metastable MD structure. A series of experiments were designed to examine the stability using a selection of characterised synthetic and natural samples. Low-stress hydrothermal recrystallised samples where grown for this study. For the first time, the stability of thermoremanence induced in hydrothermal crystals to cooling was examined. The results agree with previous observations for crushed and natural magnetites, and support kinematic models. The behaviour of SIRM and thermoremanences in MD magnetite to <b>low-temperature</b> <b>cooling</b> to below the crystallographic Verwey transition at 120 - 124 K (T v) and the cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy isotropic point (T k) at 130 K was investigated. On cooling through T v, SIRM was observed to decrease and demagnetise, however thermoremanence was found to display a large increase in the magnetisation at T v, which was partially re- versible on warming. The size of the anomaly is shown to be dependent on the temperature at which the thermoremanence is acquired, internal stress and grain size. The anomaly is attributed to the large increase in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy which occurs on cooling through T v. It is postulated that low-temperature cycling demagnetisation is due to kinematic processes which occur on cooling between room temperature and T k. Characterisation of low-temperature treated remanence and partially alternating field demagnetised remanence, suggest that the stable remanence is multidomain. <b>Low-temperature</b> <b>cooling</b> of remanence in single sub-micron crystals was simulated using micromagnetic models. The models predict the observed anomaly for thermoremanence on cooling through T v, and also the relative behaviour of SIRM and thermoremanence.

40|$|For a given {{heat sink}} thermal {{resistance}} and ambient temperature, {{the temperature of}} an electronic device rises fairly linearly with increasing device heat flux. This relationship is especially problematic for defense electronics, where heat dissipation is projected to exceed 1000 W/cm 2 in the near future. Direct and indirect <b>low-temperature</b> refrigeration <b>cooling</b> facilitate appreciable reduction in the temperature of both coolant and device. This paper explores the benefits of cooling the device using direct and indirect refrigeration cooling systems. In the direct cooling system, a microchannel heat sink serves as an evaporator in a conventional vapor compression cycle using R 134 a as working fluid. In the indirect cooling system, HFE 7100 is used to cool the heat sink in a primary pumped liquid loop that rejects heat to a secondary refrigeration loop. Two drastically different flow behaviors are observed in these systems. Because of compressor performance constraints, mostly high void fraction two-phase patterns are encountered in the R 134 a system, dominated by saturated boiling. On the other hand, the indirect refrigeration cooling system facilitates highly subcooled boiling inside the heat sink. Both systems are shown to provide important cooling benefits, but the indirect cooling system is far more effective at dissipating high heat fluxes. Tests with this system yielded cooling heat fluxes as high as 840 W/cm 2 without incurring critical heat flux (CHF). Results from both systems are combined to construct an overall map of performance trends relative to mass velocity, subcooling, pressure, and surface tension. Extreme conditions of near-saturated flow, low mass velocity, and low pressure produce ldquomicrordquo behavior, where macrochannel flow pattern maps simply fail to apply, instabilities are prominent, and CHF is quite low. One the other hand, systems with high mass velocity, high subcooling, and high pressure are far more stable and y- - ield very high CHF values; two-phase flow in these systems follows the fluid flow and heat transfer behavior {{as well as the}} flow pattern maps of macrochannels. close...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods of}} fast cooling of {{intensive}} beams are described. The first one, coherent electron cooling, {{is based on}} enhancement of friction effect in the electron cooling method using a microwave instability of electron beam specially arranged in the cooling section. This method is effective for cooling of high-temperature circulating beams. The second one, self-cooling, is based on use of the intrabeam Coulomb scattering of particles during the adiabatic processes of beam acceleration and transverse compression. This method allows frequent decrease mittance of an intensive beam issued by a low-temperature source. 1. COHERENT ELECTRON COOLING Three methods of cooling of circulating heavy particle beams are known to-day: electron cooling, {{which is based on}} the use of a co-moving electron beam, straight or circulating, as in a thermostat El-sj; stochastic ooling based on the use of RF feedback system t''~J; laser cooling of ion beams t 61. Electron and laser cooling are efficient o <b>cool</b> <b>low-temperature</b> intensive beam; oppositely, stochas-tic cooling is effective to cool high-temperature, low-intensity beams. The co-herent electron cooling ET'SI described below combines principles and advantages of both electron and stochastic ooling. First, let us give the qualitative consideration i favor of the principle pos-sibility to increase the friction effect at Coulomb interaction.
