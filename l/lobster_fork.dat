60|$|Haywood {{walked down}} into the village. He was human, after all, and his {{prospective}} millions weighed upon him. Wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest. He {{was the product of}} private tutors. Even under his first hobby-horse had tan bark been strewn. He had been born with a gold spoon, <b>lobster</b> <b>fork</b> and fish-set in his mouth. For which I hope, later, to submit justification, I must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring.|$|E
50|$|A {{lobster pick}} or <b>lobster</b> <b>fork</b> is a long, narrow food utensil used to extract meat from joints, legs, claws, {{and other small}} parts of a lobster. Lobster picks are usually made of {{stainless}} steel and weigh {{as much as an}} average teaspoon. They have a long, textured cylindrical handle, ending in a crescent-shaped moderately sharp pick, or else a small two-tined fork. The other end may have a spoon for scooping out meat from inside the lobster. The lobster pick can also be used with other seafood, such as crab and crawfish.|$|E
50|$|The {{company did}} not prosper during the Great Depression. Unable {{to afford the}} {{mortgage}} on the Deep River location, the equipment was moved in 1933 to Messerschmidt's largely idle sawmill. One by one, the partners dropped out until only the Messerschmidts were left. They drew no salary during those years, as all the company's receipts went towards paying the dozen employees. On the edge of collapse, Deep River was saved by the National Silver Co., of New York City, which offered to buy all the nutcrackers and nut picks the company could make. (The company would later produce <b>lobster</b> <b>forks</b> as well.) Charles Messerschmidt, Jr., was placed in charge of converting the company's equipment to make these products.|$|R
5000|$|A crab fork (similar to, and {{sometimes}} synonymous with, a shrimp fork) {{is a very}} small fork for extracting flesh from a crab or <b>lobster.</b> Crab <b>forks</b> may be special-purpose food utensils decorated or constructed specifically for crabs and lobsters, or may simply be very small forks sold or used for the purpose.|$|R

40|$|Since 1988, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has {{monitored}} juvenile salmonid summer abundance, smolt abundance, adult spawner abundance, and stream habitat parameters in East Fork and Upper Mainstem Lobster Creeks of the Alsea watershed (Figure 1). The {{primary purpose}} of this monitoring is to study the affects that stream habitat modification has on the freshwater survival and abundance of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). This work has been partially funded by the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Salem District Office since 1996. The purpose of this report is to provide BLM with an update of ODFW’s sampling in East <b>Fork</b> <b>Lobster</b> Creek (East <b>Fork)</b> and Upper Mainstem Lobster Creek (Upper Mainstem) during the 2004 - 05 sampling season and to put these data in context with past data collected by ODFW. The watershed characteristics of the two study streams are shown in Table 1. In 1991, extensive instream habitat modification was conducted by the BLM in Upper Mainstem {{as part of a}} before-after-control-impact (BACI) study to determine the effect of habitat modification on survival rate and smolt abundance of juvenile salmonids.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Natural and gabion {{modified}} habitats containing {{coho salmon}} (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were observed and measured seasonally in East <b>Fork</b> <b>Lobster</b> Creek, a fifth order stream in western Oregon. Coho salmon usually inhabited backwater and secondary channel pools in winter. Large wood debris complexes and undercut banks {{were the primary}} sources of cover in winter. Beaver activity played {{a vital role in}} creating summer and winter habitat. Discharge rates seemed to have more influence than temperature in regulating coho winter hiding behavior. Lower than usual stream discharges of the 1984 - 85 winter allowed many fish to move out from cover, and {{a large portion of the}} coho were found more than 2 meters from cover. Coho were also not as dependent on cover during the low flows of spring and summer, and these low discharges allowed fish to inhabit less complex sites. Study sites with gabions maintained large numbers of fry throughout the spring and summer. Fish were attracted to the gabion-created plunge pools in low stream discharge months but not in high discharge months. During winter high discharges, gabion sites with backwater pool habitat held relatively larger numbers of fish than gabion sites without such habitat...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Stream-restoration {{projects}} are usually {{designed to improve}} habitat quality for fishes. These projects manipulate flow patterns, substrate distribution, and amount and placement of large woody debris. Consequently, they also affect the size and composition of the aquatic macroinvertebrate community. This research evaluates two types of fish habitat restoration: off-channel structures (alcoves) and in-channel structures (log weirs). I compared macroinvertebrate habitats and communities in natural and artificial alcoves in Upper and South <b>Fork</b> <b>Lobster</b> Creeks, Lane Co., and {{examined the effects of}} log weirs on in-channel habitat diversity, community composition, drift patterns, and fish consumption of macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from artificial and natural alcoves using hand pumps and D-nets. Within the channel, macroinvertebrates were collected from restored and unrestored reaches with a Hess sampler and using a stratified random sampling scheme. Forty-eight hour invertebrate drift samples were obtained at outlets of log-weir pools. Stomach contents were obtained from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and cutthroat trout (O. clarki) in restored reaches. Although natural alcoves differed from artificial in location within the floodplain, morphology, permanence, and degree of interaction with the stream channel, both alcovetypes provided similar habitats and contained similar macroinvertebrate communities. Average densities and diversity within the alcoves depended on habitat and time of year. Average densities were higher in artificial than in natural. Alcoves contained 29...|$|R
