40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic wave {{transmitted}} in {{the plate}} is called <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave.</b> The dispersion characteristic of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> {{makes it very}} complicated {{to be used in}} material Nondestructive Testing (NDT). In order to solve this problem, the analysis of frequency-dispersion characteristic of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> is made in this paper, and the dispersion curves of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> in specific plate are plotted, then the physical propagation model of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> is established. Under the analysis of FFT, the expressions of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> in specific plate are obtained. By combining with the dispersion characteristic of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave,</b> the changes of waveform in different propagation distances are simulated. With the deep researches of new algorithms, <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> will be applied in wider area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design requirements for embedded piezoelectric plate transducers suitable for generating efficient, uni-modal <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> signals in plate structures. Three piezoelectric materials are considered, modified lead titanate, lead zirconate titanate, and polyvinylidene difluoride, {{in conjunction with}} different 1 - 3 piezoelectric composite configurations. Finite element modelling was used to predict the various <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes generated by transducers embedded in a hard-set epoxy plate. Accordingly, the design requirements for successful generation of the zeroth order symmetric (So) <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode have been identified. It is shown that the transducer position and the orientation within the host structure, and the appropriate choice of the excitation frequency of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave,</b> relative to the structural resonances, are the crucial design parameters {{for the success of}} <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode selectivity. The amplitude of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> signal can be optimised by appropriate choice of the transducer lateral dimension. To validate the theoretical findings, transducers were embedded in both hard-set epoxy and uni-directional carbon fibre plates. Successful generation of the So mode is demonstrated by means of a scanning laser vibrometer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThin film plate {{acoustic}} resonators (FPAR) devices {{operating in}} the lowest order symmetric <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode (S 0), the first order asymmetric <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode (A 1) and the first order symmetric <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode (S 1), propagating in c-oriented aluminum nitride (AlN) membranes on Si were fabricated and tested for their sensitivities to pressure and mass. Systematic data on frequency shifts versus rigid mass (layer) thickness and ambient pressure variations are presented for the different <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> resonances. Further {{the ability to work}} in liquid environment of the S 0, A 1 and S 1 modes, respectively, has been tested in view of Bio-sensor applications...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s, the {{understanding}} and utilization of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> has advanced greatly, {{thanks to the}} rapid increase in the availability of computing power. Lamb's theoretical formulations have found substantial practical application, especially {{in the field of}} nondestructive testing.|$|E
50|$|Acousto-{{ultrasonic}} testing {{differs from}} ultrasonic testing {{in that it}} was conceived as a means of assessing damage (and other material attributes) distributed over substantial areas, rather than characterizing flaws individually. <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> are well suited to this concept, because they irradiate the whole plate thickness and propagate substantial distances with consistent patterns of motion.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{challenge}} and skill {{in the use}} of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> for ultrasonic testing is the generation of specific modes at specific frequencies that will propagate well and give clean return [...] "echoes". This requires careful control of the excitation. Techniques for this include the use of comb transducers, wedges, waves from liquid media and electro magnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT's).|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of traveling <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> in single layer of elastic metamaterial is investigated in this paper. We first categorized the traveling <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes inside an elastic metamaterial layer according to different combinations (positive or negative) of effective medium parameters. Then {{the impacts of}} the frequency dependence of effective parameters on dispersion characteristics of traveling <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> were studied. Distinct differences could be observed when comparing the traveling <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> along an elastic metamaterial layer with one inside the traditional elastic layer. We further examined in detail the traveling <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode supported in elastic metamaterial layer, when the effective P and S wave velocities were simultaneously imaginary.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation for ray tracing of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> utilizing a quantitative laser ultrasound visualization technique (QLUV) and two-dimentional wavefronts model. A novel technique called <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> tomography {{had been made}} for image restructuring of the defect region information of specimen, including position, size and shape. Previous researches developed existing algorithm to restructure image in <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> tomography. However these restructured algorithms are susceptible to refraction, strong scattering or abrupt change in the thickness and result inaccurate image reconstruction. This paper employs QLUV as experimental ray tracing method for <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> propagating along samples suffering strong refraction on beam distortions.

50|$|Rayleigh {{waves are}} {{a type of}} surface {{acoustic}} wave that travel along the surface of solids. They can be produced in materials in many ways, such as by a localized impact or by piezo-electric transduction, and are frequently used in non-destructive testing for detecting defects.

50|$|J. and H. Krautkrämer {{have pointed}} out that <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> can be {{conceived}} as a system of longitudinal and shear waves propagating at suitable angles across and along the plate. These waves reflect and mode-convert and combine to produce a sustained, coherent wave pattern. For this coherent wave pattern to be formed, the plate thickness has to be just right relative to the angles of propagation and wavelengths of the underlying longitudinal and shear waves; this requirement leads to the velocity dispersion relationships.|$|E

By acting optimized exciting condition, single mode <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> was generated in the plate with defect. S 0 mode and A 0 mode are the main modes researched in this paper. A 2 -D {{finite element model}} was built to analyze the reflection from the defect using S 0 mode <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> scattering approach. Complex wavelet transform was applied to extract envelope and arrival time of reflections from defect to evaluate the depth of defect.

In comparison with the results between theory and experiment, it's concluded that the finite element model is effective for predicting the <b>lamb</b> <b>wave</b> signal on UNDE...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the fundamental anti-symmetric <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> (A 0) with debondings at structural features is investigated using experimental data and finite element (FE) simulations. In this study explicit three-dimensional (3 D) FE simulations are employed, which allows {{the study of the}} scattered wave along different propagation directions. Good agreement between the FE predictions and the measurements are obtained that demonstrates that the 3 D FE scattering model is able to accurately predict the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> scattering characteristics at debondings. The study show that the characteristics of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> reflected from the debondings at the structure feature is much more complicated than that from defects in flat composite laminates. Parameter studies show that the backward and forward scattering coefficient of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> is a function of debonding size to wavelength ratio and debonding location. This shows the potential of employing <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> to identify the size and monitor the growth of the debondings. The findings of the study provide improved physical insights into the scattering phenomena, which are important to further advance damage detection techniques for complex structures made by composite laminates...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> {{propagate}} {{in solid}} plates. They are elastic waves whose particle motion {{lies in the}} plane that contains the direction of wave propagation and the plate normal (the direction perpendicular to the plate). In 1917, the English mathematician Horace Lamb published his classic analysis and description of acoustic waves of this type. Their properties {{turned out to be}} quite complex. An infinite medium supports just two wave modes traveling at unique velocities; but plates support two infinite sets of Lamb wave modes, whose velocities depend on the relationship between wavelength and plate thickness.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit {{velocity}} dispersion; that is, their {{velocity of}} propagation c depends on the frequency (or wavelength), {{as well as on}} the elastic constants and density of the material. This phenomenon is central to the study and understanding of wave behavior in plates. Physically, the key parameter is the ratio of plate thickness d to wavelength [...] This ratio determines the effective stiffness of the plate and hence the velocity of the wave. In technological applications, a more practical parameter readily derived from this is used, namely the product of thickness and frequency: ...|$|E
50|$|An {{arbitrary}} mechanical excitation {{applied to}} a plate will generate a multiplicity of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> carrying energy {{across a range of}} frequencies. Such is the case for the acoustic emission wave. In acoustic emission testing, the challenge is to recognize the multiple Lamb wave components in the received waveform and to interpret them in terms of source motion. This contrasts with the situation in ultrasonic testing, where the first challenge is to generate a single, well-controlled Lamb wave mode at a single frequency. But even in ultrasonic testing, mode conversion takes place when the generated Lamb wave interacts with flaws, so the interpretation of reflected signals compounded from multiple modes becomes a means of flaw characterization.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> based {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} technique {{is one of}} the promising techniques for detecting damage in structures. Among different types of guided waves, the fundamental anti-symmetric mode of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> (A 0) has attracted considerable attention for damage detection in plates due to its outstanding properties, such as sensitivity to small and different types of defects, which make it a powerful tool for damage detection. Cracks are one of the major culprits in metallic structures which affect their durability and serviceability. Once the crack appears on the structures, it can affect its serviceability. It is important to detect cracks at early stage to avoid any catastrophic failure of the structures. This paper presents a study on the capability of using the A 0 <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> in detecting crack-like defects in aluminium plates, in which the scattering behaviour of the A 0 <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> at through-thickness notches in aluminium plates is studied in detail. 3 D explicit finite element simulations are used to provide a comprehensive study on the scattering characteristics of the A 0 <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> at notches with different sizes and orientations. This study also considers different incident and scattered wave directions on the scattering characteristics. The results show that scattering characteristics of the A 0 <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> are sensitive to the size and orientation of notches. The findings of this study can improve the understanding of the capability of the A 0 <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> in detecting the crack-like defects and further advance damage detection techniques.

5000|$|In a {{stratified}} {{ocean of}} mean depth H, free waves propagate along coastal boundaries (and hence become {{trapped in the}} vicinity of the coast itself) in the form of internal Kelvin waves on a scale of about 30 km. These waves are called coastal Kelvin waves, and have propagation speeds of approximately 2 m/s in the ocean. Using the assumption that the cross-shore velocity v is zero at the coast, v = 0, one may solve a frequency relation for the phase speed of coastal Kelvin waves, which are among the class of waves called boundary waves, edge waves, trapped waves, or surface waves (similar to the <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves).</b> [...] The (linearised) primitive equations then become the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|Rayleigh waves, {{also called}} ground roll, are surface waves that travel as ripples with motions {{that are similar}} to those of waves on the surface of water (note, however, that the {{associated}} particle motion at shallow depths is retrograde, and that the restoring force in Rayleigh and in other seismic waves is elastic, not gravitational as for water waves). The existence of these waves was predicted by John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, in 1885. They are slower than body waves, roughly 90% of the velocity of S waves for typical homogeneous elastic media. In the layered medium (like the crust and upper mantle) the velocity of the Rayleigh waves depends on their frequency and wavelength. See also <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) is a {{transducer}} for non-contact sound {{generation and}} reception using electromagnetic mechanisms. EMAT is an ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) method {{which does not}} require contact or couplant, because the sound is directly generated within the material adjacent to the transducer. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMAT is particularly useful for automated inspection, and hot, cold, clean, or dry environments. EMAT is an ideal transducer to generate Shear Horizontal (SH) bulk wave mode, Surface Wave, <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> {{and all sorts of}} other guided-wave modes in metallic and/or ferromagnetic materials. As an emerging ultrasonic testing (UT) technique, EMAT can be used for thickness measurement, flaw detection, and material property characterization. After decades of research and development, EMAT has found its applications in many industries such as primary metal manufacturing and processing, automotive, railroad, pipeline, boiler and pressure vessel industries.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental {{asymmetric}} <b>lamb</b> <b>wave’s</b> {{interactions with}} rectangular notches in a steel plate are investigated in this paper.

50|$|The {{existence}} of Rayleigh waves was predicted in 1885 by Lord Rayleigh, after {{whom they were}} named. In isotropic solids these waves cause the surface particles to move in ellipses in planes normal {{to the surface and}} parallel to the direction of propagation - the major axis of the ellipse is vertical. At the surface and at shallow depths this motion is retrograde, that is the in-plane motion of a particle is counterclockwise when the wave travels from left to right. At greater depths the particle motion becomes prograde. In addition, the motion amplitude decays and the eccentricity changes as the depth into the material increases. The depth of significant displacement in the solid is approximately equal to the acoustic wavelength. Rayleigh waves are distinct from other types of surface or guided acoustic waves such as Love waves or <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves,</b> both being types of guided waves supported by a layer, or longitudinal and shear waves, that travel in the bulk.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{ultrasonic}} testing {{has been conducted}} with waves whose wavelength is very much shorter than the dimension of the part being inspected. In this high-frequency-regime, the ultrasonic inspector uses waves that approximate to the infinite-medium longitudinal and shear wave modes, zig-zagging to and from across {{the thickness of the}} plate. Although the lamb wave pioneers worked on nondestructive testing applications and drew attention to the theory, widespread use did not come about until the 1990s when computer programs for calculating dispersion curves and relating them to experimentally observable signals became much more widely available. These computational tools, along with a more widespread {{understanding of the nature of}} <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves,</b> made it possible to devise techniques for nondestructive testing using wavelengths that are comparable with or greater than the thickness of the plate. At these longer wavelengths the attenuation of the wave is less, so that flaws can be detected at greater distances.|$|E
5000|$|Lamb's {{characteristic}} equations {{indicate the}} existence of two entire families of sinusoidal wave modes in infinite plates of width [...] This stands {{in contrast with the}} situation in unbounded media where there are just two wave modes, the longitudinal wave and the transverse or shear wave. As in Rayleigh waves which propagate along single free surfaces, the particle motion in <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> is elliptical with its x and z components depending on the depth within the plate. In one family of modes, the motion is symmetrical about the midthickness plane. In the other family it is antisymmetric.The phenomenon of velocity dispersion leads to a rich variety of experimentally observable waveforms when acoustic waves propagate in plates. It is the group velocity cg, not the above-mentioned phase velocity c or cp, that determines the modulations seen in the observed waveform. The appearance of the waveforms depends critically on the frequency range selected for observation. The flexural and extensional modes are relatively easy to recognize and this has been advocated as a technique of nondestructive testing.|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric wafer (PW) {{transducers}} {{used for}} <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> actuation may get partially debonded from the host structure, {{because of their}} prolonged use, excessive voltage supply, or improper bonding onto the host structure. In this paper, higher harmonics induced in <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> because of such debonding of the PW actuator are studied both experimentally and through finite element simulation. In experiments, an artificial partial debond is created while bonding the actuator patch onto a pristine aluminium plate. <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> transduced by this actuator in the plate is {{picked up by a}} PW sensor which does not have any debonding. In FE simulation, Augmented Lagrangian algorithm is used to solve the contact problem at the breathing debond. Three higher harmonics are observed in the experiments and also in the FE simulation. To ensure that the generated higher harmonics correspond to <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave,</b> time-frequency analysis is carried out using Morlet wavelet transform, and the results are reported in the paper. Spectral damage index (SDI), obtained from spectral attributes of first four harmonics in experiments and simulation, is found to be decreasing with an increase in debonding area. This shows that actuator debonding introduces contact nonlinearity which induces higher harmonics in <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave.</b> Therefore, in damage detection using <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> based nonlinear techniques, the higher harmonics produced may get influenced by the false higher harmonics produced by actuator debonding, leading to incorrect results, if bonding of the actuator is not taken care of properly.
