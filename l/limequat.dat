50|$|<b>Limequats</b> {{are more}} cold hardy than limes but less cold-hardy than kumquats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Limequats</b> can {{be grown}} indoors or {{outdoors}} providing the temperature stays between 10°C to 30°C (50°F to 86°F). They are fairly small and can be planted in containers or pots. Plant <b>limequats</b> in a well drained fertile soil. Incorporate a good compost with some gravel or other drainage-aiding substance. Sand, despite popular opinion, is poor for aiding drainage. Adding mulch or compost {{on top of the}} soil can be very beneficial. Plant anytime of the year, watering it well. Water when nearly dry and add fertilizer occasionally. It can be pruned to keep a shape.|$|R
5000|$|Tavares (Citrus japonica 'Margarita' [...] Citrus aurantiifolia) - Key lime crossed with {{oval kumquat}} (though {{there is some}} {{speculation}} that it is actually a lemon/kumquat hybrid), fruit is larger and more elongated and color at maturity is more orange than other <b>limequats.</b> It was named after the city of Tavares, Florida.|$|R
5000|$|Eustis (Citrus japonica [...] Citrus aurantiifolia) - Key lime crossed with round kumquat, {{the most}} common <b>limequat.</b> It was named after the city of Eustis, Florida.|$|E
50|$|The <b>limequat</b> is a citrofortunella hybrid that is {{the result}} of a cross between the key lime and the kumquat, hybridized by Walter Tennyson Swingle in 1909.|$|E
50|$|Procimequat is a {{triploid}} {{citrus hybrid}} or transgeneric hybrid, {{in which the}} <b>Limequat</b> that itself is a cross between lime and a round kumquat, was backcrossed with a kumquat-like fruit, named Fortunella hindsii.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{small tree}} that grows into a {{contained}} bushy form. The leaves are characteristically citrus-like. The <b>limequat</b> produces an abundance of fruit even at a young age. The fruit is small, oval, greenish yellow and contains seeds or pips. It has a sweet tasting skin and a bitter sweet pulp that tastes similar to limes. The fruit can be eaten whole or the juice and rind {{can be used to}} flavor drinks and dishes. It has considerable amounts of vitamin C and is strongly acidic.|$|E

Mabb., is proposed, and the relationships of the Australian Citrineae to the genus Citrus L. are reassessed; Eremocitrus Swingle and Microcitrus Swingle are reunited with Citrus. A new species, C. gracilis Mabb. from the Northern Territory, is described and a conspectus of, and an identification key to, Australian native Citrus spp. presented; ‘Sydney Hybrid ’ is formally described and named C. × virgata Mabb.; a new combination, C. × floridana (J. Ingram & H. Moore) Mabb., {{for the name of}} the <b>limequat</b> and a new name, C. wintersii Mabb., for one of the Papuan endemic species formerly referred to Microcitrus are proposed. In tribe Clauseneae, notes on Glycosmis, Micromelum and Murraya, especially on typification of names, are presented. Rutaceae: Aurantioideae in Australia This paper is a prelude to the account of the subfamily Aurantioideae Horan. for Flora of Australia, in which full descriptions will be found, so those are not repeated here.
