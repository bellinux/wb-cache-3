5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these thoughts in 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed Burnout 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E

25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E

They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and [...] "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record is a good way of recognising a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he does and how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound.

Her promotion was officially announced on November 29, 2012, making Lee {{the first woman to}} direct a full-length animated motion picture produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. She primarily worked on story while Buck focused on animation.

[...] In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the Century 21 base at the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire for the commencement of filming on UFO, the Andersons' first full live-action series.|$|E

[...] Marina Sirtis appeared once more as Counselor Deanna Troi. She was positive about the film, saying [...] "we've been involved with this for eleven years, we've done 179 episodes, three movies, and there are still surprises.

Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' and I guess I don't either.

500|$|In a very {{positive}} review, Planet Game Boy magazine praised the multiplayer mode for its selection of competitive games, concluding: [...] "Perfect Dark {{is one of the}} biggest handheld games ever made, and for fans of the [...] version it's a vital purchase." [...] IGN also praised the multiplayer mode and extras, but remarked that [...] "there's no real strategy involved in these deathmatch games other than to find the other person and open fire until one dies and respawns elsewhere on the map". In a retrospective review, Jon Wahlgren of Nintendo Life felt that Rare [...] "did a great job on squeezing so many features and technical magic into the little cart, but by focusing so heavily on the tech they seem to have sacrificed a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would make it more fun to play". In 2012, GamesRadar ranked it the 47th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff praised Rare for its adaptation of the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E
500|$|Several {{alternative}} {{rock bands}} have cited My Bloody Valentine as an influence.

[...] The Smashing Pumpkins two successive studio albums, Siamese Dream (1993) and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), were also influenced by the band. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails praised Loveless musical diversity and production, Courtney Love cited the band as an influence on Hole's third album Celebrity Skin (1998) and the album has also been said {{to have made a}} considerable influence on Radiohead, particularly influencing the band's textured guitar sound. The Edge, guitarist of U2, cited Loveless as a major influence on the guitar sound on Achtung Baby (1991) and referred to My Bloody Valentine as [...] "head and shoulders above a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was going on at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will find a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit {{the spirit of the}} story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E
500|$|Their outward personas {{have also}} changed over time. In {{one of the}} duo's {{earliest}} magazine appearances, Homem-Christo stated in a Jockey Slut interview that, [...] "We don't want to be photographed. [...] We don't especially {{want to be in}} magazines. We have a responsibility." [...] Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French television arts program at the time, Daft Punk did not wish to speak on screen [...] "because it is dangerous." [...] During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear a variety of masks to hide their appearance. Bangalter noted that “the foundation for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we’re about artistically" [...] is the 1974 film Phantom of the Paradise, in which the title character prominently wears a mask. Daft Punk were also fans of the 1970s band Space, known for wearing space suits with helmets that hid the performers' appearance. In 1998, the Bangalter side project Stardust experimented with the band wearing reflective costumes in their music video. When not wearing disguises, Daft Punk occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Few official photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{prototype}} of the game had styling similar to a text-based role-playing game, with a large open world and many sub-quests. After moving towards [...] "multiple-choice text answers" [...] and a complicated gameplay system, the team decided to simplify the game and set the 2007 Independent Games Festival as a deadline to complete everything. With this time pressure, they forced themselves to cut out a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they felt was unneeded complexity, bringing the game to its core. After removing many of what they decided were extraneous elements they then added back in the cooking system, which they felt fit well {{with the rest of}} the game, as well as a map system. They then developed the game world and story in a roughly linear manner, creating basic designs of each region and then coming back to fill in details. They felt that this allowed them to create interesting ideas at the beginning of the game and then fill them out and resolve them at the end. One of these ideas was that of the [...] "verse"; Holowka realized partway through development that he had been using the same twelve-note sequence transposed into different keys throughout the music, and realized that the idea of a pervasive musical theme to the world fit with the story. The game also includes a level and animation editor; several mods have been made for the game.|$|E

5000|$|American avant-garde singer Bobby Conn {{wrote an}} album of anti-Bush songs with his 2004 {{collection}} The Homeland. Conn has stated that [...] "all the records that I've done are a critique <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on in contemporary America". Conn has admitted that while he actively protests {{what he sees as}} the evils of American society, he is not always at ease with such a label for himself.

500|$|Richard's death {{encouraged}} the furtherance of this later negative image by his Tudor successors {{due to the}} fact that it helped to legitimise Henry VII's seizure of the throne. The Richard III Society contends that this means that 'a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> people thought they knew about Richard III was pretty much propaganda and myth building.' The Tudor characterisation culminated in the famous fictional portrayal of him in Shakespeare's play Richard III as a physically deformed Machiavellian villain, albeit courageous and witty, cheerfully committing numerous murders in order to claw his way to power; Shakespeare's intention perhaps being to use Richard III as a vehicle for creating his own Marlowesque protagonist. [...] Rous himself, in his History of the Kings of England, written during Henry VII's reign, initiated the process. He reversed his earlier position, and now portrayed Richard as a freakish individual who was born with teeth and shoulder-length hair after having been in his mother's womb for two years. His body was stunted and distorted, with one shoulder higher than the other, and he was [...] "slight in body and weak in strength". Rous also attributes the murder of Henry VI to Richard, and claims that he poisoned his own wife. Jeremy Potter, a former Chair of the Richard III Society, claims that 'At the bar of history Richard III continues to be guilty because it is impossible to prove him innocent. The Tudors ride high in popular esteem.' ...|$|E

[...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back.

[...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he has to say is related {{to a lot of the}} shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E
