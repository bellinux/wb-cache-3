5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> due to sorties in which the French were able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart estimated that the Austrian <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The German fighter units heavily overclaimed RAF losses, with German pilots {{claiming}} 38 aircraft shot down, but actual RAF <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> 12 aircraft. RAF gunners claimed 12 German fighters, as well {{as another}} 12 severely damaged. Actual German <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> three destroyed plus four severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Although {{concrete}} casualty {{numbers are}} unavailable for either side, sources agree that Belgian-Congolese <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> relatively light, while several hundred Mahdist {{soldiers were killed}} in the two actions.|$|E
50|$|Return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} both {{standing}} wave ratio (SWR) and reflection coefficient (Γ). Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR. Return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure of how}} well devices or lines are matched. A match is good if the return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> high. A high return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> desirable and results in a lower insertion loss.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of Gisela, the Ju 88 was the only fighter {{available}} in the necessary numbers, with the required range, to reach eastern England and return. As a consequence, all German <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> Ju 88s. Below {{is a list of}} German losses during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} solvable had the league achieved economic stability but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively lost more than US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given {{the prestige of the}} franchise.|$|E
5|$|During 2014 Edinburgh Trams lost almost £450,000, {{though this}} was less than {{expected}} due to higher than predicted passenger numbers. In 2015 <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> down to £24,922.|$|E

5|$|French <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> minimal, {{with only}} four dead and 18 wounded. Between 18 and 22 Moroccans died, two-thirds {{of whom were}} civilians. The French forces withdrew, and both sides claimed victory.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> also high. Five of the {{fourteen}} Group commanders (Gruppenkommandeure) of II./JG 1 {{were killed in}} action while serving with II./JG 1. The notable <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> Oberleutnant Rohwer, and Hauptmanns Kijewski, Wickop, Seegatz and Dähne. During early 1944, prior to D-Day, II./JG 1 was led by one of its four experienced formation commanders. These were Hauptmann Segatz, Major Bär, and Oberleutnants von Kirchmayr and Eder. Yet the unit suffered heavy losses (along with most other wings in the West) of 48 pilots killed, 23 wounded, and 158 aircraft destroyed for 164 confirmed victories. Of these, 119 were USAAF four-engined bombers.|$|E
5|$|In Miami-Dade County, {{thousands}} of low-lying {{homes in the}} Homestead area were flooded. Overall, 857houses in the county were destroyed, while about 2,317others suffered damage. Significant agricultural <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> also reported. Donna was the first hurricane to affect Miami, Florida, since Hurricane King in October 1950.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to their 2014 counterpart, the 2015 Bears were more competitive in games; in 2014, {{three of the}} worst <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> by 48, 28 and 21 points, while six of the 2015 team's <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> by less than a touchdown, two of which ended in overtime. The Bears ended the season 5–3 in away games, but won only once at home, the worst home record in team history. Additionally, the Bears were swept at home by division opponents {{for the first time}} since the NFL realignment in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Baedeker raids {{failed to}} cause any {{reduction}} in the RAF's raids over Germany. Civilian <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> considerable, with 1,637 killed, 1,760 injured, and 50,000 homes destroyed or damaged. In comparison to The Blitz this was relatively minor; 30,000 civilians were killed and 50,000 injured {{by the end of}} that campaign. Luftwaffe <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> 40 bombers and 150 aircrew. Although the night fighters were not particularly successful, accounting for perhaps 22 aircraft from late April to the end of June, their shortcomings were on the way to being addressed.|$|E
5|$|JG 2′s {{mission was}} a disaster. I./JG 2 lost 18 Fw 190s and six more were damaged by ground fire and enemy aircraft. This {{represented}} 73% of their force. Of the 15 pilots missing, six would survive as POWs. II./JG 2 lost five Bf 109s and three were damaged a loss rate of 40%. Pilot <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> three missing, one dead and one wounded. III./JG 2 lost 19 Fw 190s and three were damaged, a loss rate of 79%. Nine pilots were killed, two were wounded and four were captured. JG 2 losses, according to another source, amounted to 40% of its force. Pilot <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> 24 killed or posted missing, 10 captured and four wounded. Another source asserts that pilot losses stood at 23 killed or missing.|$|E

50|$|Hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify {{the degree of}} hearing loss in each ear. Normal hearing thresholds {{are considered to be}} 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical. Mild hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound hearing <b>loss</b> thresholds <b>are</b> greater than 85 dB.|$|R
5|$|Operation Kutuzov {{reduced the}} Orel salient and inflicted {{substantial}} losses on the German military, {{paving the way}} for the liberation of Smolensk. Soviet <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> heavy, but were replaced. The offensive allowed the Soviets to seize the strategic initiative, which they retained {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The British Fourth Army took 13,000 prisoners {{while the}} French {{captured}} a further 3,000. Total German <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> {{estimated to be}} 30,000 on 8 August. The Fourth Army's casualties, British, Australian and Canadian infantry, were approximately 8,800, exclusive of tank and air losses and those of their French allies.|$|E
5|$|The MFA {{undertook}} a third restoration in 1943, when some yellowing of the glaze was repaired. Most recently, {{the painting was}} cleaned in 1980 when small amounts of grime were removed, some <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> filled in, and a light coat of varnish was applied.|$|E

50|$|Copper <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{the term}} often given to heat {{produced}} by electrical currents in the conductors of transformer windings, or other electrical devices. Copper <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> an undesirable transfer of energy, as <b>are</b> core <b>losses,</b> which result from induced currents in adjacent components. The term is applied {{regardless of whether}} the windings are made of copper or another conductor, such as aluminium. Hence the term winding <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> often preferred. The term load <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> closely related but not identical, since an unloaded transformer will have some winding loss.|$|R

5|$|The {{casualties}} at Fort Donelson were heavy, {{primarily because}} of the large Confederate surrender. Union <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> 2,691 (507 killed, 1,976 wounded, 208 captured/missing), Confederate 13,846 (327 killed, 1,127 wounded, 12,392 captured/missing).|$|E
5|$|According to one source, JG 4′s <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> 25 fighters of the 55 {{that took}} part. With 17 pilots killed or missing and seven captured, JG 4 {{suffered}} a 42% loss rate. A more recent source claims {{a total of}} 75 aircraft of JG 4 took part, with only 12 attacking ground targets. Two Ju 88 pathfinders were lost, as well as 26 fighters with six more damaged.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural <b>losses</b> <b>were</b> heavy. In Florida, {{the second-largest}} {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E

30|$|Pilehvari and Nyshadham (2002) have {{discussed}} that circulation <b>losses</b> can <b>be</b> classified into three distinct groups as seepage loss, when the <b>loss</b> rate <b>is</b> 1 – 10  bbl/h, partial loss, when the <b>loss</b> rate <b>is</b> 10 – 500  bbl/h, and complete loss, when the <b>loss</b> rate <b>is</b> more than 500  bbl/h. On the other hand, <b>losses</b> can <b>be</b> divided to minor and severe losses. Minor loss occurs when total <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> between 6 and 470 barrels or it takes less than 48  h {{to be treated}} by either increasing mud viscosity or increasing small amount of LCMs to the mud. Severe <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> experienced where <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> > 470 barrels or it takes > 48  h to control or cease the lost circulation by adding some bridging materials to the circulation system (Moazzeni and Nabaei 2010).|$|R
50|$|Data <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguished}} from data unavailability, which {{may arise from}} a network outage. Although the two have substantially similar consequences for users, data unavailability is temporary, while data <b>loss</b> may <b>be</b> permanent.
