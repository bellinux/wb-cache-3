As a result, the offered load has largely determined {{the performance of}} Frame Relay networks.

50|$|Figure 4 gives a basic example how frame {{pre-emption}} works. During {{the process}} of sending a best effort Ethernet frame, the MAC interrupts the frame transmission just {{before the start of}} the guard band. The partial frame is completed with a CRC and will be stored in the next switch to wait for the second part of the frame to arrive. After the high priority traffic in time slice 1 has passed and the cycle switches back to time slice 2, the interrupted frame transmission is resumed. Frame pre-emption always operates on a pure <b>link-by-link</b> basis and only fragments from one Ethernet switch to the next Ethernet switch, where the frame is reassembled. In contrast to fragmentation with the Internet Protocol (IP), no end-to-end fragmentation is supported.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though there}} is a {{commonality}} in their physical and link layers, Advanced Switching (AS) is more than merely an extension of PCI Express. The role of PCI Express is primarily as a chip-interconnect. In contrast, AS functions as a true system fabric interconnect encompassing domains that are vastly different and indeed more sophisticated than that of PCI Express’. In such a setup, congestion management is crucial for optimal utilization of the fabric bandwidth. Congestion control in network fabrics has generally been based on end-to-end and <b>link-by-link</b> schemes for controlling packet injection. Though seemingly adequate, these schemes may not be effective in handling “transient ” congestion arising from intermittent traffic − for transient congestion can indeed occur in fabrics operating well below their saturation limit. In such scenarios, a <b>link-by-link</b> scheme does not prevent congestion from spreading while an end-to-end scheme may result in under-utilization of the fabric bandwidth. This paper details a congestion control mechanism called Status Based Flow Control (SBFC) that has been incorporated into AS and is specifically targeted for alleviating the transition congestion problem. The SBFC mechanism exploits the source-based path routing used in AS. It enables upstream switch nodes to modify the transmission of packets based on the congestion status of links in a downstream switch. Simulation studies show that the SBFC mechanism indeed permits optimal usage of the fabric bandwidth during periods of transient congestion and effectively complements the traditional end-to-end and <b>link-by-link</b> schemes for congestion control. ...|$|E

Nodes are arranged in a line, and the first node wishes {{to communicate with the}} end node. When node i transmits, it is received at node j with a probability Pi,j. Several communication protocols are proposed and their performance studied using the mean and variance of the completion time as metrics. The protocols studied use end-to-end retransmission, end-to-end coding, and <b>link-by-link</b> retransmission with network coding both with and without opportunistic routing. Simulation and analytical results are presented. End-to-end coding significantly outperforms end-to-end retransmission on both metrics, and the <b>link-by-link</b> protocols outperform both. Opportunistic routing shows a mixed benefit over <b>link-by-link</b> protocols without it. When using opportunistic routing, the variance of the completion time is higher, and the mean is either similar or lower, depending on the channel conditions. When the loss probabilities are higher, opportunistic routing shows little benefit, whereas with a lower probability of packet loss, opportunistic routing shows a significant reduction in mean completion time. al Engineering and Computer Science. by Daniel Montgomery Whisman.

In RLNC, intermediate nodes buffer the packets received from upstream nodes. Using intra-session RLNC, intermediate nodes transmit coded packets by performing coding on the packets of various flows.

Using this analysis, we design a <b>link-by-link</b> feedback mechanism to acknowledge the packets of a particular flow. An intermediate node generates feedback packets for its upstream nodes.

40|$|Abstract — The {{capacity}} gain {{of network}} coding {{has been extensively}} studied in wired and wireless networks. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that network coding improves network reliability by reducing the number of packet retransmissions in lossy networks. However, the extent of the reliability benefit of network coding is not known. This paper quantifies the reliability gain of network coding for reliable multicasting in a wireless network where network coding is the most promising. We define the expected number of transmissions per packet as the performance metric for reliability and derive analytical expressions characterizing the performance of network coding. For a tree-based multicast, we derive expressions for the expected number of transmissions at the source of the multicast and inside the multicast tree. We also analyze the performance of error control mechanisms based on rateless codes and automatic repeat request (ARQ). We then use the analytical expressions to study the impact of multicast group size on the performance of different error control schemes. Our numerical results show that network coding significantly reduces the number of retransmissions in lossy networks compared to end-to-end ARQ scheme, however, rateless coding and <b>link-by-link</b> ARQ are able to achieve performance results comparable to that of network coding. Interestingly, <b>link-by-link</b> ARQ can outperform rateless coding depending on the network size and loss probability. We conjecture that network coding achieves a logarithmic reliability gain with respect to multicast group size compared to a simple ARQ scheme. I...|$|E
