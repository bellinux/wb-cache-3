5|$|In 1974, Ijaz {{launched}} a Distinguished Visitors Colloquium Series under the Physics department's sponsorship that brought world-renowned physicists to the Blacksburg campus {{for nearly a}} decade. Visiting scholars included Salam, Sheldon Glashow, and Nobel physics laureates Hans Bethe, Robert Hofstadter, Eugene Wigner and Richard Feynman. Noted Chinese physicist Luke W.

5|$|In 1963, Sands became deputy {{director}} for the construction and early operation of the Stanford <b>Linear</b> <b>Accelerator</b> Center (SLAC). When Richard Feynman was deciding {{whether or not to}} accept the 1965 Nobel Prize—due to a disdain for the added notoriety it might bring—Sands convinced Feynman that not accepting it would bring even more attention. Sands later joined the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) as a professor of physics, and served as its Vice Chancellor for science from 1969 to 1972. After retiring from UCSC in 1985, Sands worked as a consultant for SLAC and also as a consultant for Bay View Elementary School and Santa Cruz High School in Santa Cruz, California, developing computer systems and physics lab activities for students.|$|E

In parallel with the technological developments, the design of collimators used in <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> is also changing. The difference {{in the design of}} the collimators is directly related to the dose at the edge and outside of the field. Collimator designs become even more important in radiotherapy techniques where adjacent orthogonal fields are used. In this study, the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> used in radiation oncology and collimator designs were investigated by examining the existing literature on the advantages of these designs.

5|$|In 1973, Titterton {{stepped down}} as Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, and became an {{ordinary}} professor. Once again he spearheaded a proposal to upgrade the department's equipment, this time by using the tandem as an injector for a superconducting <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator.</b> Unable to secure funding in Australia, he managed to persuade the British Science Research Council to donate the required equipment to the ANU from facilities in England that were being closed down. It was installed and commissioned after his death. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1957, and was created a knight bachelor on 1 January 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the nuclear reactor, Szilard submitted patent applications for a <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> in 1928, and a cyclotron in 1929.

After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{is already}} used as {{radiation}} detection device. It is radiation hard {{and has a}} wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors {{by the lack of}} a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation {{to gain access to the}} active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford <b>Linear</b> <b>Accelerator</b> and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.|$|E

5|$|What Lawrence {{needed to}} develop the idea was capable {{graduate}} students to do the work. Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and M. Stanley Livingston, who he set to work on developing Widerøe's accelerator and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV. Livingston had a greater technical challenge, but when he applied 1,800V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-electron volt protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with Burton Richter, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the Stanford <b>Linear</b> <b>Accelerator</b> {{were collected in}} his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O'Neill considered his device {{to be capable of}} only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as professor emeritus until his death.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{was alarmed}} by the Soviet Union's first nuclear test in August 1949. The proper response, he concluded, was an all-out effort to build a bigger nuclear weapon: the {{hydrogen}} bomb. Lawrence proposed to use accelerators instead of nuclear reactors to produce the neutrons needed to create the tritium the bomb required, as well as plutonium, which was more difficult, as much higher energies would be required. He first proposed the construction of Mark I, a prototype $7 million, 25 MeV <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator,</b> codenamed Materials Test Accelerator (MTA). He was soon talking about a new, even larger MTA known as the Mark II, which could produce tritium or plutonium from depleted uranium-238. Serber and Segré attempted in vain to explain the technical problems that made it impractical, but Lawrence {{felt that they were}} being unpatriotic.|$|E
40|$|Quality {{assurance}} (QA) {{for medical}} <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> is indispensable for appropriate cancer treatment. Some international organizations and western advanced countries provide QA guidelines for <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators.</b> Currently, QA regulations for <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> in Korean hospitals specify {{a system in}} which each hospital stipulates its independent hospital-based protocols for QA procedures (HP_QAPs) and conducts QA based on these HP_QAPs while regulatory authorities verify whether items under these HP_QAPs have been performed. However, because this regulatory method cannot guarantee the quality of universal treatment, and QA items with tolerance criteria are different in many hospitals, the presentation of standardized QA items and tolerance criteria is essential. In this study, QA items in HP_QAPs from various hospitals and those presented by international organizations. Concordance rates between QA items for <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> that were presented by the aforementioned organizations and those currently being implemented in Korean hospitals were shown to exhibit a daily QA of 50 %, a weekly QA of 22 %, a monthly QA of 43 %, and an annual QA of 65 %, and the overall concordance rates of all QA items were approximately 48 %. In comparison between QA items being implemented in Korean hospitals and those being implemented in western advanced countries, concordance rates were shown to exhibit a daily QA of 50 %, a weekly QA of 33 %, a monthly QA of 60 %, and an annual QA of 67 %, and the overall concordance rate of all QA items were approximately 57 %. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the HP_QAPs currently implemented by Korean hospitals as QA standards for <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> used in radiation therapy do not meet international standards. To solve this problem, it is necessary to develop national standardized QA items and procedures for <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators.</b> Comment: 22 pages, 12 table...|$|R

5|$|Responsibility for the {{national}} laboratories passed to the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. That year, Lawrence asked for $15 million for his projects, which included a new <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> and a new gigaelectronvolt synchrotron which {{became known as the}} bevatron. The University of California's contract to run the Los Alamos laboratory was due to expire on July 1, 1948, and some board members wished to divest the university of the responsibility for running a site outside California. After some negotiation, the university agreed to extend the contract for what was now the Los Alamos National Laboratory for four more years, and to appoint Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer as its director in October 1945, as a professor. Soon after, Lawrence received all the funds he had requested.|$|E
