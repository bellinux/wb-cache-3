25|$|Cistern 16/17 (located at {{the centre}} of the far {{northern}} end of the Temple Mount). Despite the currently narrow entrances, this cistern (17 and 16 are the same cistern) is a large vaulted chamber, which Warren described as looking <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral at Cordoba (which was previously a mosque). Warren believed that it was almost certainly built for some other purpose, and was only adapted into a cistern at a later date; he suggested that it might have been part of a general vault supporting the northern side of the platform, in which case substantially more of the chamber exists than is used for a cistern.|$|E

The song was also performed by the singer on the American talk show The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Jeremy Allen from NME magazine included it on his list of [...] "10 Greatest Musical Moments" [...] on the show, commenting, [...] "with her fingers tinted like icicles and the background sonics just a sparse and glitchy soundscape with tinkles of warm xylophone <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> some ethereal cave, the singer takes {{a little bit of}} Iceland to the USA - via heaven - with her voice as commanding as it ever was". She also performed it across Europe following its release as a single, including The Jonathan Ross Show, Die Harald Schmidt Show, Johnny Vaughan Tonight, Top of the Pops, and Music Planet 2Nite.|$|E

500|$|The fifth episode, [...] "Kush", {{was filmed}} on a damaged {{fuselage}} set, {{which was built}} by production designer Bridget McGuire. The episode's cast disliked the episode the most {{because they had to}} act as if they were in freezing temperatures, where in fact it was around 40degrees Celsius. Because it was an expensive set, the producers wanted to reuse it. It was later redesigned to look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a submarine for [...] "Requiem". It was redressed again for [...] "Revelations". Although released third, [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] was filmed as the fourth episode, and was considered to be aired after [...] "Folding Man". However, Tapping felt strongly that it would make a great stand alone episode after [...] "Sanctuary for All", and the characters appeared more comfortable with each other in [...] "Folding Man". Swapping the episodes caused a major continuity issue, in which Ashley appears to show scratches on her neck from [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] in [...] "Folding Man", but not in between.|$|E

6000|$|The colonel {{looked at}} him long, and then said, [...] "Do you know, I should <b>like</b> to see <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> your head more than <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> your pockets.

6000|$|... 'My meagre staff {{consists}} {{of only two}} women and the boy; and they are away in the other wing.

So we will walk through it instead of staying out here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Piph-ph-ph--how warm it is, to be sure!' said Mr. Swancourt, as if {{his mind}} were a long {{distance}} from all he saw.

6000|$|WAKI [...] Strange, {{what seemed}} so very old a cave [...] Is all glittering-bright within, [...] Like {{the flicker of}} fire.

[...] Is it illusion, illusion? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{passed through}} a huge low ceiled chamber, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a fort, and into a smaller one where a bright wood-fire blazed in an old open fireplace, and from this into her own room. It had the same comfort as was {{manifested}} in the home-like outer court; moreover, it was warm and rich in soft hues.|$|E
6000|$|... "It matters {{above all}} things;--above all things, because as to them you {{may come to}} {{something}} <b>like</b> certainty. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> her heart you cannot know so much. The fact I take it is this--that you would wish to escape from this bondage." ...|$|R

60|$|When I had traversed {{all about}} it, with great interest, {{and had gone}} up to the topmost round of seats, and turning from the lovely {{panorama}} closed in by the distant Alps, {{looked down into the}} building, it seemed to lie before me <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a prodigious hat of plaited straw, with an enormously broad brim and a shallow crown; the plaits being represented by the four-and-forty rows of seats. The comparison is a homely and fantastic one, in sober remembrance and on paper, but it was irresistibly suggested at the moment, nevertheless.|$|E
60|$|To their joy {{they found}} it was a white light that now greeted them, for all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had made their eyes ache with their {{constantly}} shifting rays. The sides of the tunnel showed before them <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a long spy-glass, and the floor became more level. Jim hastened his lagging steps at this assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, {{and in a few}} moments more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves {{face to face with a}} new and charming country.|$|E
60|$|It {{is always}} lovely {{out here on}} the Big Half Moon in summer. When it is fine the harbour is blue and calm, with little winds and ripples purring over it, and the {{mainland}} shores look like long blue lands where fairies dwell. Away out over the bar, where the big ships go, it is always hazy and pearl-tinted, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the mussel shells. Claude says he is going to sail out there when he grows up. I would like to too, but Claude says I can't because I'm a girl. It is dreadfully inconvenient to be a girl at times.|$|E
50|$|The tuber has all {{the parts}} of a normal stem, {{including}} nodes and internodes. The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the stolon. The terminal bud is produced at the farthest point away from the stolon attachment and tubers thus show the same apical dominance as a normal stem. Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged parenchyma <b>like</b> cells. <b>The</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of the matter {{comprising}} the Solar System is crucial for understanding the mechanism that generates the Earth's geomagnetic field and the magnetic fields of other planets and satellites. The commonality in the Solar System of matter <b>like</b> that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth, together with common nuclear reactor operating conditions,forms the basis for generalizing the author's concept of nuclear geomagnetic field generation to planetary magnetic field generation by natural planetocentric nuclear fission reactors...|$|R
5000|$|Mr Mad: , would phone in, {{refer to}} Steve as [...] "Pal" [...] and would ask [...] "Guess where I'm livin' today?" [...] then proceed to name {{improbable}} locations (<b>like</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> mace <b>of</b> the House <b>of</b> Commons or <b>inside</b> Paul McCartney's guitar). Then {{would end the}} call with vocal whistles and beeps and his catchphrases were [...] "Ravin' mad, pal!" [...] and [...] "Check up from the neck up".|$|R
60|$|The sun {{had already}} sunk beneath {{the line of}} palm trees, and the great arch of the heaven above our head was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a huge shell, shimmering with dainty pinks and {{delicate}} iridescence. No one who has not lived in a land where the weight and heat of a napkin become intolerable upon the knees can imagine the blessed relief which the coolness of evening brings along with it. In this sweeter and purer air the Doctor and I walked round the little island, he pointing out the stores, and explaining the routine of his work.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed through}} several such passages, {{and came out}} at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in shape, but presenting, with its tiers of benches, {{something}} of {{the appearance of a}} scientific lecture-theatre. There were no rifles or pistols in this apartment, but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked like the bulbs of iron plants, or the eggs of iron birds. They were bombs, and the very room itself seemed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a bomb. Syme knocked his cigar ash off against the wall, and went in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean a {{young woman}} that he ain't likely to get. One of the biggest swells in England--a little un with a face <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a oyster-shell, that he met down at Wiltstoken, where I trained him to fight the Flying Dutchman. He went right off his {{training}} after he met her--wouldn't do anything I told him. I made so cock-sure that he'd be licked that I hedged every penny I had laid on him except twenty pound that I got a flat to bet agin him down at the fight after I had changed my mind. Curse that woman! I lost a hundred pound by her." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{being out}} there, doing bad things to us people, <b>like</b> we're <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> covered wagons and {{technology}} {{is out there}} firing arrows at us. We're making the technology {{and it is a}} manifestation of how we think. To the extent that we think egotistically and irrationally and paranoically and foolishly, then we have technology that will give us nuclear winters or cars that won't brake. But that's because people didn't design them right.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 Schaub and Callen {{released}} [...] "The Fighter and the Kid 3D". The twelve episode digital download series features sketch comedy pieces spawned {{from the}} duo's podcast personas.

The Fighter and the Kid 3D also ranked #3 most downloaded TV show overall on the iTunes charts, topping hit series such as Game of Thrones and Keeping {{up with the}} Kardashians.|$|R
5000|$|Short {{radio waves}} reflect from curves and corners {{in a way}} similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most {{reflective}} targets for short wavelengths have 90¬∞ angles between the reflective surfaces. A corner reflector consists of three flat surfaces meeting <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> corner <b>of</b> a box. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to [...] "odd" [...] looking stealth aircraft. These precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of diffraction, especially at longer wavelengths. Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as chaff, are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its radar cross section.|$|R
60|$|She {{dipped into}} the hollow {{straight}} down, as if {{going over the}} edge of the world. The engine-room toppled forward menacingly, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a tower nodding in an earthquake. An awful racket, of iron things falling, came from the stokehold. She hung on this appalling slant long enough for Beale to drop on his hands and knees and begin to crawl as if he meant to fly on all fours out of the engine-room, and for Mr. Rout to turn his head slowly, rigid, cavernous, with the lower jaw dropping. Jukes had shut his eyes, and his face in a moment became hopelessly blank and gentle, like the face of a blind man.|$|E
60|$|After {{the party}} was all over, quite late, I went with Watersell for a swim in his private pool. Most {{remarkable}} thing I ever saw. He said everybody has Roman baths and Pompei baths {{and he was going}} to go them one better, so he has an Egyptian bath, the pool itself <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> an ancient temple, long vista of great big green columns and a big idol at the end, and the pool all in green marble with lights underneath the water and among the columns, and the water itself just heat of air, so you can't tell where the water leaves off and the air above it begins, hardly, and feel as though you were swimming in air through a green twilight. Darndest sensation I ever felt, and the idol and columns sort of awe you.|$|E
6000|$|The hot drink {{helped us}} through the bleak hours that precede the dawn. The sky low by the horizon took on the {{delicate}} tints of pink and yellow <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> a rare shell. And higher, where it glowed with a pearly sheen, a small black cloud appeared, like a forgotten fragment of the night set in a border of dazzling gold. The beams of light skipped on the crests of waves. The eyes of men turned to the eastward. The sunlight flooded their weary faces. They were giving themselves up to fatigue {{as though they had}} done for ever with their work. On Singleton's black oilskin coat the dried salt glistened like hoar frost. He hung on by the wheel, with open and lifeless eyes. Captain Allistoun, unblinking, faced the rising sun. His lips stirred, opened {{for the first time in}} twenty-four hours, and with a fresh firm voice he cried, [...] "Wear ship!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sound {{were his}} slumbers, {{until they were}} {{suddenly}} dispelled by the iron tongue of the castle-bell, which sent its deep and sullen sounds wide over the bosom of the lake, and awakened the echoes of Bennarty, the hill which descends steeply on its southern bank. Roland started up, for this bell was always tolled at ten o'clock, as the signal for locking the castle gates, and placing the keys under the charge of the seneschal. He therefore hastened to the wicket by which the garden communicated with the building, and had the mortification, just as he reached it, to hear the bolt leave its sheath with a discordant crash, and enter the stone groove of the door-lintel. [...] "Hold, hold," [...] cried the page, [...] "and let me in ere you lock the wicket." [...] The voice of Dryfesdale replied from within, in his usual tone of embittered sullenness, [...] "The hour is passed, fair master--you <b>like</b> not <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> these walls--even make it a complete holiday, and spend the night {{as well as the}} day out of bounds." ...|$|R

60|$|Now {{look at this}} figure. It {{represents}} a section of a volcano; that is, one cut in half to show you <b>the</b> <b>inside.</b> A is <b>the</b> cone of cinders. B, the black line up through the middle, is the funnel, or crack, through which steam, ashes, lava, and everything else rises. C is the crater mouth. D D D, which looks broken, are the old rocks which the steam heaved up and burst before it could get out. And what are the black lines across, marked E E E? They are the streams of lava which have burrowed out, some covered up again in cinders, some lying bare in the open air, some still <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cone, bracing it together, holding it up.
