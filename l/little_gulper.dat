50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>gulper</b> is {{a common}} dogfish and lives near the bottom between 50 and 1,400 m. They are {{ovoviviparous}} with usually only one pup per litter. They eat bony fish and squid.|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>gulper</b> shark has no anal fin, two dorsal fins with spines, {{slightly}} humped {{back before}} the first dorsal fin, darker areas of coloration above gills and on dorsal fins, long free rear tips on pectoral fins, and a notched caudal fin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>gulper</b> shark {{lives in}} the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, the eastern Atlantic from Spain south to the Cape of Good Hope, the Mediterranean west of Sicily, the western Indian Ocean around Mozambique, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal around India, and possibly Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The broad {{teeth of}} this species differ between {{the upper and lower}} jaws, with the lower teeth being much larger. The teeth also differ between the male and female, with the male having much more erect, upright upper teeth, and upward-curving tips on the lowers. The dumb gulper shark is very similar in {{appearance}} to the closely related <b>little</b> <b>gulper</b> shark.|$|E
40|$|In chapter 1 I {{describe}} the population dynamics of an understudied species of gulper shark, Centrophorus uyato (common name, the <b>Little</b> <b>Gulper),</b> {{found in the}} Northern Gulf of Mexico. Sharks in the family Centrophoridae are mid-sized, demersal fish, with seven species identified in North American waters. These deepwater species {{can be difficult to}} study due to the extreme depths at which they occur. During four longlining cruises from 2012 - 2014, 593 sharks were landed, predominantly in the Mississippi Canyon off the Louisiana coast. Mean depth of capture was 290 m. Supplementing these data are catch records for C. uyato from a second series of cruises east of these stations. These data suggest the <b>Little</b> <b>Gulper</b> displays sexual dimorphism in its population size structure, similar to other elasmobranchs. Length frequency distributions, sex ratios by length, and length-weight curves were similar for both catch series, however females comprised a greater fraction of the catch from Mississippi Canyon stations compared to those further east. The high incidence of females in the region may indicate the use of Mississippi Canyon as a nursery for C. uyato, and the species 2 ̆ 7 tendency to sexually segregate at some point in its life history. A high number of large, pregnant females, along with observations of recently delivered animals, was noted at the Mississippi Canyon sites. <b>Little</b> <b>Gulper</b> sex ratios by length exhibited a characteristic 2 ̆ 2 notch 2 ̆ 2, indicative of a low female-to-male ratio at intermediate lengths, then a reversal to female dominance at the largest sizes captured. I modeled this curve under various assumptions of growth, mortality, and longevity for the species. The combination of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter, K, and the total instantaneous mortality rate, Z, that best fit the data suggests a population of slow growing, long-lived animals with a differentially higher growth rate for males. In chapter 2, I examine species associations among elasmobranchs in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in relation to depth of capture. From 2011 - 2014, 3609 sharks, comprising 31 species in 10 families, were landed on five long-lining cruises throughout the Northern Gulf and along the West Florida Shelf. Stations were grouped a priori according to depth into one of three categories, based on pre-existing divisions in the station data: 0 - 73 m (shallow), 110 - 146 m (intermediate), and 183 m or greater (deep). Using a non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (NP-MANOVA) and a pairwise test found I found significant differences in species composition among all three depth groupings. Gulf Smoothhound (Mustelus sinusmexicanus) and Atlantic Sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) contributed most to the differences, and also accounted for over 65...|$|E
