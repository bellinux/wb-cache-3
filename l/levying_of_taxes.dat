5|$|After his succession, Charles quarrelled {{with the}} Parliament of England, {{which sought to}} curb his royal prerogative. Charles {{believed}} in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the <b>levying</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed {{groups such as the}} English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.|$|E
25|$|The <b>levying</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> aims {{to raise}} revenue to fund {{governing}} and/or to alter prices {{in order to}} affect demand. States and their functional equivalents throughout history have used money provided by taxation to carry out many functions. Some of these include expenditures on economic infrastructure (roads, public transportation, sanitation, legal systems, public safety, education, health-care systems), military, scientific research, culture and the arts, public works, distribution, data collection and dissemination, public insurance, and the operation of government itself. A government's ability to raise taxes is called its fiscal capacity.|$|E

5000|$|Parker's {{later years}} were overshadowed by his bitter quarrel with the Lord Deputy, Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex. Initial {{relations}} between the two men seem to have been friendly enough : Parker entertained Sussex at Holmpatrick Abbey soon after the latter's arrival in Ireland, and they went together on an expedition against Shane O'Neill the next year. By 1562 however their quarrel was a major factor in Irish politics. Sussex's policies, particularly his <b>levying</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes,</b> had aroused much opposition in the Pale (i.e. the few counties under secure English rule); Parker {{emerged as one of the}} leaders of [...] "the gentlemen of the Pale" [...] and used his judicial authority to declare that Sussex had exceeded his legal powers. Sussex in turn accused Parker of disloyalty to the Queen and of being the author of a scurrilous book attacking him.|$|E

50|$|The Mongol {{invasion}} led to {{the total}} destruction of Qom by the armies of the Mongol generals, Jebe and S√ºbedei, in 621/1224 and left the city in ruins for at least twenty years, when the sources (Jovayni) tell of the <b>levying</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> Twenty years later, reconstruction and repair works, probably sponsored by some wealthy inhabitants, were being done on the mausoleums of Shia saints in the city, which contradict those sources, such as ·∏§amd-AllƒÅh Mostawfi, that describe Qom as a ruined and depopulated city throughout the Ilkhanid period. Besides, {{the fact that the}} Ilkhanid vizier ≈†ams-al-Din Jovayni took refuge in the FƒÅtimah bint M≈´sƒÅ sanctuary in 683/1284, indicates that the city must have experienced at least a modest comeback. The city walls were probably rebuilt and, moreover, four graves of saints are known to have been constructed between 720/1301 and 1365. Additionally some fine tiles are known from this period. Nothing is known about the irrigation systems of the town, but nearby a dam was built in the Ilkhanid period and the local administration must have functioned again, as the name of a judge shows. The agricultural situation is described as flourishing with a variety of cultivated plants and a good supply of water, and legends indicate the use of deposits of mineral resources. Information exists concerning taxes for the post-Mongolian period. Qom paid 40,000 dinars, but more remarkable is {{the fact that some of}} the surrounding rural districts paid as much as Qom or even more, which suggests that the whole administrative structure of districts had also changed.|$|E
