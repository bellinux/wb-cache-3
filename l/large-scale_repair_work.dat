40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of a test embankment on ultra-soft ground containing an approximately 50 -m-deep soft peat layer with N-values of 0 to 1 {{did not result in}} catastrophic slip failure during construction but did cause substantial deformation of the adjacent ground. In addition, large-scale settlement in excess of 11 m occurred in the approximately 3 years following embankment construction. Based on field observations, it became evident that this large settlement was attributable to delayed compression of the deep peat layer, which was assumed at the design stage not to be subject to settlement. Based on laboratory tests and site investigations, it was deduced that due to depositions under continuous artesian conditions, this peat layer had an extremely low consolidation yield stress and was in a state such that even a slight increase in stress would result in large-scale compression. After confirming the ability of the analysis code based on soilâ€“water coupled finite deformation theory, which included an elasto-plastic constitutive equation describing the behavior of the soil skeleton, to reproduce the observed ground behavior, the code was used to predict future settlement. These simulations were then used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} countermeasures aimed not only at improving stability during construction, but also at reducing residual settlement. The results of these analyses were applied in the planning of <b>large-scale</b> <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> performed on the test embankment. Also, when an embankment was subsequently constructed near the test embankment on similar ultra-soft ground, ground improvements were conducted prior to embankment construction as a countermeasure against residual settlement. In this paper, valuable field data related to these latter construction efforts is also presented...|$|E

40|$|The method {{involves}} sending accessory requirements defining data of {{log book}} (549) in a network. The accessory requirements defining data is received at accessory associated terminals (542, 544, 547). The bidirectional communication of network components is established with one another. The maintenance and <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> on vehicle is assigned. The feedback is provided after {{carrying out the}} maintenance and <b>repair</b> <b>work,</b> such that the assignment and feedback signal are performed by the network components. Independent claims are included for the following: (1) a computer program product for planning and controlling maintenance and <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> on vehicle of transport system; (2) a electronic, optical and/or magnetic storage medium storing instructions for planning and controlling maintenance and <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> on vehicle of transport system; (3) a terminal for attaching accessories of transport system; (4) a system for planning and controlling maintenance and <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> on vehicle of transport system; and (5) a communication interface for exchanging data between log book and terminal at vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aluminium {{is being}} {{increasingly}} used in all fields of industry. Especially {{if it is}} about the structures like car bodies or frames for transportation units aluminium replaces steel. The components used are regularly assembled by joining welds. Therefore there is an increasing need for reliable <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> on aluminium welds. <b>Repair</b> <b>work</b> to aluminium structures is conducted extremely successfully. This paper will present considerations associated with the repair of aluminium structures due to practical examples. A focus will be the investigation of finding reasons for appearance of failures. Repair strategies are developed to help to prevent problems associated with <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> and to help ensure consistently successful repairs...|$|R
