40|$|This report {{studies the}} {{behaviour}} of the Italian consumers of lighting fixtures, taking into consideration: lighting product characteristics, purchasing process, consumer's profile. Purchases of bulbs are also considered. The study {{is based on}} 420 telephone interviews with families who purchased lighting fixtures worth at least ITL 50, 000 over the previous 12 months. Purchases of lighting products are broken down by product type (floor lamps, table lamps, wall lights and brackets, chandeliers & multi arm fittings, flush fittings, bathroom mirror lights, spotlights projectors, built-in spotlights, outdoor and garden lights), style of lighting product (contemporary/modern/design or classical/traditional), material (glass/crystal, steel/aluminium/metal, bronze/brass, wood, plastic) and positioning {{of the source of}} light. The type of light source is also considered (traditional screw-type bulbs, halogen bulbs, fluorescent energy saving bulbs, fluorescent neon tubes). The average total spend on lighting appliances is also provided as well as spend on each type of lighting appliance. All the above mentioned data on purchases of lighting products and bulbs are broken down by socio-demographic characteristics of purchasers: geographic area, size of urban centre, sex, age and profession of head of family. The purchasing process is analysed according to: reasons for purchase, degree of recollection of names of lighting brands and retailers, criteria of choice in the purchase, distribution channels for lighting products, loyalty to the sales outlet, information channels about the lighting products (magazines, Internet), degree of customer satisfaction and reasons for any dissatisfaction. Purchases of lighting fixtures are broken down by product type and purchasing channel: design lighting retailer, traditional lighting retailer, furniture and lighting retailer, large furniture and <b>lighting</b> <b>chain,</b> retailers and wholesalers of electric materials, hypermarkets and department stores, DIY, other (direct sales, craft products, antiques, mail order, gift shops). The consumer's life-style is examined on the basis of socio-economic status, value models (choice of consumer goods, cultural consumption, leisure activities), decision-making process within the family nucleus, living conditions, type of furnishings. ...|$|E

40|$|Many non-muscle cells {{including}} chromaffin cells contain actin and myosin. The 20, 000 dalton <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> subunits of myosin can be phosphorylated by a Ca 2 + /calmodulin-dependent enzyme, myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase. In tissues {{other than}} striated muscle, <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphorylation {{is required for}} actin-induced myosin ATPase activity. The possibility that actin and myosin are involved in catecholamine secretion was investigated by determining whether increased phosphorylation {{in the presence of}} [γ- 32 P]ATP of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> by myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase enhances secretion from digitonin-treated chromaffin cells. In the absence of exogenous myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase, 1 μM Ca 2 + caused a 30 – 40 % enhancement of the phosphorylation of a 20 kDa protein. This protein was identified on 2 -dimensional gels as myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> by its comigration with purified myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain.</b> Purified myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase (400 μg/ml) in the presence of calmodulin (10 μM) caused little or no enhancement of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphorylation in the absence of Ca 2 + in digitonin-treated cells. In the presence of 1 μM Ca 2 +, myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase (400 μg/ml) caused an approximately two-fold increase in myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphorylation in digitonin-treated cells in 5 min. The phosphorylation required permeabilization of the cells by digitonin and occurred within the cells rather than in the medium. Myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase-induced phosphorylation of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> was maximal at 1 μM. Ca 2 +. Under identical conditions to those of the phosphorylation experiments, secretion was unaltered by myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase. The experiments indicate that the phosphorylation of myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> by myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase is not a limiting factor in secretion in digitonin-treated chromaffin cells and suggest that the activation of myosin is not directly involved in secretion from the cells.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients with AL amyloidosis to determine the frequency of abnormal free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> assay results at diagnosis and whether changes in the serum free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> assay predict outcome after therapy. Results: An abnormal free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> assay was found in 30 of 31 patients (97 %) at the time of diagnosis. In the subset of our patients who received treatment for AL amyloidosis, a > 50 % reduction of the pathological free <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> following treatment was shown to predict improved overall survival.

40|$|Amyloidoses are a {{group of}} {{disorders}} characterized by abnormal folding of proteins that impair organ function.

The cellular response to 11 urinary immunoglobulin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> of κ 1, λ 6, and λ 3 subtypes was evaluated. The localization of the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was monitored by conjugating them to Oregon Green 488 and performing live cell confocal microscopy. Sulfation of the proteoglycans was determined after elution over Q 1 -columns with a single-step salt gradient (1. 5 mol/L NaCl) via dimethylmethylene blue. <b>Light</b> <b>chains</b> were detected inside cells within 4 hours and demonstrated perinuclear localization. Over 80 % of the cells showed intracellular localization of the amyloid <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> The <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> induced sulfation of the secreted glycosaminoglycans, but the cell fraction possessed only minimal sulfation. Furthermore, the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> caused a translocation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan to the nucleus. The conformation and thermal stability of <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was altered when they were incubated {{in the presence of}} heparan sulfate and destabilization of the amyloid <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> was detected.

Previously, we demonstrated that amyloidogenic <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> (κ 1, λ 6, and λ 3 subtypes), internalized by cardiac fibroblasts, enhanced sulfation of secreted glycosaminoglycans. In this study, we investigated the inter-nalization and cellular trafficking of urinary immunoglobulin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> into cardiac fibroblasts. We demonstrate that these <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> {{have the ability to}} form annular rings in solution. Internalization was assessed by incubating cells in the presence of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> conjugated to Oregon Green 488 followed by monitoring with live cell confocal imaging. The rate of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> internalization was reduced by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin but not filipin. Amyloid <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> did co-localize with dextran-Texas Red. Once internalized, the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were detected in lysosomes and then secreted into the extracellular medium. The <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> detected in the cell lysate and medium possessed a lower hydrophobic species. Nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor, did not disperse aggregates. In addition, internalization and retention of the <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> proteins was altered {{in the presence of the}} proteasomal inhibitor MG 132.

40|$|Context: <b>Light</b> <b>chain</b> immunofluoresence (IF) in {{renal biopsy}} is {{routinely}} {{used in the}} diagnosis of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> deposition disease (LCDD), amyloidosis and cast nephropathy. <b>Light</b> <b>chain</b> predominance has also been reported in certain glomerulopathies like IgA nephropathy. However, pathogenesis of this pattern of deposition in various glomerulopathies is uncertain. Aim: To discuss the pathogenesis and utility of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> IF in nephropathies. Setting and Design: Retrospective study. Materials and Methods: The pattern of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> IF and <b>light</b> microscopic diagnosis in 306 cases of various nephropathies was reviewed. Direct IF was done in all these cases with commercial fluorescence (Fluoresciene Isothiocynate) conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-human antisera against IgM, IgG, IgA, C 3, C 1 q, kappa and lambda <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> Results: <b>Light</b> <b>chain</b> deposits were seen in 240 (78. 43 %) cases. In IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis and post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN), lambda positivity was more as compared to kappa. <b>Light</b> <b>chain</b> deposits in LCDD and membranous nephropathy were more kappa type. The IF pattern in amyloidosis was not consistent.

40|$|The glomerulopathy of {{monoclonal}} immunoglobulin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> deposition {{disease is}} a progressive disorder characterized by accumulation of monoclonal <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and matrix proteins in the mesangium. To define the role of <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in this process, cultured rat mesangial cells were exposed to different <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and human albumin. Two <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were purified from the urine of patients who had biopsy-proven <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> deposition disease. These proteins inhibited mesangial cell proliferation and increased production of matrix proteins, including type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. By immunocytochemistry and bioassay, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) production and activity increased when mesangial cells were exposed to these proteins. Furthermore, anti-TGF-beta antibody abolished the inhibition of cell proliferation and the increase of extracellular matrix protein production caused by these <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> These findings were not observed in mesangial cells exposed to human albumin and two other <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> previously characterized to be tubulopathic. We concluded that the glomerulopathic <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> increased TGF-beta, which inhibited mesangial cell proliferation and increased matrix protein production. Together with overexpression of TGF-beta in affected glomeruli of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> deposition disease, <b>light</b> chain-mediated stimulation of mesangial cells to produce TGF-beta {{appears to be a}} key pathological mechanism of this disease...|$|R

Although cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations decrease, myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> remains highly phosphorylated (50 %). In smooth muscle treated with carbachol alone or carbachol plus okadaic acid 32 P is incorporated into a single peptide on myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> which corresponds to the site phosphorylated by myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase. Treatment with okadaic acid alone does not result in myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphorylation or tension development. These results suggest that a cellular mechanism other than myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> phosphorylation can regulate contractile tension...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe myosin {{regulatory}} and essential <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> in skeletal muscle do {{not play a}} role as significant as in scallop or smooth muscle, however, there are some data suggesting that the skeletal myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and their N-terminal parts may have a modulatory function in the interaction of actin with myosin heads. In this paper four conformational states of the myosin head {{with respect to the}} regulatory <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> bound cation (magnesium or calcium) and phosphorylation are proposed. Communication between {{regulatory and}} essential <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and putative binding of the N-terminus of A 1 essential <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> to actin is discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe microtubule-associated {{proteins}} MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B {{are related}} but distinct multi-subunit protein complexes that consist of heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> The predominant forms of these complexes are homotypic, i. e. they {{consist of a}} MAP 1 A heavy chain associated with MAP 1 A <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> or a MAP 1 B heavy chain associated with MAP 1 B <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> respectively. In addition, MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B can exchange subunits and form heterotypic complexes consisting of a MAP 1 A heavy chain associated with MAP 1 B <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> which might {{play a role in}} a transition period of neuronal differentiation. Here we extend previous findings by confirming that heterotypic MAP 1 B heavy chain-MAP 1 A <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> complexes also exist in the developing murine brain. We show that these complexes form through interaction of homologous domains conserved in heavy and <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> of MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B. Likewise, conserved domains of the MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> account for formation of <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> heterodimers. By yeast 2 -hybrid analysis we located the <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> binding domain on the heavy chain to amino acids 211 – 508, thereby defining a new functional subdomain...|$|R
50|$|The {{ferritin}} {{protein is}} made up of heavy <b>chain</b> (H) and <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> (L) subunits. In neuroferritinopathy, the gene encoding the <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> is mutated. Several different mutation variations have led to diagnosis as neuroferritinopathy; all of these mutations occur in the <b>light</b> <b>chain.</b> A mutated <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> is believed to inhibit ferritin’s ability to effectively sequester and hold iron. Without control of iron, it is free to cause oxidative brain damage as described above.|$|R
40|$|Myosins and myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinases {{have been}} {{isolated}} from a cloned line of myoblasts (L 5 /A 10) as this cell line undergoes differentiation toward adult muscle. At least three myosin isozymes were obtained during this developmental process. Initially a nonmuscle type of myosin {{was found in}} the myoblasts. The molecular weights of the myoblast <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were 20 000 and 15 000. Myosin isolated from early myotubes had <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> with molecular weights of 20 000 and 19 500. Myosin isolated from myotubes which contained sarcomeres had <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> with molecular weights of 23 000, 18 500, and 16 000. This last myosin was similar in <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> complement to adult rat thigh muscle. Two forms of the myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase activity were detected: a calcium-independent kinase in the myoblasts and a calcium-dependent kinase in the myotubes with sarcomeres. No myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> kinase activity was detected in the early myotubes...|$|R

Carraro U, dalla Libera L, Catani C. Abstract The myosin <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> of slow muscles from different {{species have been}} examined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. While the myosin <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> 2 S of mammalian soleus muscles (rabbit, rat and guinea-pig) could not be distinguished from that of avian anterior latissimus dorsi (chicken and turkey), the 1 S <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> complement of myosins shows inter- and intraspecific differences. The 1 S <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> varies between birds and mammals. The 1 S <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> is absent in avian slow myosins and has an electrophoretic mobility peculiar to each mammalian species. Furthermore the relative amount of 1 S and 1 S <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> varies in different muscles of the same mammalian species and among species.
