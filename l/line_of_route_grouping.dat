50|$|ELRs {{differ from}} LORs (<b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>route),</b> {{not only in}} their use and format, but also in what they demarcate. <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> refer to {{strategic}} rail routes, and {{can be made up}} of several ELRs. For example, SBJ is the ELR for the line between Swanley and Ashford B junction. At Otford junction, the line diverges to Sevenoaks with an ELR <b>of</b> OJS. The <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> which covers Swanley to Sevenoaks is SO140. The LOR reference for any UK location {{can be found in the}} page heading of the Sectional Appendix line diagrams.|$|R
50|$|The Metro {{route to}} Newcastle Airport now follows part <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was a {{thirty miles}} ride, {{and it was}} evening before he reached Eckeron, having seen no enemy on his <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 2013 aerial images clearly {{show the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> {{and that the}} area {{to the west of}} the station site had been {{transformed}} by housing.|$|R
50|$|By 2013 aerial images clearly {{show the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> {{and that the}} area around the station site had been {{transformed}} by housing. The station site itself appeared to be a scrapyard.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific Highway {{continues}} on south from the M1 into New South Wales, while the Bruce Highway continues further north from the M1 up the Queensland coast. Both of these roads and the M1 itself are part <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> National Highway 1, although M1 signage {{is used for}} {{that part of the}} corridor.|$|R
60|$|The governor's {{inquiries}} {{were limited}} {{to the state of}} the country, the behavior of the tribesmen along the road, the state of the wells, and the amount of provisions obtainable along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 2013 the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> north <b>of</b> Pica {{and south}} of Oatlands station {{was easy to see}} on {{satellite}} imagery, its course through the station site was much fainter. No station buildings appeared to remain.|$|R
50|$|By 2013 aerial images clearly {{show the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> {{and that the}} area around the station site had been {{transformed}} by housing. The trackbed through the station site was used by the West Cumbria Cycle Network.|$|R
50|$|It was {{converted}} to use iron rails in 1815, and {{was connected to}} the new main line North British Railway from 1846, later becoming superseded by a branch <b>line</b> <b>of</b> that railway. A section <b>of</b> the original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> was still in railway use until 1968. Some <b>of</b> the <b>route</b> can be traced at the present day.|$|R
50|$|Straight <b>line</b> section <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 12 is {{the longest}} in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The stop {{is served}} by Tramlink route 3 from Wimbledon to New Addington via central Croydon. The tram route towards Croydon follows the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> the Woodside and South Croydon Railway through the Park Hill Tunnels, whilst that towards Addington follows a new <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> {{alongside}} Lloyd Park.|$|R
50|$|Since 2000 {{there have}} been at least two {{attempts}} to put the remaining line to use, but none of these come close {{to the site of the}} halt. As the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> has been severed by Llyn Celyn the prospects of revival must be very remote.|$|R
50|$|Since 2000 {{there have}} been at least two {{attempts}} to put the mothballed section <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> to use, but none of these came close to Frongoch. As the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> to the west has been severed by Llyn Celyn the prospects of revival must be very remote.|$|R
50|$|Raising the {{pressure}} further, Clark assigned U.S. II Corps which, fighting its {{way along the}} coast from the Gustav Line, had joined up with VI Corps on May 25 to attack around the right hand side of the Alban Hills and advance along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 6 to Rome.|$|R
50|$|Passenger operation, {{not part}} of Treffry's plan, came into action in 1876. The East Wheal Rose branch {{remained}} a mineral section until the Great Western Railway (GWR), which {{had taken over the}} CMR in 1896, built its line from Newquay to Perranporth and Chacewater, partly taking over the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway was {{a railway}} in Scotland {{connecting}} Stirling and Dunfermline. It was planned by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway as {{to get access}} to the mineral deposits on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> but also as a tactical measure to keep the rival Caledonian Railway out of Fife.|$|R
50|$|Between 2000 and 2011 {{there were}} at least two {{attempts}} to put the remaining line to use, but none of these aspired to come close {{to the site of the}} halt. As the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> to the east has been severed by Llyn Celyn the prospects of revival must be very remote.|$|R
5000|$|... 128 yards long, it was {{cut through}} an {{unstable}} hillside on a notoriously difficult <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b> What had initially been expected to be acceptably strong coal-bearing rock {{turned out to be}} wet shale. On beginning excavation a landslide occurred, the effects of which can still be seen further up the bank in Thatcher's Wood.|$|R
5000|$|Tibula (Greek: , Ptol.), was {{an ancient}} town of Sardinia, near the {{northern}} extremity of the island, {{which appears to}} have been the customary landing-place for travelers coming from Corsica; for which reason the Itineraries give no less than four <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> taking their departure from Tibula as a starting-point. (Itin. Ant. pp. 78-83.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Borderlands <b>Line</b> (part <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 22) from Wrexham to Bidston crosses at Shotton with {{interchange}} facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{residents}} of Monmouth urged a change <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> {{to run through}} Gloucester, Monmouth, Usk and Caerleon to reach Newport. In fact the proposed <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> east <b>of</b> Chepstow was rejected in Parliament, largely due to Admiralty objections to the bridge over the Severn, and the project was authorised west of Chepstow only in the 1845 session of Parliament; however {{there was to be}} a branch to Monmouth.|$|R
50|$|For {{this purpose}} the South West Main Line covers {{not only the}} whole <b>of</b> Network Rail's <b>Route</b> 3 - South West Main Line (with the {{exception}} of the Isle <b>of</b> Wight <b>line),</b> but also significant parts <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 4 - Wessex, specifically Basingstoke to Exeter and <b>routes</b> west <b>of</b> Eastleigh and Redbridge (both near Southampton), as well as the Basingstoke to Reading West <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 13 - Great Western Main Line.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after closure {{the track}} was lifted for about 100 {{yards from the}} {{junction}} at Goxhill, leaving the line through the station as a long siding which was sometimes used to store redundant wagons. Some time later the track was lifted through the station almost to Killingholme Admiralty Platform. In 2015 the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> was still plain to see.|$|R
60|$|The {{next evening}} the force encamped round Torgau, {{a very strong}} fortress, where a great store of {{provisions}} had been collected. Ample quarters {{were assigned to the}} marshal and his staff in the town. Here they halted for a day to allow the other armies, which had both farther to march, to keep abreast of them on their respective <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 2013 aerial images clearly {{show the}} <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> through the station site. The general <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the C&WJR {{trackbed}} through the station site {{was used by}} the West Cumbria Cycle Network. The general <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the Gilgarran Branch west of the station site {{was used by the}} A595, whereas its general line to Ullock Junction was fragmented; some was clear, some had been reused as minor or service roads and others had been returned to farmland.|$|R
50|$|There were evidently doubts cast on the {{practicality}} of Chapman's railway scheme, for {{the promoters}} brought in Josias Jessop {{to give an}} opinion. He reported on 4 March 1825, stating {{that it would be}} appropriate to increase the construction estimate by £40,000 (later rounded to £300,000); the railway was still considerably cheaper than the canal alternative. Jessop also recommended a variation in the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
60|$|We lingered {{about the}} wild {{habitation}} of the stonemason and his family, until sunset. Long shadows of rocks lay over the moor, the breeze had freshened and was already growing chill, when we set forth, at last, to trace {{our way back}} to Liskeard. It was too late now to think of proceeding on our journey, and sleeping at the next town on our <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the century a {{contemporary}} OS map shows that the final route from Rose Hill Junction had been laid. The original tramway running southsouthwest to John and Hodgson Pits had been abandoned from a short distance south of Foxpit House, with the new <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> continuing nearer the shoreline to [...] "Micklam Pit", [...] "Harrington Colliery" [...] and then swinging east to [...] "Bain's Siding".|$|R
5000|$|There were {{numerous}} small coal pits on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route,</b> {{and they were}} quick to construct their own tramway connections to the line; already in 1832 a contemporary account of a journey on the line described [...] "the rich flat valley through which we now rolled, veined with rail-ways, branching off, right and left, to the several coal-works - to Edmonstone, Newton, 'Sir John's' colliery, &c &c".|$|R
5000|$|Tulsa Transit {{operates}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> {{all over the}} city and into Jenks, Broken Arrow and Sand Springs, despite the setback of not running as a full-time bus fleet. Each set <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> are <b>grouped</b> by the first of three digits as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The Association makes {{available}} funding via {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>routes,</b> working <b>group</b> funding, conference bursaries, founders fund awards etc. Introduced in 2015, BISA also offers funding for Early Career Researchers’ projects with grants {{of up to}} £3,000.|$|R
2500|$|Between 2000 and 2011 {{there were}} at least two {{attempts}} to put part <b>of</b> the remaining <b>line</b> to use, but neither of these aspired to reach Trawsfynydd. As the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> to the south has been severed by Llyn Celyn the prospects of revival must be very remote. [...] In February 2012, there was a trial of a velorail (pedal powered train) on the line but this seems to have been short-lived.|$|R
50|$|Together with Route 7 - Great Eastern and Route 5 - West Anglia, the London, Tilbury and Southend <b>Line</b> section <b>of</b> the <b>route</b> was {{included}} in the Greater Anglia Route Utilisation Strategy. The North London <b>Lines</b> section <b>of</b> the <b>route</b> {{was included}} in the Cross London Route Utilisation Strategy.|$|R
25|$|The {{system has}} no triangles {{and only a}} single {{turnback}} loop. Therefore, all rolling stock must be bidirectional, with cabs at each end. There are also two non-switch 90-degree crossings, between the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> 1 and 21/22, on the crossing of Zonnestraat with Veldstraat as well as Korte Meers street. There are two crossings because the track <b>of</b> <b>route</b> 1 passes over streets in each direction. Along the Korte Meer the tram track goes toward the city center, the Korenmarkt stop, yet returns along the pedestrian/tram-only shopping area along the Veldstraat.|$|R
60|$|Something {{like what}} Jerusalem {{was to the}} pilgrim in the Holy Land, the Land's End is--comparing great things with small--to the tourist in Cornwall. It is the Ultima Thule where his {{progress}} stops--the shrine towards which his face has been set, {{from the first day}} when he started on his travels--the main vent, through which all the pent-up enthusiasm accumulated along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>route</b> is to burst its way out, in one long flow of admiration and delight.|$|R
