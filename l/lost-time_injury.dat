A class of bivariate zero-inflated Poisson autoregression models is presented to accommodate the zero-inflation and the inherent serial dependency between successive observations.

Parameter estimation is achieved via an EM algorithm, by maximizing an appropriate log-likelihood function to obtain residual maximum likelihood estimates. The proposed method is applied to analyze a bivariate series from an occupational health study, in which the zero-inflated injury count events are classified as either musculoskeletal or non-musculoskeletal in nature.

40|$|It {{is unknown}} {{if either of}} the two {{dominant}} regulatory approaches commonly employed in the mining industry to oversee occupational health and safety is superior in terms of reducing workplace injuries. In effort to answer this question, the following study analyzed annual <b>lost-time</b> <b>injury</b> (LTI) rates for bituminous coal mines in the United States (US) with respect to Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW), Australia from 1996 to 2003. Using the available data sources, changes in the occurrences of accidents and injuries were contrasted between each of these regions. The relationship between secular trends in injury rates and changes in the Australian regulatory structure from compliance-based to a risk-based approach was examined to see if evidence existed that the implementation of risk-based regulatory systems may be associated with substantive improvement in employee safety. Generalized estimating equations were constructed to analyze rates of change in incident rate ratios (IRR) of LTIs among coal mines. From 1996 to 2003, LTIs per 100, 000 miners declined 20 % in the US as compared with 78 % and 52 % in QLD and NSW, and the adjusted IRR for each region decreased by 11 %, 72 % and 44 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a literature review examining predictors of <b>lost-time</b> <b>injury,</b> illness and disability (IID) in the workplace, with a focus on obesity as a predictor, and to evaluate the relationship between obesity and losttime IID. The study objective was also to analyze workplace disability prevention and interventions aimed at encouraging a healthy lifestyle among employees and reducing obesity and IID, as well as to identify research gaps. The search was conducted in several major online databases. Articles included in the review were published in English in peer-reviewed journals between January 2003 and December 2014, and were found to be of good quality and of relevance to the topic. Each article was critically reviewed for inclusion in this study. Studies that focused on lost-time IID in the workplace were reviewed and summarized. Workers in overweight and obese categories are shown to be at a higher risk of workplace IID, are more likely to suffer from lost-time IID, and experience a slower recovery compared to workers with a healthy body mass index (BMI) score. Lost-time IID is costly to an employer and an employee; therefore, weight reduction may financially benefit both – workers and companies. It was found that some companies have focused on developing interventions that aid reduction of weight and the practice of active lifestyle among their employees.

During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal <b>lost-time</b> <b>injury</b> data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six roof bolting tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the roof bolting machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions. This research provides a data-driven foundation from which future research can be conducted for safety interventions to reduce the frequency and severity of incidences involving the roof bolter activities of bolting, handling of materials, and setting the TRS.

Companies that fall under the European Union SEVESO II Directive were analyzed separately. This study shows which indicators are used the most in the industry. It also shows that the respondents take safety very seriously; on average, they use 15 of the 37 safety indicators stated. This study also asks what the organizations do with these indicators in practice. Much of the collected information is not used as an indicator to improve organizations, even those that are considered to be of utmost importance for safety. The number of indicators used in organizations proved to be a reasonably good measure of discriminating between companies with a good or not-so-good personal safety performance, as measured by self-reported <b>lost-time</b> <b>injury</b> frequency (LTIF). It cannot be concluded from this that the use of more indicators leads to fewer accidents. It is more likely that good organizations gather and use more information to steer safety efforts, and that this leads to fewer personal accidents. What is also evident is that more-successful organizations make more use of specific types of indicators. Notably, neither the amount nor the nature of indicators collected can be related to process safety performance as measured by self-reported "loss of containment" events. This could be {{because of the lack of}} standardization with respect to what is measured and how it is standardized. At present, there are no set indicators that can be collected from organizations that can reliably discriminate between organizations with no or few or organizations with many process-related incidents. This study legitimizes the continued pursuit of suitable "leading indicators" for process safety. Copyright © 2014 Society of Petroleum Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Research on {{improving}} haulage truck safety, {{started by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines, is being continued by its successors. This paper reports {{the orientation of the}} renewed research efforts, beginning with an update on accident data analysis, the role of multiple causes in these accidents, and the search for practical methods for addressing the most important causes. Fatal haulage accidents most often involve loss of control or collisions caused by a variety of factors. <b>Lost-time</b> <b>injuries</b> most often involve sprains or strains to the back or multiple body areas, which can often be attributed to rough roads and the shocks of loading and unloading. Research to reduce these accidents includes improved warning systems, shock isolation for drivers, encouraging seatbelt usage, and general improvements to system and task design...|$|R
