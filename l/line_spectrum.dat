40|$|At {{the turn}} of the millennium, {{supercritical}} accretion disks (superdisks), where the mass-accretion rate highly exceeds the Eddington's one, are being resurrected under recent observational and theoretical progress. We examined the effects and properties of the self-irradiation, self-occultation, continuous and <b>line</b> <b>spectra</b> of superdisks, and found various distinct features of superdisks. Due to self-irradiation, the effective flux is enhanced by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 8 all over the disk, depending on the relative disk thickness. For a superdisk with finite thickness, the flux at infinity is enhanced in the poleward direction, while it is zero in the equatorial direction. The continuous spectra are generally flat (vS_v ～ V^ 0), as long as we see the disk pole-on. It, however, strongly depends on the inclination angle: for a larger inclination angle {{the central part of the}} disk is self-occulted and the flat nature of the continuum disappears. The <b>line</b> <b>spectra</b> are also greatly modified from those of the standard disk. In the non-relativistic standard model the <b>line</b> <b>spectra</b> have symmetrical double peaks. In the superdisk, however, the <b>line</b> <b>spectra</b> become asymmetric with strong blue peaks and weak red peaks, even for the non-relativistic case. This is due to the projection effect.

50|$|Light {{consists}} of electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. Therefore, when the elements or their compounds are heated either on a flame or by an electric arc they emit {{energy in the}} form of light. Analysis of this light, {{with the help of a}} spectroscope gives us a discontinuous spectrum. A spectroscope or a spectrometer is an instrument which is used for separating the components of light, which have different wavelengths. The spectrum appears in a series of lines called the <b>line</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This <b>line</b> <b>spectrum</b> is called an atomic spectrum when it originates from an atom in elemental form. Each element has a different atomic spectrum. The production of line spectra by the atoms of an element indicate that an atom can radiate only a certain amount of energy. This leads to the conclusion that bound electrons cannot have just any amount of energy but only a certain amount of energy.|$|E
