He failed to complete the course in his next two races, refusing at a fence in the Irish Gold Cup and falling at the third last when attempting to repeat his 1990 success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Later {{in the spring of}} 1991, Norton's Coin showed improved form. On 4 April in the Martell Cup at Aintree he recovered from a bad mistake at the second last to take the <b>lead</b> <b>final</b> fence but was overtaken on the run-in and beaten one and a half lengths by the Martin Pipe-trained Aquilifer. Two weeks later at Cheltenham he was matched against Pegwell Bay and the outstanding two-mile chaser Waterloo Boy as he contested the Silver Trophy Chase for a second time. McCourt settled the gelding in third place before taking the lead from Pegwell Bay at the last and held off the late challenge of Waterloo Boy to win by a head.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Biventricular pacing {{has been}} studied for the {{treatment}} of chronic heart failure (CHF). This technique seems to be able to improve symptoms and exercise tolerance, in patients with advanced CHF and prolonged QRS duration. OBJECTIVE: To present our experience with biventricular pacing in the management of severe CHF. METHODS: Between June 2000 and March 2001, 8 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block (LBBB) were selected for transvenous biventricular pacing system implantation. Mean age: 54. 12 +/- 16. 8 years; 5 males. The etiology was: idiopathic in 6 cases; operated congenital heart disease in 1, and ischemic in the other. Despite tailored treatment of CHF (with all patients taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), 7 patients remained in NYHA class III and 1 in IV. The quality of life score (assessed by the "Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire") was 62. 25 +/- 11. 29. Seven patients had sinus rhythm and only one chronic atrial fibrillation; mean PQ duration [...] 220 +/- 76. 37 ms; mean QRS duration [...] 168. 75 +/- 20. 31 ms. RESULTS: Implant failure, due to coronary sinus dissection and to excessive fluoroscopy time, with no coronary sinus catheterization, occurred in 2 cases (success rate: 75 %). Implant data: mean implant procedure duration: 122. 5 +/- 47. 82 min; mean fluoroscopy time: 35. 66 +/- 22. 06 min; QRS duration, after implant: 133. 33 +/- 15. 05 ms. Left ventricular <b>lead</b> <b>final</b> position: anterolateral in 2 patients and lateral in 4. Pacing thresholds: biventricular [...] 1. 36 +/- 0. 6 V; right ventricle [...] 0. 28 +/- 0. 04 V; right atrium [...] 0. 32 +/- 0. 08 V. Pacing impedance (left ventricle) : 1013. 33 +/- 147. 87 omega. Follow-up (1 st and 3 rd month) : one patient died, suddenly, 15 days after the procedure. In the others, an improvement in the quality of life index and functional class was found. These results were independent of echocardiography data. There {{were no significant differences in}} the pacing threshold and impedance during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced CHF and widened QRS benefited from biventricular stimulation, in which improvement on the clinical status was evident...|$|E
