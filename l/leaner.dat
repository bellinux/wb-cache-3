5|$|Some {{cultures}} revere the elk as {{a spiritual}} force. In parts of Asia, antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines. Elk are hunted as a game species. The meat is <b>leaner</b> and higher in protein than beef or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{years have}} seen changes as bigger <b>leaner</b> {{carcasses}} were demanded. This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate. Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer. Today the breed's original characteristics are now back in demand. This {{is due to the}} demand of high quality meat that requires economical production.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for <b>leaner</b> times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
50|$|The Hitchhiker's Guide to <b>Lean</b> is a {{book that}} covers <b>lean</b> {{manufacturing}} principles and thinking, <b>lean</b> leadership moves, the road map for <b>lean</b> transformation, common pitfalls of <b>lean</b> journeys, building an operating system, <b>lean</b> accounting, <b>lean</b> material management, <b>lean</b> in service organizations, and how individuals can apply <b>lean</b> to improve themselves. It concludes with interviews of <b>lean</b> practitioners at Chrysler, Ross Controls, DTE Energy, RSR Corporation, and Nemak.|$|R
50|$|If the tool, method, and/or {{technique}} {{will assist}} in fulfilling {{the aims of}} <b>lean</b> construction, it is considered {{a part of the}} toolkit available for use. A sampling of these tools includes: BIM (<b>Lean</b> Design), A3, process design (<b>Lean</b> Design), offsite fabrication and JIT (<b>Lean</b> Supply), value chain mapping (<b>Lean</b> Assembly), visual site (<b>Lean</b> Assembly); 5S (<b>Lean</b> Assembly), daily crew huddles (<b>Lean</b> Assembly).|$|R
30|$|Both, ISM-based <b>Lean</b> Model and UNIDO–ACMA Model {{were studied}} and {{compared}} to validate ISM-based <b>Lean</b> implementation model in this research. ISM-based <b>Lean</b> Model and UNIDO–ACMA Model approaches are almost similar. The ISM-based <b>Lean</b> implementation model is thus successfully validated through {{high degree of}} resemblance with UNIDO–ACMA Model. The significant contribution {{of this paper is}} the ISM Model for sustainable <b>Lean</b> implementation. The ISM-based <b>Lean</b> implementation structure offers greater understanding of implementation process at more microlevel as compared to UNIDO–ACMA Model. ISM Model focuses on successful implementation of <b>Lean</b> in a company where as UNIDO–ACMA seeks sustenance of <b>Lean</b> practices throughout the cluster. To implement <b>Lean</b> successfully, sustenance of <b>Lean</b> practices and perfection at each phase are absolutely essential. ISM-based <b>Lean</b> model advocates implementation of eight <b>Lean</b> practice bundles in sequential order. Application of ISM-based <b>Lean</b> implementation framework offers more clear picture.|$|R
5|$|Bolton were a {{successful}} cup {{side in the}} 1920s, winning the FA Cup three times. The club won the cup a fourth time in 1958. A <b>leaner</b> spell followed, reaching a nadir in 1987 when the club spent a season in the Fourth Division. The club regained top-flight status in 1995 after a 15-year absence. In a period of relative success, the club qualified for the UEFA Cup twice, reaching the last 32 in 2005–06 and the last 16 in 2007–08.|$|E
5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be <b>leaner</b> than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for <b>leaner</b> times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
40|$|Multiple <b>lean</b> metrics {{representing}} {{performance for}} {{various aspects of}} <b>lean</b> can be consolidated into one holistic measure for <b>lean,</b> called the <b>lean</b> index, {{of which there are}} two types. In this article it was established that the qualitative based <b>lean</b> index are subjective while the quantitative types lack scope. Subsequently, an appraisal is done on techniques for quantifying qualitative <b>lean</b> metrics so that the <b>lean</b> index is a hybrid of both, increasing the confidence in the information derived using the <b>lean</b> index. This ensures every detail of <b>lean</b> within a system is quantified, allowing daily tracking of <b>lean.</b> The techniques are demonstrated in a print packaging manufacturing case...|$|R
40|$|Exploring <b>Lean</b> {{manufacturing}} in a holistic manner, this book helps organizations to implement <b>Lean</b> principles successfully by offering theoretical, empirical and practical knowledge. It empirically demonstrates how a successful <b>Lean</b> initiative can improve organizational efficiency, and incorporates valuable primary research to substantiate findings. It argues that <b>Lean</b> principles {{need to be}} applied throughout the value chain {{in order to be}} successful, and suggests that these tools need to be aligned with culture and change management. Chapters examine issues including <b>Lean</b> cultures, impediments to <b>Lean,</b> <b>Lean</b> and performance measurement, and the impact of <b>Lean.</b> Viewing <b>Lean</b> as a never-ending journey, this book provides a valuable resource to practising <b>Lean</b> managers, and specialist researchers and students, and also offers an important reference for organizations embarking on their <b>Lean</b> voyage...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>lean</b> {{manufacturing}} provides {{the quality of}} the products in minimum cost and pro-vides customer satisfaction. Today, the competition level is very high and every industry tries to supply high quality products in nominal cost, so <b>lean</b> is the latest tool to achieve. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study different <b>lean</b> concepts under various <b>lean</b> strategies. This study helps to find out the status of <b>lean</b> manufacturing and its ways of implementation. Also in this paper, there is a discussion about <b>lean</b> manufacturing concept, <b>lean</b> waste, <b>lean</b> strategies, <b>lean</b> barriers and cycle of <b>lean</b> implementation.

5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, <b>leaner</b> muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E
5|$|The American Quarter Pony Association {{was begun}} in 1964 with {{the ideals of}} a {{registry}} which would register small horses and ponies of western type, whose breeding could be unknown but which were desirable for breeding purposes. Crossbred and purebred animals are eligible for registration, as are animals registered with other registries that meet the entry requirements. In 1975, the National Quarter Pony Association was begun to preserve the smaller, stockier type Quarter Horse when breeding trends were leaning towards taller, <b>leaner</b> animals. The AQPA now registers horses in several foreign countries, {{as well as all}} US states and Canadian provinces. The International Quarter Pony Association, begun in the 1970s, also registers Quarter Ponies, and is a worldwide association for ponies of Quarter Horse type. The Quarter Pony Association is an association affiliated with the International Quarter Pony Association, with the goal of promoting the Quarter Pony. In 2005, the IQPA and the QPA became one organization, with the IQPA acting as the registry and the QPA as the membership branch. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Quarter Ponies registered with all registering organizations. Registries say that registrations of adult animals outnumber those for foals every year, as many owners wait until the pony is old enough to be shown under saddle before registering them.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a <b>leaner,</b> more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lean</b> Manufacturing (LM) {{has been}} used in {{production}} processes to help manufacturing companies maintain competitive advantages for decades. However, with the increasingly fierce competition and pressure to sustain survival and long-term growth, enterprises cannot be satisfied with just improving the performance of a single process. Therefore, adoption of <b>lean</b> to the whole product development processes has become a necessity. There is evidence that <b>lean</b> thinking and some <b>lean</b> manufacturing tools are able to improve Product Development (PD) processes. Thus, terms of <b>Lean</b> Product Development (<b>Lean</b> PD) and <b>Lean</b> Product and Process Development (<b>Lean</b> PPD) are becoming popular in engineering fields. In this project, the research aimed to improve the tooling design situation in Chinese aerospace by implementing <b>lean</b> techniques to the design process. Tooling is an indispensible part of aircraft manufacturing and assembly. The quality and development time can influence aircraft quality and delivery time. However, there is little research about the <b>lean</b> techniques implementation based on aircraft tooling design characteristics and there are few <b>lean</b> frameworks for aircraft tooling design process. Therefore, this research will be conducted to fill this gap. The research comprised four phases. In the first phase, a comprehensive literature review about <b>lean</b> (<b>lean</b> thinking and <b>lean</b> manufacturing), <b>Lean</b> PD and <b>Lean</b> PPD, tooling design, <b>lean</b> models/frameworks and the relationship between <b>lean</b> and organisational culture was conducted. In the second phase, data and information from three Chinese aircraft manufacturing companies (Company A, B and C) and literature were collected and analysed, aiming to discover the current <b>lean</b> implementation status in tooling design process and find improvement opportunities. In the third stage, a <b>lean</b> framework for tooling design process was synthesised. Finally, the proposed framework was validated by academic and industry experts. Finally, the research can contribute to companies which need a <b>lean</b> transformation. Moreover, the <b>lean</b> framework also {{could be used as a}} reference for research in <b>lean</b> and tooling design field...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Since the {{introduction}} of <b>lean</b> manufacturing by Toyota and publication by Womack and Jones, organizations have realized sizeable gains through <b>lean</b> process improvement. The spread of <b>lean</b> practices across organizations and industries – from manufacturing to healthcare and construction – requires adjustments of the <b>lean</b> process and, {{in the case of}} construction engineering, modification of the traditional <b>lean</b> paradigm (stationary product versus the traditional mobile product). Consequently, success in <b>lean</b> manufacturing projects is closer to 20 %, and less than 2 % of manufacturing jobs in the United States are truly <b>lean.</b> Previous studies show that this unsatisfactory result occurs because mangers use inappropriate practices and rely solely on financial measures and consequent performance measures. This leads to an overall lack of synchronization between <b>lean</b> goals and actual practices. Given the challenges associated with adopting <b>lean</b> and synchronizing strategy beyond financial measures, this study attempts to resolve the confusion surrounding <b>lean</b> implementation by providing a systematic, clear description of effective and efficient routes through which organizations in different industries (or sectors) can adopt appropriate <b>lean</b> strategies. The following steps are taken to resolve the confusion in <b>lean</b> implementation: (a) a literature review of <b>lean</b> principles, <b>lean</b> practices, performance measures and performance measurement system; (b) an investigating of <b>lean</b> principles to integrate the literature with a survey of <b>lean</b> experts; (c) creation of a <b>lean</b> conceptual map that integrates <b>lean</b> principles with <b>lean</b> practices and performance measures; (d) incorporation of the <b>lean</b> balanced scorecard as a performance measurement system based on validated performance measures obtained through a survey of different manufacturing sectors in the United States; (e) identification of causal relationship between <b>lean</b> principles using Decision Making Trial Evaluation Laboratory method (DEMATEL), to construct an industry-specific strategy map with information from a survey of <b>lean</b> manufacturing companies in the United States (f) an investigating of the difference between the strategy maps constructed for each sector, and the cause and the central factors for each <b>lean</b> sector; and (g) a suggestion of an effective <b>lean</b> strategy for each sector. This thesis identifies a path for management to better invest resources in the aspects of <b>lean</b> implementation that are in acute need of improvement, by focusing on the most salient and central <b>lean</b> objectives. Such a tool could result in more effective and efficient <b>lean</b> implementation...|$|R
40|$|Language as a {{branding}} tool: <b>Lean</b> management, <b>Lean</b> metaphors, and {{the special}} <b>Lean</b> words Branding normally concerns products or corporations.

40|$|Abstract. Any company {{wishing to}} {{implement}} a <b>Lean</b> approach is faced with the following issue: should <b>Lean</b> be implemented sequentially or simultaneously? No consensus on the method for implementing <b>Lean</b> has been established. For this reason we sought {{to find out if}} there was an implementation order regarding <b>Lean</b> practices. 25 <b>Lean</b> experts were interviewed. We used a precedence method to identify the potential precedence for implementing certain <b>Lean</b> practices. We considered only the common responses from over 50 % of <b>Lean</b> experts interviewed. We showed that five precedence levels could exist. Understanding these levels should contribute {{to the creation of a}} deployment standard for <b>Lean,</b> as well as the successful implementation of <b>Lean</b> practices in companies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lean</b> {{construction}} borrows concepts from <b>lean</b> {{manufacturing and}} Toyota Production System {{in order to}} eliminate waste and add value to the construction process. Manufacturing processes utilizing <b>lean</b> principles have matured and developed {{a clear understanding of}} the relation between <b>lean</b> and safety. Because <b>lean</b> in construction is a relatively new phenomenon, there is not a completely developed understanding of how <b>lean</b> practices affect safety in construction. The <b>Lean</b> Construction Institute and the Academic Forum for <b>Lean</b> Construction has recently targeted this area for focused research. Since all safety incidents imply waste in time and resources, <b>lean</b> and safety have a common ground in the minimization of waste. This thesis researches the common ground of <b>lean</b> and safety in waste minimization and proposes a framework for understanding their relationship. This thesis also critically analyzes <b>lean</b> and safety principles to form an insight to the relationship between <b>lean</b> theories as well as practices and safety issues reported in construction literature. Further, literature also revealed the safety strategies and checklists that companies typically incorporate in their program. A comparative analysis of <b>lean</b> and safety is employed to understand their relations in a better way. This framework establishes that <b>lean</b> and safety have a strong relationship in the context of construction. Future work is needed to show that <b>lean</b> practices indeed strongly affect safety by reducing the number of incidents...|$|R

40|$|Building on Shah & Ward’s (2007 : 791) {{idea that}} <b>lean</b> {{production}} systems are organizational configurations and drawing upon {{recent developments in}} <b>lean</b> and behavioral operations literature, this study posits that: a) <b>lean</b> production systems as organizational configurations span the boundaries of <b>lean</b> operations practices and include a larger set of behavioral and structural variables; and b) diverse <b>lean</b> production systems as different combinations/bundles of variables might have differential performance effects or be equifinal. The study applies fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to explain such variation and investigate the determinants of successful implementation of <b>lean</b> production systems. It analyzes why industry normalized financial performance improvements of firms implementing <b>lean</b> production systems vary and explains this cross-firm variation as the effect of different combinations of: a) level of adoption of <b>lean</b> operations and high involvement human resource management practices; b) <b>lean</b> management behaviors; and c) <b>lean</b> infrastructure and strategic commitment to <b>lean</b> thinking. Complementing existing empirical work, the study shows that the adoption of <b>lean</b> operations and high involvement human resource practices does not represent a sufficient condition to sustainably improve financial performance.
