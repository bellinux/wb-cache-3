5000|$|On July 13, {{the reactor}} {{experienced}} {{a series of}} temperature and radiation fluctuations (known as [...] "excursions", because they were an unexpected departure from expected conditions). The power level rose from about 4 MW to about 14 MW (70 percent of full power) {{over a period of}} about two minutes. The excursion required the operators to manually override a malfunctioning automatic-control switch, and the reactor was shut down. The switch was repaired, and the reactor was slowly restarted. The following day, monitors again indicated elevated airborne radioactivity levels within the reactor building. The source was traced to two locations at the reactor core <b>loading</b> <b>face,</b> which were sealed; airborne radioactivity within the reactor building was reduced. The reactor was restarted, but the operators noted unusual behavior over the next few days. The reactor increased power faster than expected, and the temperature difference between the reactor bottom (where the sodium entered) and the reactor top (where the sodium exited) was unusually high. Radioactivity within the reactor also increased. The operators investigated, performing several exercises to understand and correct the reactor behavior.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{historical}} significance: The world's first {{nuclear power}} generated electricity {{was produced in}} September 1948 with the X-10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge National Labs, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where among other firsts, this first ever electricity generated by nuclear power occurred utilizing a Jensen #50 steam engine and generator. A miniature atomic power plant was operating and generating electricity on September 3, 1948 per records at ORNL.gov. The #50 was the largest model engine and generator made by Jensen Manufacturing Co of Jeannette, PA. That Jensen #50 and generator are still there in the Graphite Reactor building and still on the same shelf they were mounted on in 1948. That shelf with the engine {{is now part of}} a kiosk display in the visitor area in front of the <b>loading</b> <b>face</b> of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. While the power generated here was only about 3 volts, enough to light a flashlight bulb, it did occur in Oak Ridge in 1948 with a Jensen Steam Engine and generator. The makeshift boiling water reactor that these engineers built also became the test bed for the light water reactors used today.|$|E
40|$|When a {{blast wave}} strikes a finite target, {{diffraction}} {{of the blast}} wave around the free edge causes a rarefaction clearing wave to propagate along the <b>loaded</b> <b>face</b> and relieve the pressure acting at any point it passes over. For small targets, the time taken for this clearing wave to traverse the <b>loaded</b> <b>face</b> will be small {{in relation to the}} duration of loading. Previous studies have not shown what happens in the late-time stages of clearing relief, nor the mechanism by which the cleared reflected pressure decays to approach the incident pressure. Current design guidance assumes a series of interacting clearing waves propagate over the target face – this assumption is tested in this article by using numerical analysis to evaluate the blast pressure acting on small targets subjected to blast loads. It is shown that repeat propagations of the rarefaction waves do not occur and new model is proposed, based on an over-expanded region of air in front of the <b>loaded</b> <b>face</b> of the target.

The {{results show that the}} stress distributed in bondline near the interface was significantly affected by the adhesive thickness and the elastic modulus. When the thickness increased from 1 mm to 2 mm, the values of all the stress components increased evidently along the upper edge of the adhesive but decreased significantly along the lower edge near the <b>loading</b> <b>face.</b> When the elastic modulus of the adhesive was increased, all the stresses increased along either the upper or the lower edge.

The loading operation was performed for a fixed period of 3  min. The dynamic mesh technique in FLUENT was used to study the impact of truck motion on DPM distribution. The resultant DPM distributions are presented for the cases when the truck were driving upstream and downstream of the <b>loading</b> <b>face.</b> Interesting phenomena were revealed in the study including the piston effect, layering of DPM in the roof region, and backflow of diesel exhaust against ventilation. The results from the simulation {{can be used to}} determine if the areas inside the face area and straight entry exceed the current U.S. regulatory requirement for DPM concentration (> 160  µg/m 3). This research can guide the selection of DPM reduction strategies and improve the working practices for the underground miners.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of the intense loading produced by the detonation of a buried explosive is an extremely difficult task. Historically, high-fidelity measurement techniques have not been sufficiently robust to capture the extremely high pressures associated with such events, and researchers have relied on ‘global’ measurements such as the average loading acting over a particular area of interest. Recently, a large-scale experimental approach to the direct {{measurement of}} the spatial and temporal variation in loading resulting from an explosive event has been developed, which utilises Hopkinson pressure bars (HPBs) inserted through holes in a large target plate such that their faces lie flush with the <b>loaded</b> <b>face.</b> This article presents results from ten experiments conducted at 1 / 4 scale, using 17 HPBs to measure the spatial pressure distribution from explosives buried in dry Leighton Buzzard sand, a commonly available sand used in many geotechnical applications. Localised pressure measurements are {{used in conjunction with}} high speed video to provide a detailed examination of the physical processes occurring at the <b>loaded</b> <b>face,</b> as well allowing quantification of these effects. Example pressure–time and impulse–time traces are provided in full to allow researchers to use this data for validation of numerical modelling approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|The mine {{planning}} process converts resources into economically mineable reserves, focusing on value addition and risk reduction. Equipment selection is traditionally addressed {{late in the}} process and addresses production capacity, equipment matching and equipment allocation. The primary focus being to reduce the operating cost per unit of material handled. Mineral resource management is an integration of the key functions in the mining process. A focus on resource utilisation {{plays a key role in}} the management process and leads to the question whether lower operating costs always add value in the long term. It was determined that traditional equipment selection methods are not effective for all mineral deposits and might even be short sighted, destroying value over the long term. The mine {{planning process}} was adapted to allow for an early investigation into the potential for increased recovery. The effect of selectivity in the loading action is simulated in a 3 D environment over a range of bench heights. The results are analysed with a grade tonnage curve and the saleable product at each bench height is calculated, taking account of the required product qualities. The concept of financial materiality is applied to classify the resource as either a massive or selective deposit. A massive deposit support the traditional drive for bigger equipment and will benefit from lower operating costs. A selective deposit requires less focus on production capacity, equipment matching and allocation and more on resource recovery. In order to take advantage of the potential indicated in the evaluation, it is necessary to modify the traditional equipment selection techniques. A thorough understanding of the capabilities of the loading equipment is required in an attempt to match these abilities with the geometry of the ore deposit. The objective is to identify the equipment that will ensure the highest mining recovery at the lowest cost. This will be achieved when the loading equipment can attain a mining recovery smaller than the bench height it is mining or if the equipment can be applied economically on small bench heights. The most suitable equipment can only be determined at the hand of a total value chain costing analyses. This means that the production cost i. e. the cost to produce the final product must be evaluated and not the operating cost i. e. the cost to move a unit of material, as is often the case. The proposed mine planning approach and equipment selection technique was used on the Thabazimbi iron ore mine deposits. The results indicated that the NPV of the project could be increased dramatically. It was concluded that the ability to load selectively cannot be calculated mathematically. It is a judgment made on a thorough evaluation of the design and operating features of the shovel in conjunction with the ore body geometric parameters and the <b>loading</b> <b>face</b> conditions. The efficiency of the selected shovel can be manipulated through the application of different bench heights, and the optimum combination can only be determined through a total value chain costing analyses.

40|$|The {{flexural}} behaviour {{of three different}} hybrid fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) matrix composites, i. e. S 2 -glass/E-glass/epoxy, TR 50 S carbon/IM 7 carbon/epoxy, and E-glass/TR 50 S carbon/epoxy hybrid FRP composites, has been investigated. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to: (i) improve the flexural properties of the parent composite materials, i. e. E-glass/epoxy and TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy composites, through substitution of stronger fibres, i. e. S 2 -glass and IM 7 carbon fibres, for the fibres of the parent composite materials, and (ii) determine the optimum stacking configurations that produced the maximum increase in flexural properties of the resulting hybrid composites. In addition to these, two secondary objectives related to the preliminary investigation of determining the optimum stacking configurations have also been established. The two secondary objectives were to: (i) determine the optimum values of the processing parameters of the composites under investigation, and (ii) determine the compressive strength and compressive modulus of the parent materials. The investigation was carried out experimentally, thus data presented and analysed were obtained from laboratory work. Optimum values of five processing parameters, i. e. (i) the concentration of matrix precursor within the solvent solution utilised to wet the fibres, (ii) the compressive pressure applied during hotpress curing, (iii) the vacuum pressure of the atmosphere inside the curing chamber, (iv) the dwell time during hot-press curing, and (v) the holding temperature during hot-press curing, have been established. The criteria for determining the optimum values of these parameters were optimum fibre content, minimum void content, and optimum flexural properties. Compressive strength and compressive modulus of the parent composite materials have also been determined. Specimens were cut from flat composite plates using a diamond-tipped circular blade saw. The longitudinal edges of the specimens were carefully polished to remove any possible edge damage due to cutting. The composite plates were produced from preforms comprised of a number of glass fibre/epoxy prepregs, carbon fibre/epoxy prepregs or a combination of these. All the fabrication procedures were carried out using manual techniques. Whilst the compressive tests were conducted in accordance with the ASTM D 3410 - 03 standard, flexural tests were carried out according to Procedure A of the ASTM D 790 - 07 standard. Span-to depth ratios, S/d, of 16, 32, and 64 were selected for flexural testing {{in order to determine the}} minimum value of S/d required to ensure flexural failure rather than shear failure. Fibre and void contents were evaluated from optical micrograph images of the slices perpendicular to the fibre direction of the samples. It was concluded that the optimum values of the five processing parameters under investigations were: (i) epoxy concentration, C[subscript]e ~ 50 wt%, (ii) compressive pressure, p[subscript]c ~ 1. 00 MPa, (iii) vacuum pressure, p[subscript]v ~ 0. 035 MPa, (iv) dwell time, t ~ 30 minutes, and (v) holding temperature, T ~ 120 °C. Compressive tests revealed that the order of compressive strength for the parent composite materials were arranged as follows: S 2 -glass fibre/epoxy (476 MPa), E-glass fibre/epoxy (430 MPa), IM 7 carbon fibre/epoxy (426 MPa), and TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy (384 MPa). The compressive modulus of these parent composite materials were found to be ordered as follows: IM 7 carbon fibre/epoxy (67. 9 GPa), TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy (61. 8 GPa), S 2 -glass fibre/epoxy (45. 1 GPa), and E-glass fibre/epoxy (32. 9 GPa). After considering these compressive properties, three different hybrid combinations, as mentioned earlier, were manufactured and evaluated with the prepreg layers of the fibre composites possessing higher compressive strength being placed at the compressively loaded side of the flexural specimens. Shorter beam specimens (S/d = 16) of the three hybrid systems exhibited increased flexural strength as the amount of stronger fibre content was increased, but no hybrid effect was noted. The increase appeared to follow the rule of mixtures and this was attributed to their failure mode being shear failure. For beams tested at S/d = 32 and S/d = 64, the three hybrid systems demonstrated three different trends. The S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system, where the S 2 -glass fibre (substituted at the compressive <b>loading</b> <b>face)</b> was slightly stronger and stiffer compared to the E-glass fibre at the tensile side, demonstrated increases in flexural strength together with the presence of a hybrid effect following partial substitution of the S 2 -glass fibre for E-glass fibres at the compressive side. The IM 7 carbon fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system, where the IM 7 carbon fibre (substituted at the compressive side) was slightly stronger but significantly stiffer in compression compared to the TR 50 S fibre at the tensile side, exhibited a slight increase in flexural strength that appeared to obey the rule of mixtures. This result was attributed to the strength increase in the compressive side introduced by the substituted fibres not being sufficient to suppress the increase of internal compressive stress due to the increase in compressive modulus of the substituted fibres. The E-glass fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system, where the E-glass fibre (substituted at the compressive side) was found to be slightly stronger but significantly less stiff in compression compared to the TR 50 S fibre at the tensile side, demonstrated a significant increase in flexural modulus and also exhibited a significant hybrid effect. The decrease in internal compressive stresses generated at the compressive side due to the decreased compressive modulus of the substituted fibre, when combined with the increase in compressive strength of the substituted fibre, was thought to led to the significant increase of flexural strength for this hybrid system. General trends observed in flexural modulus for the three hybrid systems were reasonably similar with any change in flexural modulus appearing to obey the rule of mixtures. Whilst an increase in flexural modulus was noted for higher contents of stronger fibre in the case of the S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system and IM 7 carbon fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system, a decrease in flexural modulus with increased quantities of stronger fibre was exhibited by the E-glass fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system. The increase or decrease in flexural modulus was attributed to the relative stiffness in compression of the substituted fibre when compared to that of the respective parent composite materials. Unlike the S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system and IM 7 carbon fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system that did not exhibit any significant trend with regards the effect of the substitution of stronger fibre at the compressive side, the E-glass fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre hybrid system demonstrated a significant increase in the energy stored to maximum stress with increasing content of the stronger fibre. This increase was mainly attributed to the increased strain–to-maximum stress of the hybrid system with respect to that of the parent composite material. In addition, for the three hybrid systems under investigation, the most significant change in flexural properties was noticed following substitution of the first layer at the compressive face. The relative position with respect to the neutral plane of the substituted layer was thought to be the reason for this phenomenon. It was also noted that flexural properties increased with the increase in S/d. A change in failure morphology was noted with the change of S/d from 16 to 32. It was thus determined that a S/d ratio of at least 32 was required in order to promote flexural failure (as opposed to shear failure). For the S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system, this change appeared more obvious in comparison with that the other two hybrid systems with this change being accompanied by a significant increase in flexural strength. The main general conclusions that could be drawn from this investigation were that, although the flexural modulus appeared to obey the rule of mixture, an increase in flexural strength together with the presence of a hybrid effect, would most probably be observed when the fibre substituted at the compressive side possessed a significantly lower modulus combined with significantly higher compressive strength as demonstrated by the hybrid TR 50 S carbon - E-glass FRP composites. The most significant change in properties was exhibited by the first layer substitution whilst increasing the value of S/d resulted in an increase of flexural strength, with S/d = 32 being determined to be sufficient in order to promote flexural failure as opposed to shear failure...|$|E

In agricultural sector such as in oil palm plantation, ergonomics problems are prominent. Oil palm fruit harvesters and collectors perform various types of manual work activities and work postures, which can exposed them to {{many different types of}} muscular skeletal disorders (MSDs). To have the accurate measurement results so that correct control measure could be observational techniques have to be chosen correctly. In this study, postural analysis was conducted to identify and understand the physical <b>loads</b> <b>faced</b> by manual oil palm fruit harvesters. Their activities and postures while performing harvesting and collecting fresh fruit bunches (FFB) activities were video recorded. Later, their body postures were assessed using Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS) method. It was found oil palm fruit harvesters were exposed to many awkward postures while performing harvesting and manual handling of FFB activities. The authors found it very difficult to quantify the actual <b>load</b> <b>faced</b> by the oil palm fruit harvesters, while they are performing each hazardous posture due to the unavailability of certain parameters such as: posture duration and repetitive work in OWAS. In addition, OWAS was not capable of quantify separately the workload of upper extremities.

Specifically, rigorous spectral solutions for three-dimensional scattering from anisotropic impedance wedges with a PEC face have been presented, when the impedance tensor of the <b>loaded</b> <b>face</b> exhibits a vanishing surface impedance along an anisotropy axis and a finite value in the orthogonal direction. However, these solutions are valid only when the direction of vanishing impedance is either parallel or perpendicular to the edge. A new rigorous spectral solution is presented in this paper, which is valid when the vanishing impedance direction is arbitrarily oriented with respect to the diffracting edge. The solution applies to both the half-plane and the planar-junction configurations. It is worth noting that the anisotropic impedance model is also suitable to simulate corrugated surfaces or strip loaded grounded dielectric slab...|$|R
40|$|Object-oriented {{database}} systems typically offer {{a variety}} of structuring capabilities to model complex objects. This flexibility, together with type (or class) hierarchies and computed "attributes" (methods), poses a high demand on the physical design of object-oriented databases. Similar to traditional databases, it is hardly ever true that the conceptual structure of the database is also a good, that is, efficient, internal one. Rather, data representing the conceptual objects may be structured completely different, for performance reasons. Database systems providing a reasonable amount of data independence allow a physical design that differs from the logical structure significantly. Hence, the performance of the system can be tailored to the overall transaction <b>load</b> <b>faced.</b> The paper presents choices for physical designs that make use of a complex storage model, an extended nested relational model. A first prototype of a physical design optimizer is also presented. 1. 1 Introduction [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{scattering}} of plane waues obliquely incident {{on the edge}} of a planar anisotropic impedance surface is analyzed. A rigorous analytical solution, obtained by applying a procedure similar to that originally proposed by Maliuzhinets, is derived with reference to a couple of pariicular geometrical conjgurations. These latter are relerant to the case in which the anisotropic impedance surface is truncated to originate on either the edge of a half-plune, the other face being perfect electric conductor, or on a planar junction between the same anisotropic surface and a perfectly conducting plane. The exact integral representation for the total field is then asymptotically er,aluated in the conlext of the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD). The particulur kind of anisotropic surface impedance considered for the <b>loaded</b> <b>face</b> is suitable for modeling corrugated surfaces or strip-loaded grounded dielectric slabs, when the direction of either corrugations or strips is petpendicular to the edge...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric strip {{reinforced}} soil walls {{require a}} practical method {{to fix the}} reinforcement tail-ends in the soil backfill during construction to ensure adequate anchorage and to avoid any slack along the linear reinforcement elements. A number of different techniques are currently used depending on the reinforcement type, arrangement and the contractor. This paper reports {{the results of a}} series of numerical simulations that were carried out on an idealized 6 m-high wall with precast partial height facing panels. A different reinforcement pre-tension load was applied to the layers in each simulation case. The results of numerical simulations include the reinforcement axial <b>load</b> distribution, vertical <b>facing</b> <b>load</b> and end-of-construction <b>facing</b> alignment plotted {{as a function of the}} reinforcement layer depth location and applied pre-tension load. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of pre-tensioning has a significant effect on wall performance for walls subjected to operational (working stress) conditions at end of construction.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a metallic reinforced soil segmental retaining wall is examined in a systematic manner using two numerical modelling approaches. Finite element modelling was carried out using the commercial program PLAXIS and finite difference modelling using the commercial program FLAC. Numerical model results using both approaches were compared against measurements recorded for a well-instrumented full-scale 3. 6 -m high wall constructed with a sand backfill, modular-block facing, and steel reinforcement (welded wire mesh). This paper presents measured and predicted toe <b>loads,</b> <b>facing</b> displacements, and reinforcement connection loads at end of construction and during subsequent staged surcharge loading approaching failure. Both numerical models have been verified against recorded measurements. The sensitivity of the assigned backfill soil friction angle on the magnitude and distribution of reinforcement connection loads is also examined. The paper concludes with a summary of lessons learned to achieve satisfactory agreement between predicted performance and wall measurements using both modelling approaches.
