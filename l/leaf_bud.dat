The leaves should not crumble when rubbed, and with ripened pu'erh, it should not resemble compost. Aged raw pu'erh should have leaves that unfurl when brewed while leaves of most ripened pu'erh will generally remain closed.|$|E

2500|$|A {{week after}} the egg has been laid, the larva hatches and begins to feed on the <b>leaf</b> <b>bud</b> tissue. This {{activity}} stimulates (in a way not yet understood) the development by the host plant of enlarged 'nutritive' cells {{in the area around}} the growing larva. [...] These are fed on by the larva and are continually replaced by new cells. [...] Further concentric layers of tissues develop around the core nutritive tissue and come to form the structure known as the bedeguar, complete with the outermost and characteristic fibrous outgrowths that give the gall its alternative name of Robin's pincushion. [...] As the larva feeds and grows within this gall, it probably undergoes five larval instar stages (the growth stages between moults). [...] The final instar stage is reached by late October. [...] The larva ceases feeding. It now passes into the prepupal stage, in which form it overwinters inside the gall. [...] In the following February or March, the prepupa undergoes a final moult and becomes a pupa. Through the thin, transparent skin of the pupa, it is possible to see the fully formed antennae, legs, wings and body segments of the adult wasp. [...] As stated earlier, the adult wasps which start to emerge from the rose bedeguar will be mostly female, and these females will go on to lay eggs through parthenogenesis. The adults begin to emerge from the old galls, which are still attached to the rose, in May. Emergences may continues through to August. No alternation of generation exists in this species.|$|E

40|$|Utilization of glucose, uracil and valine by {{flower and}} <b>leaf</b> <b>buds</b> of {{seedling}} pear trees (Pyrus calleryana Decne.) {{from the time}} of flower bud initiation to flowering was investigated. A very high rate of glucose utilization through the pentose phosphate pathway was observed throughout the development of buds. There was no difference in the type of glucose metabolism between flower and <b>leaf</b> <b>buds</b> except immediately before flowering, when the metabolism in flower buds was shifted toward the glycolytic pathway. Such a shift did not occur in <b>leaf</b> <b>buds.</b> The incorporation of uracil and valine into the nucleic acid and protein fraction of buds, respectively, was high throughout bud development, perhaps indicating a high rate of turnover in the resting buds. Incorporation of both compounds decreased when buds started to expand prior to flowering...|$|R
