They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.|$|E

Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.|$|E
5|$|In December 1852, {{the mill}} complex was valued at £75,000; when George Murray died in 1855, {{two of his}} three sons – James and Benjamin – {{inherited}} the complex. By 1881, A & G Murray had become registered as a <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>company</b> and the running of it was mostly {{in the hands of}} manager Herbert Dixon, who had joined the company in 1876, as the Murray family played less of a role. Under Dixon the company modernised and used new technology and was the reason for the firm's continued success. The use of new, more efficient technologies resulted in the further reduction of the workforce so that by 1897, A & G Murray only employed 500 people. In 1887, Fireproof Mill and Doubling Mill were leased by A & G Murray Ltd to C E Bennet.|$|E

5|$|Royal Arsenal's move to professionalism in 1891 was {{frowned upon}} {{by many of}} the amateur {{southern}} clubs, and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association. With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal, they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League, but the move failed. The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>company</b> to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground. Woolwich Arsenal's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893. Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League, initially joining the Second Division; in response, some of the club's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal, broke away to form a short-lived alternative side, Royal Ordnance Factories.|$|E

5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>company.</b> Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
5|$|With {{access to}} wood from the Quantock Hills, {{records show that}} paper making was {{established}} by 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill was established by the Fulford and Hadley families {{near the mouth of}} the Washford River. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west. By 1652, the mill had started to produce paper. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business and introduced mechanised-production using a water wheel-powered pulley system. In the 1860s, the factory was converted to steam power and the local harbour was used to import raw materials and export finished goods. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889 but it was rebuilt and less than ten years later five paper making machines were operating. The mill became the largest manufacturer of paper bags in the UK. In 1896, the business became the Wansbrough Paper Company, a <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>company</b> and is now known as the Wansbrough Paper Mill. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 100 people, it is the UK's largest manufacturer of coreboard, and also produces containerboard, recycled envelope, bag and kraft papers. In December 2015 the paper mill ceased production and closed.|$|E
