40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Pants {{have become}} a {{seemingly}} necessary part of the average American woman's wardrobe and may be worn for nearly every occasion. However, many women have indicated that when conventional methods of construction were used for pants-making, the pants did not conform to their expectation of good fit. Observation showed that pants made according to the conventional methods of construction did not comply with the standards of good fit that have been established for other garments. Therefore, the conventional methods of pants construction were modified {{in accordance with the}} principles and standards of clothing construction that have been used as a basis for achieving good fit. The basic differences between the unmodified and modified methods of construction were: 1) the location of the <b>lengthwise</b> <b>grain</b> line on the patterns, 2) the addition of fitting allowances on the fitting seams of the modified pants patterns, 3) the techniques used to facilitate the placement of the grain lines of the fabric on the balance lines of the body, and 4) the fabrics used to construct the pants. The participants were students at Oregon State University. To determine the effect that a modified method of construction would have on the fit of women's custom-made pants, eight pants patterns were randomly selected from the commercial patterns purchased by the participants. Two pairs of pants were constructed from each of the selected patterns, one pair before the pattern was modified and another pair after pattern modifications. An additional 46 pairs of pants were also made by the modified method of construction. Each of the 62 pairs of pants was then modeled, and 12 characteristics of fit were rated by a panel of clothing construction authorities {{as well as by the}} other participants in a class. There were statistically significant differences between the fit of the crosswise grain line, front crotch, back crotch, and lower back hip on the two sets of garments, while no significant differences were found between the other characteristics of fit on these garments. When the scores for the fit of the crosswise grain line, front crotch, back crotch, and lower back hip were compared among groups of modified pants, no significant differences were found. Subsequent analysis of the scores for the modified pants indicated that: 1) bonded wool-acetate fabrics were not suitable for the construction of closely fitted pants, 2) the size of the wearer apparently did not affect the ratings of the fit of the modified pants, and 3) the comfort of the modified pants was considered to be above average. The results of a secondary investigation showed that the total crotch length method of measurement provided a better basis for determining the adequacy of the crotch length of a pattern than did either of the two crotch depth methods of measurement...|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the basic}} {{structure}} of the threshing board is ready, it must be smoothed. This is first done by [...] "working" [...] it with an adze <b>lengthwise,</b> along the <b>grain.</b> Then the final finishing is done with various specialized carpenter's planes, on both top and bottom; first going across in a transverse direction, and later lengthwish.|$|R
5000|$|A {{table saw}} is {{typically}} used for cross-cutting and ripping; cross-cutting slices a board across its grain width-wise, ripping cuts <b>lengthwise</b> along the <b>grain.</b> Various conditions experienced while cutting either way {{can cause a}} partially cut board to move, twist, or have the saw blade's [...] close up and bind the blade. Poor blade or fence alignment, operator error, or pre-existing stresses in the wood released by cutting may cause these different and dangerous conditions. A riving knife rides within the kerf, pivoting on the saw's arbor in relation to blade height, to maintain an even {{gap between the two}} cut sides of the board, preventing jamming which could cause the stock to be forcefully ejected rearward toward the saw's operator.|$|R
40|$|Mostly annual, rather small, of {{peculiar}} habit, often moss-like, gregarious, {{confined to}} swift running water in streams and cascades. Tissues with silicium. Roots often thallose, flat, stem sometimes absent. Leaves mostly alternate, sometimes scattered, decussate or distichous, base often {{provided with a}} sheath, and sometimes stipulelike appendages, often dentate or divided. Flowers terminal, often in cymose inflor., mostly ♀♂, actinomorphic to zygomorphic. Perianth of 3 - 5 free or subconnate tepals, if reduced to two small, ovate or linear appendages, the bud is enveloped by an originally closed thin ‘spathella’. Stamens hypogyn, 1 -~, often 2 unilateral, frequently monadelphic. Anthers mostly introrse, 2 — 4 -locular, splitting <b>lengthwise.</b> Pollen <b>grains</b> single, or in twos or fours. Ovary superior, ovate to elliptic, mostly 2 -, rarely 3 -locular with thickened central placenta and thin septa. Ovules ~; styles as many as carpels, free, rarely 1. Capsule septicid (often) ribbed; seeds ~, minute, exalbuminous, epidermis mucilaginous. Distr. Principally confined to the tropics throughout the world, not yet recorded from the Pacific islands and {{the greater part of}} Australia, northward as far as S. Japan, in Malaysia apparently very rare. The locality closest to Malaysia is isthmian Siam where Dr A. KEITH found Podostemon ?algaeformis BTH. in the nineties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{degree of}} effect of cold plastic {{deformation}} on {{change of the}} controlled magnetic parameter of structural steels is investigated. It is shown that {{with the increase of}} deformation ratio, stray magnetic field strength in zones of control changes the sign from the positive to negative and at deformation ratio 40 and more percent, only negative values are observed. It has been found that the shift of meaning and sign controlled the magnetic parameter in the process of plastic deformation is conditioned by structural changes, passing in steels when fractional rolling: formation of rolling texture and increase of crystallographic orientation of <b>grains</b> <b>lengthwise</b> of rolling direction with the increase of deformation ratio. The revealed correlation between the degree of cold plastic deformation, stray magnetic field strength and structural changes, taking place in lowcarbon steel 08 ps and low-alloy steels 09 G 2 S and 10 HSND, allows for recommending the passive ferroprobe method for control of structural changes of metal in the process of cold plastic deformation.
