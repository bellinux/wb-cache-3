50|$|The land {{is made up}} {{of forest}} and lakes typical of the rugged Canadian Shield. It is used {{primarily}} for hunting and fishing by Mohawk from the reserves of Kanesatake and Kahnewake Quebec, who share access to this territory. It was the site of the now defuncked Iroquois Cranberry Growers, which was Ontario's <b>largest</b> <b>cranberry</b> farm. The farm was shuttered because of economic reasons.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the {{cranberry}} {{industry has}} dominated Wareham's economy, {{as evidenced by}} the fact that the main local road is known as Cranberry Highway (Route 28) and one of the world's <b>largest</b> <b>cranberry</b> growers, the A.D. Makepeace Company (a founder of the Ocean Spray growers' cooperative), is headquartered in Wareham. The University of Massachusetts Cranberry Research Station is also located in Wareham, as is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cranberry Marketing Committee.|$|R

There are several sanctuaries, a conservation area and other forests within the town, especially in the western half.|$|R
50|$|It is {{considered}} one of the hubs of cottage country located north of Toronto. Thus, its year-round population of several hundred is increased by thousands of seasonal residents and weekend day-trippers during summer months. It is known as the Cranberry Capital of Ontario, as the province's <b>largest</b> <b>cranberry</b> farms, Johnston's Cranberry Marsh and Wahta Iroquis Growers, are located nearby. It was once the smallest incorporated town in Canada, until amalgamation as part of Muskoka Lakes Township.|$|R
50|$|During his childhood, he used {{to enjoy}} fishing and hunting pigeons using a net with his {{grandfather}} {{and when he was}} old enough, the school days were limited to only winter season because he assisted in his father's sawmill. Dr. Peck went {{for the first time with}} his father to collect <b>large</b> <b>cranberries</b> when he was eight or ten years old. Picking up cranberries was a family matter since his grandmother went with the Indians, who knew the swamp very well, to perform this activity (Burnham 1919).|$|R

40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was {{introduced}} into the Iberian Paninsula (Spain and Portugal), mainly from Central America around 1506 and from the southern Andes after 1532, through sailors and traders, who brought the nicely colored, easily transportable seeds with them as a curiosity. The principal ciltivated bean types {{in this area are}} cultivars of Andean origin and belonging to the white kidney, Canellini, marrow, "Favada", <b>large</b> <b>cranberry,</b> cranberry, red pinto and "Canela" market classes. The level of genetic variation has not eroded since the introduction of common bean from the American centres of domestication to the Iberian Peninsula. Instead, obvious signs of introgression between the two gene pools were observed, mainly among white-seeded genotypes (Santalla et al., 2002). A preliminary study of the productivity potential and breeding value of great northern recombinant genotypes is presented in this work. Peer reviewe...|$|E
50|$|The forest also {{contains}} Whitesbog Village, an historic company town, {{founded in the}} 1870s by Joseph J. White which was {{once one of the}} <b>largest</b> <b>cranberry</b> and blueberry farms in the state, active through the mid-20th century. The cultivated blueberry, a hybrid of the native Vaccinium caesariense, was developed and commercialized here by Elizabeth Coleman White and Frank Coville. The now silent Whitesbog Village exemplifies the changes in agriculture in this state. The site has been leased to the nonprofit Whitesbog Preservation Trust for restoration.|$|R
50|$|Today, Cranberry Glades {{serves as}} a major tourism stop along the Highland Scenic Highway corridor. Near the Glades is the Cranberry Mountain Nature Center {{providing}} interpretive services. Within the Glades area itself, Monongahela National Forest has constructed a 0.5 mi boardwalk that traverses the edge of some bogs and a small wooded section. The entire Glades area itself is traversed by Cowpasture Trail, a 6.0 mi improved hiking path {{that serves as the}} border between the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area and the much <b>larger</b> <b>Cranberry</b> Wilderness. Due to the ecologically-sensitive nature of the area, visitors are not permitted to leave these developed paths within the Glades.|$|R
50|$|There are two public boat {{landings}} on Grindstone Lake: {{an improved}} landing at {{the southwest corner}} and a small, unimproved landing at the southeast corner near the outlet stream. A <b>large</b> commercial <b>Cranberry</b> bog was formerly located on the southwest shore of the lake near the improved boat landing but has now been closed. Grindstone Lake is a popular resort area drawing cabin owners and visitors from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee, and Chicago metropolitan areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{anticoagulant}} {{effects of}} warfarin {{may be increased}} by consuming cranberry juice, resulting in adverse effects such as increased incidence of bleeding and bruising.

50|$|Typically 2-10% {{of fruit}} in diseased beds is {{infected}} and becomes unmarketable. Wisconsin is the <b>largest</b> producer of <b>cranberries</b> in the United States (it is Wisconsin's state fruit). In 2010, Wisconsin produced 3.96 {{million barrels of}} cranberries, representing nearly 60% of the nation's crop. Cranberries contribute nearly $300 million annually in Wisconsin, and support approximately 3,400 jobs in the state. Even relatively small amounts of cottonball infections can have a dramatic effect on producers' incomes.|$|R
50|$|Cranberry {{production}} in Washington makes up a moderate amount (less than {{a tenth of}} a percent) of agricultural revenue for the state. These berries could be affected by higher winter temperatures due to climate change. This would mean considerable losses in revenue in Washington. Washington is the fifth <b>largest</b> supplier of <b>cranberries</b> in the U.S., producing 3% of total U.S. production. There are three growing regions in Washington, including Whatcom County, Grays Harbor County, and Pacific County.|$|R

5000|$|Ocean Spray {{was formed}} in 1930, in Hanson, Massachusetts, by three {{cranberry}} growers who wanted to expand their market for cranberries. Led by grower Marcus L. Urann, who had created a cranberry sauce, the cooperative developed more cranberry-based products. In the same year Ocean Spray became the first producer of cranberry juice drinks {{with the introduction of}} Cranberry Juice Cocktail. (A.D. Makepeace Company, one of the original founders of Ocean Spray, has been in continual operation since the late 19th century and is currently the world's <b>largest</b> grower of <b>cranberries.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|This Wildlife Management Area covers 305 acre, with a {{focal point}} on the 28 acre of the Spruce Flats Bog which formed in a natural {{depression}} atop Laurel Ridge. The area had previously passed through the successional sequence from open water to (eventually) forest. This process was actually reversed {{in the early part}} of the 20th century by a combination of clear-cutting the forest, and fires which burned away much of the forest floor. This resulted in a return to the swamp or bog stage of development, and the area is now slowly proceeding back into the forest stage. The bog currently hosts a <b>large</b> community of <b>cranberry,</b> pitcher plant, sundew, and cotton grass.|$|R
60|$|About the light-house I {{observed}} in the summer the pretty Polygala polygama, spreading ray-wise flat on the ground, white pasture thistles (Cirsium pumilum), and amid the shrubbery the Smilax glauca, which is commonly said not to grow so far north; {{near the edge of}} the banks about half a mile southward, the broom crow-berry (Empetrum Conradii), for which Plymouth is the only locality in Massachusetts usually named, forms pretty green mounds four or five feet in diameter by one foot high,--soft, springy beds for the wayfarer. I saw it afterward in Provincetown, but prettiest of all the scarlet pimpernel, or poor-man's weather-glass (Anagallis-arvensis), greets you in fair weather on almost every square yard of sand. From Yarmouth, I have received the Chrysopsis falcata (golden aster), and Vaccinium stamineum (Deerberry or Squaw Huckleberry), with fruit not edible, sometimes as <b>large</b> as a <b>cranberry</b> (Sept. 7).|$|R
