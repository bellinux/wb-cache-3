5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it.

His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology.

The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one grade) was instituted in 1917.
