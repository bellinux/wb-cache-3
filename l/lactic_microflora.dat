40|$|Microbiological {{characterization}} of an artisanal cheese produced from raw milk of Massese sheep {{was carried out}} in order to standardize the production. The research was conducted during 3 traditional cheesemaking processes. Samples from milk, rennet, curd and cheese at different stages of ripening (2, 7, 14, 28, 42 days) were analysed to determine the enumeration of: total mesophilic bacteria; lactococci; mesophilic lactobacilli; enterococci; yeasts and moulds; staphylococci and micrococci; total and faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. Lactic acid bacteria remarkably increased during ripening: a very high level of lactococci was detected particularly during the first 14 days and was followed by a gradual decrease. Lactobacilli showed high levels, but lower than lactococci, during the whole ripening period. Enterococci and yeasts resulted quantitatively less important. Staphylococci and coliforms markedly decreased during ripening. Samples from rennet constantly revealed low bacterial counts. Means and standard deviations were calculated. ANOVA tables were constructed on data previously transformed according to Bartlett method. Isolation and identification of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from the examined cheese were also carried out. 28 lactobacilli, 9 lactococci, 27 enterococci and 59 yeasts were identified. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida spherica resulted the most abundant species. The results obtained from the analyses of this type of cheese allowed to evaluate the behaviour of lactic and non <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> and to determine the predominant mesophilic <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora...</b>|$|E

The antibacterial activity of {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) isolates was investigated. Snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of Bulgaria. One hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging {{to the group of}} LAB, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. Representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. The snail gut <b>lactic</b> acid <b>microflora</b> was composed by Enterococcus (17 isolates), Lactococcus (12 isolates), Leuconostoc (7 isolates), Lactobacillus (18 isolates) and Weissella (1 isolate). The species affiliation of Lactococcus lactis (12), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and Lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. The Lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA as Lactobacillus brevis (12), L. plantarum (2), Lactobacillus graminis (1) and Lactobacillus curvatus (3). The species L. brevis, L. graminis and L. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas L. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. Antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of L. mesentereoides P 4 / 8 against Propionibacterium acnes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} {{organoleptic}} evaluation, chemical and microbiological analysis of Sombor cheese were presented. Sombor cheese {{is a type of}} autochthonous cheese whose traditional processing method is still in use in areas of northern part of Serbia. The sensory profile, chemical and microbiological analysis were performed on 19 samples of traditionally made cheese collected from two households. The sensory evaluation of cheese samples showed its variation in taste and consistency, as well as an unstable cheese flavour. Generally, the traditionally made Sombor cheese in wood modules received a higher score than the cheese produced in the cylindric form. According to the fat content in dry matter Sombor cheese can be classified as a fat cheese and depending of water content in non fat cheese matter, Sombor cheese belongs to the group of soft cheeses. Fat in dry matter and content of total nitrogen showed great variations which indicate the unevenness in technology and unconsistent quality of the raw substrate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate, {{identify}} and select, with respect to acidification and proteolytic activities, the autochthonous mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in milk and Caciotta della Garfagnana, a cheese produced either with raw or thermised cow’s milk in small dairies and family plants of Garfagnana (Tuscany), to obtain LAB strains with attributes suitable to be employed as starter cultures in this type of cheese, particularly when thermised milk is used to control spoilage microflora. Samples of raw milk, curd and cheese were collected from three representative farmers of the production area and used to isolate autochthonous LAB. Phenotypic and genotypic (species-specific PCR assay) identification of isolated LAB was done. Twenty-eight strains of LAB isolated from milk, curd and cheese were screened for acidifying and proteolytic activities.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown an {{association}} between a high consumption of vegetables and fruits and low incidences of certain chronic diseases. With the increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as market globalization, an increase in foodborne illness due to produce is a real possibility {{as a result of}} contamination of foods with pathogenic microorganisms. Minimally processed foods such as fresh, precut vegetables and fruits, both conventional and organic, have limited shelf life and mainly rely on good manufacturing practices (GMP) for preservation and safety. Contaminated raw vegetables, fruits, and fruit juices have all been vehicles for transmission of pathogens. These foods are often consumed raw without the benefit of any pathogen-killing step. In the past few decades, a number of major foodborne disease outbreaks involving up to thousands of cases and many deaths attributable to consumption of fresh, precut, and minimally processed produce have been reported in several countries. The microorganisms present in this produce are the natural <b>microflora</b> (<b>lactic</b> acid bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., yeast and molds) or the bacteria incorporated in these products during their cultivation (irrigation and fertilization), and processing (harvest, postharvest handling, processing, and distribution). Ionizing radiation is a nonthermal technology that has been reported to eliminate foodborne pathogens and extend the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables.

40|$|The {{production}} of fermented foods {{is based on}} the use of starter cultures, for instance, lactic acid bacteria, to initiate rapid acidification of the raw material. Recently, new started cultures of lactic acid bacteria with industrially important functionality are being developed. Examples are lactic bacteria that produce antimicrobial substances, sugar polymers, sweeteners, aromatic compounds, vitamins, or those having probiotic properties. The study was undertaken to explore the possibilities of interpolating the probiotic concept into the product range of fermented sausages. The considerable influence of the starter culture Lactobacillus sake LS 25 on the microbiological, physical and chemical traits of the dry fermented sausages was observed. The quantitative significant {{increase in the number of}} lactic acid bacteria was determined during ripening (day 2 and day 4) in fermented sausage with probiotic starter cultures. The use of Lactobacillus sake LS 25 makes it possible to avoid the increase in coliform bacteria count at the initial stages of ripening in fermented sausage. The sausage with natural <b>lactic</b> acid bacteria <b>microflora</b> showed its depressing influence on coliforms only on the fourth day of ripening, when the lactic acid bacteria count became equal to the amount in fermented sausage batches with Lactobacillus sake LS 25. The use of Lactobacillus sake LS 25 suppresses the biogenic amine formation in fermented sausage during ripening: the quantities of putrescine, tyramine and histamine were 87. 0, 62. 2 and 68. 1 mg/kg, respectively. The amounts of biogenic amine in fermented sausage were twice as lower as those made without Lactobacillus sake LS 25.

Non-starter lactic acid bacteria, such as Lb. parabuchneri and Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei formed {{a large part of the}} <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> at 42 and 60 d of ripening. The level of pH 4. 6 -soluble nitrogen increased from the outer to the inner of the cheese and also increased in each section as ripening progressed, attaining values of 18 – 15 %. Urea-PAGE electrophoresis showed that degradation of αs 1 -casein was more rapid than that of β-casein throughout ripening and the rates at which both caseins were degraded greatly increased from the outside to the inside of the cheese. Based on the primary proteolysis products, both chymosin and plasmin appeared to be active. RP-HPLC profiles of the 70 % ethanol-soluble, pH 4. 6 -soluble nitrogen, showed a large number of peaks, indicating a heterogeneous mixture of proteolytic products. There were both age- and section-related changes in the area of the different peptide peaks. Butyric (C 4 : 0), caproic (C 6 : 0), palmitic (C 16 : 0) and oleic (C 18 : 1) acids were the free fatty acids found at the highest concentrations. The level of short chain fatty acids (e. g., butyric and caproic) decreased from the middle and inner to outer sections of the cheese. Peptidase activity in the curd was pronounced, increased during ripening and varied with the cheese section. The greatest increase of the peptidase activity coincided with a change in the <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> and with the prevalence of non-starter lactic acid bacteria.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of {{the fate of}} microbial foodborne pathogens in foods is of great concern for anyone involved in the food chain. Factors that may influence microbial responses in foods and food environments, such as food structure and composition, microbial interactions and mode of growth were identified and assessed in the present study. The fate of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was monitored both in and on teewurst, a raw spreadable sausage, at different storage temperatures. Regardless of the storage temperature and inoculation type, pathogen numbers decreased during storage. The increase of endogenous lactic acid bacteria and the concomitant reduction of pH mostly accounted for this reduction. The inactivation of all three pathogens inoculated into batter or onto slices varied considerably among trials possibly due to variations in the initial batch-to-batch levels of <b>lactic</b> acid <b>microflora</b> and the associated microbial interactions. The effect of structure, composition and microbial interactions on the growth kinetics of L. monocytogenes was evaluated in different growth substrates, including broth, agar, sterile meat blocks, naturally contaminated meat blocks and minced meat. The growth responses of L. monocytogenes were significantly different in the different growth media and food products tested. These differences were more pronounced at low temperatures. The validation of a model {{based on data from}} broth against the observed growth of the pathogen {{in the rest of the}} tested media showed that broth models may result in significant prediction errors. The potential for mono- or multi-strain cultures of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 to attach and form biofilm in combinations of food-contact surfaces, growth substrates and storage temperatures was examined. The susceptibility of biofilms to sanitizers was also evaluated. Attachment and biofilm formation was strain dependent. The presence of food residues (liquid or solid) facilitated the attachment/transfer of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on food-contact surfaces. At moderately cold temperatures culture broth was more conducive to subsequent growth. At chill temperatures the presence of natural microflora in liquid residues enhanced further attachment of the pathogen. Biofilms were less susceptible to sanitation treatments as compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm cells surviving sanitation were able to survive and present slight increases at refrigeration and abuse temperatures, respectively, in cross-contaminated ground meat. Acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2) signalling molecules in the cell-free supernatants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica-like, Serratia proteamaculans and a mixture of two Yersinia enterocolitica strains were found to affect the growth kinetics of two Salmonella Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium strains, respectively. P. aeruginosa synthesized quorum sensing signals that accelerated the metabolic activity of Salmonella strains. All other quorated bacteria tested had a negative effect on both initiation of growth and metabolic activity. The effect seems to be strain and QS signal dependent.

40|$|At present, {{different}} methods {{are used to}} accumulate functional peptides in meat raw materials, {{including the use of}} spontaneous microflora during autolysis, the use of the microbial enzymes (the application of starter cultures) {{and the use of the}} non-microbial enzymes (enzymes of animals and plant origin). Each method has its own specific characteristics of an impact on raw materials, which requires their detail study. This paper examines an effect of spontaneous microflora of fermented meat products from horsemeat on formation of biologically active peptides. Using the T-RFLP analysis, it was established that in air dried and uncooked smoked sausages produced with the use of the muscle tissue of horsemeat as a raw material, a significant proportion of microflora was presented by lactic acid microorganisms. The highest content of <b>lactic</b> acid <b>microflora</b> was observed in sample 1 (52. 45 %), and the least in sample 3 (29. 62 %). Sample 2 had the medium percent content of microflora compared to samples 1 and 3 — 38. 82 %. It is necessary to note that about 25 % of microflora was unculturable; i. e., it had metabolic processes but did not grow on culture media. In the samples, the representatives of Actinobacteria and Pseudomonadales were found. Pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microflora was not detected. Not only quantitative but also qualitative changes were observed in the studied samples. For example, in samples 1 and 2, the fractions of amilo- 1, 6 -glucosidase, fast-type muscle myosin-binding-protein C; glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase; fast skeletal muscle troponin I, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase and skeletal muscle actin were found, which were absent or reduced in sample 3. Therefore, in the studied product, good preservation of the main spectra of muscle proteins was observed, and the identified fractions, apparently, can be sources of new functional peptides. Not only quantitative but also qualitative changes were observed in the studied samples. For example, in samples 1 and 2, the C-terminal fragments of the myosin heavy chain were found, which were absent in sample 3. Also, the significant content of myoglobin was revealed in samples 2 and 3, and the myosin light chain was found in sample 1. Therefore, in the studied product, good preservation of muscle proteins myosin and myoglobin, which can be a source of new functional peptides, was observed. Based on the results of tandem mass-spectrometry, the proteins and natural short peptides present in the analyzed extracts were identified by the obtained masses. They belonged mainly to different peptides of equine myoglobin. Also, we identified several fragments, among which fast skeletal muscle troponin T and muscle creatine kinase were found. The obtained materials can be regarded as an experimental basis for the directed impact of starter cultures with a possibility to predict the protein and peptide composition of a finished product including with the aim of obtaining biologically active peptides...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is {{a common}} {{post-processing}} contaminant in ready-to-eat vacuum packaged (VP) cold smoked salmon. Since this psychrotrophic pathogen can grow at refrigerated temperatures (~ 4 °C), other safety barriers in addition to temperature are needed to ensure the continued safety of VP cold smoked salmon. One such novel barrier could be the pulsed light (PL) treatment of the product prior to packaging or treating the product through a transparent package. Pulsed light destruction kinetics of L. monocytogenes were evaluated while dispensed into a liquid media, {{on the surface of}} a general purpose agar and on the surface of cold smoked salmon. Results showed that PL technology was an effective surface sanitation method (a decimal reduction time or D-value of 0. 91, 1. 37 and 2. 25 s exposure of PL at 800, 700 and 600 V, respectively, and a resulting z value of 500 V) on the agar plate. However, it had only a limited success when applied to liquid samples as well as directly on the surface of cold smoked salmon (D-value ranged from 93 s to 24 min). Sensory quality of VP cold smoked salmon subjected to selected PL treatments was monitored during storage for 14 days at 4 °C. Both color and odor scores remained within acceptable limits over the 14 day storage period. Subsequent challenge studies were carried out with L. monocytogenes applied on VP cold smoked salmon. An overall reduction in counts was observed in samples stored at 4 °C over 28 days; however, after PL treatment (day 0), there was no significant reduction in counts. Color and odor scores maintained acceptable values over 14 days. Additional experiments were carried out {{to determine the effects of}} (1) 1. 5 % salt, (2) 6 % oil, (3) a representative salmon media and (4) background <b>microflora</b> (<b>lactic</b> acid bacteria) on the PL inactivation of L. monocytogenes. All of these factors significantly affected the destruction of L. monocytogenes by increasing the D-value (adding resistance to pulsed light destruction). Overall, these studies have shown that PL treatment in combination with low temperature storage (4 °C) has the potential to extend the shelf-life of VP cold smoked salmon products without compromising sensory quality. However further investigation into higher treatment voltages is necessary in order to achieve a higher target kill of L. monocytogenes...|$|R

Isolation of 275 strains belonging to different Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus species was achieved. Coccal-shaped LAB were found to predominate during cheese fermentation, while lactobacilli were preponderate during the latter phase of ripening. The technological selection of a total of 174 LAB strains belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lb. casei allowed an experimental starter to be prepared, in which a potentially probiotic species, Lb. casei was used. The suitability of the autochthonous starter culture was tested in cheese-making trials, using thermised ewes’ milk, by comparing experimental Pecorino Sardo cheese with a control cheese produced at industrial scale using a whey starter culture from previous batches of manufacture. In particular, microbiological and physicochemical parameters were determined over 210 days of cheese ripening. Although sensory evaluation did not show any significant difference between experimental and control Pecorino Sardo cheeses, the use of the selected autochthonous starter allowed the production of experimental cheese with a significantly higher level of free amino acids, in particular essential amino acids, in comparison with the Pecorino Sardo control cheeses...|$|E

Leucine, glutamic acid, lysine, valine were the free amino acids present at the highest levels in all the cheeses. Flavour and texture profile were characterized through a sensory analysis...|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) are a {{group of}} Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria that convert carbohydrates and complex sugars into lactic acid as the end product through fermentation. Several species of LAB {{have been used as}} probiotics. Probiotics are mono- or mixed cultures of live microorganisms which, when orally administered to animals or man, benefit them by improving the balance of the indigenous <b>microflora.</b> <b>Lactic</b> acid bacteria are claimed to have several beneficial effects; one of them being stimulation of the immune system. Many studies have demonstrated the immunostimulatory effects of LAB and various mechanisms have been suggested as to how LAB stimulate the immune system. These include the ability of LAB to translocate to Peyer's Patches (PP) and other gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) for immunological processing by immunocompetent cells and production of cytokines. There were three aims in our present studies. The first was to determine the effect of dose of an immunoenhancing probiotic strain L. rhamnosus on the mucosal and serum immune responses of mice to oral antigens cholera toxin (CT) and ovalbumin (OV). The second aim was to examine the effect of viability of L. rhamnosus on these responses. Various mucosal immune parameters were measured in these studies. Results indicate that the immunostimulatory effects of L. rhamnosus were dose-dependent and that the 1 x 109 cfu dose was the most appropriate dose for L. rhamnosus for its immunostimulatory effects. Viability also affects the immunostimulatory effects of L. rhamnosus as shown by the higher efficacy of viable L rhamnosus than non-viable L. rhamnosus in stimulation of several aspects of the mucosal immune system. In some other immune parameters, non-viable L. rhamnosus was found to be the same as, or more effective than the viable bacteria. These findings were significant in that they provide additional evidence of the dose- and viability-dependency of different LAB. This information will help those involved in the development of probiotic products to consider these factors when formulating their products so that the concentration of live LAB can be adjusted to ensure the product can convey the maximum beneficial effect to the consumer. The third aim of our studies was to examine the role played by the immune system in protecting against enteric infection. It was found that L rhamnosus increased the resistance of mice to S. typhimurium infection as demonstrated by the lower numbers of bacteria found in the liver and spleen, and a maintenance of liveweight. This was also accompanied by increased mucosal and systemic immune responses to S. typhimurium. This result suggests that the immune system may {{play an important role in}} mediating the protection against enteric infection. Various other mechanisms have also been postulated by which LAB protect against enteric infection, for example, production of antibacterial substances, competition for adherence to the gut wall and for nutrients. However, the precise role and relative importance of these mechanisms in mediating protection against enteric infection is unknown...|$|R
40|$|Lysozyme is {{a natural}} enzyme with muramidase {{activity}} which can work against a range of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus spp., that can affect wine stability (Cunningham et al., 1991). For such reason, over the last decade, {{there has been a}} growing interest in lysozyme as a supplement to sulphur dioxide for bacterial inhibition (Sonni et al., 2009). Since, lysozyme applications proved to be enough specific to require technical knowledge and expertise to be efficient, an experimental winemaking was performed to evaluate the efficiency of this enzyme application to produce a Sicilian wine from “organic grapes”. Specifically, two experimental conditions were considered by using SO 2 or lysozyme, alternatively, according to a defined industrial winemaking scheme, with periodically samplings in order to: i) control organic acid content, ii) control unwanted LAB and iii) to prevent malolactic fermentation. Musts to be employed derived by grapes of “Catarratto”, an ancient white variety, whose wine presented susceptibility to oxidation phenomena. The evaluation during time of <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> revealed an appreciable microbial reduction following to lysozyme addition, even if this drop took a longer time (about 48 h) if compared to the production with SO 2 (about 2 h). In addition, in the wine added with lysozime the content of acetic acid, after 30 days of the end of alcoholic fermentation, was half of the value determined on the wine added with the SO 2. Seventy-three LAB cultures isolated by different phases of both thesis were identified and characterized through molecular approach. Identification revealed the prevalence of Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum (about 60...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to produce functional Scamorza cheese from Gentile di Puglia ewe milk by incorporating probiotic strains into the cheese matrix and to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of Scamorza ewe milk cheese. Gentile di Puglia ewe bulk milk was used for Scamorza cheese production. Cheeses were denoted S-CO for control Scamorza cheese, S-BB for Scamorza cheese made using a mix of Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium lactis, and S-LA for Scamorza cheese made using Lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotic strain. Cheeses were analyzed at 1, 7, and 15 d of ripening. Probiotic cell recovery in cheese was 7. 55 ± 0. 07 log 10 cfu/g and 9. 09 ± 0. 04 log 10 cfu/g in S-LA and S-BB cheese, respectively; probiotic cheeses also displayed {{the highest levels of}} <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora.</b> Reverse-phase HPLC chromatograms of the water-soluble nitrogen fraction showed a more complex profile in S-BB, with distinctive peaks in the early-eluting zone. The matured Scamorza cheese containing the mix of B. longum and B. lactis was characterized by significantly higher levels of Gln, Ser, Arg, Ile, and Leu, whereas cheese containing Lb. acidophilus was characterized by higher levels of Tyr and Met. Total FFA content was the highest in S-LA, intermediate in S-BB, and the lowest in S-CO cheese; in particular, Scamorza cheese containing Lb. acidophilus showed the highest level of vaccenic acid, oleic acid, and total conjugated linoleic acid. Probiotic bacteria survived through the technological phases of pasta filata cheese production, maintained their specific metabolic pathways, and conferred functional properties to Scamorza ewe milk cheese...|$|E
40|$|Pecorino Sardo Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) is a half-cooked paste cheese {{produced}} only with full cream ewes’ milk {{that can be}} thermised if necessary. Pecorino Sardo PDO is a cylindrical-shaped cheese with flat faces and a straight or slightly convex rim. Two typologies of Pecorino Sardo PDO are currently produced: "sweet" when the ripening time is short (20 - 60 days), and "ripened" when the ripening is longer than 2 months. In this study we evaluated the influence of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the microbiological and nutritional characteristics of the “sweet” type of Pecorino Sardo PDO. For this aim two cheese-making trials (experimental and control) were carried out on an industrial scale. Experimental Pecorino Sardo cheese was manufactured {{with the addition of}} an autochthonous starter culture prepared with Streptococcus thermophilus + Lactobacillus plantarum + Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei while control cheese was manufactured {{with the addition of a}} commercial starter including Streptococcus thermophilus + Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. The evolution of free amino acids (FAAs) and cheese microflora were then monitored in both cheeses at different ripening times. The addition of the selected autochthonous starter resulted in a substantial increase of the mesophilic <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora,</b> lactobacilli in particular, in the experimental curd and cheeses. The presence of spoilage microorganisms in the experimental cheeses, such as total and fecal coliforms, was significantly reduced compared to the control indicating a suitable activity of the starter during the fermentation phase. Moreover, the use of the selected autochthonous LAB allowed the production of experimental cheeses with a significantly higher amount of FAAs compared to Pecorino Sardo control cheeses. It is concluded that the selected starter used in the experimental trials is suitable for the production on a industrial scale of the “sweet” type of Pecorino Sardo PDO...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{livestock}} system and cheese making technique {{on the quality}} of Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese - Caciocavallo Palermitano is a typical stretched curd cheese produced in the Central and Western Sicily. It is traditionally obtained from whole milk of indigenous cows breeds and by the original cheese making technology in which wooden tools, source of inoculum of autochthonous lactic bacteria, are used. Recently, Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese is also obtained in dairy intensive farms of specialized breeds where milk is processed mainly using stainless steel equipment and commercial selected lactic ferments. The aim of this investigation was to verify the influence of cheese making process (traditional with wood tools or innovative with modern stainless steel tools and selected lactic bacteria) on qualitative characteristics of Caciocavallo Palermitano at different ripening time (1, 30, 60 and 120 d) obtained from milk of two livestock systems, an extensive system of local cows breeds fed at pasture and an intensive system of specialized dairy breeds fed mostly hay and concentrate. Milk and cheese quality was affected by livestock system; in fact, milk from extensive farm contained more protein and casein and less fat, urea and somatic cells; then the cheese showed higher cheese yield and protein content and lower fat percentage. In addition, the colour of the cheese from extensive farm resulted more yellow, probably due to the greater transfer of beta-carotene from pasture to milk. The quality of cheese was also significantly influenced by cheese making process; indeed, traditional technology based on the use of wooden tools and the action of natural <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> led to a reduction in cheese yield and a production of cheese higher in fat, and with a more cohesive and yellow past...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{selected}} autochthonous starter culture made up by Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus on the microbiological and physicochemical properties of Pecorino Romano cheese during ripening was investigated. The suitability of the experimental starter culture was tested at industrial scales in cheese-making trials of Pecorino Romano. Pecorino Romano cheese manufactured by use of scotta-fermento served as control. The <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> increased significantly in experimental cheeses {{as compared to the}} control and this was also accompanied by a substantial decrease of spoilage microorganisms in experimental cheeses. Free amino acids (FAAs) were more abundant in experimental cheeses, arginine+g-aminobutyric acid and leucine in particular. These differences could be likely due to a different enzymatic activity of the selected starter culture as compared to the scotta-fermento used in the control trials. Oleic (C 18 : 1), palmitic (C 16 : 0), butyric (C 4), stearic (C 18 : 0) and myristic (C 14 : 0) acids were the most abundant Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) detected in both brand of cheeses at the end of ripening. Overall, the level of FFAs in experimental and control cheeses did not show significant differences, even if the average values in experimental cheeses were always slightly higher than those recorded for the control. Moreover, the average content of FFAs of Pecorino Romano was found the lowest when compared with the other Sardinian PDO cheeses; most likely the high content of sodium chloride and the low a W of Pecorino Romano influenced all the lipase activities, even those present in the rennet paste. Despite this, the employment of the selected starter culture revealed useful to improve the physico-chemical features of Pecorino Romano while preserving its tipicity...|$|E
40|$|Fruhe” is {{the name}} of a fresh cheese {{traditionally}} manufactured in Sardinia (Italy) from sheep or goat milk. When the cheese is stored for long time in brine it is called “Merca”. The Fruhe is a fermented curd characterized by a compact coagulum, a white shining paste and a soft texture. The taste is slightly sour and aromatic. The Fruhe is manufactured from whole milk, raw or heat-treated, deriving from Sardinian farms. It is produced using the following general manufacturing process: - the milk, brought at 36 - 38 °C, is inoculated with autochthonous lactic acid bacterial (LAB) cultures and coagulated with calf or lamb liquid rennet; - this milk is now distributed in plastic containers that can have a variable volume; - the cheese ripening takes place in 12 - 24 hours; - the coagulum within the container can be cut in cubes of approximately 4 cm and the whey is usually partially discarded; - the cheese is stored at 4 °C. In the present study we investigated the microbial populations associated with this traditional product. For this aim twenty samples of Fruhe, manufactured from sheep and goat milk by using different cheesemaking technologies, have been investigated. Microbiological analyses showed that total mesophilic bacteria counts of Fruhe samples were between 1. 00 E+ 06 and 2. 70 E+ 09 CFU/g. Lactobacilli and lactic streptococci were constantly present in a 1 : 1 ratio and in a few samples they reached significant numbers (around 1. 00 E+ 09 CFU/g) while in general the size of these populations was more limited (around 1. 00 E+ 06 CFU/g). This was attributed to an excessive acidification and post-acidification of the cheese. It is important to mention that the presence of a suitable number of LAB (at least 1. 00 E+ 07 CFU/g) is crucial for the nutritional quality of fresh dairy products. The presence of total coliforms and coagulasenegative staphylococci was limited and related to some extent to the reduced number of LAB in most of the samples. Heterofermenting LAB, faecal coliforms and coagulase-positive staphylococci were always absent while yeasts were isolated only from three Fruhe samples. The study showed that <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora</b> associated to Fruhe cheese was substantially homogeneous in all the samples analyzed. However, the number of LAB was globally low in the majority of samples and quite different from other fresh cheeses...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes of}} {{microbial}} flora and some chemical characteristics (pH, % moisture and % salt-in-moisture) in Batzos, raw goat’s milk cheese, were studied during ripening, {{throughout the whole}} lactation season in nine cheese batches manufactured three in each, winter, spring and summer. High counts of Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms were recorded early in ripening, but their levels decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) on ripening and storage. Lactic acid bacteria predominated over the other microbial groups throughout ripening, during the whole lactation season. It seems possible, that high NaCl content of the cheese was the main agent that regulated the microbial survival. No significant differences were observed in the counts related to the season when the cheeses were ripened and stored. However, the season affected {{the composition of the}} <b>lactic</b> <b>microflora.</b> Thus, in winter enterococci were abundant, while in spring and summer lactobacilli isolates were found more frequently. The main Enterococcus species was Ent. durans while among Lactobacillus, were Lb. plantarum and Lb. paraplantarum. Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was the most frequently isolated species in the cheese and its use as starter seems promising. During the second experimental phase, the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated, in order to find the appropriate culture for the production of Batzos cheese. The genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the lactococcal isolates was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of ~ 50 %) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2 - 8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE {{for the majority of the}} strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7. Their ability to affect the growth of Y. enterocolitica, S. aureus, B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis was strain dependent. In 42. 5 % of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75 % of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu- aminopeptidase activity while the ~ 67 % of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys- aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for αs-casein degradation. The majority (90 %) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry. Due to the high levels of enterococci in Batzos cheese, during the third phase of our investigation, the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans, was studied, in order to investigate their contribution to the organoleptic characteristics of Batzos cheese and study their genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed β-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88. 9 %) showed decarboxylase activity on tyrosine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. ...|$|E
