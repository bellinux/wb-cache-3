2500|$|The [...] "Oase 2" [...] and [...] "Oase 3" [...] {{confirm a}} pattern already {{known from the}} {{probably}} contemporaneous [...] "Oase 1" [...] mandible, indicating a mixture of archaic, early modern human and Neanderthal morphological features. Thus, the specimens exhibit a suite of derived [...] "modern human" [...] features like projecting chin, no brow ridge, a high and rounded brain case. Yet, these features are associated with several archaic aspects of the cranium and dentition that place them outside the range of variation for modern humans, like a <b>large</b> <b>face,</b> a large crest of bone behind the ear and big teeth that get even larger toward the back. This mosaic of Neanderthal and modern human resembles similar traits found in a 25,000 years old fossil of a child in Abrigo do Lagar Velho or in the 31,000 years old site of Mladeč, by Cidália Duarte, et al. (1999).|$|E

60|$|He bustled about cheerily, cooking his fried {{potatoes}} and scraps of meat, and boiling his tea. The dim light made his <b>large</b> <b>face</b> softer and more thoughtful {{than it had}} appeared before, and his cheerfulness over his lonely meal typed forth the sublime audacity, profound ignorance, and pathetic faith with which such a man faces the world's millions and dares to hope for success.|$|E
60|$|The form it {{took was}} a childish and yet hateful fancy. As he walked across the inner room towards the balcony, the <b>large</b> <b>face</b> of Sunday grew larger and larger; and Syme was gripped with a fear {{that when he was}} quite close the face would be too big to be possible, and that he would scream aloud. He remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum, because it was a face, and so large.|$|E
50|$|Two pair {{species of}} common yellowthroats were {{analyzed}} from Wisconsin and New York {{for the effect}} of ornamental cues on parental care. Males possess a black face mask and yellow (breast, throat, and belly) patch which is usually completely absent in females. In both U.S. states, yellowthroat males with a larger patch had a lower parental investment towards their young however the ornament involved varied. In Wisconsin males with a <b>larger</b> <b>face</b> mask showed lower parental care and their yellow patch {{had no effect on}} parental care. In New York, males with a larger yellow patch showed lower parental care and their <b>larger</b> <b>face</b> mask had no effect on parental care. (Alonzo, Suzanne H.) Females in Wisconsin were not affected by a <b>larger</b> black <b>face</b> mask in providing parental care and likewise females in New York were not affected by yellow patch size, conflicting with the good parent hypothesis (larger ornamental cues lead to higher parental care). The trade-off hypothesis matches the results which says larger ornamental cues on males leads to less parental investment because their effort is diverted to finding more mates for future reproductive success or holding on to territories.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} {{examples of}} the numerical solution of boundary-value problems in nonlinear magnetoelasticity involving finite geometry based on the theoretical framework developed by Dorfmann and co-workers.

In the first problem the deformation induced in the block by {{the application of a}} uniform magnetic field far from the block and normal to its <b>larger</b> <b>faces</b> without mechanical load is examined, while in the second problem the same magnetic field is applied in conjunction with a shearing deformation produced by in-plane shear stresses on its <b>larger</b> <b>faces.</b> For each problem the distribution of the magnetic field throughout the block and the surrounding space is illustrated graphically, along with the corresponding deformation of the block. The rapidly (in space) changing magnitude of the magnetic field in the neighbourhood of the faces of the block is highlighted...|$|R

He had to Mr. Brumley's eyes a restored look, as though his self-confidence had been thoroughly done up since their last encounter. Bygones were bygones. Mr. Brumley was admitted as one is admitted to any normal home.

60|$|Here all {{the people}} were so much changed, that he {{scarcely}} knew them. False hair, false colour, false calves, false muscles--they had become different beings.

There was a gorgeous banquet ready spread for the third act, consisting of two pasteboard vases, one plate of biscuits, a black bottle, and a vinegar cruet; and, in short, everything was on a scale of the utmost splendour and preparation.|$|E
40|$|For {{integers}} g,m ≥ 0 and n> 0, let S_g(n,m) {{denote the}} graph taken uniformly at random {{from the set}} of all graphs on { 1, 2, [...] ., n} with exactly m=m(n) edges and with genus at most g. We use counting arguments to investigate the components, subgraphs, maximum degree, and <b>largest</b> <b>face</b> size of S_g(n,m), finding that there is often different asymptotic behaviour depending on the ratio m/n. In our main results, we show that the probability that S_g(n,m) contains any given non-planar component converges to 0 as n →∞ for all m(n); the probability that S_g(n,m) contains a copy of any given planar graph converges to 1 as n →∞ if m/n > 1; the maximum degree of S_g(n,m) is Θ (n) with high probability if m/n > 1; and the <b>largest</b> <b>face</b> size of S_g(n,m) has a threshold around m/n= 1 where it changes from Θ (n) to Θ (n) with high probability.
