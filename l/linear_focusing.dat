If the plasma ions remain stationary a uniform ion column results which provides a <b>linear</b> <b>focusing</b> force for both the driving and accelerated beams. <b>Linear</b> <b>focusing</b> is a cornerstone of PWFA schemes because it provides for ideal beam transport conditions.

Their location was consistently in the lower mesen-cephalon near the junction of the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle.

Bessel beams with their extended <b>linear</b> <b>foci</b> intuitively appear to be better suited for generation of long plasma channels. We report experimental results on creating extended filaments in air using femtosecond Bessel beams.

DLR operates two test benches for the measurement of these parameters with high accuracy in its QUARZ Center.

40|$|Beams {{injected}} into a <b>linear</b> <b>focusing</b> channel typically have {{some degree of}} space-charge nonuniformity. For unbunched beams with high space-charge intensity propagating in <b>linear</b> <b>focusing</b> channels, Debye screening of self-field interactions tends to make the transverse density profile flat. An injected particle distribution with a large systematic charge nonuniformity will generally be far from an equilibrium of the focusing channel and the initial condition will launch {{a broad spectrum of}} collective modes. These modes can phase-mix and experience nonlinear interactions which result in an effective relaxation to a more thermal-equilibrium-like distribution characterized by a uniform density profile. This relaxation transfers self-field energy from the initial space-charge nonuniformity to the local particle temperature, thereby increasing beam phase space area (emittance growth). Here they employ two-dimensional electrostatic particle in cell (PIC) simulations to investigate the effects of initial transverse space-charge nonuniformities on the equality of beams with high space-charge intensity propagating in a continuous focusing channel. Results are compared to theoretical bounds of emittance growth developed in previous studies. Consistent with earlier theory, it is found that a high degree of initial distribution nonuniformity can be tolerated with only modest emittance growth and that beam control can be maintained. The simulations also provide information on the rate of relaxation and characteristic levels of fluctuations in the relaxed states. This research suggests that a surprising degree of initial space-charge nonuniformity can be tolerated in practical intense beam experiments...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Plasma lenses [1] {{have been}} {{proposed}} for focusing relativistic electron beams to small spot sizes and for luminosity enhancement in future linear colliders. Plasma lenses can be overdense (plasma density, n p, much greater than electron beam density, n b) or underdense (n p < 2 n b). In overdense lenses the space-charge force of the electron beam is canceled by the plasma and the remaining magnetic force causes the electron beam to self-pinch. The focusing gradient is non-linear, resulting in spherical aberrations. In underdense lenses, the self-forces of the electron beam cancel, allowing the plasma ions to focus the beam. Such <b>linear</b> <b>focusing</b> (proportional to n p) leads to more desirable beam qualities.

40|$|Insight is {{provided}} into focused wave group runup {{on a plane}} beach by means of laboratory wave flume experiments and numerical simulations. A focused wave group is presented {{as an alternative to}} an empirical description of the wave conditions leading to extreme runup. Secondorder correction to the laboratory wavemaker generation signal is observed to remove about 60 % of the sub-harmonic error wave that would otherwise contaminate coastal response experiments. Laboratory measurements of the wave runup time history are obtained using inclined resistancetype wires and copper strips attached to the beach surface. The numerical wave runup model is based on hybrid Boussinesq-Nonlinear Shallow Water equations, empirical parameters for wave breaking and bed friction, and a wetting and drying algorithm. After calibration against experimental runup data, the numerical model reproduces satisfactorily the propagation, shoaling and runup of focused wave groups over {{the entire length of the}} wave flume. Results from a comprehensive parametric study show that both measured and predicted maximum runup elevations exhibit strong dependence on the <b>linear</b> <b>focus</b> amplitude of the wave group (linked to its probability of occurrence), the focus location, and the phase of the wave group at focus. The results also demonstrate that extreme runup events owing to focused wave incidence cannot be characterised using spectral parameters alone. The optimal band of focus locations shifts onshore as <b>linear</b> <b>focus</b> amplitude of the incident wave group increases. Optimisation of phase and focus location leads to a maximum runup elevation at each linear amplitude, and, when generated using second-order corrected paddle signals, the maximum runup appears to approach saturation at very large focused wave amplitudes.
