40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is described}} which tests between various equilibrium theories of unemployment using matching data. The Paper shows how to correct econometrically for temporal aggregation effects, where the econometrician’s {{aim is to}} identify a matching process using data which is recorded monthly, and also shows how to identify different unemployment theories on the data. As implementing this test requires information on the inflow of new vacancies over time, this Paper uses employment agency data for the UK over the period 1985 - 99. Although the standard random matching approach provides a reasonably good fit, the empirical evidence provides greater support for ‘stock-flow’ matching. Estimates find that over this period, around 87 % of newly laid-off workers are on the <b>long-side</b> of their markets and so match with the flow of new vacancies as those vacancies come onto the market. In particular, these workers experience average durations of unemployment which exceed six months and their matching rates are highly correlated with the inflow of new vacancies. This job queue interpretation of the matching data {{has important implications for}} government policy on long term unemployment and optimal UI. It also suggests that previous estimates of the so-called matching function have been misspecified, which potentially explains the large variation in results obtained in that literature...|$|E
40|$|The X-ray {{structure}} of the bacterial sodium channel NavAb provides a new template {{for the study of}} sodium and calcium channels. Unlike potassium channels, NavAb contains P 2 he-lices in the outer-pore region. Because the sequence similarity between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sodium channels in this region is poor, the structural similarity is unclear. We analyzed it by using experimental data on tetrodotoxin block of sodium channels. Key tetrodotoxin-binding residues are outer carboxy-lates in repeats I, II, and IV, three positions downstream from the selectivity-filter residues. In a NavAb-based model of Nav 1 channels derived from the sequence alignment without inser-tions/deletions, the outer carboxylates did not face the pore and therefore did not interact with tetrodotoxin. The hypothesis that the evolutionary appearance of Nav 1 channels involved point deletions in an ancestral channel between the selectivity filter and the outer carboxylates allowed building of a NavAb-based model with tetrodotoxin-channel contacts similar to those proposed previously. This hypothesis also allowed us to reproduce in Nav 1 the folding-stabilizing contacts between <b>long-side</b> chain residues in P 1 and P 2, which are seen in NavAb. The NavAb-based inner-pore model of Nav 1 preserved major features of our previous KcsA-based models, including the access pathway for ligands through the repeat III/IV inter-face and their interactions with specific residues. Thus, struc-tural properties of eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channels that are suggested by functional data were reproduced in the NavAb-based models built by using the unaltered template structure but with adjusted sequence alignment. Sequences of eukary-otic calcium channels aligned with NavAb without insertions/ deletions, which suggests that NavAb is a promising basis for the modeling of calcium channels...|$|E
40|$|Solid polymer {{electrolytes}} are a {{key component}} in fuel cell as ion conducting barrier between the two electrochemical reactive electrodes and their conductivity significantly determines {{the performance of the}} cells. The conductivity of the electrolyte membranes is typically based on a nanoscale phase separation that results in an ionic conductive network and a stabilizing matrix. In sulfonated ionomers the sulfonic acid groups are solvated and a hydrophilic proton conducting aqueous ionic phase is formed in a self-assembling process upon solidification of the membrane. The hydrophobic polymer back-bones which may be perfluorinated as in case of Nafion-type molecules or aromatic as in case of multi-block copolymers provide mechanical stabilization. Consequently, the membrane properties at or close to the surface may differ from the bulk of the membrane and its structure and conductivity are crucial as interface between membrane and electrode/catalyst. Different types of sulfonated membranes, perfluorinated Nafion® (<b>long-side</b> chain molecules) and Aquivion® (short side chain molecules) membranes, and aromatic multiblock copolymer membrane named JST (JSR Corp., Japan) have been investigated. Beside the investigation of surfaces freshly cut cross section from Nafion and Aquivion samples have been examined.

40|$|The {{image of}} George Romney {{presented}} {{in his early}} biographies is of a successful society portraitist by day but the creator of `sublime and infernal reveries' at night by candlelight. Today these passionate designs from literature are characterized as proto- Romantic but, paradoxically, they were created {{within the context of}} a disciplined renaissance-humanist tradition. Romney's amateur and professional literary friends supplied him with a profusion of potential subjects and produced eulogistic verses about the artist and his works, stressing his sensitivity, seclusion, humble origins and natural genius. Taking their cue from the formulaic writings about artists from antiquity and the renaissance, the poets applied to Romney legends concerning artistic predispositions towards melancholy and emotional depth and provided a format in which his works of sentimental or tragic themes could be appreciated. The desired end result of their concerted and contrived enterprise was a fame for the artist which also reflected glory on the writers. Post-Romantic-historical methodologies have taken for granted that deference on the part of the artist t wards a visors and patrons carried negative associations and have underestimated the collaborative nature of creativity in the eighteenth century. George Romney's career demonstrates that even within changing social and creative orders, and a <b>long-side</b> more modem impulses, longstanding traditions involving a close association between artists and advisors, striving for mutual benefits, survived well into the early-Romantic period. Examination of the extensive money primary source material, including correspondence with literary friends and his jottings on subjects and artistic theories in notebooks is undertaken within the context o f an analysis of Romney's works and the means of their promulgation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the air {{infiltration}} through the envelope of a naturally ventilated stone church located in Bergby (Gävle, Sweden) is studied. The project {{is focused on}} Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) modeling the air change rate (ACH) inside the church hall and studying the factors (stack effect and wind effect) that influence the air infiltration. The weather parameters outside the building were recorded in a weather station and {{the properties of the}} air inside the church was analyzed with different methods. Infrared thermography techniques and thermistors were used to measure the temperature inside, the tracer gas method to measure the ACH and the blower door technique to measure the tightness of the building envelope. In order to know the pressure coefficients on the church envelope a physical model of the building was studied in a wind tunnel. Firstly, only the values obtained from the weather station were used to calculate the predictors of ACH and see which parameter influence more on its variation:  temperature difference (∆T) indicating the stack effect; and wind speed (WS), the component of wind speed perpendicular to the <b>long-side</b> facades of the church (WS 90) and their square values (WS 2 and WS 902) indicating the wind effect. The data obtained in the wind tunnel were later used to do the MLR study with new predictors for indicating wind effect (∆Cp∙WS, ∆Cp∙WS 2, ∆CpOUT-IN·A∙WS, ∆CpOUT-IN·A∙WS 2, ∆CpC-H∙WS, ∆CpC-H∙WS 2). Better prediction of ACH was obtained with the square of the wind speed (WS 2) instead of the magnitude itself (WS). However, the latter (WS) provided better results than the regression with the magnitude of the perpendicular component of the wind (WS 90). Although wind speed influences in ACH, it alone seems to be a very poor predictor of ACH since has a negative correlation with ΔT when the data under study include both day and night. However when high wind speed are detected it has quite strong influence. The most significant predictions of ACR were attained with the combined predictors ∆T & WS and ∆T & ∆CpOUT-IN·A∙WS 2. The main conclusion taken from the MLR analysis is that the stack effect is the most significant factor influencing the ACH inside the church hall. This leads to suggest that an effective way of reducing ACH could be sealing the floor and ceiling of the church because from those areas the air infiltration has big influence on the ACH inside the church hall, and more in this case that have been noted that the floor is very leaky. Although different assumptions have been done during the analyses that contribute to make the predictions deviate from reality, at the end {{it would be possible to}} asses that MLR can be a useful tool for analyzing the relative importance of the driving forces for ACR in churches and similar buildings, as long as the included predictors not are too mutually correlated, and that attained models that are statistically significant also are physically realistic.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in developing}} shape-changing soft materials for potential applications in drug delivery, microfluidics and biosensing. These shape- changing materials are inspired by the morphological changes exhibited by plants in nature, such as the Venus flytrap. One specific class of shape-change is that from a flat sheet to a folded structure (e. g., a tube). Such “self-folding” materials are usually composed of polymer hydrogels, and these typically fold in response to external stimuli such as pH and temperature. In order to develop these hydrogels for the previously described applications, {{it is necessary to}} expand the range of triggers. The focus of this dissertation is the advancement of shape-changing polymer hydrogels that are sensitive to uncommon cues such as specific biomolecules (enzymes), the substrates for such enzymes, or specific multivalent cations. First, we describe a hybrid gel that responds to the presence of low concentrations of a class of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The hybrid gel was created by utilizing photolithographic techniques to combine two or more gels with distinct chemical composition into the same material. Certain portions of the hybrid gel are composed of a biopolymer derivative with crosslinkable groups. The hybrid gel is flat in water; however, in the presence of MMPs, the regions containing the biopolymer are degraded and the flat sheet folds to form a 3 D structure. We demonstrate that hydrogels with different patterns can transform into different 3 D structures such as tubes, helices and pancakes. Furthermore, this shape change can be made to occur at physiological concentrations of enzymes. Next, we report a gel with two layers that undergoes a shape change in the presence of glucose. The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) is immobilized in one of the layers. GOx catalyzes the conversion of glucose to gluconic acid. The production of gluconic acid decreases the local pH. The decrease in local pH causes one of the layers to swell. As a result, the flat sheet folds to form a tube. The tube unfolds to form a flat sheet when it is transferred to a solution with no glucose present. Therefore, this biomolecule- triggered shape transformation is reversible, meaning the glucose sensing gel is reusable. Furthermore, this shape change only occurs in the presence of glucose and it does not occur in the presence of other small sugars such as fructose. In our final study, we report the shape change of a gel with two layers in the presence of multivalent ions such as Ca 2 + and Sr 2 +. The gel consists of a passive layer and an active layer. The passive layer is composed of dimethylyacrylamide (DMAA), which does not interact with multivalent ions. The active layer consists of DMAA and the biopolymer alginate. In the presence of Ca 2 + ions, the alginate chains crosslink and the active layer shrinks. As a result, the gel converts from a flat sheet to a folded tube. What is particularly unusual is the direction of folding. In most cases, when flat rectangular gels fold, they do so about their short-side. However, our gels typically fold about their <b>long-side.</b> We hypothesize that non-homogeneous swelling determines the folding axis...|$|E
40|$|Self-folding polymer {{films were}} only {{recently}} proposed {{as an alternative}} method {{for the design of}} three-dimensional constructs. Due to the relative novelty of the approach, insufficient amount of data on the behavior of such systems is available in the literature. This study is bound to fill the gaps and give a deeper insight into the understanding of how and why different types of folding occur. In this study, four different types of folding of polymer bilayers are presented. Rectangles are one of the simplest geometrical forms and were therefore adopted as a convenient initial system for the investigation of the folding behavior of polymer bilayers. We chose PNIPAM for the active polymer, as it is a well-studied polymer with sharp Lower Critical Transition Temperature at around 33 C. For the passive layer, poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(caprolactone) were chosen. The influence of different parameters of the system, such as polymer thickness and temperature was thoroughly investigated in order to be accounted for in later experiments. It was demonstrated that bilayers placed on a substrate start to roll from the corners due to quicker diffusion of water. Rolling from the <b>long-side</b> starts later but dominates at high aspect ratio. We showed that the main reasons causing a variety of rolling scenarios are (i) non-homogenous swelling due to slow diffusion of water in hydrogels and (ii) adhesion of polymer to a substrate until a certain threshold. Moreover, non-homogenous swelling determines folding in the first moments, while adhesion plays a decisive role at later stages of folding. After having understood the abovementioned basics, we decided to explore how those applied to more complex shapes. For the purpose, four- and six-arm stars were chosen, the main idea behind this being the creation of self-folding polymer capsules capable of encapsulation of microparticles and cells. Adjusting the polymer thickness and thus the radius of folding allowed creating structures, capable of reversible self-folding and unfolding. The possibility to reversibly encapsulate and release objects in the micro-range was demonstrated on the example of yeast cells. Noteworthy, the capsules were produced by means of the same process we used for the design of tubes – when compared to the folding of rectangles, it was the shape of the initial pattern and the folding radius that were changed; the mechanism was the same – simple one-step folding towards the center of the bilayer. Clearly the number of structures that can be generated by this method is fairly limited. The search for means to overcome this constraint led to the idea of hierarchical multi-step folding. Due to the edge-activation of the bilayers, the observed deformed shapes differ from the classical ones obtained by homogeneous activation. It was found that films could demonstrate several kinds of actuation behavior such as wrinkling, bending and folding that result in a variety of shapes. It was demonstrated that one can introduce hinges into the folded structure by proper design of the bilayer's external shape through diffusion without having to use site selective deposition of active polymers. Experimental observations led us to derive four empirical rules: 1) “Bilayer polymer films placed on a substrate start to fold from their periphery and the number of formed wrinkles/tubes decreases until the angle between adjacent wrinkles/tubes approaches 130 °”; 2) “After the wrinkles along the perimeter of the film form tubes, further folding proceeds along the lines connecting the vertexes of the folded film”; 3) “The folding goes along the lines which are closer to the periphery of the films”; 4) „Folding of the rays may result in blocking of the neighboring rays if the angle between the base of the folded ray and the shoulders of the neighboring rays is close to 180 °”. These rules were then applied to direct the folding of edge-activated polymer bilayers through a concrete example - the design of a 3 D pyramid. One consequence of the second and third rules is that generally triangles are formed during the multi-step folding process. In order to create a cube, or any other 3 D structure with non-triangular sides, an effective way to stop the folding along the lines, connecting neighboring vertexes had to be thought of. A possible solution would be the insertion of a rigid element inside the bilayer, perpendicular to the direction of folding. The solution of this problem was to design structures with pores. A pore would normally decrease the rigidity of a structure but in our case, a pore basically comprised an edge inside the structure and could thus form tubes which, as was already shown, exhibit much higher rigidity than a film. On the other hand, a pore, or many pores, would expose different parts of the active layer to the solvent and would strongly influence its swelling and, as a consequence, folding behavior. Hence, the influence of a pore on the swelling and the folding behavior of polymer bilayers had to be investigated. It was shown that pores of the right form and dimensions did indeed hinder the folding as intended. Instead, the polymer films took other ways to fold. As a result, despite the correctness of our reasoning, we failed to produce a cube by hierarchical folding of polymer bilayers. However, other sophisticated 3 D objects were obtained, further increasing the arsenal of available structures, as well as giving an in-depth insight on the folding process...|$|E
