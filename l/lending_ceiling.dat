40|$|History {{suggests}} the following stylized facts about default on sovereign debt:(1) Defaults {{are associated with}} identifiably bad states of the world. (2) Defaults are usually partial, rather than complete. (3) Sovereign states usually are able to borrow again soon after a default. Motivated by these facts, this paper analyses a reputational equilibrium in a model that interprets sovereign debts as contingent claims that both finance investments and facilitate risk shifting. Loans are a useful device to facilitate risk shifting because they permit the prepayment of indemnities. Nevertheless, because the power to abrogate commitments without having to answer to a higher enforcement authority is an essential aspect of sovereignty, a decision by a sovereign to validate lender expectations about debt servicing depends on the sovereign's concern for its trust worthy reputation. A trustworthy reputationis valuable because it provides continued access to loans. A key aspect of the analysis is that lenders differentiate excusable default, which is associated with implicitly understood contingencies, from unjustifiable repudiation. In the reputational equilibrium, the short-run benefits from repudiation are smaller than the long-run costs from loss of a trustworthy reputation. Thus, although sovereigns sometimes excusably default, they never repudiate their debts. The reputational equilibrium can involve efficient risk shifting and efficient investment or it can involve a binding <b>lending</b> <b>ceiling</b> that limits risk shifting and can also restrict investment. The factors that tend to produce a binding <b>lending</b> <b>ceiling</b> include a high time discount rate for the sovereign, low-risk aversion forthe sovereign, and a low net return from the sovereign's investments. ...|$|E
40|$|The 'market discipline' {{approach}} to subnational finance requires that moral hazard {{derived from the}} possibility of a central government bailout be made insignificantly small. Therefore, governments interested in following this approach and willing to abide by its rules should start by creating the conditions for a default and its resolution to be possible. This article discusses the use of <b>lending</b> <b>ceilings</b> as an instrument to allow the default, without dragging in the central government.

5000|$|Competition {{and credit}} control (CCC) was a {{monetary}} policy {{operated by the}} Bank of England from September 1971 until the autumn of 1973. Under this policy the bank sought to control money supply indirectly through open market operations, instead of through the direct <b>lending</b> <b>ceilings</b> imposed on individual banks used formerly. Reserve Asset Ratios were imposed on all financial institutions where formerly cash and liquidity rations had applied to major clearing banks only. [...] In practice, sterling money supply increased rapidly following introduction. At the end of 1973, the Supplementary Special Deposit Scheme re-established direct controls on lending.|$|R
50|$|Financial sector {{reform has}} also progressed with partial {{interest}} rate liberalization. Interest {{rates have been}} liberalized on deposits, while a <b>lending</b> rate <b>ceiling</b> has been set above the discount rate. The Libyan Stock Exchange, established in 2007, is the first exchange {{of its kind in}} the country.|$|R
40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are {{the backbone of}} most Asian economies. The main obstacle {{to the development of}} the SME sector is the lack of stable finance. Considering the bank-dominated characteristic of economies in Asia, banks are the main source of financing, and the lack of a comprehensive credit rating database has been a bottleneck for SMEs. This paper examines how a credit rating scheme for SMEs can be developed, when access to other financial and non-financial ratios is not possible, by using data on lending by banks to SMEs. We employ statistical techniques on five variables from a sample of Thai SMEs and classify them into subgroups based on their financial health. By employing these techniques, banks could reduce information asymmetry and consequently set interest rates and <b>lending</b> <b>ceilings</b> for SMEs. This would ease financing to healthy SMEs and reduce the amount of non-performing loans to this important sector...|$|R
40|$|In Asia, {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) account for a major share of employment and dominate the economy. Asian economies are often characterized as having bank-dominated financial systems and underdeveloped capital markets, in particular venture capital markets. Hence, looking for new methods of financing for SMEs is crucial. Hometown investment trust funds (HIT) are a new form of financial intermediation that has now been adopted as a national strategy in Japan. In this paper, we explain the importance of SMEs in Asia and describe about HITs. We then provide a scheme for the credit rating of SMEs by employing two statistical analysis techniques, principal components analysis and cluster analysis, and applying various financial variables to 1, 363 SMEs in Asia. Adoption of this comprehensive and efficient method would enable banks to group SME customers based on financial health, adjust interest rates on loans, and set <b>lending</b> <b>ceilings</b> for each group. Moreover, this method is applicable to HITs around the world...|$|R
50|$|Research was {{conducted}} after Zambia reopened an old debate on a <b>lending</b> rate <b>ceiling</b> for {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The issue originally {{came to the fore}} during the financial liberalisations of the 1990s and again as microfinance increased in prominence with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank in 2006. It was over the appropriateness of regulatory intervention to limit the charging of rates that are deemed, by policymakers, to be excessively high.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses newly {{collected}} {{data from the}} Reserve Bank of India {{to examine the effects}} of various types of banking sector controls on the process of financial deepening. With the exception of a <b>lending</b> rate <b>ceiling,</b> these controls are found to influence financial deepening negatively, independently of the well-known effect of the real interest rate. Exogeneity tests suggest that financial deepening and economic growth are jointly determined. Thus, policies which affect financial deepening may also have an influence on economic growth.

50|$|With these caveats, it is {{worthwhile}} to consider how reputation concerns can lead to credit rationing. The seminal contribution is by Jonathan Eaton and Mark Gersovitz, who consider a simple model of international lending for a small open economy. Lenders set a maximum amount {{they are willing to}} <b>lend</b> (credit <b>ceiling),</b> which might be smaller or larger than the borrowing needs of the country. Countries face a penalty if they default, and whenever they are supposed to make debt payments, they consider whether they would be better off by defaulting, paying the penalty, and be forever barred from international credit markets, or pay the debt installment, borrowing again, and making the same decision next period.|$|R
40|$|Interest {{rates are}} a topical {{subject in the}} micro lending {{industry}} in South Africa. The micro lending industry {{has been accused of}} charging usurious interest and exploitating the consumers. This has led to the Department of Trade and Industry passing a Usury Act with an aim of protecting the consumers. The Act imposes interest rate ceilings on loan finance provided by money <b>lending</b> institutions. These <b>ceilings</b> are proposed to be linked to the prime rate. Given this, it is not possible for micro lenders to charge full-cost recovery interest rates. This paper tries to highlight the effects of interest rate ceilings on the micro finance market. It argues that the biggest cost component of microlenders is administration costs and not the cost of capital, thus linking ceilings to the prime rate is illogic. Financial Economics,...|$|R
