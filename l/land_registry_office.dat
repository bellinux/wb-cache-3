30|$|Since in {{the future}} number and {{location}} of GMO fields might change considerably, the integration of geometries of Bt-maize fields into the WebGIS should be improved by an automation of the update procedure. Difficulties arise when no free Web services on ALK data are available to locate the respective GMO fields precisely. This {{is the case for}} about one third of all federal states in Germany. A possible solution is to compile the information directly from <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> <b>offices.</b> But this causes additional costs and is very time consuming. In this context, access to the 'Integrated Administration and Control System' (IASC, in German: InVeKoS = Integriertes Verwaltungs- und Kontrollsystem) would be a better and more efficient solution. Referring to this, in 1992 {{in the course of the}} reform of the 'Common Agriculture Policy' (GAP) the implementation of an 'IASC' was decided. It was introduced in Germany as per regulation no. 1782 / 2003 on December 3 th 2004 (BGBl. 1 p. 3194) in order to define cultivation premiums. However, a nationwide information system on spatial and temporal cultivation patterns integrating agricultural data of all federal states has not been established, yet. In completion with information provided by the official GMO location register, such information platform could be used for detection of potential conflict regions with regard to conventional and Bt-maize cultivation. Since access to these data is not possible so far, future work aims at detection of maize fields by remote sensing data to integrate these data into the WebGIS application.|$|R

50|$|Although in 1890 Marienberg {{had only}} 707 (mostly Evangelical) {{inhabitants}} and was officially {{said to be}} a village, it already had a considerable infrastructure at its disposal: the village had a provincial council office (Landratsamt), a court (Landgericht Limburg an der Lahn), a taxation and <b>land</b> <b>registry</b> <b>office,</b> a post and telegraph office, a credit union and an agency for the Nassauische Landesbank. Moreover, there was a tannery in the village, and nearby were brown coal and ironstone mines along with clay pits.|$|E
50|$|The ancient {{main street}} through {{the centre of}} the village running south to Leicester and north towards Coalville was {{classified}} as the A50 under the British road numbering scheme, but this road has now bypassed much of the village due to two road schemes in the 1980s and 90s. The village also has easy access to the A46 Leicester Western Bypass and the M1 (J22 North and J21a South).A 2011 survey, using 60 sets of data from police, <b>Land</b> <b>Registry,</b> Ofsted and <b>Office</b> for National Statistics named the village as the best place in the East Midlands to bring up children.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to analyze London residential housing market {{in the period of}} time from 1995 to 2016. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the emphasis is put on the definition of theories related to the topic. It includes the reasons why house prices are worth measuring. Another point of the theory are the economic fundaments which influence the house prices. The main topic and result of this bachelor thesis is a deep analysis of the development of house prices in London. Based on the analysis, in the conclusion, it is enabled to evaluate the stability of the market. It is particularly the problematics of high house prices and affordabulity, which is solved in this document. These topics have become increasingly popular in London, recently. The work concentrates data from many fields, which affect developments housing markets, in one document. Thanks to it, the work provides comprehensibly processed data from statistical authorities such as HM <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> or <b>Office</b> for National Statistics including useful comparisons of important fundamentals...|$|R
40|$|Since 1990 tlie <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> has {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} six new office buildings. As the buildings {{are based on the}} same design and are constructed in the same way from the same materials it was predicted that the post occupancy energy performance and levels of occupancy satisfaction would also be similar. However, initial information received from these buildings suggested varying energy performances and varying levels of occupancy satisfaction. A case study approach was employed to examine the energy performance and occupancy satisfaction at two of the <b>Land</b> <b>Registry</b> new <b>office</b> buildings, Infomnation Systems Office in Plymouth and Tunbridge Wells Office, and, the reasons for the potential differences between them. Quantitative research was use to examine the energy use at the two case study buildings and qualitative research was used to examine occupancy satisfaction at the case study buildings through the use of an occupancy survey and a focus group discussion at the two case study buildings. The research concluded that both offices had similar levels of occupancy satisfaction but had very different overall energy performances. Whilst Infomiation Systems Office and Tunbridge Wells Office had the same gas performance per square meter {{there was a significant difference}} between the electricity performance at Infonnation Systems Office and Tunbridge Wells Office. The research identified BREEAM assessments undertaken at Information Systems Office, the different functions of the two buildings and the different density of staff occupancy within the two buildings as potential reasons for the disparity in electricity performance.
