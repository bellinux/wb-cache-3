No building is permanently still; soil and wind can affect building stability and need to be documented. Finally, the architect or surveyor tests the electrical connections, plumbing, and other utilities present in the building (this is more for historic and re-purposed buildings). For both ancient and historic buildings, lightning conductors and fire-fighting equipment are checked to make sure they can provide sufficient protection.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} spatial and {{environmental}} {{performance of the}} Greek vernacular Architecture of Mount Pelion. The {{main body of the}} work focuses on a well-preserved mansion in the Vysitsa village, which contains the typical architectural features of the Mount Pelion traditional architecture. What characterizes these traditional dwellings is the seasonal migratory <b>living</b> <b>pattern</b> in response to the external environmental conditions. This study investigated the luminous and thermal environments in the chosen building, which was designed and constructed, based on accumulated knowledge and past experiences to provide environmental delight to the occupants. The conclusions derived from this study establish an appreciation and understanding of the occupants ’ past living habits and seasonal needs. The findings from this research will be useful references for the architectural designers and environmental engineers working in the field of sustainable design. The migratory <b>living</b> <b>pattern</b> evident in the vernacular dwellings at Mount Pelion is a <b>living</b> <b>pattern</b> that we should learn from and potentially re-apply in modern design...|$|E
