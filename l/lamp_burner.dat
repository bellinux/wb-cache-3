50|$|The <b>lamp</b> <b>burner</b> has a flat wick, {{usually made}} of cotton. The {{lower part of}} the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the <b>lamp</b> <b>burner,</b> which {{includes}} a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick, and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the <b>lamp</b> <b>burner.</b> Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the wick. If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone {{at the top of the}} wick tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat wick lamps use the dead flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above.|$|E
5000|$|A flat-wick lamp is {{a simple}} type of {{kerosene}} lamp, which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action. If this type of lamp is broken it can easily start a fire. A flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank (fount), with the <b>lamp</b> <b>burner</b> attached. Attached to the fuel tank, four prongs hold the glass chimney, which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft. The glass chimney needs a [...] "throat," [...] or slight constriction, to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel; the draft carries more air (oxygen) past the flame, helping to produce a smokeless light which is brighter than an open flame would produce.|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectrical {{breakdown}} in near-atmospheric pressure noble gasses requires voltages that are quite high, which is undesirable {{for a large}} number of possible applications. Metallic structures (antennas) were used on the outer side of the <b>lamp</b> <b>burner</b> to enhance the electric field locally while keeping the same potential difference across the electrodes. Optical and electrical measurements were performed in an argon or xenon atmosphere at 0. 3 or 0. 7 bar, with 4 or 7 mm between the electrode tips. We used rod-shaped tungsten electrodes of 0. 6 mm in diameter. We found that both active and passive antennas facilitate breakdown, and we demonstrated {{the differences between the two}} types and their effects on the breakdown process...|$|E
40|$|Antenna {{structures}} are not {{often used as}} a way to influence the breakdown process in gases. However, they do show great potential for lowering the ignition voltage of high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps. We used HID <b>lamp</b> <b>burners</b> filled with pure argon to test the effects that a simple active antenna can have on the breakdown process. We show the photographs of the process and explain why it is different from the case without antenna structures...|$|R
50|$|The {{designers}} {{of the building}} intended to use the gas not just for illumination, but also in burners for laboratory operations. For any <b>burner</b> <b>lamp,</b> it was desirable to maximize the temperature and minimize luminosity. However, existing laboratory <b>burner</b> <b>lamps</b> left much to be desired not {{just in terms of}} the heat of the flame, but also regarding economy and simplicity.|$|R
40|$|An optical {{study of}} pulse, dc, and ac (50 – 400 kHz) {{ignition}} of {{metal halide lamps}} has been performed by investigating intensified CCD camera images of the discharges. The ceramic <b>lamp</b> <b>burners</b> were filled with xenon gas at pressures of 300 and 700 mbar. In comparison with dc and pulse ignition, igniting with an ac voltage decreases the ignition voltage by up to 56 % and the breakdown time scales get much longer (~ 10 - 3 s compared with ~ 10 - 7 s for pulse ignition). Increasing the ac frequency decreases the ignition voltages and changes the ionization channel shapes. External irradiation of UV light can have either an increasing or a decreasing effect on ignition voltages...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{frequency}} {{on the characteristics}} of AC-driven breakdown processes in 0. 7 bar argon is investigated by means of a two-dimensional fluid model. The geometry represents the HID <b>lamp</b> <b>burner</b> with a pin-pin electrode system forming a 7 mm electrode gap. The breakdown process is considered in the frequency range between 60 kHz and 1 MHz. The appearance of the discharge and the influence of the voltage frequency on its characteristics obtained in the simulations is in good agreement with the experimental data (accompanying paper- Sobota et al., submitted for publication in J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., Special issue on LS 12 /WLED 3 symposium). The role of the secondary electron emission from the electrode surfaces is demonstrated and linked to the lowering of the threshold voltage with the increase of frequency observed both in experiment and model...|$|E
40|$|Biogas is {{obtained}} from anaerobic digestion of biodegradable {{materials such as}} agricultural waste, animal waste, and othertype of household solid waste and its main constituents are CH 4 and CO 2. Effects of the concentration of each species are very important in the biogas combustion. The present study focuses {{on the effect of}} inlet velocities of methane and air on the flame temperature in a biogas <b>burner</b> <b>lamp.</b> The model of biogas <b>burner</b> <b>lamp</b> is constructed by using the CFD software GAMBIT and the simulation process was performed by using Fluent Software. The flame temperature obtained is 2172 k when the inlet velocities of methane and air are 0. 2 m/s and 0. 8 m/s respectively.

50|$|The <b>lamps</b> and <b>burners</b> {{were the}} first of that size and {{description}} ever constructed for petroleum oil, and burnt with great certainty and less variation of flame than other petroleum burners. The Portmaster was concerned, however, {{as to whether he}} was justified in having only one lightkeeper on the island, considering its nearness to Fraser Island. The lights were two nautical miles apart, over a bad road, and the keeper, while at one light, left his family unprotected near the other lighthouse. Also, in the case of sudden illness, there was no person able to light the distant light, which might have led to very serious results.|$|R
50|$|The Carcel is {{a former}} French unit for {{measuring}} the intensity of light. The unit was defined in 1860 as the intensity of a Carcel <b>lamp</b> with standard <b>burner</b> and chimney dimensions, which burnt colza oil (obtained from the seed of the plant Brassica campestris) {{at a rate of}} 42 grams of colza oil per hour with a flame 40 millimeters in height.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, {{the eternal}} flame was shared {{for the first}} time in its history. On June 18, a U.S. Army honor guard {{accompanied}} Irish Minister of State Paul Kehoe, T.D., in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Kennedy grave site. An Irish Army officer, accompanied by an Irish Army honor guard, lit a lamp in a metal burner from the eternal flame. (The <b>lamp</b> and <b>burner</b> were created by the Bullfinch company, which also designed the torches for the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.) The [...] "spark" [...] traveled back to Ireland aboard a special Aer Lingus flight, accompanied by Kehoe, Irish Army personnel, and a delegation from the New Ross Town Council.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Ceravision Limited {{introduced}} the first High Efficiency Plasma (HEP) lamp under the trade name Alvara. This lamp replaces the opaque ceramic waveguide used in earlier lamps with an optically clear quartz waveguide giving greatly increased efficiency. In previous <b>lamps,</b> though the <b>burner,</b> or bulb, was very efficient, the opaque ceramic waveguide severely obstructed {{the collection of}} light. A quartz waveguide allows all of {{the light from the}} plasma to be collected.|$|R
50|$|The lamp {{consists}} of four integrated elements; a quartz RF resonator and integral plasma <b>burner</b> (<b>lamp),</b> a transition unit (the system which couples the RF source to the resonator), a magnetron, and an AC power supply. The resonator and integrated burner contain an inert gas and metal halide salts. Microwave energy ionizes the gas to form the plasma which combines with the metal halide to vaporize the metal halide salts and produce the light.|$|R
50|$|A beacon in {{the island}} began to {{function}} on December 11, 1884. The beacon was constructed in the southern stretch of the island and provided ships {{with an opportunity to}} enter Baku bay at night. The beacon is a stone residential building with three-metered tower on a roof, along with a <b>lamp.</b> A kerosene-wick <b>burner,</b> and then a gas lamp with a light-optic apparatus of the 4th degree, which was specially produced in Sweden, illuminates a way for ships.|$|R
5000|$|Larger Gaz refillable butane {{cylinders}} come {{in three}} sizes. The 901 cylinder contains 0.454 kg of gas in a 161 mm high cylinder with a 110 mm diameter, the 904 contains 1.81 kg in a 188 mm high cylinder with a 202 mm diameter, and the 907 (the largest commonly used size) contains 2.72 kg in a 250 mm high cylinder with a 202 mm diameter. [...] They are self-resealing, {{so they need}} not be empty when disconnected. The container is fitted with an M16x1.5 internal screw thread onto which a specific Campingaz pressure regulator is connected (or on recent installations a pigtail hose leading to the regulator). This {{is followed by the}} appliance (<b>lamp,</b> cooker <b>burners</b> etc.) attached either by a short rigid pipe or a longer flexible hose. These are typically used for applicances like multi-ring cookers, gas refrigerators, grills or heaters and are frequently used in boats, caravans and motorhomes in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A central draught lamp, or Argand lamp, {{works in}} the same manner as the flat wick <b>lamp.</b> The <b>burner</b> is {{equipped}} with a tall glass chimney, of around 12 inches tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of cotton, that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a [...] "carrier," [...] which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the [...] "central draft" [...] or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.|$|R
40|$|On high-energy {{discharge}} <b>lamps</b> with <b>burners</b> {{consisting of}} polycrystalline aluminum oxide (PCA) corrosion leads to relocation {{of the wall}} material; {{the extent of the}} phenomenon depends on the composition and the wetting behaviour of the liquid salt mixture contained in the lamp. The aim of this work was to better comprehend these phenomena. For this the wetting behaviours of several iodides on PCA- and carbon plates in a water-free argon atmosphere was determined in a contact angle measurement apparatus. While pure salts show good or, at high temperatures, complete wetting, the surface wetting of binary salt mixtures is positively worse, even if only small amounts of the second component are present. From the contact angle measurements the surface tension of the pure salts could be determined. By combining the YOUNG-LAPLACE-Equation with the BUTLER-Equation, the excess GIBBS energy could be related to the contact angles of salt mixtures, which makes the estimation of their wetting properties possible. The extent of the corrosion was determined by annealing experiments in a temperature gradient. No corrosion was found in reference experiments without any salt. In addition to diverse corrosion phenomena the formation of cerium aluminate was observed in some cases. All these effects could also be reproduced by computer simulations, for which a special program was developed. This program may lead to the development of advanced software in the future which can calculate the shape and corrosivity of lamp-relevant salt melts...|$|R
40|$|Acid rain (rain with a pH of {{less than}} 5. 6) is able to leach several metals from sediments and soils, among the metals that pass into ground water and, some times surface water is aluminum, which is {{believed}} to be toxic to fish, other aquatic organisms and several plant species. Difficulties is measurement of aluminium by AAS arises from the effect of interferences generally results in relatively high detection limits. This paper deals with the mathematical evaluation of important experimental parameters including concentration, <b>burner</b> height, <b>lamp</b> current and fuel/oxidant ratio influencing the AAS response of aluminium. Factorial design was used to obtain reliable information for the effects of each parameter or their combined influence. The statistical models obtained make it possible to evaluate the weight to any experimental value and obtain an idea for possible analytical application of the systems studied. Results indicates that the most significant input factors affecting absorbtion signal are the instrumental parameters.

40|$|The {{accomplished}} {{investigations in}} the context of the available work concerning the high-temperature corrosion of polycrystalline alumina (PCA) by halides of the alkalis and the lanthanides are from special interest in the lamp industry. Mixtures from alkali halides and halides of the lanthanides are an indispensable component of modern metal halide lamps. The halides of the lanthanides produce a very line-rich emission spectrum in the arc of the gas-discharge lamp within the visible range which is very close to that of the natural sunlight. Caused by the high temperatures and temperature gradients in a burner vessel chemical reactions between the lamp filling and the wall of the discharge vessel as well as the electrodes take place. Chemical transport can be observed, which can finally lead to a reduction of the wall thickness and to a failure of the lamp. The goal of this work is the clearing-up of the so far not understood mechanisms of the corrosion processes observed in metal halide <b>lamps</b> with PCA <b>burners.</b> For the improvement of the lamp characteristics it is finally the goal of describing these lamps in a computer-model in order to be able to make statements concerning the corrosion behavior. Apart from the understanding of the corrosion mechanisms it is important for the modelling to identify the formed corrosion phases and to determine their thermochemical data.
