Despite the fact that Niki no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{has served}} as the {{executive}} producer {{over the course of the}} series' entire history, and functioned as the showrunner from the series' debut in 1999 until 2004. The series went on hiatus in 2002, after Hillenburg halted production to work on a feature film of the series, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Once the film was finalized and the third season finished, Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner. Although he no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> a direct role in the production of the series, he still maintains an advisory role and reviews each episode.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{plans for an}} {{intermediate}} stop at the current Woodside LIRR station, and an additional 63rd Street line station at Northern Boulevard adjacent to Queens Plaza. The bypass and proposed Woodside station would have necessitated the widening of the LIRR Main Line right-of-way onto private property west of Winfield Junction, where the Main Line merges with the Port Washington Branch, and reorganization of the track layout in the Sunnyside Yards. Later proposals suggested routing the bypass directly to the Archer Avenue line via the LIRR Montauk Branch (which no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> passenger service).|$|E

He also said that he no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not {{bringing}} him a dirt bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands {{in front of}} the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> to give him a dirt bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are.|$|E
5|$|Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall {{stations}} were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop, although the line through them remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 {{by members of}} the London Railway Preservation Society to use as a permanent base, and now houses the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, but no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> a scheduled passenger service. There are no longer any open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. Plans have been proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a heritage railway.|$|E

5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment {{was forced}} to turn back from Tam Kỳ {{to deal with an}} attack on Thang Binh, by the Viet Cong 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the Viet Cong 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down trying to deal with Viet Cong attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising that he no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, {{citing a}} drop in {{production}} and difficulty servicing significant debt {{as a result of}} the 1998 Mafco transaction, shareholder MacAndrews & Forbes agreed to a debt restructuring arrangement with Panavision's creditors. Private equity firm Cerberus Capital was the lead investor in the deal, which involved a US$140 million reduction in debt and a US$40 million cash infusion. In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> any equity in the company. In June 2013, its creditors sued over an unpaid debt of $1.7 million, threatening to dissolve the company if they win.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Tasmania, Whitemore no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> {{passenger}} rail transport; the last Tasmanian passenger rail service stopped in 1978 and the service to Whitemore prior to that. Rail transport for Whitemore opened in the late 1870s. The first passenger train was on 27 April 1870 and the rail line opened for regular traffic in February 1871. This transport was from a siding rather than a station. The Whitemore siding did not have a full-time station master and was not a regular stop; passengers had to request the train stop or flag the train for a pickup. The town’s only regular transport services as of 2014 are Redline Coaches' private school-bus services.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E

The Smoking Man calls Skinner's bluff, knowing he no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> the tape, but Skinner reveals that Albert and twenty other Navajo have memorized the {{contents}} of the tape and are ready to reveal it if either Mulder or Scully are harmed. Mulder meets with Scully at the hospital, who reveals that her sister died a few hours before. Mulder tells Scully that he believes that the truth is still in the X-Files. Scully {{tells him that}} she's heard the truth, and now what she wants are the answers.|$|E
5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no <b>longer</b> <b>has</b> a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form.
