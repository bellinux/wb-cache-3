5|$|Ten were {{transferred}} to the United Kingdom under <b>Lend-Lease.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 890th {{began to}} fly <b>Lend-Lease</b> B-25 Mitchells {{in the spring}} of 1944 and was itself re-designated as the 890th Bomber Aviation Regiment on 26 December 1944. The 362nd APDD was formed in early 1944 with four Pe-8s {{received}} from the other two regiments, but these were returned {{in the spring of}} 1944, when the regiment began to convert to the <b>Lend-Lease</b> Mitchells.|$|E
5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for <b>lend-lease</b> supply to Allies. It {{was designed to}} provide a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car. It had the same body and chassis as the M5 Half-track (also built by International Harvester for <b>lend-lease)</b> but had the same stowage and radio fit as the M2 Half Track.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on <b>Lend-Lease,</b> Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing <b>Lend-Lease.</b>|$|E
5|$|M32B1 – A M32 {{based on}} the M4A1. 1,085 were {{produced}} by Federal Machine, Baldwin Locomotive, and Pressed Steel Car. Some were also shipped to Britain under <b>Lend-Lease.</b> It was named ARV Mark III by the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Starting in fall 1942, {{large numbers}} of Soviet {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks {{to work with the}} U.S. soldiers already in the town. The massive <b>Lend-Lease</b> effort required additional facilities to be built in and near Fairbanks. Ladd Field expanded in size, and the grounds of the U.S. Army post expanded until it met the city limits of Fairbanks. The University of Alaska, which saw most of its students taken up by the draft, provided office and dormitory space for U.S. and Soviet soldiers. Its professors also contributed to the war effort with specially created Russian language classes. Russian airmen were regular customers of Fairbanks stores, and they bought large amounts of consumer goods unavailable at home. To meet demand when Ladd Field was unusable due to fog, an airfield now known as Eielson Air Force Base was built southeast of Fairbanks. Although there were some conflicts between Soviet and U.S. soldiers and civilians, <b>Lend-Lease</b> operations in Fairbanks continued {{through the end of the}} war, and when <b>Lend-Lease</b> ended in September 1945, 7,926 aircraft and tons of cargo had been transferred to Soviet officials in Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|As built Kalinin lacked any radars, but by 1944 she was {{equipped}} with British and American <b>Lend-Lease</b> radars as well as Soviet-designed systems. A British Type 291 and an American SG radar were used for air search. Two Soviet Yupiter-1 radars were used for main battery fire control while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two British Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{considered}} {{building a}} bridge across Rampart Gorge {{as part of}} a project to extend the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to Nome to facilitate <b>Lend-Lease</b> shipments to the Soviet Union during World War II. The war ended before the project got beyond the planning stages, and the bridge idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Kaganovichs radar suite is unknown, but it {{is likely}} she was {{equipped}} {{with a mix of}} Soviet and British and American <b>Lend-Lease</b> radars. At some point during the 1950s her radars were replaced by modern Soviet-built radars; Gyuys for air search, Rif for surface search, Zalp for main-armament gunnery and Yakor for anti-aircraft gunnery.|$|E
5|$|Kirov lacked any radar {{when war}} broke out in 1941, but by 1944 was {{equipped}} with British <b>Lend-Lease</b> models. One Type 291 was used for air search. One Type 284 and two Type 285 radars were for main battery fire control, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|M14 Half-track – This variant had {{the same}} {{armament}} as the M13 but used the slightly different M5 Half-track chassis built by International Harvester for the <b>Lend-Lease</b> Program. The M14 was mostly supplied to Britain, where they were converted back to regular half-tracks. A total of 1602 were produced by International Harvester.|$|E
5|$|The M16 saw {{service with}} U.S. {{forces in the}} Italian Campaign, and Operation Overlord, the Battle of Arracourt, and the Ardennes Offensive in {{northern}} Europe. Small numbers were supplied to the United Kingdom and France under <b>Lend-Lease.</b> The vehicle was also used widely in the Korean War by the South Korean army, the United States Marine Corps, and the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{combination of}} the M54 mount with the M3A1 Halftrack chassis was designated the M15A1 CGMC. A total of 1,052 were produced in 1943, and a further 600 in 1944. 100 M15s were shipped to the Soviet Union for use under the <b>Lend-Lease</b> policy. Both the M42 mount and M15 CGMC were classified as obsolete in August 1946.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941 Maxim Gorky lacked radar, but she was {{equipped}} with British <b>Lend-Lease</b> radar by 1944. One Type 291 was used for air search. One Type 284 and two Type 285 radars were for main battery fire control, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941, Voroshilov was not {{equipped}} with any radars, but she received a number of British <b>Lend-Lease</b> radars by 1944. One Type 284 and two Type 285 radars were used for main battery fire control. One Type 291 was used for air search, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing the}} Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May Molotov left for Washington, D.C., United States. Molotov met with Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and {{ratified}} a <b>Lend-Lease</b> Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the United States government, albeit vaguely, promised {{to open up}} a second front against Germany. On his flight back to the USSR his plane was attacked by German fighters, and then later by Soviet fighters.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, {{with the return of}} <b>lend-lease</b> bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|E
5|$|CTLS-4TAC – Designed {{for export}} under <b>Lend-Lease,</b> {{a total of}} 420 were produced, {{originally}} intended for China. Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor. The remaining 240 were dispersed for emergency situations, like in Alaska. The armor was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62mm (.30 cal) machine guns, {{one of which was}} mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC was labeled Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine was a British Fort ship {{which was}} built in Canada in 1942. Owned by the American War Shipping Administration, she was leased under charter to the Ministry of War Transport under the <b>Lend-Lease</b> scheme and {{operated}} under {{the management of the}} Port Line. Fort Stikine only had a short career, and was destroyed in an explosion at Bombay, India, in April 1944 that caused the loss of a further thirteen ships.|$|E
5|$|In June 1945, Orizaba was {{transferred}} under <b>Lend-Lease</b> to the Brazilian Navy where {{she served as}} Duque de Caxias (U-11). In August 1945, Duque de Caxis carried parts of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force from Naples back to Rio de Janeiro. The ship was badly damaged by a fire in 1947, but was repaired and remained in service. Permanently transferred to Brazil in 1953, Duque de Caxias was decommissioned in 1959and scrapped in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} supply U.S. allies, much more {{production}} was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 Half-track). International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences {{had to be}} accepted due to different manufacturing methods and components. This led to IH producing for <b>lend-lease</b> the M5 Half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The M3 GMC saw {{limited service}} with other {{countries}} as it was not widely supplied through the <b>Lend-Lease</b> program. A small batch of 170 vehicles was supplied to Britain, which used them in armored car regiments. They were first used in the Tunisian Campaign with the Royal Dragoons. They were also used in Sicily, Italy, and later in France, but were gradually retired. The Free French Army also used M3s for training before receiving M10 tank destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The T48 {{originated}} from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun. The requirement {{was met by}} emplacing a 57mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – {{in the rear of}} an M3 Half-track. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942. The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10. Afterwards, it was intended solely to be supplied overseas {{under the terms of the}} <b>Lend-Lease</b> Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.|$|E
5|$|The first Soviet ship {{to carry}} a radar was Molotov which was given a Redut-K air warning system in 1940, which she used for the entire war. <b>Lend-Lease</b> radars {{equipped}} {{most of the other}} ships. The British Types 281, 291 and the American SG radars were used for air search. Main battery fire control radars were the British Types 284 and 285 while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by the Type 282 radar. Soviet-designed Yupiter-1 and Mars-1 gunnery radars were fitted in Molotov and Kalinin by 1944.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 628 CTMS tanks were {{ordered by the}} Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Of these, a small number were {{delivered}} to Java, {{just in time to}} see combat in the Dutch East Indies campaign following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. 149 from this order were diverted to Australia where they were used for training. 600 CTLS-4TACs and 4TAYs were delivered to China under <b>Lend-Lease</b> after Pearl Harbor. After the war, the Indonesian Army is reported to have used several captured Dutch vehicles, with the type remaining in Indonesian service until 1949 amidst the Indonesian National Revolution.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through <b>Lend-Lease,</b> intending to use them in the Western Desert, {{but by the time}} they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the ship}} was re-commissioned by the U.S. Navy as USS Catlin (AP-19) {{for about six months}} and was {{operated}} by the British under <b>Lend-Lease,</b> but her old coal-fired engines were too slow for effective combat use. After conversion to oil-fired boilers, {{the ship was}} chartered to the U.S. Army as USAT George Washington and sailed around the world in 1943 in trooping duties. The ship sailed in regular service to the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean from 1944 to 1947, and was laid up in Baltimore after ending her Army service. A fire in January 1951 damaged the ship severely, and she was sold for scrapping the following month.|$|E
5|$|From Ulithi, Orizaba sailed east, {{passed through}} the Panama Canal again, and, as the battle for Okinawa raged, arrived at Tampa, Florida. Decommissioning on 23 April, she {{underwent}} an overhaul and on 16 July 1945 she was transferred to Brazil {{under the terms of}} <b>Lend-Lease.</b> The ship was permanently transferred to Brazil in June 1953 and struck from the US Naval Vessel Register on 20 July of that same year. Orizaba received one battle star for her US Navy service in World War II. As of 2008, no other US Navy ship has been named Orizaba.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the ship}} was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which {{transferred}} her to the Soviet Union {{under the terms of}} <b>Lend-Lease</b> in December 1942. She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SSTashkent, but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of the Soviet invasion of Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea at that time to become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
5|$|While the Command {{retained}} a minimum peacetime {{force and the}} Air Ministry had every intention of maintaining it as such, the fleet was further reduced and suffered from procurement problems. The Short Shetland and Short Seaford were rejected as replacements for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. A maritime version of the promising Avro Lincoln {{had yet to be}} ordered by the time the <b>Lend-Lease</b> programme ended in August 1945. The Short Sunderland was forced to continue as the main operational type until the end of 1946. Most of the aircraft that operated in the command were the Second World War types; the Spitfire, Lancaster, Mosquito and Beaufighter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}}, 6. Staffel {{at the time}} was based in Petsamo, present-day Pechenga in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Weissenberger took off on his first Bf109 combat mission at 14:00 on 15 September 1942 after he had spent a few days familiarizing himself with the {{single-engine}} fighter aircraft. The mission, flown by 10 Bf109 fighters from 6. Staffel, was a combat air patrol in the vicinity of Murmashi. The flight encountered enemy aircraft and Weissenberger filed claims over two Curtiss P-40 Warhawk <b>Lend-Lease</b> fighters shot down at 14:31 and 14:33. These were his first victories claimed on the Bf109, taking his total to 25 victories. A week later, on 22 September, Weissenberger and 6. Staffel were again patrolling the airspace near the Soviet airfield at Murmashi. During this mission, he claimed three more aerial victories, over Hurricanes shot down between 14:59 and 15:05.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, a {{disagreement}} between Settlemier, {{one of his}} reporters, {{and the editor of}} the Alaska Miner resulted in several changes to the News-Miner. Settlemier was replaced as editor by the reporter, David B. Tewkesbury, and the Alaska Miner was discontinued. Its editor, E.F. Jessen, created Jessen's Weekly, a separate newspaper, to compete with the News-Miner. The Weekly lasted until 1968, when it was closed by the Internal Revenue Service. The same year that Jessen founded his weekly newspaper, the United States became involved in the Second World War. Travel to and from Alaska was restricted, and after Japan invaded the Alaska islands of Attu and Kiska, the News-Miner was censored by the U.S. Army. Fairbanks benefited from a military construction boom as the United States built the Northwest Staging Route to ferry <b>Lend-Lease</b> aircraft to the Soviet Union. The boom left the News-Miner short-staffed, but it continued operations throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|In January 1946 her air group flew aboard, {{minus the}} disbanded 880 Squadron, and with 1790 Squadron {{replacing}} 1771 Squadron. After {{several days of}} flying exercises, Implacable made a port visit to Melbourne together with her sister Indefatigable and several other ships. She became the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Philip Vian, the newly appointed second {{in command of the}} BPF on 31 January. She continued a relaxed schedule of training and port visits until she began a refit on 15 March in Sydney, that lasted until 29 April, when she put to sea to fly on her aircraft and to dump overboard the 16 <b>Lend-Lease</b> Avengers belonging to 828 Squadron (Britain had to either pay for them or dispose of them {{with the end of the}} war, and lacked the means to do the former). She sailed for home on 5 May and reached Devonport on 3 June, where Vian struck his flag.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940 the Australian Government {{placed an}} order for 243 Brewster Bermuda dive bombers for the RAAF. This type was still under development, and the program to produce it {{suffered}} from repeated delays. On 28 September 1941 the British Government offered to provide Vultee Vengeances from its allocation of the type if the RAAF considered them suitable. The Australian War Cabinet authorised the purchase of 297 Vultee Vengeances on 22 October 1941 and cancelled the order of Bermudas. By March 1942 the order had been slightly increased to 300 aircraft, of which 57 were to be provided by the United States Government under <b>Lend-Lease</b> and the other 243 {{paid for by the}} Australian Government. Australia eventually ordered 400 Vengeances. The price for each of the aircraft purchased by Australia was A£90,000.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} return, Cockcroft was {{appointed}} Chief Superintendent of the Air Defence Research Development Establishment (ADRDE) at Christchurch, Hampshire. His {{focus was on}} the use of radar for shooting down enemy aircraft. The GL Mk. III radar was developed as a target tracking and predicting radar, but by 1942 the SCR-584 radar developed for the same purpose in the United States became available, and Cockcroft recommended that it be acquired under <b>Lend-Lease.</b> On his own initiative, he acquired SCR-584 sets for testing, and trials conducted on the Isle of Sheppey in October 1943 conclusively demonstrated that SCR-584 was superior. This made Cockcroft very unpopular at the Ministry of Supply, but he had intelligence that the Germans were planning to deploy the V-1 flying bomb. On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Weeks sent Washington an urgent request for 134 SCR-584 sets.|$|E
5|$|The M19 MGMC {{served in}} Europe in World War II with the U.S. Army. By {{the time the}} M19 arrived, the Luftwaffe had been driven from the skies by Allied air power, so the M19 found use as an assault gun, which was a role it {{performed}} very well. It was never delivered to other countries for <b>Lend-Lease</b> or the Military Aid Program (though a few examples were transferred to the newly established JGSDF in 1954). It also served in the Korean War, for the same purpose as it was used in World War II. It {{was used in the}} defense against the North Korean forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting and later fighting in Korea. The 40mm guns were especially effective against Chinese mass infantry charges in North Korea.|$|E
