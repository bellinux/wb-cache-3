He knew in his heart what it was; the {{interview}} could concern nothing but the letter that he had sent to Lady Alice that day. As he followed the groom through the now dark and silent courts, and across {{the corner of the}} great quadrangle, and so to the Earl's house, he tried to brace his failing courage to meet the coming interview. Nevertheless, his heart beat tumultuously as he followed the other down the long corridor, lit only by a flaring <b>link</b> <b>set</b> in a wrought-iron bracket. Then his conductor lifted the arras {{at the door of the}} bedchamber, whence came the murmuring sound of many voices, and holding it aside, beckoned him to enter, and Myles passed within. At the first, he was conscious of nothing but a crowd of people, and of the brightness of many lighted candles; then he saw that he stood in a great airy room spread with a woven mat of rushes. On three sides the walls were hung with tapestry representing hunting and battle scenes, at the farther end, where the bed stood, the stone wall of the fourth side was covered with cloth of blue, embroidered with silver goshawks. Even now, in the ripe springtime of May, the room was still chilly, and a great fire roared and crackled in the huge gaping mouth of the stone fireplace. Not far from the blaze were clustered the greater part of those present, buzzing in talk, now and then swelled by murmuring laughter. Some of those who knew Myles nodded to him, and two or three spoke to him as he stood waiting, whilst the groom went forward to speak to the Earl; though what they said and what he answered, Myles, in his bewilderment and trepidation, hardly knew.|$|E
6000|$|She had got up {{with these}} last words; she stood there before him with that {{particular}} suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of their life together had not closed his sense, kept sharp, year after year, by the collation of types and signs, the comparison of fine object with fine object, of one degree of finish, of one form of the exquisite with another--the appearance of some slight, slim draped [...] "antique" [...] of Vatican or Capitoline halls, late and refined, rare as a note and immortal as a <b>link,</b> <b>set</b> in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and yet, for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries by their pedestal, keeping still the quality, the perfect felicity, of the statue; the blurred, absent eyes, the smoothed, elegant, nameless head, the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a precious vase. She had always had odd moments of striking him, daughter of his very own though she was, as a figure thus simplified, [...] "generalised" [...] in its grace, a figure with which his human connection was fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude, something shyly mythological and nymphlike. The trick, he was not uncomplacently aware, was mainly of his own mind; it came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters. And what was {{more to the point}} still, it often operated while he was quite at the same time conscious that Maggie had been described, even in her prettiness, as [...] "prim"--Mrs. Rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of her; while he remembered that when once she had been told before him, familiarly, that she resembled a nun, she had replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainly try to; while also, finally, it was present to him that, discreetly heedless, thanks to her long association with nobleness in art, to the leaps and bounds of fashion, she brought her hair down very straight and flat over her temples, in the constant manner of her mother, who had not been a bit mythological. Nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types, but Mr. Verver, when he really amused himself, let consistency go. The play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive impressions of sense even while positively thinking. He was positively thinking while Maggie stood there, and it led for him to yet another question--which in its turn led to others still. [...] "Do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago?" ...|$|E

5000|$|On YCDTOTV, McGlade {{was most}} {{frequently}} {{seen on the}} familiar blue <b>link</b> <b>set,</b> talking directly to the audience and lecturing {{on the theme of}} each program. Generally, she did not appear in as many of the comedy sketches taped off the <b>link</b> <b>set</b> as her fellow cast members, and, though she often took part in the school-bus, classroom, living-room, Barth's Burgery and Blip's Arkaid sketches, she appeared only three times before the firing squad (all in 1984), and twice as the prisoner chained to the wall of the dungeon (both in 1979). During the live, local, hour-long episodes of YCDTOTV aired on CJOH in 1979 and 1981, she often introduced the live contest segments and music videos. In later years, after the show was converted into a half-hour program devoted exclusively to comedy, McGlade became the focal point of many of the episodes' story lines. Several notable [...] comedy examples include [...] "Vacations" [...] (1982), in which she attempts to enjoy some time off on the beach, only to find that the show's cast and crew have followed her there with the intention of shooting an episode; [...] "Rumors" [...] (1983), in which word spreads throughout the cast that she is about to be fired from her hosting position; [...] "Medicine" [...] (1983), in which she breaks her leg and is forced to host the entire episode wearing a cast; [...] "Jealousy" [...] (1984), in which she receives a raise and incurs the ire of her fellow cast members; and [...] "Friends" [...] (1984), in which she learns that her mother has been paying her castmates to be friends with her, and finds herself suddenly friendless when that month's payment fails to arrive.|$|E
50|$|The Zelda {{character}} in The Wind Waker (2002) is unaware of her royal identity, instead living as the pirate captain named Tetra. She first {{appears in the}} clutches of a giant bird called the Helmaroc King, though she struggles and is dropped {{at the top of}} Link's home island of Outset. She then agrees to take Link with her crew in order to help him rescue his younger sister Aryll, whom the Helmaroc King has subsequently captured. She later crosses paths with Link again while her crew is stealing bombs from Windfall Island, turning a blind eye to his spying on her and consenting for her crew to spend the night relaxing on Windfall, thus allowing Link to beat them to Jabun's Grotto. She also decides to help Link confront Ganon at the forbidden fortress, but they are unsuccessful in defeating him. At this point, Ganon discovers Tetra's true identity as the Princess Zelda, but is attacked by the dragon Valoo and two Rito warriors before he is able to capture her. Her true identity disclosed, it is determined safest for Zelda to stay in the ancient Hyrule Castle. She is protected there for a time, but Ganon eventually invades and takes her to his Tower, also in Ancient Hyrule. She then assists Link in his final battle against Ganon, using his bow to fire arrows of light. After Ganon's defeat, Tetra and <b>Link</b> <b>set</b> out with her crew to seek new lands. This incarnation is unique in that she continues to live by and identify with her non-royal persona rather than as Princess Zelda.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a centro-based characterization of singularities in planar multi-DOF mechanisms with arbitrary kinematic structure. A multi-DOF mechanism {{is treated as}} an assembly of several single DOF link sets and hence the terms like affected <b>link</b> <b>set,</b> active <b>link</b> <b>set</b> and active centro have been defined. Criteria for end-effector dependent and end-effector independent singularities of a closed-loop manipulator with given output link have been established in the paper in terms of centroes. Based on the relative disposition of the centroes, the singularities have been classified into five types and their physical implications have been explained. End-effector dependent singularities are shown to lie on the coupler curve of ab larger single DOF mechanism. A simple linkage transformation has been proposed {{for the study of}} manipulators with physical limits on joint motion under the general framework of close-loop manipulators.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the link {{capacity}} assignment problem in packet-switched networks (CA problem) {{focusing on the}} case where link cost function is a piecewise linear concave function. This type of cost function arises in many communication network design problems such as those arising from developments in communication transmission technologies. It is already know that the method of <b>link</b> <b>set</b> assignment is applicable for solving the CA problem with piecewise linear convex cost function. That is, each link in the network is {{assigned to one of}} a group of specific sets, and checked for <b>link</b> <b>set</b> contradiction. By extending the method of <b>link</b> <b>set</b> assignment to the case of piecewise linear concave cost function, an important characteristic of the optimal solution of the CA problem is derived. Based on this chracteristic, the non-differentiable link cost function can be treated as a differntiable function, and a heuristic algorithm derived from the Lagrange multiplier method is then proposed. Althought it is difficult to determine the global optimum of the CA problem due to its non-convexity, it is shown by numerical results that the solution obtained from the proposed algortithm is very close to the global optimum. Moreover, the computation time is linearly dependent on the number of links in the problem. These performances show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in solving the CA problem, even in the case of large-scale networks. key words: communication networks and services, packet-switched networks, network design, link capacity assignment, non-linear programming, algorith...|$|E
