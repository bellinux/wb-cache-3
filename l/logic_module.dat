50|$|Arden syntax is a markup {{language}} used for representing and sharing medical knowledge. This clinical and scientific knowledge language {{is used in}} an executable format by clinical decision support systems to generate alerts, interpretations, and to screen and manage messages to clinicians.

Rule sets, called Medical <b>Logic</b> <b>Modules,</b> comprise enough <b>logic</b> to make a single medical decision. Medical <b>logic</b> <b>modules</b> are written in Arden syntax, and are called by a program - an event monitor - when the condition they are written to help with occurs.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{traditional}} ASIC technologies, the geometrical {{structures of}} clock trees in an FPGA are usually xed and cannot be changed for di erent circuit designs. Moreover, the clock pins {{are connected to}} the clock trees via programmable switches. As a result, the load capacitances of a clock tree may bechanged, depending on the utilization and distribution of <b>logic</b> <b>modules</b> in an FPGA. It is possible to minimize clock skew by distributing the load capacitances, or equivalently the <b>logic</b> <b>modules</b> used by the circuit design, carefully according to the circuit design. In this paper we present an algorithm for selecting <b>logic</b> <b>modules</b> used for circuit placement such that the clock skew is minimized. The algorithm can be applied to a variety of clock tree architectures, including those used in major commercial FPGAs. Furthermore, the algorithm can be extended to handle bu ered clock trees and multi-phase clock trees. Experimental results show that the algorithm can reduce clock skews signi cantly as compared with the traditional placement algorithms which do not consider clock skew minimization. ...|$|R

All this was served up via a Gould SEL mainframe. The <b>logic</b> <b>module</b> included four socketed chips: a TR1865CL-04, a full-duplex UART, an SC87253P 8-bit microprocessor, an N8X60N FIFO I/O controller and a pre-programmed ROM. The remainder of the parts on the board were numerous 74LS series logic ICs. There was an RF module that down-converted signals from the cable connection and up-converted requests {{to be sent to}} the server. There were four circuit boards for frequency synthesis, data in and out and RF conversion and dual helical coil bandpass filters.|$|E

The network nodes are called dynamically programmable <b>logic</b> <b>modules.</b> They can be implemented with digitally controlled demultiplexers. Each node performs a Boolean function of its inputs which can be dynamically assigned. The overall network is therefore a combinational circuit and its outputs are Boolean global functions of the network's input variables.

50|$|Various {{kinds of}} Engine Control Units were {{used with the}} 2.2 and 2.5 engines. From 1984-1987, the ECU was divided into the <b>Logic</b> <b>Module</b> (LM), which was inside the {{passenger}} cabin, and the Power Module located near the battery on the left front fender. The LM used a Motorola 6803U4 processor operating at 1 MHz, with 256 bytes of RAM and either two 8K EPROMs or one 16K EPROM. From 1988-1989, a SMEC (Single Module Engine Controller) was used. This was a complete redesign of the older system, using modern CAD for board design, and higher density SMD components. The processor was a 68HC11 operating at 2 MHz with 256 bytes of RAM and a 32K EPROM. Functionally, the SMEC was {{the combination of the}} earlier Logic and Power modules into one unit.
