50|$|Phosphorus is {{particularly}} important both {{for the growth of}} tagasaste and for the growth of the animals grazing on it. Higher levels of phosphorus are required for the maximum growth of the animals than for maximum plant growth. Fertiliser will also reduce the level of phenolic compounds (similar to tannins) that increase when the plants are moisture stressed. These phenolic compounds make the tagasaste less palatable and reduce the animals' feed intake. The phenolics suppress the utilisation of protein in the rumen, and as a result feed intake. Despite the crude protein always being above 14%, supplementing with a high-protein feed like <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> stimulates animal feed intake when phenolics are high in tagasaste. Tagasaste typically has the same nutritional value as the best type of Alfalfa when planted on good soil balanced in nutrients. Daily weight gains of 1 to 1.5kg per steer per day are achieved during the growing season, with 6-10 rotations per year, typically one every 6=8 weeks.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{spreading}} seed also occurred to Alan Pritchard, a pilot for the New Zealand Public Works Department, {{as he was}} flying E. Madden of the Ministry of Works in a de Havilland Moth, sharing grapes and throwing the seeds out of the open cockpits. A few months later Pritchard was tasked with conducting an aerial survey in Northland. The survey was delayed when the Ministry's Miles Whitney Straight, ZK-AFH, was grounded by bad weather. A supervisor, J. L. Harrison, complained that Pritchard was holding back men needed to sow <b>lupin</b> <b>seed.</b> Remembering the grape seeds, Pritchard suggested sowing the seed by air. Burying the hatchet, Harrison and Pritchard spent that evening experimenting with methods of dispersal, before settling on sewing a sack onto a piece of downpipe. The following morning, 8 March 1939, Pritchard flew over Ninety Mile Beach while Harrison, on his signal, held the downpipe out a window and emptied the sack. They then landed and examined {{the spread of the}} seeds. It was found a distribution of 1 seed per square foot was obtained from a height of 100 to 150 ft. On Monday 10 March, they sowed 375 acre, using 2 lb/acre (224 kg/km2) instead of the 5 lb/acre (560 kg/km2) used when sowing by hand. The pair returned to examine the site at 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 years and at all points the aerially sown land was indistinguishable from that sown by hand.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLupins have {{a variety}} of both {{traditional}} and modern uses. In the last decade, reports assessing the benefits of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> proteins have proliferated and, nowadays, the pharmaceutical industry is interested in lupin proteins for human health. Modern genomics and proteomics have hugely contributed to describing the diversity of lupin storage genes and, above all, proteins. Most of these studies have been centered on few edible lupin species. However, Lupinus genus comprises hundreds of species spread throughout the Old and New Worlds, and these resources have been scarcely explored and exploited. We present here a detailed review of the literature on the potential of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> proteins as nutraceuticals, and the use of -omic tools to analyze seed storage polypeptides in main edible lupins and their diversity at the Lupinus inter- and intra-species level. In this sense, proteomics, more than any other, has been a key approach. Proteomics has shown that <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> protein diversity, where post-translational modifications yield a large number of peptide variants with a potential concern in bioactivity, goes far beyond gene diversity. The future extended use of second and third generation proteomics should definitely help to go deeper into coverage and characterization of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> proteome. Biological significance Some important topics concerning storage proteins from lupin seeds are presented and analyzed in an integrated way in this review. Proteomic approaches have been essential in characterizing <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> protein diversity, which goes far beyond gene diversity since the protein level adds to the latter differential proteolytic cleavage of conglutin pro-proteins and a diverse array of glycosylation forms and sites.

In <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds,</b> α-galactosides were effectively removed and processed seeds contained very low amounts of flatulence causing factors (not, vert, similar 0. 5 – 1 %).

A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the effect of breeding and growing conditions on the structure and degradability of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> coats. Breeding has had significant influences on both seed size and seed coat structure of lupins.

Hardseeded and roughseeded lines of L. cosentinii had thicker coats (P < 0. 05) than softseeded and smoothseeded, respectively. The main contributor to the thick seed coat of hardseeded lines was a layer of cells known as the hourglass layer, which is located between the outer palisade and inner parenchyma. Anatomical analysis revealed that the soft seed coat tended to have short and round cells, whereas the hard seed tended to have long cells in the palisade layer.

For every cysteine residue in a protein, such treatment increases its molecular mass value by 105. 14 Da, which can be accurately determined by MALDI-TOF equipment. Based on the changes of the molecular mass value after 4 -vp treatment, the number of cysteine residue can be reliably determined. We found that this method is also useful in studying non-glutenin proteins such as <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> storage proteins. This method is particularly valuable {{when the number of}} cysteine residue is of importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of cotyledon {{cells is}} described at five stages of <b>lupin</b> <b>seed</b> development, distinguished {{on the basis}} of their morphological features. It was found that the endoplasmic reticulum nad dictyosomes participate in the synthesis and transport of storage protein, and that protein is deposited in the central vacuole or in newly forming ones. In the investigated zone of lupin cotyledon cells two forms of protein bodies were observed differing in the contrast and compactness. Both were the simple protein, bodies. Parallelly to storage protein synthesis, thickening of the cell walls was observed which may indicate synthesis and deposition of hemicellulose in them. Storage lipids surrounding the protein bodies form in the end stages of seed development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDisulphide {{mapping of}} a methionine-rich 2 S albumin from {{sunflower}} seeds showed four intra-chain disulphide bonds which are homologous {{with those in}} a related heterodimeric albumin from <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> (conglutin δ). Similar conserved disulphide bonds are also present in α-gliadin and γ-gliadin storage proteins of wheat, but {{a lower level of}} conservation is present in a further related group of proteins, the cereal inhibitors of α-amylase and trypsin. These differences may relate to the different functions of the proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to verify if the different dietetic energy sources (maize and barley) in diets based on sweet white <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> and the different slaughtering age, may modify carcass and meat quality in lamb. Results show that the use of maize and barley in diets have no influences on carcass and meat quality; the lambs slaughtered at 105 days gave better carcasses and similar meat quality than those slaughtered at 75 days...|$|R
40|$|With the {{objective}} of promoting the cultivation, usage, and consumption of lupin, in the present study, the chemical and fibre composition of dehulled seeds of seven cultivars of different lupin species (Lupinus angustifolius, Lupinus albus and Lupinus luteus) was determined in comparison to pea (Pisum sativum) and soya bean (Glycine max). The mean protein content of lupin was significantly higher compared to pea (P< 0. 001) and similar to soya bean, whereas the proportion of calculated carbohydrates was lowest for lupin (P< 0. 001). The content of total dietary fibre and of calculated soluble fibre was higher for lupin compared to pea (P 0. 003) and soya bean (P 0. 013). In contrast to the existing literature, the soluble fibre content of lupin contributed about 75 % of the total dietary fibre. In conclusion, dehulled <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> {{can be considered as}} a valuable source of plant protein and dietary fibre, while simultaneously being low in carbohydrates. Therefore, lupin should be exploited more efficiently within human and also animal nutrition. In further studies, the impact of dehulling <b>lupin</b> <b>seeds</b> and of using different methodologies in fibre analyses on the results of chemical composition should be elucidated...|$|R
