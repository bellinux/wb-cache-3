40|$|We {{study the}} effects of tax laws on foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) and direct investment abroad (DIA), distinguishing in each case between investment financed by retained earnings and investment financed by transfers from abroad. We find that tax policy, through its effect on the rate-of-return available in the U. S., has an important effect on the international <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> FDI in the U. S. is very sensitive to after-tax rates-of-return available here. U. S. direct investment abroad is also affected, although to a lesser extent. We use these estimates to examine {{the effects of}} the 1981 - 82 tax changes on the international <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> We estimate that the tax changes lowered annual DIA by $ 0. 5 billion to $ 1. 0 billion (2 % to 4 % of its 1980 value), and raised annual FDI by $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion (11 % of 20 % of its 1980 value). We also discuss the welfare effects of tax policy toward international investment. Our results suggest that the tax effects on the international <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> are important. Tax policies, such as ACRS andthe ITC, which raise the after tax rate-of-return on new investment without losing revenue from previous investment, not only stimulate domestic fixed investment, but also attract additional investment from abroad. The additional investment supplements the domestic investment impact on productivity and raises corporate tax revenue.

40|$|Summary. This article {{presents}} and discusses findings of an exploratory marketing study of individual private investors ’ preferences for renewable energies. The study, {{completed in the}} summer of 2008, reports about the importance of items considered by participants when selecting an investment option, their views regarding forests services and forest management. A research design distinguished between different investment options (stocks, wood-based energy, solar/wind energy), expected returns on investment, and geographic <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> (within state, in the U. S. and abroad) to elicit investment preferences. Results indicate that wood-based energy investments rank below stock market and solar/wind renewable energy investments. The geographic location of energy investments within the U. S. was a major factor influencing investment preferences. Attitudes toward wood-based energy investments were highly dependent on views of forestry and perceived expected returns on interest. This research suggests that a pool of potential investors could support the development of the wood-based energy sector. Interest can be linked to favorable attitudes towards forestry and minimum investment returns.

40|$|The {{business}} angel market is usually {{identified as a}} local market, and the proximity of an investment {{has been shown to}} be key in the angel's investment preferences and an important filter at the screening stage of the investment decision. This is generally explained by the personal and hence localised networks used to identify potential investments, the hands-on involvement of the investor and the desire to minimise risk. However, a significant minority of investments are made over long distances. This paper is based on data from 373 investments made by 109 UK {{business angel}}s. We classify the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> into three groups: local investments (those made within the same county or in adjacent counties), intermediate investments (those made in counties adjacent to the 'local' counties), and long-distance investments (those made beyond this range). Using ordered logit analysis the paper develops and tests a number of hypotheses that relate long distance investment to investment characteristics and investor characteristics. The paper concludes by drawing out the implications for entrepreneurs seeking business angel finance in investment-deficient regions, business angel networks seeking to match investors to entrepreneurs and firms (which are normally their primary clients), and for policy makers responsible for local and regional economic development...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} use of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) leads to new ways of doing business internationally. Nowadays, firm-specific intangible assets as well as services often constitute the most important factors for the creation of value. Besides, geographic distances tend to be less relevant. The main objective of international tax planning consists of minimising the effective tax rate of the whole company or group. In this paper, it is examined for several instruments of international tax planning whether new chances of minimising the effective tax rate emerge with the use of ICT and to what extent new risks occur. The analysis comprises the (re) location of a company?s residence, the (re) allocation of functions and risks, the implementation of a transfer pricing system, the choice of the form and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> abroad as well as hybrid forms of co-operation. For each instrument, both current and non-current tax issues are considered. We conclude that, due to ICT, it is easier {{to make use of the}} international tax differential by choosing the optimal location and form of investment and by allocating functions and risks. Thus, companies can pay more attention to the tax-optimal choice between international locations and the importance of this instrument to reduce the effective tax rate is further strengthened by the use of ICT.

This growth model leads banks to operate close to specific client bases. The author illustrates his point with the example of HSBC, the second largest bank in the world.

This {{policy is to}} lead to the most rational use of the human environment. It is supported by spatial planning which, using local land use plans, helps clarify the concept of spatial planning policy, and it is also actively involved in its implementation. Spatial planning may not, however, exist independently. It is clearly related to other areas, without which the implementation of the spatial planning policy would be impossible. Surveying and construction are those sectors which are undoubtedly related to spatial planning. Surveying studies determine the location of future objects defined in the planning processes, whereas these structures are implemented in investment processes.

Domestic possibilities to finance forest investments in Russia are still under developing, and the forest sector is not attractive among Russian investors due to the more profitable sectors such as energy, technology and metal clusters. Therefore, the forest sector calls urgently for forest investments to develop, to create more value added production and to survive in international competition in final product markets. Along with the global profit maximisation many foreign forest enterprises have established especially in Northwest Russia during 1990 s and 2000 s. However, most of these investments are of small-scale (saw- and veneer mills, packaging plants), {{and they can be}} seen as pilot investments to test market environment and, especially, the working of wood procurement.

The viewpoint is mostly of Finnish forest enterprises and investors.
