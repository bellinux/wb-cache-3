5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a <b>leather</b> <b>pad,</b> which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
2500|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a [...] fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra heat shielding to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> with a round cutout for the left-side fuel filler cap. Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse cone exhaust. Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|E
60|$|Kala Nag, {{which means}} Black Snake, had served the Indian Government {{in every way}} that an {{elephant}} could serve it for forty-seven years, and as he was fully twenty {{years old when he}} was caught, that makes him nearly seventy--a ripe age for an elephant. He remembered pushing, with a big <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was before the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full strength.|$|E

50|$|Until 1954, Henney built a few nine-passenger Executive Sedans and Corporate Limousines on {{a chassis}} with 148-inch (3759 mm) wheelbase. Derham in Rosemont built very few Patrician Custom Formal Sedans with <b>leather</b> <b>padded</b> roofs, small backlights and {{elaborate}} interiors {{on the standard}} Patrician frame.|$|R
60|$|By {{the advice}} of a {{fallacious}} local saddler, a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> was made for me with rings to fasten on my bundle; and I thoughtfully completed my kit and arranged my toilette. By way of armoury and utensils, I took a revolver, a little spirit-lamp and pan, a lantern and some halfpenny candles, a jack-knife and a large leather flask. The main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothing--besides my travelling wear of country velveteen, pilot-coat, and knitted spencer--some books, and my railway-rug, which, being also {{in the form of a}} bag, made me a double castle for cold nights. The permanent larder was represented by cakes of chocolate and tins of Bologna sausage. All this, except what I carried about my person, was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag; and by good fortune I threw in my empty knapsack, rather for convenience of carriage than from any thought that I should want it on my journey. For more immediate needs I took a leg of cold mutton, a bottle of Beaujolais, an empty bottle to carry milk, an egg-beater, and a considerable quantity of black bread and white, like Father Adam, for myself and donkey, only in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed.|$|E
5000|$|Muffling For {{commemorative}} {{services such}} as funerals, memorial services and Remembrance Sunday, the bells are rung half-muffled with a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> {{on one side of}} the clapper. Very rarely fully-muffled with pads both sides..|$|E
5000|$|Early petecas {{were very}} {{primitive}} home-made affairs consisting of stones wrapped in leaves tied inside an ear of corn. A more sophisticated version {{was described in}} a Brazilian-English dictionary as [...] "a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> with feathers stuck into it." ...|$|E
50|$|Orchestral clash cymbals {{and most}} band cymbals have leather straps {{passed through the}} holes in their bells, leading to four tails which are knotted inside the bell, to allow the player to hold them. Marching bands in {{addition}} use <b>leather</b> <b>pads</b> between the outsides of the bells and the player's hands.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally the clappers have <b>leather</b> <b>pads</b> (called muffles) {{strapped}} {{around them}} to quieten the bells when practice ringing to avoid annoying the neighbourhood. Also at funerals, half-muffles {{are often used}} to give a full open sound on one round, and a muffled sound on the alternate round - a distinctive, mournful effect.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked off}} stiffly, while I searched the sack {{and the car}} for the impounded {{correspondence}} that Bobby had talked of. I found nothing except, as the police reports say, the trace of a struggle. He had kicked half the varnish {{off the back of}} the front seat, and had bitten the <b>leather</b> <b>padding</b> where he could reach it. Evidently a purposeful and hard-mouthed young gentleman.|$|R
50|$|From 1883 to 1889 he was honorary Treasurer of the Winchester Diocesan Society. In 1888, {{following}} the death of an oarsman, Willan wrote to The Times to propose that in bumping races a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> should be fixed to the nose of eight-oared boats.|$|E
50|$|In churches with full-circle English bells, for {{commemorative}} {{services such}} as funerals, memorial services and Remembrance Sunday, the bells are rung half-muffled instead with a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> {{on one side of}} the clapper in call changes or method ringing. Very rarely are they rung fully-muffled with pads both sides. This can often be a Quarter peal or Peal - the latter lasting three hours.|$|E
50|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a 6 gal fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra heat shielding to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> with a round cutout for the left-side fuel filler cap. Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36 mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse cone exhaust. Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|E
50|$|Rugby Fives {{is played}} between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being {{to hit the}} ball above a 'bar' across the front wall {{in such a way that}} the {{opposition}} cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear <b>leather</b> <b>padded</b> gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{boxing gloves}} started showing up towards {{end of the}} 1990s. Over ten years of {{engineering}} and testing {{by some of the}} biggest boxing manufacturers and sport names have helped create safe, durable equipment. Modern boxing gloves include mesh palm, velcro, leather-based stitching, suspension cushioning and new padding for the boxer. The International Boxing Association (amateur) approves new designs of gloves according to rules around weight and the amount of <b>leather,</b> <b>padding</b> and support allowed.|$|R
50|$|The rifle is a semi-automatic, gas {{operated}} weapon with the piston located beneath the barrel and ammunition feed from detachable top-mounted magazine with bottom ejection for the spent cartridges. To reduce recoil, the rifle {{is equipped with}} a five hole muzzle brake and a <b>padded</b> <b>leather</b> recoil <b>pad.</b> The barrel had a wooden jacket as to allow transportation after firing.|$|R

5000|$|Otlachimalli {{consisted}} of maize cane {{with the individual}} strands double-twisted with interwoven cotton or maguey fibers. On the front ornaments were attached {{in the form of}} faces, legendary figures and other illustrations which were meant to convey heraldry and status of the user. These representations were worked with colorful feathers {{in the form of a}} mosaic. In addition, materials such as beaten copper and gold would be used for decoration. The Otlachimalli was used as a battle shield. The reverse was reinforced by horizontal and vertical wooden struts. A leather cover was used to protect the carrying arm. In some shields tortoise shell was used to manufacture decorations. [...] The Cuauhchimalli was made of wood and decorated in the same manner as the Otlachimalli. On the cuauhchimalli also mosaics from stone chips were sometimes applied. The reverse was equipped with two leather straps which were used for carrying the shield. In both types a <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> was attached to the front as the basis for the ornaments, and they had a curtain of leather [...] "straps" [...] attached to the bottom portion of the shield which served as extra protection from arrows.|$|E
40|$|Wiper {{assembly}} {{is described}} for feedback potentiometers which provides self cleaning, self lubrication, and tension within controlled limits. Each {{end of the}} assembly contains loose fitting <b>leather</b> <b>pad</b> thoroughly soaked in wiper lubricating fluid.

50|$|The overall {{form and}} {{shell of the}} helmet {{remained}} unchanged. The internal harness was modified to include four stuffed <b>leather</b> <b>pads</b> (rather than three as with the SSh-40) attached to the dome rivets. The petals were moved {{to the top of}} the helmet along with two rivets and the chin strap. As the SSh-60 looks identical to the SSh-40 externally when worn, photos don't indicate how many were in use. The short time of manufacture suggests that these were limited in numbers when compared to the SSh-40.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{varieties}} of tone holes, straight and rolled. Straight tone holes {{are much more}} prevalent, but rolled tone holes are favored by some saxophonists as they supposedly produce a different timbre of sound. An American company based in Elkhart, Indiana named [...] "Martin" [...] manufactured saxophones with straight toneholes that were tapered, i.e. the circumference of the tone-hole chimneys was smaller {{at the point of}} contact with the <b>leather</b> <b>pads</b> than where they were soldered to {{the main body of the}} instrument.|$|R
50|$|Many {{platform}} beds have {{a contemporary}} style that usually feature clean lines, neutral elements and solid color characteristics. These typically reflect European styles which usually include low features with straight bold lines. Some styles incorporate microfiber and <b>leather</b> <b>padding</b> on a headboard {{for use as}} a backrest when sitting in bed.In 1973 John Lorenc brought a design for his platform bed to Guild Furniture in New York City which was owned by Ray Strazza. Mr. Strazza built the bed and recreated it many times starting the modern platform bed trend.|$|R
50|$|In {{this first}} group sound is {{generated}} by an array of 61 ground stainless steel reeds which are plucked by <b>leather</b> and foam <b>pads</b> saturated with silicone oil. Silicone oil {{had the benefit of}} not evaporating from the <b>leather</b> <b>pads,</b> not corroding the steel reeds, and remaining at a consistent viscosity across a wide temperature range. The pads are connected to the keys via metal rods so that, on pressing a key, the pad is raised and released from the reed making it vibrate. An electrostatic pick-up consisting of a segmented vertical plate mounted orthogonal to and just beyond the ends of the reeds transmits the sound to an amplifier. The Pianet's sound was piano-like, sharing sonic similarities to the Wurlitzer series of electric pianos as both relied on metal reeds and variable capacitance as their sound generation source.|$|R
50|$|Interior changes {{included}} perforations in {{the central}} sections of the <b>leather</b> seats, <b>padded</b> dashboard sections for safety, moving the clock to a central position, {{and the introduction of}} air conditioning as an option.|$|R

50|$|Forward flex was {{controlled}} by three neoprene bands connected to the cuff through a strap running {{up the back of}} the boot. The bands were located under the removable sole liner, and could be replaced to change the stiffness. For comfort and fit, the boot was customized by inserting a series of small <b>leather</b> <b>pads</b> in a variety of sizes. The pillows contained one or more plastic bags filled with tiny plastic beads. The bags could be hand-moulded into the required shape, and natural movement of the foot would keep them in the approximate shape needed for comfort. Initial setup was time consuming, and presented a problem in the ski shops.|$|R
50|$|A mahlstick, or maulstick, is a {{stick with}} a soft <b>leather</b> or <b>padded</b> head used by {{painters}} to support the hand holding the paintbrush. The word derives from the Dutch maalstok 'painter's stick', from malen 'to paint'.|$|R

50|$|Casegoods {{are one of}} {{the three}} classifications of furniture, the others being {{upholstery}} and occasional. Upholstery refers to furniture that has fabric or <b>leather</b> and <b>padding</b> stretched over a frame. Occasional furniture includes coffee tables, end tables, nesting tables, ottomans, and accent stools.|$|R
5000|$|Ulama de cadera or hip ulama. A hip ulama team {{consists}} {{of five or}} more players (but there could {{be as many as}} twelve) wearing loincloths, with <b>leather</b> hip <b>pads</b> for some protection against the heavy (3 kg, around 7 lb) rubber ball.|$|R
2500|$|Bareback pad, {{usually a}} simple pad {{in the shape}} of an English-style saddle pad, made of cordura nylon or <b>leather,</b> <b>padded</b> with fleece, wool or {{synthetic}} foam, equipped with a girth. It is used as an alternative to bareback riding to provide padding for both horse and rider and to help keep the rider's clothing a bit cleaner. Depending on materials, bareback pads offer a bit more grip to the rider's seat and legs. [...] However, though some bareback pads come with handles and even stirrups, without being attached to a saddle tree, these appendages are [...] unsafe and pads with them should be avoided. [...] In some cases, the addition of stirrups without a supporting tree place pressure on the horse's spinuous processes, potentially causing damage.|$|R

50|$|Japanese greaves, {{known as}} suneate, were first {{introduced}} during the eleventh century, {{during the late}} Heian period. The earliest suneate consisted of three plates of metal covering the shin. By the Kamakura period (1186 - 1333), suneate became a standard part of Japanese armor. Around the Muromachi period (1334 - 1572), suneate eventually became a splint mounted {{on a piece of}} fabric with mail in between the metal splint and fabric, not unlike European greaves. This is {{the most common form of}} suneate, termed shino-suneate, and saw continued use throughout the Momoyama period (1573 - 1602). Sometimes, cavalrymen used the older three-plate greaves, known as tsutsu-suneate. Like its European counterparts, most suneate contain <b>leather</b> <b>padding</b> on the interior to reduce the impact of blows and to reduce chafing.|$|R
5000|$|The new case, {{painted in}} three {{metallic}} colors, consists mostly of medium density wood fiber panels {{and has a}} modular design. This {{makes it easier to}} transport the system and to exchange defective components. Besides a 15 inch color screen, there is standard PC technology inside and a special control plate. The pain levels can be changed from 50% to 150%. The player must confirm {{that they are willing to}} participate in the game by pressing a [...] "I agree" [...] button before playing. Added benefits for the players include <b>leather</b> <b>padded</b> arm rests and the new ergonomic layout of the controls. Newly added fans in the PEUs cool the system down better between games to avoid electronic problems and can serve the players if they hit the right bonus item.|$|R
