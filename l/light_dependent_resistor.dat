The strong coupling between the PPy and SnO 2 results in the transformation of PPy from highly oxidized states to oxidized states and is confirmed through Raman analysis. The simple band conduction model and Kivelson's power law based conduction mechanism could not be applied to explain the conduction mechanism due to different reasons.

The formation of p-n junctions between p-type PPy and n-type SnO 2 changes the bandgap of PPy and the work function. This modifies the electronic structure of PPy which brings a synergistic effect in the photosensitivity of the PPy/SnO 2 nanocomposites.
