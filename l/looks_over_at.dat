2500|$|After {{wrapping}} Paul's {{body in a}} rug {{and cleaning}} up evidence of the murder and of his own presence in the apartment, Edward hears Connie leaving a message on Paul's answering machine, saying she must end the affair. Edward erases all the messages and leaves, putting Paul's body {{in the trunk of}} his car. Edward joins his wife at Charlie's school play, and late that night while Connie is sleeping, drives to a landfill and dumps Paul's body. In the ensuing days, Paul's murder plagues Edward, who is unable to stop thinking about what he has done. When two NYPD detectives arrive at the Sumner home while Edward is at work, they explain to Connie that Paul's estranged wife had reported him missing, and that they found Connie's name and phone number on his desk. Connie claims she barely knows him and that she was interested in buying books from him. A week later, the detectives return and tell Connie and Edward that Paul's body has been discovered. When police ask Connie how she met Paul, she replies that they met at a Juilliard fundraiser. To Connie's surprise, Edward corroborates her story. The detectives ask if Connie has ever been to Paul's apartment, and Connie denies even being in the Soho neighborhood any time recently. However, the police tell her that she had in fact received a parking ticket in front of Paul's apartment just a month earlier. Connie replies that she forgot about a day that she met friends for coffee at a Soho café. Several days later, Connie finds the investigator's photos of her and Paul when she takes Edward's clothes to the drycleaner, and realizes that Edward knows about the affair. That night, during a party at their home, Connie notices that the snow globe has been returned to their collection. Connie <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Edward, he meets her gaze knowingly, and she realizes that Edward murdered Paul.|$|E

60|$|Carston, Waite & Co. {{found they}} had struck {{on a good}} thing, so, down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk, until soon there were six pits working. From Nuttall, {{high up on the}} {{sandstone}} among the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to Minton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running north to Beggarlee and Selby, that <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Crich and the hills of Derbyshire: six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a loop of fine chain, the railway.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} this Joe <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> {{his master}} and what he sees shocks him: [...] "My Lord!" [...] Croak’s club slips from his hand and we hear it land on the ground but he is not dead; the [...] "‘morose delectation’ of remembered bygone sexual {{encounters}} has overwhelmed him". He gets up and shuffles off leaving his [...] "comforts" [...] alone.|$|E
50|$|Pepper {{turns out}} to be Coles, the wealthy businessman, and as both are being treated, Coles' wife arrives and hugs her husband. Caviezel <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the couple, and upon seeing the wife, remembers that they were having an affair. Caviezel {{arranged}} the kidnapping and planned to get rich and win the girl. Horrified by what he has done, he takes the ransom money to the officers. Coles introduces his wife to Caviezel.|$|E

50|$|Foreman {{is meeting}} with some donors when he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> some flowers he {{received}} a week ago that are still fresh. He excuses himself. He goes to House in triumph - it's Reye's syndrome. House says it's rare in adults and the wife kept all the medicine under lock and key. However, Foreman has realized that Natalie was an ex-florist who most likely used aspirin to {{extend the life of}} flowers for the few orders she still worked on. The patient probably had flu, which presented with a sore throat. He saw aspirin and started taking them and, because he forgot he took them, he probably took several. Foreman has already started the patient on steroids.|$|E
50|$|As Scott {{prepares to}} call for the hike, he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> his girlfriend, then looks out into the band bleachers, where he sees Macey. The clock runs down and Scott calls an audible, a running play where he {{maneuvers}} himself close enough {{to jump into the}} end zone. As he crosses, Scott is hammered by two defensive players, and his leg is shattered at the knee. Coldwater wins the Ohio State High School Championship game over the heavily favored Chiefs. Scott demonstrated that he is an intensely talented football player, as he basically; for the most part single handedly, beat a high school team that had eight players on defense already signed to NCAA Division I scholarships.|$|E
50|$|Orn {{approaches}} {{the young couple}} after they finish. Roong leads Orn into a stream where they both rub lotion on Min. They then dry off and lie {{down by the river}} bank, Roong with Min and Orn by herself. Orn <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the couple and becomes emotional. She discovers ants on all the picnic articles and throws the majority of the garbage into the river. She brushes off the picnic blanket, lies down on it and begins to cry. Meanwhile, Roong brings Min's penis out of his pants and rubs it with her hand. She slowly falls asleep as she whispers Min's name. The final shot is of Roong turning over and gazing directly into the camera.|$|E

50|$|Immediately three fish appear {{floating}} {{a bit of}} seaweed {{ahead of}} them, and on the seaweed rests the King's ring. Astonished, the King agrees to the marriage of his daughter to the young man. However, the daughter sets him upon another task of refilling sacks of grain that she has spilled in the grass. The young man is discouraged because he believes it impossible to gather all of the grain {{from the ground and}} he lies down and falls asleep shortly. When he wakes, he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the sacks that were empty the night before. To his surprise, they are now filled with grain with not one grain missing. The Ant King had all of the ants working the entire night to fill them.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mrs. Wilkins is frantically searching in the dark for Danny when she comes upon an odd shape which becomes surrounded by blinding light and then goes up into space. She begins crying thinking Danny might be in there, when she hears cries and mumbling from the grass. It's Danny, who, when asked by his mom if he's all right, says [...] "just cold".|$|E

Robin overhears that Bane and Candice are planning to kill Thorne after he takes care Batman, allowing them to run Thorne's criminal empire. They share a kiss shortly before Thorn enters the room, prompting Candice to casually leave the building. Batman tails her in the newly repaired Batmobile. Robin <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Batman following Candice for a brief moment, and right as {{he is about to}} resume spying on Thorne, he turns around to see that Bane has snuck up behind him and is now charging him. Robin manages to evade Bane for a brief period, but the cunning Bane eventually manages to sneak up behind Robin again and bear hug him into unconsciousness.|$|E

50|$|Pink's {{mother is}} seen praying {{in a church}} {{after the death of}} her husband overseas. Pink, however, is, at this point, {{oblivious}} of his death, and can be seen playing with a toy aeroplane. The song continues with Pink playing in a public park after his mother leaves him to go shopping. He sees a man who he takes a liking to in the absence of his own father. The man gives Pink a lift onto a ride, and it's clear Pink feels as if this man is his real father. Pink follows the man's son around, copying him, but doesn't understand why the other boy's father isn't paying attention to him. He grabs the man's hand but is shooed away, only to grab the man's hand again. The man pushes Pink away again, and dejectedly he sits on a swing (which is too far off the ground for him to swing himself). He <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the other parents swinging their kids, feeling even more alone.|$|E
50|$|In {{downtown}} Tokyo, Aiko keeps a {{close eye}} on Toru and Raidon in the streets. However, unbeknownst to her they have spotted her tailing them. Tracking them, she finds herself alone in an alley where Toru has strategically left a mysterious, glowing red ring on the ground for her to pick up. Aiko reaches for it, when suddenly the vampire gang's witch Kumiko flies overhead behind her with the Scythe. For a few seconds, the Scythe, the device, and Aiko conduct a red energy, before Toru appears in front of Aiko and breaks her jaw with a single punch, asking her how it feels to be a regular girl again. Before she can answer, Toru takes a horrific bite in her neck and kills her. Toru <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Raidon and claims the beta-test was successful. It is now time to take this technology global. The last panel is of Kumiko flying triumphantly into the sky, revealing a far larger ring device on the roof of a building.|$|E
50|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colin Tilley and was released on September 30, 2010. It opens with Shontelle walking alone next to an old building before cutting to {{a black and white}} scene of her singing in darkness. A man is shown working out in a gym and footage is shown of Shontelle interacting with him after he is finished. In the next scene, Shontelle can be seen standing in front of bright yellow lights and four other woman, who begin to dance as the song's beat picks up. Between takes of Shontelle singing in front of these women, the man can again be seen working out but this time with a different woman. Next, Shontelle is shown entering the gym and crouching in front of a row of lockers, flailing around as she sings. In the final scene, a fight is taking place between the man and another boxer as the other woman watches. Shontelle is shown {{standing in front of a}} wall that separates the boxing ring from the locker room, and finally steps around the wall entering into plain sight of the man. He <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> her, concerned, and as he does his opponent punches him in the head, knocking him down.|$|E
6000|$|He didn't like it; and, {{clapping}} on his hat, he {{went out}} to learn what the matter was. He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the house, up at the sky, down at the ground, and through the street; but nothing funny appeared, for Poppy and dolly were hidden again, and the old gentleman was puzzled. He went in and sat down to watch, feeling rather disturbed. Presently the fun began again: the children clapped their hands, the people laughed, and every one <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the house, in what he thought a very impertinent way. This made him angry; and out he rushed a second time, saying, as he marched across the street: ...|$|R
