25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the <b>Lock</b> <b>button.</b> Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the <b>Lock</b> <b>button</b> is clicked.|$|E

The Borg-Warner ITM 3e is also used in the 2006-now Hyundai Santa Fe and the Hyundai Tucson. In the Hyundais, the ITM 3e acts like a full-time AWD with 95:5 normal torque split. In extreme conditions, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split via the 4WD <b>LOCK</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

The <b>lock</b> <b>buttons</b> on C & D are not automatic releases. Figure C is a Christy Cutter (trademark) [...] and Figure D is an antique design. The simplicity of sliding mechanisms have allowed some knife manufacturers to build extremely thin gentlemen's models, that are very comfortable to pocket.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1967 the 250 SE was {{superseded}} by the 280 SE. It was {{powered by the}} new 2778 cc M130 engine, which produced [...] at 5500 rpm. Top speed was hardly affected, but acceleration improved to 10.5 seconds (13 with automatic).

2500|$|DA/SA pistols are {{versatile}} mechanisms. These firearms {{generally have}} a manual safety that additionally {{may serve to}} decock the hammer.

5000|$|Although {{the design}} concept was geared towards law {{enforcement}} and military close quarters combat scenarios, there was inadequate demand for the weapon due to some problematic design issues in its conception. One such design feature was safety lever {{on the left side}} of the stamped steel receiver, above the pistol grip. The actuation of this lever is not possible without removing the left arm from the pump, and is difficult if the operator is wearing gloves. The same problem exists for the slide <b>lock</b> <b>button.</b> These problems were mainly found in the early models exported to the United States of America. The company then focused its attention on these issues and were solved by reducing the resistance of the safety lever and over-ride slide <b>lock</b> <b>button.</b> The user can now operate both levers effectively and easily without taking the left hand off the pump. Another issue that plagued the MAG-7 was the 7.7 Kgf trigger pull. It was also addressed by the manufacturer and reduced to an industry standard 3.5Kgf ...|$|E

Operating systems may also provide audible notifications when Caps Lock, Num lock, or Scroll <b>lock</b> <b>buttons</b> are toggled.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the procedure taken to modify trans-tibial shuttle lock release mechanisms to decrease standard reach requirements {{in a case of}} limited mobility secondary to morbid obesity. The participant was a middle-aged, morbidly obese client with bilateral trans-tibial amputations. The distomedial shuttle <b>lock</b> release <b>buttons</b> were modified to activate with a cable/Dacron pull strap located proximal/lateral. The outcome of the modification was determined by whether or not the client would be able to independently doff the prostheses, if the patient was satisfied with the prostheses and by the condition of the components at the three-month follow-up. The client was independently successful at doffing both prostheses following the modification procedure. The patient expressed satisfaction with operation of the release mechanism but cosmetic covering was an issue. Components were optimally functioning at the three month follow-up. It was concluded that this procedure is a viable option for relocating distomedial release <b>lock</b> <b>buttons</b> more proximally when reach is limited. The procedure is not indicated in every case as gadget tolerance, cosmesis and manufacturer warranty issues must be considered...|$|R

The <b>lock</b> <b>button</b> for the shutter speed dial also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge.
