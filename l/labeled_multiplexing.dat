Selected reaction monitoring, a recently developed targeted proteomic mass spectrometric approach, {{has made it}} possible to evaluate previous findings and hypotheses with high sensitivity, reproducibility, and quantitative accuracy. Methods: Here, we have developed a <b>labelled</b> <b>multiplexed</b> selected reaction monitoring assay, comprising 56 proteins previously implicated in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders, including cell type markers or targets and effectors of known psychopharmacological interventions. We analyzed postmortem anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) tissue of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 22), bipolar disorder (n = 23), and major depressive disorder with (n = 11) and without (n = 11) psychotic features compared with healthy controls (n = 22). Results: Results agreed with several previous studies, with the finding of alterations of Wnt-signalling and glutamate receptor abundance predominately in bipolar disorder and abnormalities in energy metabolism across the neuropsychiatric disease spectrum. Calcium signalling was predominantly affected in schizophrenia and affective psychosis. Interestingly, we were able to show a decrease of all 4 tested oligodendrocyte specific proteins (MOG, MBP, MYPR, CNPase) in bipolar disorder {{and to a lesser extent}} in schizophrenia and affective psychosis.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of TS gene polymorphisms in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving PEM-based treatment. The vari-able nucleoid tandem repeat in the 5 '-UTR region was amplified and detected using fluorescently <b>labeled</b> <b>multiplex</b> short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction. The polymorphism in the 3 '-UTR region of the TS gene was detected using the Taqman probe. Efficacy of PEM was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1. 1. None of the genotypes were associated with gender, smoking status and age. Disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were similar between patients harboring 2 R and 3 R alleles (PFS, p= 0. 518; DCR, p= 0. 631; ORR, p= 0. 541), as well as those with a 6 -bp insertion and 6 -bp deletion (PFS, p= 0. 776; DCR, p= 0. 626; ORR, p= 0. 330). To study the combined effect of TS polymorphisms, the study population was divided into three groups: 2 R& 6 del, 2 R& 6 ins and 3 R& 6 del.

Our contributions are manifold. To evaluate influence, we define the influence graph allowing us to capture the relationships between users as a <b>labeled</b> <b>multiplex</b> graph where users are represented by nodes, and links model the different relations between them. After that, we combine the relations obtained from the graph to assess influence. The measure can be established between a couple of users by taking into account different relationships or interactions between them or it may also assess a user’s global influence in the network considering all the relations and interactions where his peers are involved in. We also consider uncertainty in the measurement process. We define a theoretical framework, to compute influence, based on the conjunctive combination rule for belief functions theory and Smets rule [7] to fusion and combine information. The proposed approach is flexible and thus, indirect influence in the graph can also be considered. In this case, the influence assessment considers influence exercised on indirect nodes (e.g. a user may retweet another’s tweet indirectly through an intermediate user). This spans the influence on multiple levels based on a multi-level influence graph. An evaluation through experiments is proposed. It is based on real data gathered from Twitter in the TEE 2014 project during the European Election campaign in 2014. We also conduct experiments on the CLEF RepLab 2014 data set, which contains Twitter data including influence-annotated Twitter profiles. We {{take advantage of these}} manual annotations to analyze our results and study the importance of the belief theory consideration in the influence assessment.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative data is an {{excellent}} resource in any proteomics study but is essential in many. In recent years this area has expanded from relative to absolute quantification {{with a wide range}} of methods available for absolute quantitative proteomics. In general protein quantification is based on either label-mediated or label-free strategies. Common label-mediated approaches are isotope dilution strategies, such as AQUA, coupled with mass spectrometry, where analyte signal is compared to a stable isotope labelled standard added in known abundance. These methods are suited to small-scale studies but increasing demand for large-scale proteome quantification exposed the need for alternative quantification methodologies. The QconCAT technology, first published in 2005, is a label mediated approach which utilises the principle of surrogacy to quantify analyte proteins based on a signature peptide, or peptides, for each protein. QconCATs are concatenations of quantotypic peptides for a group of proteins, the QconCAT gene is designed in silico and expressed heterologously in E. coli with [13 C 6]arg and [13 C 6]lys to elicit a stable isotope <b>labelled</b> <b>multiplexed</b> absolute quantification standard. In this thesis I describe several developments to the QconCAT production protocol. These developments reduce the production time from ~ 19 d, using the initial method, to less than 7 d. Time gains have been made across the whole workflow in the areas of protein expression, cell lysis, and product purification. Moreover verification of the QconCAT is delayed until the final product is synthesised, made possible by evidence of high quality reproducible expression. I explain how these alterations allow for production of several QconCATs in parallel, giving added efficiency. The success of the method is demonstrated through the use of multiple QconCATs. As a result of this work it is now possible to make at least eight QconCATs per week and the rate-limiting step of the quantification workflow has migrated from standard preparation to data processing. The final study in this thesis discusses methods for accurate quantification of the QconCAT protein and additional applications of QconCATs for testing mass spectrometer performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper shows a modulation-format {{transparent}} optical-label switching transmitter {{based on}} optical arbi-trary waveform generation. Every generated packet {{consists of a}} payload and a label; labels are extracted by a fiber Bragg grating. Optical-label switching (OLS) is a promising technology for implementing future all-optical packet switching networks [1]. OLS processes payloads all-optically while allowing both optical and electrical processing of labels through label extraction and rewriting. Among the many optical <b>labeling</b> schemes, subcarrier <b>multiplexed</b> <b>labeling</b> facilitates relatively simple all-optical extraction and rewriting by placing encoded labels as spectral components [2]. Modern optical networks simultaneously demand high data rates, high spectral efficiency, high capacity and low latency; however, the modulation and the spectral placement of the optical labels of the current subcarrier modulation method restrict the modulation format and bandwidth of the data payload and thus constrain network evolution. Recent developments in optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) allow for {{a new approach to}} OLS. OAWG can be used to create complex OLS packets, each consisting of a payload and a label in arbitrary modulation formats. OAWG is based on the parallel line-by-line manipulations of an optical frequency comb (OFC), which can generate spectrally efficient OLS packets. The maximum data rate of the OLS packets is determined by the total spectral bandwidth of the OFC. Static intensity and phase manipulations on each optical comb line generates identical OL...|$|R

We create a new node-colored graph graph G″ from G′, which is the graph with binary <b>labels</b> representing <b>multiplex</b> graph G as discussed above. The number of node colors is equal to |J|, and each color is used to express a single edge type, according to the binary label. For each node in V(G′), a set of |J| colored nodes is created in V(G″). So for every node A∈V(G′), a set A 1,A 2,…,A|J| with different colors is added to V(G″). Then, for 1 ≤j<|J|, every Aj∈V(G″) is connected to Aj+ 1 by adding an undirected edge (Aj,Aj+ 1) to E(G″). This creates a string of colored nodes for each node in the original network. Then, crucially, an edge between two nodes Aj and Bj is used to express the presence of the jth edge type encoded in the binary label. An example with undirected edges can be seen in Fig.  4 c, where the multiplex graph from Fig.  4 a with two types of edges is shown rewritten with two types of colored nodes.|$|R

We observed that reactions of nitrones with bicyclo[6. 1. 0]nonyne showed a stronger dependence on substituent effect for the reaction, as evidenced by a larger Hammett value, than that for biaryl-aza-cyclooctanone. We demonstrate the ability to stereoelectronically tune the reactivity of nitrones towards different cyclooctynes in SPANC reactions. This ability to introduce selectivity into different SPANC reactions through substituent provides the opportunity to perform multiple SPANC reactions in one reaction vessel and opens up potential applications in <b>multiplex</b> <b>labeling.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a SNP scoring platform, yielding high throughput, inexpensive assays. The basic platform uses fluorescently labeled DNA fragments bound to microspheres, which are analyzed using flow cytometry. SNP scoring is performed using minisequencing primers and fluorescently <b>labeled</b> dideoxynucleotides. Furthermore, <b>multiplexed</b> microspheres {{make it possible to}} score hundreds of SNPs simultaneously. Multiplexing, coupled with high throughput rates allow inexpensive scoring of several million SNPs/day. GAMMArrays use universal tags that consist of computer designed, unique DNA tails. These are incorporated into each primer, and the reverse-component is attached to a discrete population of microspheres in a multiplexed set. This enables simultaneous minisequencing of many SNPs in solution, followed by capture onto the appropriate microsphere for multiplexed analysis by flow cytometry. We present results from multiplexed SNP analyses of bacterial pathogens, and human mtDNA variation. Analytes are performed on PCR amplicons, each containing numerous SNPs scored simultaneously. In addition, these assays easily integrate into conventional liquid handling automation, and require no unique instrumentation for setup and analysis. Very high signal-to-noise ratios, ease of setup, flexibility in format and scale, and low cost make these assays extremely versatile and valuable tools {{for a wide variety of}} SNP scoring applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{common thread}} of this thesis is {{the will of}} {{investigating}} properties and behavior of assemblies. Groups of objects display peculiar properties, which can be very far from the simple sum of respective components’ properties. This is truer, the smaller is inter-objects distance, i. e. the higher is their density, and the smaller is the container size. “Confinement” {{is in fact a}} key concept in many topics explored and here reported. It can be conceived as a spatial limitation, that yet gives origin to unexpected processes and phenomena based on inter-objects communication. Such phenomena eventually result in “non-linear properties”, responsible for the low predictability of large assemblies. Chapter 1 provides two insights on surface chemistry, namely (i) on a supramolecular assembly based on orthogonal forces, and (ii) on selective and sensitive fluorescent sensing in thin polymeric film. In chapters 2 to 4 confinement of molecules plays a major role. Most of the work focuses on FRET within core-shell nanoparticles, investigated both through a simulation model and through experiments. Exciting results of great applicative interest are drawn, such as a method of tuning emission wavelength at constant excitation, and a way of overcoming self-quenching processes by setting up a competitive deactivation channel. We envisage applications of these materials as <b>labels</b> for <b>multiplexing</b> analysis, and in all fields of fluorescence imaging, where brightness coupled with biocompatibility and water solubility is required. Adducts of nanoparticles and molecular photoswitches are investigated in the context of superresolution techniques for fluorescence microscopy. In chapter 5 a method is proposed to prepare a library of functionalized Pluronic F 127, which gives access to a twofold “smart” nanomaterial, namely both (i) luminescent and (ii) surface-functionalized SCSSNPs. Focus shifts in chapter 6 to confinement effects in an upper size scale. Moving from nanometers to micrometers, we investigate the interplay between microparticles flowing in microchannels where a constriction affects at very long ranges structure and dynamics of the colloidal paste. ...|$|R
40|$|Flow cytometry is an {{important}} drug discovery tool because it permits high-content multiparameter analysis of individual cells. A new method dramatically enhanced screening throughput by multiplexing many discrete fixed cell populations; however, this method is not suited to assays requiring functional cellular responses. HEK 293 cells were transfected with unique mutant glycine receptors. Mutant receptor expression was confirmed by coexpression of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Commercially available cell-permeant dyes were used to label each glycine receptor expressing mutant with a unique optical code. All encoded cell lines were combined in a single tube and analyzed on a flow cytometer simultaneously {{before and after the}} addition of glycine receptor agonist. We decoded multiplexed cells that expressed functionally distinct glycine receptor chloride channels and analyzed responses to glycine in terms of chloride-sensitive YFP expression. Here, data provided by flow cytometry can be used to discriminate between functional and nonfunctional mutations in the glycine receptor, a process accelerated by the use of multiplexing. Further, this data correlates to data generated using a microscopy-based technique. The present study demonstrates <b>multiplexed</b> <b>labeling</b> of live cells, to enable cell populations to be subject to further cell culture and experimentation, and compares the results with those obtained using live cell microscopy. © 2009 International Society for Advancement of Cytometr...|$|R
40|$|Differential protein {{expression}} analysis {{based on}} modification of selected amino acids with labelling reagents {{has become the}} major method of choice for quantitative proteomics. One such methodology, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE), uses a matched set of fluorescent N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) ester cyanine dyes to label lysine residues in different samples which can be run simultaneously on the same gels. Here we report the use of iodoacetylated cyanine (ICy) dyes (for labelling of cysteine thiols, for 2 -D DIGE-based redox proteomics. Characterisation of ICy dye labelling in relation to its stoichiometry, sensitivity and specificity is described, as well as comparison of ICy dye with NHS-Cy dye labelling and several protein staining methods. We have optimised conditions for labelling of nonreduced, denatured samples and report increased sensitivity for a subset of thiol-containing proteins, allowing accurate monitoring of redox-dependent thiol modifications and expression changes, Cysteine labelling was then combined with lysine <b>labelling</b> in a <b>multiplex</b> 2 -D DIGE proteomic study of redox-dependent and ErbB 2 -dependent changes in epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress. This study identifies differentially modified proteins involved in cellular redox regulation, protein folding, proliferative suppression, glycolysis and cytoskeletal organisation, revealing {{the complexity of the}} response to oxidative stress and the impact that overexpression of ErbB 2 has on this response...|$|R
