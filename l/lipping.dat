60|$|Mr. Archer laughed unpleasantly, {{rose and}} moved to the water's edge. In this part the body of the river poured across a little narrow fell, ran some ten feet very {{smoothly}} over a bed of pebbles, then getting wind, as it were, of another shelf of rock which barred the channel, began, by imperceptible degrees, to separate towards either shore in dancing currents, and to leave the middle clear and stagnant. The set towards either side was nearly equal; about one half of the whole water plunged {{on the side of the}} castle, through a narrow gullet; about one half ran <b>lipping</b> past the margin of the green and slipped across a babbling rapid.|$|E

And now came poor Ailie's severest trial. When she allowed herself to sink, and felt the water rising about her ears, and <b>lipping</b> round her mouth, terror again seized upon her; but she felt Glynn's breast heaving under her hands, so she raised her eyes to heaven and prayed silently to Him who is the only true deliverer from dangers. Her self-possession was restored, and soon she observed the boat bearing down on the spot, and heard the men as they shouted to attract attention.|$|E

40|$|Synthesis of {{multiple}} extracellular lipases in Candida rugosa has been demonstrated.

To analyze the effects of different culture conditions, the transcript concentrations for these mRNA species were normalized relative to the values for gpd, encoding glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. In relative terms, <b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3 were highly and constitutively expressed (about 105 molecules per μg of total RNA) whereas the other inducible <b>lip</b> genes, especially <b>lip</b> 4, showed significant changes in mRNA expression under different culture conditions.

6000|$|I {{will not}} enter on many more details; but I must remark that the curious {{structure}} of the northern Maldiva atolls receives (taking into consideration the free entrance of the sea through their broken margins) a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the corals, originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons, such as occur in common atolls, and on broken portions of the linear marginal reef, such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form. I cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these complex structures--a great sandy and generally concave disk rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded and its edge symmetrically bordered with oval basins of coral-rock just <b>lipping</b> {{the surface of the}} sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and each containing a lake of clear water! ...|$|E
60|$|The island {{on which}} the {{travellers}} had been cast was a mere knoll of sand, not {{more than a few}} hundred yards in circumference, that scarcely raised its rounded summit above the level of the water, and at full tide was reduced to a mere speck, utterly destitute of vegetation. The sea around it was now smooth and clear as glass, though undulated by a long, regular swell, which rolled, at slow, solemn intervals, in majestic waves towards the sand-bank, where they hovered for a moment in curved walls of dark-green water, then, <b>lipping</b> over, at their crests, fell in a roar of foam that hissed a deep sigh on the pebbles of the beach, and left the silence greater than before. Masses of ice floated here and there {{on the surface of the}} deep, the edges and fantastic points of which were tipped with light. Not far from the northern extremity of the sand-bank a large iceberg had grounded, from the sides of which several pinnacles had been hurled by the shock and now lay stranded on the beach.|$|E
60|$|To walk at all was a {{laborious}} business; {{the foot}} sank and slid, the boots were cut to pieces, among sharp, uneven, rolling stones. When {{we crossed the}} platform in any direction, it was usual to lay a course, following {{as much as possible}} the line of waggon rails. Thus, if water were to be drawn, the water-carrier left the house along some tilting planks that we had laid down, and not laid down very well. These carried him to that great highroad, the railway; and the railway served him as far as {{to the head of the}} shaft. But from thence to the spring and back again he made the best of his unaided way, staggering among the stones, and wading in low growth of the calcanthus, where the rattlesnakes lay hissing at his passage. Yet I liked to draw water. It was pleasant to dip the grey metal pail into the clean, colourless, cool water; pleasant to carry it back, with the water <b>lipping</b> at the edge, and a broken sunbeam quivering in the midst.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lips</b> {{are filled}} in {{using a small}} brush. The colour comes in a small stick, which is melted in water. Crystallized sugar is then added to give the <b>lips</b> luster. Rarely will a geisha colour in both <b>lips</b> fully in the Western style, as white creates optical illusions and {{colouring}} the <b>lips</b> fully would make them appear overly large. The lower <b>lip</b> is coloured in partially and the upper <b>lip</b> left white for maiko in her first year, after which the upper <b>lip</b> is coloured. Newly full-fledged geisha will colour in only the top <b>lip</b> fully. Most geisha wear the top <b>lip</b> coloured in fully or stylized, and the bottom <b>lip</b> in a curved stripe that does not follow {{the shape of the}} <b>lip.</b> Geisha round the bottom <b>lips</b> to create the illusion of a flower bud.|$|R
40|$|Excessively large <b>lips</b> {{represent}} an occasional but significant challenge in aesthetic surgery. Previously described techniques focus {{largely on the}} simple excision of a strip of tissue to reduce the <b>lips,</b> without specific attention to the resultant <b>lip</b> contour or to the volume relationship between the <b>lips.</b> The present paper describes a new technique for <b>lip</b> reduction, called the ‘bikini <b>lip</b> reduction’. This technique not only reduces {{the volume of the}} <b>lips,</b> but also restores an attractive labial contour, as well as an ideal volume relationship between the upper and lower <b>lips.</b> Because it is based on aesthetic analysis, this technique consistently yields both smaller and more aesthetically appealing <b>lips.</b> Simply stated, the bikini <b>lip</b> reduction consists of excision of a ‘bikini top’ (two cups and a middle strap) from the upper <b>lip</b> and a ‘bikini bottom’ (a triangle) from the lower <b>lip.</b> The aesthetic results and the patient satisfaction achieved through the bikini <b>lip</b> reduction technique have been very satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} activation of two isoenzymes (<b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3) from Candida rugosa in polyethylene glycol (PEG) media. Aqueous solutions of PEG 8000 and 20, 000 activate <b>lip</b> 3 but not <b>lip</b> 1 from C. rugosa. Maximum activation (260 %) of <b>lip</b> 3 requires 6 h of pre-incubation with PEG 8000 (4 %, w/v). PEG seems {{to shift the}} equilibrium between the open and the closed forms of <b>lip</b> 3 towards the active conformation. Inhibition experiments demonstrate that ligands have easier access to the <b>lip</b> 3 active site than to the <b>lip</b> 1 active site, both in the presence {{and the absence of}} PEG. The presence of PEG in the crystallization medium is responsible for reported differences in the crystal structures of <b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3. A comparative analysis of crystallographic models of <b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3 suggests a role for PEG in activation of <b>lip</b> 3 and further stabilization of the activated/open form via dimerization in aqueous media...|$|R
60|$|The sailor ceased {{speaking}} abruptly. As {{he looked}} back at the approaching roller he felt solemnised and somewhat alarmed, for it appeared so perpendicular and so high from his low position, that it seemed as if it would fall on and overwhelm the raft. There was, indeed, some danger of this. Glancing along its length, Jarwin saw that here and there the edge was <b>lipping</b> over, while in one place, not far off, the thunder of its fall had already begun. Another moment, and it appeared to hang over his head; the raft was violently lifted at the stern, caught up, and whirled onward at railway speed, like a cork {{in the midst of a}} boiling cauldron of foam. The roar was deafening. The tumultuous heaving almost overturned it several times. Jarwin held on firmly to the mast with his right arm, and grasped the terrier with his left hand, for the poor creature had not strength to resist such furious motion. It all passed with bewildering speed. It seemed as if, in one instant, the raft was hurled through the narrows, and launched into the calm harbour within. An eddy, at the inner side of the opening, swept it round, and fixed the end of one of the largest spars of which it was composed on the beach.|$|E
6000|$|The lagoons {{of all the}} atolls in the {{southern}} part of the Archipelago are from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part. This is well exemplified in the case of Addoo, {{the southern}}most atoll in the group, for although only nine miles in its longest diameter, it has a depth of thirty-nine fathoms, whereas all the other small atolls have comparatively shallow lagoons; I can assign no adequate cause for this difference in depth. In the central and deepest part of the lagoons, the bottom consists, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, of stiff clay (probably a calcareous mud); nearer the border it consists of sand, and in the channels through the reef, of hard sand-banks, sandstone, conglomerate rubble, and a little live coral. Close outside the reef and the line joining its detached portions (where intersected by many channels), the bottom is sandy, and it slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths. In most lagoons the depth is considerably greater in the centre than in the channels; but in Tilla-dou-Matte, where the marginal ring-formed reefs stand far apart, the same depth is carried across the entire atoll, from the deep-water line on one side to that on the other. I cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these atolls,--a great sandy and generally concave disc rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded and its border symmetrically fringed with oval basins of coral-rock, just <b>lipping</b> the surface of the sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and each containing a little lake of clear water! ...|$|E
6000|$|The farm is older. It {{was first}} a grange of Whitekirk Abbey, tilled and {{inhabited}} by rosy friars. Thence, after the Reformation, it {{passed into the}} hands of a true-blue Protestant family. During the Covenanting troubles, when a night conventicle was held upon the Pentlands, the farm doors stood hospitably open till the morning; the dresser was laden with cheese and bannocks, milk and brandy; and the worshipers kept <b>lipping</b> down from the hill between two exercises, as couples visit the supper-room between two dances of a modern ball. In the Forty-Five, some foraging Highlanders from Prince Charlie's army fell upon Swanston in the dawn. The great-grandfather of the late farmer was then a little child; him they awakened by plucking the blankets from his bed, and he remembered, when he was an old man, their truculent looks and uncouth speech. The churn stood full of cream in the dairy, and with this they made their brose in high delight. [...] "It was braw brose," [...] said one of them. At last they made off, laden like camels with their booty; and Swanston Farm has lain {{out of the way of}} history from that time forward. I do not know what may be yet in store for it. On dark days, when the mist runs low upon the hill, the house has a gloomy air as if suitable for private tragedy. But in hot July, you can fancy nothing more perfect than the garden, laid out in alleys and arbours and bright, old-fashioned flower-plots, and ending in a miniature ravine, all trellis-work and moss and tinkling waterfall, and housed from the sun under fathoms of broad foliage.|$|E

60|$|But {{what was}} the matter with the Colonel? Who would have {{recognised}} him who had only seen the broken old man in the Libyan desert? There might be some little grizzling about the moustache, but the hair was back once more at the fine glossy black which had been so much admired upon the voyage up. With a stony face and an unsympathetic manner he had received, upon his return to Haifa, all the commiserations about the dreadful way in which his privations had blanched him, and then diving into his cabin, he had reappeared within an hour exactly as he had been before that fatal moment when he had been cut off from the manifold resources of civilisation. And he looked in such a sternly questioning manner at every one who stared at him, that no one had the moral courage to make any remark about this modern miracle. It was observed from that time forward that, if the Colonel had only to ride a hundred yards into the desert, he always began his preparations by putting a small black bottle with a pink label into the side-pocket of his coat. But those who knew him best at times when a man may be best known, said that the old soldier had a young man's heart and a young man's spirit,--so that if he wished to keep a young man's colour also it was not very unreasonable after all. It was very soothing and restful up there on the saloon deck, with no sound but the gentle <b>lipping</b> of the water as it rippled against the sides of the steamer.

60|$|Thus {{far we have}} {{considered}} facts, which indicate, with more or less probability, the increase of the atoll in its different parts: there are others having an opposite tendency. On the south-east side, Lieutenant Sulivan, to whose kindness I am indebted for many interesting observations, found the conglomerate projecting on the reef nearly fifty yards {{in front of the}} beach: we may infer from what we see in all other parts of the atoll, that the conglomerate was not originally so much exposed, but formed the base of an islet, the front and upper part of which has since been swept away. The degree to which the conglomerate, round nearly the whole atoll, has been scooped, broken up, and the fragments cast on the beach, is certainly very surprising, even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales to pile up fragments, and of the daily tides to wear them away. On the western side, also, of the atoll, where I have described a bed of sand and fragments with trees growing out of it, in front of an old beach, it struck both Lieutenant Sulivan and myself, from {{the manner in which the}} trees were being washed down, that the surf had lately recommenced an attack on this line of coast. Appearances indicating a slight encroachment of the water on the land, are plainer within the lagoon: I noticed in several places, both on its windward and leeward shores, old cocoa-nut trees falling with their roots undermined, and the rotten stumps of others on the beach, where the inhabitants assured us the cocoa-nut could not now grow. Captain Fitzroy pointed out to me, near the settlement, the foundation posts of a shed, now washed by every tide, but which the inhabitants stated, had seven years before stood above high watermark. In the calm waters of the lagoon, directly connected with a great, and therefore stable ocean, it seems very improbable that a change in the currents, sufficiently great to cause the water to eat into the land on all sides, should have taken place within a limited period. From these considerations I inferred, that probably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount; and this inference was strengthened by the circumstance, that in 1834, two years before our visit, the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake, and by two slighter ones during the ten previous years. If, during these subterranean disturbances, the atoll did subside, the downward movement must have been very small, as we must conclude from the fields of dead coral still <b>lipping</b> the surface of the lagoon, and from the breakers on the western shore not having yet regained the line of their former action. The subsidence must, also, have been preceded by a long period of rest, during which the islets extended to their present size, and the living margin of the reef grew either upwards, or as I believe outwards, to its present distance from the beach.|$|E
