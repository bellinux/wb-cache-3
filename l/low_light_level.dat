5|$|Autonetics (A {{division}} of North American Aviation) R-132 forward looking radar (FLR) to locate targets for closer inspection via <b>Low</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Level</b> TV (LLLTV) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and featured a Moving Target Indicator (MTI) and automatic tracking capability.|$|E
5|$|To improve {{operations}} at low altitude, the AN/ASQ-151 Electro-Optical Viewing System (EVS), {{which consisted of}} a <b>Low</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Level</b> Television (LLLTV) and a Forward looking infrared (FLIR) system mounted in blisters under the noses of B-52Gs and Hs between 1972 and 1976. The navigational capabilities of the B-52 were later augmented {{with the addition of}} GPS in the 1980s. The IBM AP-101, also used on the Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber and the Space Shuttle, was the B-52's main computer.|$|E
5000|$|This {{breakdown}} in the usual tradeoff between aperture and shutter speed is known as reciprocity failure. Each different film type has a different response at <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> Some films are very susceptible to reciprocity failure, and others much less so. Some films that are very light sensitive at normal illumination levels and normal exposure times lose much of their sensitivity at <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> becoming effectively [...] "slow" [...] films for long exposures. Conversely some films that are [...] "slow" [...] under normal exposure duration retain their light sensitivity better at <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R

50|$|High retinal {{summation}} is {{an adaptation}} to <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> and <b>low</b> retinal summation to high <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> (thus sharpening the images).|$|R
25|$|The 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix indeed did adopt a late {{afternoon}} start (17:00 local time, 09:00 UTC). However this proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall causing {{the race to}} be red-flagged {{and not being able}} to be restarted due to the <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1967, {{three of}} the 13th Bomb Squadron's B-57Bs (52-1518, 52–1580, and 52-3860) were {{experimentally}} fitted with a <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> television system carried in a pod underneath the port wing. Operational trials with this equipment took place between December 1967 and August 1968, mostly over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The results of the trials were sufficiently encouraging that the USAF awarded a contract to Martin and Westinghouse to modify 16 B-57Bs as night intruders under the designation B-57G. In January 1968, the 13th Bomb Squadron was inactivated and its B-57s were returned to the United States for modification as B-57G night intruders for use in Vietnam under a project known as Tropic Moon.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward-facing}} {{eyes of a}} bird of prey give binocular vision, {{which is}} assisted by a double fovea. The raptor's adaptations for optimum visual resolution (an American kestrel can see a 2–mm insect {{from the top of}} an 18–m tree) has a disadvantage in that its vision is poor in <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level,</b> and it must roost at night. Raptors may have to pursue mobile prey in the lower part of their visual field, and therefore do not have the lower field myopia adaptation demonstrated by many other birds. Scavenging birds like vultures do not need such sharp vision, so a condor has only a single fovea with about 35,000 receptors mm2. Vultures, however have high physiological activity of many important enzymes to suit their distant clarity of vision.|$|E
50|$|They need high {{humidity}} and warm temperatures with <b>low</b> to medium <b>light,</b> and they tolerate extremely <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{experiments}} investigated {{several aspects}} of motion perception at high and low luminance levels. Detection of weak coherent motion in random dot cinematograms was unaffected by <b>light</b> <b>level</b> over a range of dot speeds. The ability to judge form from motion was, however, impaired at <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels,</b> as was the ability to discriminate normal from phase-scrambled biological motion sequences. The difficulty distinguishing differential motions {{may be explained by}} increased spatial pooling at <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} valued in {{cultivation}} {{for its ability}} to clothe east- or north-facing surfaces, which can be problematic due to <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
500|$|B-52G and Hs {{were also}} {{modified}} with electro-optical viewing system (EVS) that made low-level operations and terrain avoidance much easier and safer. EVS system contained a <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> television (LLTV) {{camera and a}} forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera to display information needed for penetration at lower altitude.|$|E
500|$|As {{a private}} venture, Thyssen-Henschel built a fourth {{prototype}} designated TH301. Completed in 1978, it added a PERI R12 periscope, originally {{designed for the}} Leopard 1A4, for the tank commander. [...] The gunner and loader each received a day periscope as well. To enable the crew to fire effectively at night, a <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> television (LLLTV) camera, which moved in elevation with the main gun, was fitted to the mantlet. [...] Furthermore, the tank received a more powerful [...] engine. [...] The improvement program also made provisions to increase {{the thickness of the}} armor for additional protection.|$|E
2500|$|Two C-123K {{aircraft}} modified in September 1965 under Project Black Spot. The Black Spot aircraft were to fit {{under the}} [...] "self-contained night attack capability" [...] that was Operation Shed Light's primary focus and E-Systems of Greenville, Texas was contracted {{to complete the}} modifications. These aircraft featured {{a variety of new}} sensors including <b>Low</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Level</b> TV (LLLTV), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and a laser rangefinder. The aircraft looked radically different visibly from its transport brethren, as the new equipment required lengthening the nose by over 50inches. The aircraft also featured an armament system designed to carry BLU-3/B (using the ADU-253/B adapter) or BLU-26/B (using the ADU-272/B adapter) bomblets, or CBU-68/B cluster bombs.|$|E
40|$|The {{sparsity}} of photons at very <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> necessitates a nonlinear synaptic {{transfer function}} between the rod photoreceptors and the rodbipolar cells. We examine {{different ways to}} characterize {{the performance of the}} pathway: the error rate, two variants of the mutual information, and the signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation of the pathway shows that these approaches yield substantially different performance at very <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> and that maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio yields the best performance when judged from simulated images. The results are compared to recent data. ...|$|R
50|$|Mature laurel forests {{typically}} have a dense tree canopy and <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> at the forest floor. Some forests {{are characterized by}} an overstory of emergent trees.|$|R
50|$|One {{study on}} rats {{investigated}} whether changes in light intensity - a short-term manipulation of emotional state - {{has an effect}} on cognitive bias. Light intensity was chosen as a treatment because this specifically relates to anxiety-induction. Rats were trained to discriminate between two different locations, in either high ('H') or <b>low</b> ('L') <b>light</b> <b>levels.</b> One location was rewarded with palatable food and the other with aversive food. Rats switched from high to <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> (putatively the least negative emotional manipulation) ran faster to all three ambiguous locations than rats switched from <b>low</b> to high <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> (putatively the most negative manipulation).|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to reducing infrared and acoustic emissions, a stealth vehicle must avoid radiating any other detectable energy, such as from onboard radars, communications systems, or RF leakage from electronics enclosures. The F-117 uses passive infrared and <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> television sensor systems to aim its {{weapons and the}} F-22 Raptor has an advanced LPI radar which can illuminate enemy aircraft without triggering a radar warning receiver response.|$|E
5000|$|Lanterns {{may also}} be used for signaling, as torches, or as general light sources outdoors. <b>Low</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> {{varieties}} are used for decoration. The term [...] "lantern" [...] is also used more generically to mean a light source, or the enclosure for a light source. Examples are glass pane enclosed street lights, or the housing for the top lamp and lens section of a lighthouse. The term is commonly associated with Chinese paper lanterns.|$|E

50|$|In {{late summer}} and autumn, the plant stops {{producing}} carnivorous leaves, and instead produces flat, non-carnivorous phyllodia. This is probably an adaptation to <b>low</b> <b>light</b> <b>levels</b> and insect scarcity during the winter months, and shows clearly the cost of carnivory.|$|R
