40|$|While {{females are}} still {{underrepresented}} as directors overall, {{the results of}} our survey indicate that in the past ten years female <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> have been hired in numbers nearly matching their overall percentage of the medical library profession. When the personal characteristics of medical <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> are compared by gender, male directors {{are more likely to be}} married, have children, and be somewhat younger upon attaining their first directorship. When the professional characteristics are compared, the only notable difference is that a greater portion of males hold a second master's degree. Despite the changing numbers of female <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> in the past ten years, these differences all held constant before and after 1977. Only the number of internal successions to directorship changed over time. The succession patterns of medical <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> now match more closely those of other academic <b>library</b> <b>directors...</b>|$|R

In California, his work and attention was drawn more fully into overland trail and California history. During his tenure at Bancroft he wrote or edited some forty books including the edited collection of documents in Overland in 1846 (1963) and The West of William H. Ashley (1964), as well as producing well received articles and reviews. He was named a Fellow of the Utah State Historical Society in 1960 and received the Henry Raup Wagner Award in 1961.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of {{information}} resources and communication technologies, both traditional and electronic, by academic <b>library</b> <b>directors.</b> The purpose is to improve understanding of managerial behavior when using information resources and communication technologies within a shared information environment. Taylor's concept of an information use environment is used to capture the elements associated with information use and communication within the context of decision-making styles, managerial roles, organizational environments, and professional communities. This qualitative study uses interviews, observations, questionnaires, and documents. <b>Library</b> <b>directors</b> participating in the study are from doctoral-degree granting universities in the southwestern United States. Data collection involved on-site observations with a PDA (personal digital assistant), structured interviews with <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> and their administrative assistants, the Decision Style Inventory, and a questionnaire based on Mintzberg's managerial roles. Findings show the existence of a continuum in managerial activities between an Administrator and an Administrator/Academic as critical to understanding information use and communication patterns among <b>library</b> <b>directors.</b> There is a gap between self-perception of managerial activities and actual performance, a finding that would not have surfaced without the use of multiple methods. Other findings include the need for a technical ombudsman, a managerial-level position reporting to the library director; the importance of information management as an administrative responsibility; the importance of trust when evaluating information; and the importance of integrating information and communication across formats, time, and managerial activities...|$|R

40|$|In the {{information}} age of the 1990 s, the clinical medical librarian (CML) concept, like many other personalized library services, is often criticized as being too labor-intensive and expensive; others praise its advantages. To determine the attitudes of medical school <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> and clinical department heads toward implementation and feasibility of a CML program, forty randomly selected medical schools were surveyed. A double-blind procedure was used to sample department heads in internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery, as well as health sciences <b>library</b> <b>directors</b> identified by the Association of Academic Health Sciences <b>Library</b> <b>Directors</b> (AAHSLD) annual statistics. The survey instrument was designed to measure responses to the following attitudinal variables: acceptance and nonacceptance of a CML program; importance to patient care, education, and research; influence on information-seeking patterns of health care professionals; ethical issues; CML extension services; and costs. Seventy-nine usable questionnaires {{out of a total}} of 120 (66 %) were obtained from clinical medical personnel, and 30 usable questionnaires {{out of a total of}} 40 (75 %) were obtained from medical school <b>library</b> <b>directors.</b> Survey results indicated significant differences between clinical medical personnel and library personnel regarding attitudes toward CML influence on information-seeking patterns, ethics, alternative CML services, and costs.
