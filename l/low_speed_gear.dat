For example, helical gears are {{normally}} limited to gear ratios of less than 10:1 while worm-and-gear sets vary from 10:1 to 500:1.

Between helium turbine and generator, there is gearbox device which reduces the turbine rotation speed to normal speed required by the generator. Three optional gearbox schemes are discussed. The first is single reduction cylindrical gearbox, which consists of one high speed gear and one <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>gear.</b> Its advantage is simple structure, easy to manufacture, and high reliability, while its disadvantage is large volume and misalignment of input and output axle. The second is planetary gear mechanism with static planet carrier. The third is planetary gear mechanism with static internal gear. The latter two gearbox devices have similar structure. Their advantage is small volume and high reduction gear ratio, while disadvantage are complicated structure, many gears, low reliability and low mechanical efficiency...|$|E

50|$|The Nevadas were {{virtually}} identical except in their propulsion machinery. Nevada {{and her sister}} were fitted with different engines to compare them head-to-head: Oklahoma received older vertical triple-expansion engines (she {{would be the last}} U.S. capital ship to use reciprocating machinery), while Nevada received compound, direct-drive Curtis steam turbines combined with geared cruising turbines. Oklahomas equipment made her less reliable and more vibration-prone, making her a ship the Navy wished to re-engine. In 1925, the Navy considered conversion to four double-acting two-stroke diesel engines. Because of the excessive weight of the diesels of the time, this idea was rejected. Nevada was the first US capital ship to use reduction geared cruising turbines, which could be clutched into the high-pressure turbines to improve fuel economy at <b>low</b> <b>speeds.</b> <b>Geared</b> turbines were fitted in most subsequent US battleships, except those with turbo-electric propulsion.|$|R

Examples include enclosed gear drives operating at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> and open <b>gearing.</b> Grades 0, 1 and 2 are used in highly loaded gearing. Grades 1 through 4 are often used in rolling contact bearings. Greases with a higher number are firmer, tend to stay in place and are a good choice when leakage is a concern.|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} two meshing gears {{exhibits}} a stiffness that {{varies with the}} number of teeth in instantaneous contact and the location of the corresponding contact points. A classical Newtonian statement of the equations of motion leads to a solution that contradicts the fundamental principle of mechanics that the change in total energy in the system is equal to the work done by the external forces, unless the deformation of the teeth is taken into account in defining the direction of the instantaneous tooth interaction force. This paradox is avoided by using a Lagrange’s equations to derive the equations of motion, thus ensuring conservation of energy. This introduces nonlinear terms that are absent in the classical equations of motion. In particular, the step change in stiffness associated with the introduction of an additional tooth to contact implies a step change in strain energy and hence a corresponding step change in kinetic energy and rotational speed. The effect of these additional terms is examined by dynamic simulation, using a system of two involute spur gears as an example. It is shown that the two systems of equations give similar predictions at high rotational speeds, but they differ considerably at lower speeds. The results have implications for gear design, particularly for <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> sets. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 1891815 �...|$|E
40|$|The {{main cause}} of power loss or {{dissipation}} of heat in case of meshed gears is due to friction existing between gear tooth mesh and {{is a major concern}} in <b>low</b> rotational <b>speed</b> <b>gears,</b> whereas in case of high operating speed the power loss taking place due to compression of air-lubricant mixture (churning losses) and windage losses due to aerodynamic trial of air lubricant mixture which controls the total efficiency needs to be considered. Therefore, in order to improve mechanical efficiency it is necessary for gear designer during gear tooth optimization to consider these energy losses. In this research paper the power loss analysis for a tooth-sum of 100 altered by ± 4 % operating between a specified center distance is considered. The results show that negative altered tooth-sum gearing performs better as compared to standard and positive altered tooth-sum gearing...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study of}} a representative tilt wing transport aircraft was conducted in 1990 on the Ames Vertical Motion Simulator. This simulation {{is in response to}} renewed interest in the tilt wing concept for use in future military and civil applications. For past tilt wing concepts, pitch control in hover and low-speed flight has required a tail rotor or reaction jets at the tail. Use of mono cyclic propellers or a geared flap have also been proposed as alternate methods for providing pitch control at <b>low</b> <b>speed.</b> The <b>geared</b> flap is a subject of this current study. This report describes the geared flap concept, the tilt wing aircraft, the simulation model, the simulation facility and experiment setup, the pilots' evaluation tasks and procedures, and the results obtained from the simulation experiment.

40|$|Traveling Wave Ultrasonic Motor (TWUM) is a compact, precise, {{and silent}} {{actuator}} generating high torque at <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> without <b>gears.</b> Moreover, the TWUM {{has a high}} holding torque without supply, which makes this motor as an attractive solution for holding position of robotic arms. However, their nonlinear dynamics, {{and the presence of}} load-dependent dead zones often limit their use. Those issues can be overcome in closed loop with effective and precise controllers. In this paper, robust H-infinity (H∞) and discrete time RST position controllers are presented. The H∞ controller is designed in continuous time with additional weighting filters to ensure the robustness in the case of uncertain motor model and external disturbances. Robust RST controller based on the pole placement method is also designed and compared to the H∞. Simulink model of TWUM is used to validate the stability and the robustness of the two proposed controllers...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis has {{examined}} how {{the understanding of}} different driving tasks {{can be used to}} develop a suitable powertrain model {{to be used in the}} Sim III simulator at VTI. Studies performed in the simulator have been statistically analyzed using parameters commonly used to describe driving patterns in drive cycles. It has been shown that the studies can be divided into three driving tasks: "High constant velocity", "High velocity with evasive maneuver", and "Mixed driving". Furthermore, a powertrain model from a former master thesis has been further developed. The new model utilizes a 3 D torque map that takes engine speed, accelerator pedal position and gear as input. Using measurements, from the chassis dynamometers laboratory at LiU, that resembles the derived driving tasks, it has been shown that the performance of the new model has significantly increased for high velocity driving and during maximum acceleration. However, when using the clutch at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>gears</b> the model still performs poorly and needs further development...|$|R

5000|$|A {{subset of}} CVT designs are called {{infinitely}} variable transmissions (IVT or IVTs), {{in which the}} range of ratios of output shaft speed to input shaft speed includes a zero ratio that can be continuously approached from a defined [...] "higher" [...] ratio. A zero output <b>speed</b> (<b>low</b> <b>gear)</b> with a finite input speed implies an infinite input-to-output speed ratio, which can be continuously approached from a given finite input value with an IVT. Low gears are a reference to low ratios of output speed to input <b>speed.</b> This <b>low</b> ratio is taken to the extreme with IVTs, resulting in a [...] "neutral", or non-driving [...] "low" [...] gear limit, in which the output speed is zero. Unlike neutral in a normal automotive transmission, IVT output rotation may be prevented because the back-driving (reverse IVT operation) ratio may be infinite, resulting in impossibly high backdriving torque; in a ratcheting IVT, however, the output may freely rotate in the forward direction.|$|R
40|$|Tumble mills are hollow {{cylindrical}} shells of large diameter carrying grinding media (a combination of rock/iron ore/chemical flakes and metal balls/rods), which, upon {{rotation of the}} mill, will be ground into fine powder. These mills rotate at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> using a <b>gear</b> reduction unit and often have vibration problems. These vibration problems result in increased gear wear and occasional catastrophic failures resulting in production loss. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of oscillation of grinding media on torsional vibrations of the mill. A theoretical model was developed to determine the oscillating frequency of the grinding media. A 12 " (0. 3 m) diameter tumble mill test rig was built with a 0. 5 hp DC motor. The rig is tested with sand and iron bb balls to simulate the industry process application. At low volume levels the grinding media oscillates like a rigid body as compared to higher volumes. It is shown that tumbling action of grinding media causes torsional excitation and hence its effect has to be considered in torsional vibration analysis. At starting, the load on the gears is much higher due to this oscillation...|$|R
