They are often black and white; other colors may be used (<b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> wood or even red for the dark pieces) but they would still be called the [...] "white" [...] and [...] "black" [...] pieces (see White and Black in chess). The height of the king should be 85 to 105millimetres (3.35–4.13inches). A height of approximately 95 to 102mm (–4inches) is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be {{in proportion to the}} king. The pieces should be well balanced [...]|$|E
500|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} rekindle their {{relationship}} in March 2012. Kate White from Inside Soap wrote that Audrey finds Lewis hard to resist, especially {{after he has}} apologised for his previous actions. When Lewis is wrongly accused of taking some money from The Bistro, he plans to leave Weatherfield. Nicholls told White that Audrey feels awful that she too accused Lewis {{and it is a}} wake up call for her as she does trust him. The actress said Audrey still fancies Lewis and does not want to lose him again. Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his [...] "past indiscretions still loom over them <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> cloud". Nicholls said Audrey could be making a mistake, and added, [...] "You read this sort of thing in the papers all the time, women of a certain age being charmed by these men. I'd ask her to think about what she's doing." [...] A writer for Inside Soap said that Audrey and Lewis are very happy as they [...] "bask in the warmth of their revived romance." [...] However, they have to resort to sneaky measures to spend time together to avoid upsetting Audrey's family. When Audrey calls in sick at the salon to spend time with Lewis, Gail and David become concerned and check up on her. They see Lewis leaving her house and realise the pair are back together.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, the High Court of Australia {{ordered a}} stay of charges, ruling that Australian officials' {{participation}} in Moti's extradition from the Solomons had been unlawful under Solomon Islands law. Summarising its ruling, the court said: [...] "Further {{prosecution of the}} charges would be an abuse of process because of the role that Australian officials in Mr Moti being deported to Australia". This was a permanent stay of prosecution {{putting an end to}} all court proceedings against Moti; the ruling was a majority decision of six judges to one. Manasseh Sogavare stated, in response to the ruling: [...] "I am so pleased. This matter has hung <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> cloud over me and my government. This decision has vindicated me".|$|E

2500|$|Yet {{frequently}} {{he showed}} {{himself to be}} more than a mere sightseer, with the painter, critic, and philosopher in him asserting their influence in turn or at once. A splendid scene on the shore of Lake Geneva, for example, viewed with the eye of both painter and art critic, inspired the following observation: [...] "The lake shone like a broad golden mirror, reflecting the thousand dyes of the fleecy purple clouds, while Saint Gingolph, with its clustering habitations, shewed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> pitchy spot by its side; and beyond the glimmering verge of the Jura ... hovered gay wreaths of clouds, fair, lovely, visionary, that seemed not of this world....No person can describe the effect; but so in Claude's landscapes the evening clouds drink up the rosy light, and sink into soft repose!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Even after 1967, when Jane Frank {{began making}} sculptures, {{grappling}} with new media such as plastics and metals, she maintained her ever-evolving production of mixed media paintings on canvas, virtually {{until the end}} of her life. Continuing her exploration of the possibilities of multiple-canvas, [...] "apertured" [...] paintings, she began to create her [...] "Aerial Series" [...] pieces, which came more and more explicitly to suggest landscapes seen from above. Especially noteworthy and striking are the [...] "Night Landings" [...] paintings, such as [...] "Night Landings: Sambura" [...] (1970), with the city grid glinting below <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> jewel in a deep, nocturnal blue river valley. The 1975 Yoseloff retrospective catalogue listed below is very illuminating on these latter developments, and the color plates (which include images of some of the sculptures) are of higher quality than those in the Stanton book.|$|E
2500|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where Melancholia was {{screened}} in competition on 18 May. The press conference after the screening gained considerable publicity. The Hollywood Reporters Scott Roxborough wrote that [...] "Von Trier has never been very P.C. and his Cannes press conferences always play <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> stand-up routine, but at the Melancholia press conference he took it to another level, tossing a grenade into any sense of public decorum." [...] Trier first joked about working on a hardcore pornographic film that would star Dunst and Gainsbourg. When asked about the relation between the influences of German Romanticism in Melancholia and Trier's own German heritage, the director brought up that he had been raised believing his biological father was a Jew, only to learn as an adult that his actual father was a German. He then made jokes about Jews and Nazis, said he understood Adolf Hitler and admired the work of architect Albert Speer, and jokingly announced that he was a Nazi. The Cannes Film Festival issued an official apology for the remarks the same day and clarified that Trier is not a Nazi or an anti-Semite, then declared the director [...] "persona non grata" [...] the following day. This meant he was not allowed to go within 100 meters of the Festival Palace, but he did remain in Cannes and continued to give promotional interviews.|$|E

Unless duty called, he seldom went among the crew. Hard stories too were told about him; something, in particular, concerning an hereditary propensity to kill men and eat them.
