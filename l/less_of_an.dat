5|$|Cleveland was a {{committed}} non-interventionist who had campaigned {{in opposition to}} expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expansionist in foreign relations. Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators. Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in the Congo.|$|E

The novel also features Gump as an astronaut, a professional wrestler, and a chess player.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists {{occupied}} the low-lying moor, behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted {{as an effective}} obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute {{over the course of}} the ditch at the time of the battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de Gomme, shows the ditch in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> obstacle on the Royalist right.|$|E
5|$|The strike action led to {{a backlog}} of tens of {{millions}} of items of undelivered mail, with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after the first wave of walkouts, and rising to in excess of 50 million following the second. Businesses in London were forced to lay off staff, or defer paying them, generally because they were unable to dispatch goods or couldn't receive payment for them. However, the strikes had <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact outside the capital.|$|E

5|$|Jarre's {{follow-up}} album, Équinoxe, {{was released}} in 1978. It was composed with sequencers, particularly on the bass, and features a more baroque and classical style than Oxygène, with more emphasis on melodic development. Though its sales were still very healthy, it had <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact than Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a new world record for {{the largest number of}} spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1million spectators. Although it {{was not the first time}} he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and introduced the Frenchman to Francis Rimbert, who worked for Jarre during two decades on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|On the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish {{forces were}} desperately {{fighting}} the numerically superior {{forces of the}} Elector and Marsin. The Prince of Anhalt-Dessau led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> obstacle, but the great battery positioned {{on the edge of}} the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in enfilade on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.|$|E
5|$|The {{reversal}} of course {{brought her back}} in range of the British battlecruisers, however, which quickly opened fire and scored several damaging hits. The order to abandon ship was given, and men began gathering on the deck. Engineers set scuttling charges while the men topside prepared {{to go into the}} water. At 14:25, the ship rolled over and sank. The survivors expected the British to pick them up, but they instead departed. German ships searched the area three days later, to find only one survivor, Leading Stoker Neumann; {{the rest of the crew}} had died in the water. The wreck was moved in August 1979 to render it <b>less</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underwater hazard. Some parts of the ship were salvaged and are now preserved in the Cuxhaven Shipwreck Museum.|$|E
