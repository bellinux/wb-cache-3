5|$|Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose {{withdrawn}} school <b>life</b> <b>goes</b> awry {{when his}} affection for two girls begins to affect his relationships {{with his friends}} and peers. Though unaware of each other, the girls in question constitute {{the premise of the}} game: Kotonoha Katsura, a character well known throughout the franchise as the pivotal love-interest of Makoto Itou, and Roka Kitsuregawa, a newcomer whose efforts to make Yuuki jealous only serve to further complicate her relationship with him. Chie Ashikaga, the mildly abusive older sister of Yuuki, and Kyouichi Kasannoin, Nanami Kanroji's boyfriend, having only previously made cameo appearances in the School Days anime, return to make more prominent roles, as does Ai Yamagata, a character last seen from Summer Days. Rounding up the set of the cast are Ion Ishibashi and Kira Youka, a couple of friends who also make first appearances in the game.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional version of the Shibuya {{shopping}} district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday <b>life</b> <b>goes</b> on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to an alternate plane of existence called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other Reapers to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.|$|E

25|$|The {{spirits of}} the air above are {{believed}} to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuers believe that when {{a man or a woman}} dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or <b>life</b> <b>goes</b> back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.".|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} when the Sramanic {{movements}} {{shared the same}} philosophical concepts, the details varied. In Jainism, for example, Karma is based on materialist element philosophy, where Karma is the fruit of one's action conceived as material particles which stick to a soul and keep it away from natural omniscience. The Buddha conceived Karma as a chain of causality leading to attachment of the material world and hence to rebirth. The Ajivikas were fatalists and elevated Karma as inescapable fate, where a person's <b>life</b> <b>goes</b> through a chain of consequences and rebirths until it reaches its end. Other śramaṇa movements such as those led by Pakkudha Kaccayana and Purana Kashyapa, denied the existence of Karma.|$|E
25|$|Where Is the Friend's Home?, And <b>Life</b> <b>Goes</b> On (1992) (also {{known as}} Life and Nothing More), and Through the Olive Trees (1994) are {{described}} by critics as the Koker trilogy, because all three films feature {{the village of}} Koker in northern Iran. The films also relate to the 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, in which 40,000people died. Kiarostami uses the themes of life, death, change, and continuity to connect the films. The trilogy was successful in France in the 1990s and other Western European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Finland. But, Kiarostami did not consider the three films to comprise a trilogy. He suggested that the last two titles plus Taste of Cherry (1997) comprise a trilogy, given their common theme of the preciousness of life. In 1987, Kiarostami {{was involved in the}} screenwriting of The Key, which he edited but did not direct. In 1989, he released Homework.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Thomas S. Murphy {{delegated}} {{his position}} as president to Daniel B. Burke while remaining ABC's chairman and CEO. Capital Cities/ABC reported revenues of $465 million. Now at a strong second place, the network entered the 1990s with additional family-friendly hits including America's Funniest Home Videos (which {{has gone on to}} become the longest-running prime time entertainment program in the network's history), Step by Step, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Boy Meets World and Perfect Strangers spinoff Family Matters, as well as series such as Doogie Howser, M.D., <b>Life</b> <b>Goes</b> On, cult favorite Twin Peaks and The Commish. In September 1991, the network premiered Home Improvement, a sitcom starring stand-up comic Tim Allen centering on the family and work life of an accident-prone host of a cable-access home improvement show. Lasting eight seasons, its success led ABC to greenlight additional sitcom projects helmed by comedians during the 1990s including The Drew Carey Show; Brett Butler vehicle Grace Under Fire; and Ellen, which became notable for a 1997 episode which served as the coming out of series star Ellen DeGeneres (as well as her character in the series) as a lesbian.|$|E

500|$|Actress Andrea Fay Friedman, who was {{diagnosed}} with Down syndrome at birth, and who has appeared on several television shows, including Saving Grace and <b>Life</b> <b>Goes</b> On, voiced the character Ellen. Before performing on the show, Friedman stated {{in an interview that}} she had never watched Family Guy, but found it to be [...] "funny" [...] after watching several episodes from the series.
