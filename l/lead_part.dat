5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger to take the <b>lead</b> <b>part.</b> Fox asked William Hurt to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt {{had no interest in}} acting on television, Henriksen got the part.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> of Pemberton was {{initially}} offered to Jack Warner.

Alastair Sim was offered the role of Professor Hatton-Jones, but after he turned it down, Margaret Rutherford was cast instead.|$|E
5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to <b>lead.</b> <b>Part</b> of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{practice is}} that on a Sabbath shortly after he has attained the age of thirteen, a boy is called up to read from the weekly portion of the Law (five books of Moses), either {{as one of the}} first seven men or as the last, in which case he will read the closing verses and the Haftarah (selections from the books of the Prophets); and if he is unable to read, to recite at least the benediction before and after the reading.

25|$|In 1957 More had {{announced}} that he would play the lead role of a captain caught up in the Indian Mutiny in Night Runners of Bengal but the film was never made. More turned down an offer from Roy Ward Baker to play a German POW in The One That Got Away (1957), but agreed to play the <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> of Charles Lightoller in the Titanic film for the same director, A Night to Remember (1958). This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of £40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recoup its large cost; it was one of More's most critically acclaimed films.|$|E
25|$|In March 1335, Edward III began seriously {{mustering}} his forces, timing his invasion to {{the expiration}} of the French-engineered temporary truce. Aware of his plans, Scottish loyalists were also preparing for war, setting aside their personal differences and evacuating the lowlands {{in preparation for}} invasion. Edward III summoned an army of 13,000 men, the largest assemblage he had ever managed for an invasion of Scotland, and set off in July with {{a plan for a}} three-front invasion. With a naval force waiting near the Clyde, Edward III would <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> of this troop north from Carlisle while Balliol would take the rest west from Berwick.

25|$|After Kelly {{returned}} to Hollywood in 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used {{him in a}} routine, black-and-white movie: Living in a Big Way. The film was considered so weak that the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines, and they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments. This led to a <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> in his next picture, with Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli— a musical film version of S.N. Behrman's play, The Pirate, with songs by Cole Porter, in which Kelly plays the lead. The Pirate gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism. It is also notable for Kelly's work with The Nicholas Brothers – the leading black dancers of their day – in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was {{ahead of its time}} but flopped at the box-office.|$|E
500|$|Formby {{was always}} worried {{that his son}} George would watch him on stage, as he did not wish the boy to become a comic, saying [...] "one fool in the family is enough".

After the filming, Formby sent his son to Ireland, to continue his jockey training, and also sent the five horses Formby had purchased that year, which joined others he had previously bought.|$|E

500|$|After the war, Turner {{was cast}} in a <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) {{opposite}} John Garfield, a film noir based on James M.

Turner reportedly did not get along with Garfield on the set; according to one documentary, when she found he was her male lead, she responded: [...] "Couldn't they at least hire someone attractive?" [...] The now-classic film noir marked {{a turning point in}} Turner's career as her first femme fatale role. Reviews of the film, and in particular, Turner's performance, were glowing, with a critic of The New York Times writing it was [...] "the role of her career."

500|$|Pryce {{played the}} role of the {{sinister}} Mr. Dark in Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983), based on the Ray Bradbury novel of the same title. [...] After appearing mostly in films, such as the Ian McEwan-scripted The Ploughman's Lunch, and Martin Luther, Heretic (both also 1983), he achieved a breakthrough with his role as the subdued protagonist Sam Lowry in the Terry Gilliam film, Brazil (1985). After Brazil, Pryce appeared in the historical thriller The Doctor and the Devils (also 1985) and then in the Gene Wilder-directed film Haunted Honeymoon (1986). During this period of his life, Pryce continued to perform on stage, and gained particular notice as the successful but self-doubting writer Trigorin in a London production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull in late 1985. From 1986 to 1987 Pryce played the <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Macbeth, which also starred Sinéad Cusack as Lady Macbeth. Also in 1986 he starred in the film Jumpin' Jack Flash.|$|E
500|$|He often played {{supporting}} roles, {{rather than}} the <b>lead</b> <b>part.</b> He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." [...] Film critic Pauline Kael declared that [...] "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen." ...|$|E

500|$|After Kapadia's {{separation}} from Khanna in 1982, she was keen on returning to acting, which she ultimately did in 1984. For the next decade, {{she would go}} on to become one of top five commercial actresses in Bollywood along with Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Meenakshi Sheshadri and Jaya Prada. Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities. The first film she worked on was Saagar, directed by Ramesh Sippy, after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting. She first performed a screen test, which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and [...] "literally shivering" [...] while making it. To her surprise, Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the <b>lead</b> <b>part</b> opposite her Bobby co-star Rishi Kapoor. Scripted with her in mind, the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle, but its one-year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before, the first of which was Zakhmi Sher (1984). Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia, including one scene in which she was seen topless for a split second. The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars that year. Kapadia's performance as Mona D'Silva, a young woman from Goa who is torn between her friend (Kamal Haasan) and the man she loves (Kapoor), won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards. A review by Asiaweek labelled her [...] "a delight". Rediff.com noted, [...] "Dimple, caught between a friend and lover, performed solidly and memorably, grounding the two male leads and making the film work." [...] A 1993 issue of India Today wrote, [...] "Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty. She looked ravishing: auburn hair, classical face, deep eyes, an aura of sensuality. It was clear she was back." ...|$|E
