In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his way to treat with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles. This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on his way to his marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his vows.

Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is left-right inverted, and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris.

A typical show hunter division would include classes over fences as well as [...] "Hunter under Saddle" [...] or [...] "flat" [...] classes (sometimes called [...] "hack" [...] classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called [...] "daisy cutter" [...] movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in show hunter competition are judged on {{the form of the}} horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, there has been a sharp debate in Japan on the end of lifetime employment. On one side, case studies show the intensity of restructuring and downsizing. On the other side, most of the studies on the employment adjustment at a macro level conclude to the absence of change. This article contributes to this debate, using an original micro database. The first specificity {{of this paper is to}} focus on the electrical machinery sector in a panel framework. The current restructuring in this sector is indeed often analyzed as the sign of the changing employment adjustment and, more generally, of the employment system. The second specificity is <b>to</b> consider a <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> period <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comparison between the 1990 s and the 1970 s. The first major result is the increasing heterogeneity of the speed of employment adjustment at the level of the firms. Thus, we can explain the contradictory evaluation of the change of the mean speed and disentangle the micro-macro paradox. The second main result concerns the analysis of the characteristics of the firms affecting the speed of adjustment and the factors at the root of the increasing heterogeneity. The model of adjustment seems to have changed: the size tends to play a decreasing role, while the financial characteristics, like the intensity of the link with the Main Bank, are more and more important. Last but not least, the role of these financial factors may be the main explanation of the increasing heterogeneity of the employment adjustment. This last result has however to be confirmed and specified by future studies. ∗We are sincerely grateful to professors Uni Hiroyuki (Kyoto University), Suzuki Hiromasa (Waseda Uni-versity) and Hirota Isao (Tokyo University) for providing us the access to the NEEDS-FQ database.
