500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I {{try not to think about}} things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
500|$|A {{representative}} for Jive Records stated that although Spears {{was working in}} the studio, [...] "no album is scheduled at the moment" [...] and [...] "there are no plans to service 'Mona Lisa' to radio." [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] was released in a bonus CD included with the video of [...] (2005). Spears gave birth to her first son, Sean Preston, on September 14, 2005. In an interview with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, commenting she missed [...] "traveling [...] the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling of being on the stage, knowing it's your best – I love that. I needed a break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice and where you came from. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> have more influences of that sound. Not that I'm going to be like frickin' Tina Turner. But you never know", she stated. She also said that she hoped the album would reinvigorate the current pop scene, adding that [...] "It's been boring. Nothing's been wow to me." [...] On May 9, 2006, Spears announced she was pregnant with her second child. A few days later, producers such as J. R. Rotem and Sean Garrett told MTV News they were working with Spears. On September 12, 2006, Spears gave birth to her second son, Jayden James. She filed for divorce from Federline on November 7, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences. After the divorce, her partying and public behaviour drew attention from the worldwide media, and ended with two separate stints at Promises Malibu Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Facility in February 2007. Her manager Larry Rudolph released a statement on March 20, 2007, saying that she [...] "successfully complet their program." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, {{suggested}} that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, [...] "the next fiscal year starts in April {{and if we can}} try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" [...] and that [...] " [...] is not a definite commitment, but that is what I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> shoot for". However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Packer {{was well}} known for several talks and teachings, {{and several of his}} stories have been adapted into short films. His sermon about singing a hymn to drive off bad {{thoughts}} was adapted into the video Worthy Thoughts. His Parable of the Mediator (Jesus Christ) was adapted into the short film [...] "The Mediator". [...] "The Candle of the Lord" [...] (1982) is well known for its analogy of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> describe what salt tastes <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> describe what promptings from the Holy Ghost are like. Packer also taught the importance of hymn-centered prelude music for worship services.|$|R

Discussions with Victor were non-linear and overflowing with information. Someone once aptly remarked that talking <b>to</b> Victor was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> drink from a fire hose. Often the connecting threads and underlying patterns in the information didn't become apparent until later on. There was also a non-verbal component to Victor's teaching. He was a true shaman, and {{had the ability to}} shift the consciousness of his students on a level well below the surface of conversation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, [...] "I [...] [...] [...] need a starry night with {{cypresses}} or—perhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here." [...] That same week, he wrote to Bernard, [...] "A starry sky is something I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do, {{just as in the}} daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions." [...] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on earth, [...] "we take death to reach a star." [...] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion, he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rhone, confessing to a [...] "tremendous need for, shall I say the word—for religion—so I go outside at night to paint the stars." ...|$|E

With its expanded set {{and the addition of}} Uncle Ted's first sidekick [...] "Nefu Ned" [...] (played by co-producer Richard Briggs) Monstermania became a local and cult favorite. According to Briggs, “Ted’s shtick was <b>to</b> act goofy, <b>like</b> he wasn’t very good with his magic. We <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> trip him up when he did his tricks.
