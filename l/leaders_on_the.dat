5|$|A {{week after}} the Gent–Wevelgem, Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders. On the {{penultimate}} climb of the day, the Oude Kwaremont, Cancellara attacked and only Sep Vanmarcke was able to mark his move. The pair traveled along the course and caught the <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road and the group of four then rode into the finish together. Cancellara out-sprinted the three other riders to win his third edition of the Tour of Flanders. Three days later, Cancellara raced in the Scheldeprijs. Four days following the Scheldeprijs, Cancellara began the Paris-Roubaix. He made a move in the Carrefour de l'Arbre sector and {{which led to the}} formation of a lead group. The group came to the line twenty seconds after the winner, with Cancellara managing to sprint to a third-place finish.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the main}} {{military}} <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which {{made it clear that the}} war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara {{began to}} achieve success in June, during the Tour de Suisse. He won the opening time {{trial of the}} race and the time trial on stage nine en route to his overall victory.

A week after finishing the Tour de Suisse, {{he won his first}} Swiss national road racing crown on 28 June after outsprinting Mathias Frank at the line. He continued to win in July, as he won the opening stage of the Tour de France and took the first yellow jersey of the race.

5|$|Edward I {{returned}} to Scotland {{once again in}} 1300, and this time took his son with him, making him {{the commander of the}} rearguard at the siege of Caerlaverock. In the spring of 1301, the King declared Edward the Prince of Wales, granting him the earldom of Chester and lands across North Wales; he seems to have hoped that this would help pacify the region, and that it would give his son some financial independence. Edward received homage from his Welsh subjects and then joined his father for the 1301 Scottish campaign; he took an army of around 300 soldiers north with him and captured Turnberry Castle. Prince Edward also took part in the 1303 campaign during which he besieged Brechin Castle, deploying his own siege engine in the operation. In the spring of 1304, Edward conducted negotiations with the rebel Scottish <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> King's behalf and, when these failed, he joined his father for the siege of Stirling Castle.|$|E
5|$|Palpatine {{orders the}} clone troopers {{to turn on}} their Jedi generals, while {{dispatching}} Vader to kill everyone inside the Jedi Temple and then murder the Separatist <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet Mustafar. Palpatine then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor. Jedi Master Yoda confronts him in his Senate office and engages the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel that ends in a stalemate. Sensing that his new apprentice is in danger, Palpatine travels to Mustafar and finds Vader near death following a duel with Obi-Wan. After returning to Coruscant, he rebuilds Vader's burned, mutilated body with the black armored suit from the original trilogy. Palpatine then tells Vader that Padmé {{was killed in the}} heat of Vader's anger, breaking what remains of his apprentice's spirit. Palpatine is last seen watching the original Death Star's construction, with Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin at his side.|$|E
5|$|The East Anglian Danes joined Æthelwold in {{a raid on}} Mercia, {{reaching}} {{as far as the}} fortified burh at Cricklade on {{the border}} with Wessex. He then crossed the Thames into Wessex itself to raid Braydon. Edward retaliated by ravaging Danish East Anglia, but he withdrew without engaging Æthelwold in battle. The men of Kent lingered, although according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Edward sent seven messengers to recall them. The Danes caught up with the men of Kent to fight the Battle of the Holme. Its location is unknown but may be Holme in Cambridgeshire. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses. Æthelwold was among the <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Danish side who were killed, together with Eohric, the Viking King of East Anglia, two holds (Danish noblemen), Ysopa and Oscetel, and Beorhtsige, son of the ætheling Beornoth, who was probably a kinsman of the former king of Mercia, Burgred. Kentish losses included their two ealdormen, Sigewulf and Sigehelm, and an Abbot Cenwulf.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the first}} Gatorade Duel, Murphy Reynolds gave the command for drivers {{to start their}} engines. During the pace laps, Casey Mears went {{to the back of}} the field because he changed his engine and Truex did the same because he {{switched}} to a backup car. At the start, Gordon and Bayne were the <b>leaders.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first lap, Bowyer became the leader after having assistance from Burton. On the following lap, Jamie McMurray moved into the third position, after drafting with Kyle Busch. On the third lap, the first caution was given because Mears' engine failed. At the lap six restart, Bowyer was the leader, ahead of Burton, Kyle Busch, and Biffle. Two laps later, Busch became the leader. On the 11th lap, Carl Edwards moved up to third, while McMurray moved up to second. Two laps later, Edwards became the leader. On lap 14, Gordon reclaimed the first position, as Bayne moved up to second. On the following lap, the second caution was given after Logano collided into the wall and slid through grass. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 20 restart, Edwards was the leader ahead of Kyle Busch.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{also had}} {{experience}} with the indulgences connected to All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences {{and the way they}} cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the Ninety-five Theses. He composed a Treatise on Indulgences, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the <b>leaders</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E
