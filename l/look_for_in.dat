25|$|There {{have been}} various {{studies on the}} {{connection}} between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies {{by the same people}} were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation and more intrinsic motivation than the non-addicted players. It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch is a {{key figure}} in the {{imitation}} of Horace in accentual meters. His verse letters in Latin were modelled on the Epistles and he wrote a letter to Horace {{in the form of an}} ode. However he also borrowed from Horace when composing his Italian sonnets. One modern scholar has speculated that authors who imitated Horace in accentual rhythms (including stressed Latin and vernacular languages) may have considered their work a natural sequel to Horace's metrical variety. In France, Horace and Pindar were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the Pléiade, including for example Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Montaigne made constant and inventive use of Horatian quotes. The vernacular languages were dominant in Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, where Horace's influence is notable in the works of such authors as Garcilaso de la Vega, Juan Boscán Sá de Miranda, Antonio Ferreira and Fray Luis de León, the latter for example writing odes on the Horatian theme beatus ille (happy the man). The sixteenth century in western Europe was also an age of translations (except in Germany, where Horace wasn't translated until well into the seventeenth century). The first English translator was Thomas Drant, who placed translations of Jeremiah and Horace side by side in Medicinable Morall, 1566. That was also the year that the Scot George Buchanan paraphrased the Psalms in a Horatian setting. Ben Jonson put Horace on the stage in 1601 in Poetaster, along with other classical Latin authors, giving them all their own verses to speak in translation. Horace's part evinces the independent spirit, moral earnestness and critical insight that many readers <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> his poems.|$|E

[...] More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, Eltz Castle, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege. Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.|$|E
500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} season a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select fifteen critical reviews—of 81, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". James Poniewozik of Time labeled the series {{as one of the}} six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star," [...] and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness." [...] James South of Paste praised the [...] "crisp, clever writing", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as [...] "simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was [...] "uniformly good", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting.

Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate.

Robert Abele of LA Weekly said [...] "in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way that}} stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that [...] "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell." [...] Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that {{the series was}} [...] "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." [...] Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that [...] "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television.

Thanks to the kind donation of a French admirer, Pierrot Francois Simmoneau, who had donated over 460 francs, Jones's body was preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin [...] "in the event that should the United States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified." [...] Porter knew what to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter's team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was later identified by a meticulous post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault as being that of Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.|$|E
