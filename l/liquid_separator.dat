40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary <b>liquid</b> <b>separator</b> that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor. As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, shroud, inner drum, and hollow shaft, swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation.

The difference in efficiency between individual and battery <b>liquid</b> <b>separators</b> is slight. Concentration of disperse liquid phase in refined gases is 0. 1 – 0. 3 kg/kg. In operating on dry gases with abundance of dust the separation condition changes due to peculiarities of disperse phase behavior from solid particles.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a problem of}} small axisymmetric oscillations of two-layer liquid with a foam-based separator. The separator {{is supposed to be}} rigid and non-deformable, liquid flow through the separator is modeled as a stream with a certain linear-viscous resistance. The liquid is assumed to be ideal and incompressible, its stream being potential. The paper presents experimental and analytical method for finding such a drag coefficient. The work [1] considered the problem of oscillations of a two-layer liquid divided by nondeforming permeable separator where, taking into consideration the interaction between <b>liquid</b> and <b>separator,</b> a reduced drag coefficient is introduced, which is expected to be determined experimentally, thereby generalizing the results of works [4] and [5] in case of moving two-layer liquid through a resistance. The work [6] investigated the motion of ideal incompressible and non-stratified liquid together with the elastic bottom. The work [7] studied a stability of the free liquid surface in low gravity. The paper [8] examined free axially symmetric oscillations of a two-layer liquid with an impermeable separator. Analytical dependence for the drag coefficient obtained in the paper [1] contains the frequency values of free harmonic oscillation system with no resistance (with a missing delimiter) and the damping coefficient for the system with resistance (with a separator available). These values can be obtained experimentally if the tank model oscillations with a separator and without it are excited and the natural frequencies of these oscillations are determined. The model under consideration can be used to analyze dynamic interaction between <b>liquid</b> and phase <b>separator</b> of the upper stage or launch vehicle stage and provide ground experimental method for the starting systems from the gravity-free state and low gravity one. The article shows the relationship of the analytic dependence of the damping coefficient at symmetric oscillations of liquid in a tank with resistance to the damping coefficient obtained experimentally that allows us to determine experimentally a drag coefficient value for further detailed study of interaction dynamics between <b>liquid</b> and <b>separator.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the unique {{properties}} of microfluidic flow have been exploited to generate efficient mass-transfer in continuous segmented flow to investigate {{an alternative approach}} for performing chemical extractions. The concept of extraction-enhancement, by incorporation of a solid absorbent in the extracting phase, was explored. Proof-of-principle studies focused {{on the use of}} molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) to increase the effectiveness of conventional approaches. Laser machining and micro-milling were used to prepare PTFE microfluidic separation devices. Importantly, this included the design and integration of a continuous-flow microfluidic <b>liquid</b> phase <b>separator.</b> Propranolol selective molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (3. 6 µm) were prepared by precipitation polymerisation. MIP performance was assessed using conventional (equilibrium batch rebinding) and segmented-flow liquid-liquid systems. Interfacial mass transfer processes that occur during segmented flow were characterised with respect to flow variables, fluid properties and channel geometries. Segment aspect ratio and flow velocity, together with channel diameter and curvature, were shown to be important. The MIP was shown to possess high affinity and selectivity for the template (propranolol). Incorporation of the MIP into a segmented flow extraction regime was shown to significantly enhance the extent of analyte extraction. Mathematical optimisation approaches showed good correlation with experimental data. On-chip phase separation was demonstrated to be 100 % efficient for particle-containing and particle-free immiscible flows. The discovery of soluble MIP species possessing similar binding characteristics to their insoluble counterparts may further improve the kinetics of the reported solid-liquid-liquid extractions. It was successfully demonstrated that a solid phase material can be incorporated into an organic phase to enhance extraction from an aqueous sample either in continuous segmented flow or under equilibrium conditions. The integration of the segmented flow approach with an on-chip <b>liquid</b> phase <b>separator</b> provides a novel platform for the development of unique and highly-efficient continuous flow devices for molecular enrichments, separations and manipulations.

30|$|Due to {{the special}} {{structure}} of offshore multiphase pipes, {{it is easy for}} severe slugging to occur in the riser at low gas-liquid velocity. Violent pressure fluctuations and dramatic changes of flow rate are the main characteristics of severe slugging, leading to the risk of serious damage. In this paper, the separator control is adopted to accurately control the <b>separator</b> <b>liquid</b> level and pressure under severe slugging flow conditions. This indicates that the <b>separator</b> <b>liquid</b> level control alone does not {{have a significant impact on}} the upstream flow, but it is beneficial for normal operation and pressure control of the separator. As the separator pressure increases, the peak pressure in the riser apparently diminishes, and the amplitude of pressure fluctuation gradually decreases, which means that severe slugging is inhibited. During the slug blowing out, the gas/liquid slipping in the riser intensifies. The long gas plug quickly flows through the riser, and then tends to morph into short and slowly flowing gas bubbles. The elimination effect of the pressure control strategy on severe slugging is related to the relative rate of the superficial gas/liquid flow.|$|R
