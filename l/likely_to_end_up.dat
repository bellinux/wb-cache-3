5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the {{scattered}} disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E

Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, and is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> at first base down the road.|$|E

25|$|Having lost {{eight seconds}} to Contador {{in the first}} day's {{individual}} time trial, Froome ceded even more time {{to him on the}} third stage, when the Spaniard broke away from the peloton during the uphill finish to win the stage. Now 27 seconds behind Contador, with only one mountain stage remaining, Froome seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> second. But on the penultimate fourth stage, which had a steep uphill finish, Team Sky worked hard and dropped all of Contador's Tinkoff-Saxo teammates as the leaders reached the final climb. After some punchy moves by his support riders, Froome began a solo attack. For a short time Contador was able to follow, but he soon fell away. Froome won the stage and was able to open a 29-second gap on second-place Contador by the finish line, enough to overcome his deficit and take the overall race lead by two seconds. The final fifth stage was relatively flat, with no likely chance for Contador to make up his deficit, allowing Froome to collect his first stage race victory since May 2014. This was the third year in a row that Froome won his season opener stage race.|$|E

It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale [...] "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth {{on his list}} of the top Supernatural episodes {{of the first three}} seasons. Although he [...] "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [...] deal"—the ending was a [...] "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally {{stepped up to the plate}} and knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic".

The main role of microorganisms in winemaking is to convert grape sugars to alcohol, reduce wine acidity and contribute to aroma and flavor. They can also cause numerous unwelcome wine spoilage problems, which reduce wine quality and value. Winemaking processes includes multiple stages at which microbial spoilage is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur and <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> with altering the quality and hygienic status of the wine. This may render the wine unacceptable, since the spoilage can include bitterness and off-flavours, and cosmetic problems such as turbidity, viscosity, sediment and film formation. The main microorganisms associated with wine spoilage are yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria. A microbial spoilage is the consequence of inadequate working practices. These inadequate practices are derived from two principle attitudes: (1) - non-application of known practices for well identified risks and (2) - insufficient evaluation of risk levels. One of the aims of winemaking is to minimize potential for microbial spoilage and in this review are presented risks of microbial spoilage of wine and their prevention. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{quality of}} recyclates is {{recognized}} as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other non-recyclable material. Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product. A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve [...] "high-quality" [...] recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials is of increasing importance {{over the past}} years. Especially unidirectional fibrous laminates are nowadays widely applied in industry. They provide mechanical advantages in terms of stiffness to weight ratios, strength and resistance against fatigue. These properties make them suitable for high-end applications as for example the aerospace industry. Topology optimization is a mathematical technique which has recently gained importance as well. As an optimization technique with a large design freedom, {{it is able to}} design complex structures with high performance beyond human abilities. Together with the latest improvements on manufacturing techniques, the application of topology optimized structures intensifies in various fields. This research focuses on topology optimization on unidirectional fibrous laminate structures. The problem of combined topology and fiber direction optimization is researched over the past years by a number of groups. The problem formulation where the fiber angles are directly used as design variables is highly non-convex and is <b>likely</b> destined <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in a local optimum far from the global optimum. Two other alternatives are described in literature: a discrete and continuous problem formulation. In the discrete approach, called Discrete Material Optimization (DMO), a finite number of candidate materials per element represents the different fiber orientations and penalization is applied <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with a clear distinction between the candidate materials. The discrete formulation has the drawback that the solution is limited to the predefined candidate materials and that the number of design variables easily becomes large. Furthermore, the global optimum could never be guaranteed due to the required penalization. The continuous approach uses lamination parameters as design variables and the optimization problem becomes convex. A shortest-distance approach is used to determine the closest realistic laminate configuration for the global optimal set of lamination parameters. Using this technique, continuous variable stiffness panels can be designed with a reasonable amount of design variables. However, the realistic laminate configuration to a set of lamination parameters is not known analytically for more complex problems. Therefore, the determination of a physically meaningful configuration may be a difficult task, and may go with a loss of performance. Given both the pro's and con's of the methods from literature, {{there seems to be a}} demand for a method that can provide detailed results (continuous variable stiffness), with a reasonable amount of design variables, which also directly provides a physically realistic laminate configuration. In this research a new method called the Adaptive Angle Set Method (AASM) is proposed. AASM solves a sequence of DMO-like subproblems for fiber angle optimization, but the associated design variables are not penalized. A separate set of density variables performs the topology optimization and the combined problem is solved simultaneously. Every subproblem in AASM is analogue to a non-penalized DMO problem with three candidate materials for every element, representing a set of three different fiber angfiles. In the initial subproblem, the angle set is equal for all elements and given by 60 ° 0 ° 60 °, spanning the entire domain of 180 ° of possible fiber angles. This subproblem is solved to optimality and the subsolution is used to formulate the succeeding subproblem. Based on the subsolution of design variables, a combination of update functions estimates a new fiber angle for every element, which is defined as the middle angle of the element's new angle set. The two other angles are valued from this middle angle plus and minus a certain offset (range) and the new subproblem is again solved to optimality. However, the range between the three candidate materials is tightened with the formulation of every new subproblem, such that the sequence of problems converges to angle sets where the three candidate materials are close to each other. This can be as close as 1 ° difference in the final subproblem. At the final stage, penalization is applied to create a clear distinct solution between the candidate materials, but this only causes a minimal loss of performance due to the small range in the angle set. Using this approach, the number of design variables is constant for every subproblem, namely three fiber angle design variables and one density variable per element. In the final stage, a high angle resolution is obtained with a directly known laminate configuration. The way in which a new subproblem is formulated highly depends on the estimation of the new angle for every element. The determination of the optimal new angle using an optimization routine would be equal to solving the overall fiber angle problem, which can not be solved efficiently with a gradient based optimizer. Therefore, two heuristic update functions are introduced to estimate the new angle. The first update function makes a linear combination of the previous angle set with the corresponding optimal design vector. The second update function sets the new angle equal to the largest principal stress direction for that element. A number of test cases showed that a mixed application of both update functions yielded the best results. The final configuration was tested on a number of compliance minimization problems, which were kept planar and single loaded during this research. For small problems, the AASM results could be compared to brute force global optima of the underlying fiber angle integer problem. Results equal or close to the global optimum were obtained. For larger problems and multiple layer laminates, AASM provided promising results as well, which were obtained faster than a comparable DMO-formulation. The promising results obtained by AASM makes the method worthwhile for further investigation on larger and more complex problems, including other objective functions, bending elements and manufacturing constrained problems.
