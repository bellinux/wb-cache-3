40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence of countergradient variations in life-history traits among coastal cod Gadus morhua off the Norwegian coast, suggesting {{the existence of}} sub-populations. One-yr-old wild-caught individuals from 70 °N were smaller, grew slower, weighed less, and had a lower condition factor (CF) than <b>southern</b> <b>cod</b> from 60 °N during the sampling period from June to February. In contrast, both a higher growth potential {{and an increase in}} CF were found in northern cod when offspring of northern and <b>southern</b> <b>cod</b> from the same area and of the same age as the wild cod were housed together in a ‘common-garden’ experiment. The rapid growth in northern cod was achieved by higher success in food competition when given a restricted amount of food. Active feeding behaviour and larger energy allocation to storage tissues, as suggested by the higher increase in condition, represents adaptations to the high-latitude environment for northern cod and countergradient variation. These differences suggest the existence of genetically distinct sub-populations along the Norwegian coast. Development of sub-populations that differ in behaviour and life-history strategies are discussed in relation to mechanisms for local retention of early life stages and local adaptation of older stages. Sub-populations with different life histories may respond differently to fisheries, and attention to this could be beneficial for improving fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|Vertebral averages for {{juvenile}} Atlantic cod (age-groups 0, 1 and 2), {{collected during}} 1956 - 70 in coastal waters of Labrador and eastern Newfoundland, {{were used as}} indicators of stock origin.

The consistently lower averages for the 1960 and 1961 year-classes may have resulted from delayed spawning and/or more favorable temperature conditions after spawning in these years. Occasional vertebral averages lower than 54. 8 for other year-classes, particu-larly {{in the southern part of}} the surveyed area, evidently indicate intermingling with juveniles of the <b>southern</b> <b>cod</b> stock which typically have lower vertebral counts.

40|$|Data from 40 {{published}} {{studies of the}} diet composition of larval and juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) from around the northern North Atlantic were summarized to assess generic patterns in ontogenetic and regional variability in the key prey. The results showed that larvae at {{the northern edge of}} the latitudinal range of cod depend primarily on development stages of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, whilst those at the southern edge depend on Para- and Pseudocalanus species. Juvenile cod preyed on a wider range of taxa than larvae, but euphausiids were the main target prey. Analysis of regional variations in the relative abundances of C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. in the plankton, as estimated by the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) surveys, showed a similar geographical pattern to the larval cod stomach contents. Comparison of CPR data from the 1960 s and 70 s with data from the 1990 s showed that the boundary between C. finmarchicus and Para/Pseudocalanus spp. dominance has shifted northwards {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, whilst the abundance of euphausiids in the <b>southern</b> <b>cod</b> stock regions has declined.

Estimates of reproductive potential were produced by sequentially incorporating estimates of proportion mature at age, sex ratio at age, {{and potential}} egg production. The estimates of reproductive potential produced by each method were broadly similar, {{but there were}} important differences. This leads to differing perceptions of stock productivity, as measured by relative rate of recruitment of a stock and in the spawning stock produced per recruit.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} population collapse on individual potential fecundity and total population egg production (TEP) of three northwest Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations: northern cod (Divisions 2 J 3 KL), <b>southern</b> Grand Bank <b>cod</b> (NAFO Divisions 3 NO), and <b>southern</b> Newfoundland <b>cod</b> (Subdivision 3 Ps). Fecundity at length increased in conjunction with population collapse for two (3 NO, 3 Ps) of the three populations. Subsequent moderate population recovery between the 1990 s and 2000 s in 3 Ps {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in fecundity at length. A large decrease in fecundity at length for 3 NO during the same time period, despite little or no population recovery, coupled with {{the fact that there was}} no obvious difference in fish condition between the two time periods, suggested that density-independent factors could be contributing to the changes in fecundity. Use of pre-collapse fecundity – length relationships to estimate TEP in the post-collapse period resulted in underestimation of TEP by as much as 30 % in 3 NO and 46 % in 3 Ps, whereas in 2 J 3 KL, TEP was overestimated by as much as 18 %. Although the results do not fully support the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between population size and fecundity, they do demonstrate the variable nature of cod fecundity which, if not accounted for, can lead to erroneous perceptions of stock reproductive potential...|$|R
40|$|In many seabird studies, single annual proxies of prey {{abundance}} {{have been}} used to explain variability in breeding performance, but much more important is probably the timing of prey availability relative to the breeding season when energy demand is at a maximum. Until now, intraseasonal variation in prey availability has been difficult to quantify in seabirds. Using a state-of-the-art ocean drift model of larval cod Gadus morhua, an important constituent of the diet of common guillemots Uria aalge in the southwestern Barents Sea, we were able to show clear, short-term correlations between food availability and measurements of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in parental guillemots over a 3 -year period (2009 – 2011). The model allowed the extraction of abundance and size of cod larvae with very high spatial (4 km) and temporal resolutions (1 day) and showed that cod larvae from adjacent northern spawning grounds in Norway were always available near the guillemot breeding colony while those from more distant southerly spawning grounds were less frequent, but larger. The latter arrived in waves whose magnitude and timing, and thus overlap with the guillemot breeding season, varied between years. CORT levels in adult guillemots were lower in birds caught after a week with high frequencies of <b>southern</b> <b>cod</b> larvae. This pattern was restricted to the two years (2009 and 2010) in which southern larvae arrived {{before the end of the}} guillemot breeding season. Any such pattern was masked in 2011 by already exceptionally high numbers of cod larvae in the region throughout chick-rearing period. The findings suggest that CORT levels in breeding birds increase when the arrival of southern sizable larvae does not match the period of peak energy requirements during breeding.

5000|$|It is {{exclusively}} {{found in}} New Zealand in shallow waters around the rocky coasts {{to a depth}} of 150 m, though it is far more common south of Cook Strait. It is bluish green to blue-black above with white toward the belly. Large examples are usually greenish blue in colour, while smaller ones are blotched in varying shades of brown. An adult may grow to 60 cm in length and weigh from 1.0 to 3.0 kg. It feeds mainly on small fish and crabs. Blue cod is strongly territorial. Spawning takes place in <b>southern</b> spring. Blue <b>cod</b> can also change sex from female to male.|$|R
40|$|Arctic and boreal/temperate {{species are}} likely to be {{evolutionary}} adapted to different light regimes. Currently, the boreal/temperate Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is coexisting with the native polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in the Arctic waters around Svalbard, Norway. Here, we studied light/dark adaptative optical plasticity of their eye lenses by exposing fish to bright light during the polar night. Schlieren photography, high-definition laser scanning and ray tracing were used to determine the optical properties of excised crystalline lenses. Both species have multifocal lenses, an optical adaptation for improved color vision. In polar cod, the optical properties of the lens were independent of light exposure. In the more <b>southern</b> Atlantic <b>cod,</b> the optical properties of the lens changed within hours upon exposure to light, even after months of darkness. Such fast optical adjustment has previously only been shown in a tropical cichlid. During the polar night the Atlantic cod lens seems to be unregulated and dysfunctional since it had an unsuitable focal length and severe spherical aberration. We present a system, to our knowledge unique, for studying visual plasticity on different timescales in relation to evolutionary history and present the first study on the polar cod visual system...|$|R
50|$|After near {{extirpation}} from hunting grey seals for oil, {{meat and}} skins in the United States, sightings began {{to increase in}} the late 1980s. Bounties were paid {{on all kinds of}} seals up until 1945 in Maine and 1962 in Massachusetts. One year after Congress passed the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act preventing the harming or harassing of seals, a survey of the entire Maine coast found only 30 grey seals. At first grey seal populations increased slowly then rebounded from islands off Maine to Monomoy Island and Nantucket Island off of <b>southern</b> Cape <b>Cod.</b> The southernmost breeding colony was established on Muskeget Island with five pups born in 1988 and over 2,000 counted in 2008. According to a genetics study, the United States population has formed as a result of recolonization by Canadian seals. By 2009, thousands of grey seals had taken up residence on or near popular swimming beaches on outer Cape Cod, resulting in sightings of great white sharks drawn close to shore to hunt the seals. A count of 15,756 gray seals in southeastern Massachusetts coastal waters was made in 2011 by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Also grey seals are seen increasingly in New York and New Jersey waters, and it's expected that they will establish colonies further south.|$|R
40|$|Specific {{growth rates}} and {{survival}} {{were not significantly}} different among the pelagic juveniles of three electrophoretically distinguishable stocks of Norwegian cod (Gadus morhua), co-reared in four replicate 5. 2 m 3 mesocosms, from hatch to day 38 or day 43 post-hatch. Arcto-Norwegian cod (AC, the main commercial cod stock which spawn in Lofoten and are distributed in the Barents Sea, mostly north of 70 N), were compared with a nearby coastal stock (Balsfjord cod, BC – from a fjord near Tromsø at 6930 N), and a more <b>southern</b> coastal <b>cod</b> stock (CC, from near Bergen at 60 N). The increment width series of the lapillus – otolith growth history – and the relative daily growth rate {{were not significantly different}} among stocks within any mesocosm. Although AC larvae were larger, being derived from larger brood stock, they did not exhibit consistently greater otolith growth during the experiment. Larger size at harvest was correlated with growth during the latter part of rearing (>fourth week), which is when most differences in size at age are generated. Decreases in daily increment widths occurred in all stocks within 1 – 2 days, when the zooplankton food supply was changed from nauplii and copepodites to adult copepods, and when th...|$|R
40|$|The eastern Baltic cod {{stock has}} {{recently}} started to recover, {{after two decades}} of severe depletion, however with unexpected side effects. The stock has not re-occupied its former wide distribution range, but remains concentrated in a limited area in the southern Baltic Sea. The biomass of forage fish, i. e., sprat and herring, is historic low in this area, which in combination with increasing cod stock results in locally high predation mortality of forage fish and cannibalism of cod. In line with low prey availability, body weight and nutritional condition of cod drastically declined. In the <b>southern</b> Baltic Sea, <b>cod</b> competes with pelagic fisheries for the limited resources of sprat and herring, while the largest biomass of these species is currently found outside the distribution range of cod. Accounting for spatial overlap between species is crucial in developing ecosystem based fisheries management to enhance the recovery of predator stocks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Like {{most other}} stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Northwest Atlantic, <b>cod</b> in the <b>southern</b> Gulf of St. Lawrence {{declined}} to low abundance {{in the early}} 1990 s. Recovery has been slow {{in contrast with the}} rapid re-covery from similar levels of abundance in the mid- 1970 s. This difference reflects remarkably high prerecruit survival of cod in the earlier period of low abundance rather than unusually poor survival in the 1990 s. The period of high prerecruit survival of cod coincided with the collapse of herring (Clupea harengus) and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) stocks resulting from overfishing. These pelagic fishes are potential predators or competitors of the early life history stages of cod. We report a strong negative relationship between the biomass of these pelagic fishes and recruitment rate of <b>southern</b> Gulf <b>cod.</b> This is consistent with the recent suggestion that the success of large predatory fishes may de-pend on “cultivation ” effects in which the adults crop down forage fishes that are predators or competitors of their young. Our results also point to the possibility of a triangular food web involving cod, seals, and pelagic fishes, mak-ing it difficult to predict the effect of a proposed cull of seals on the recovery of cod. Résumé: Comme la plupart des autres stocks de morue (Gadus morhua) de l’Atlantique Nord-Ouest, le stock de morue du sud du golfe du Saint-Laurent a atteint un faible niveau au début des années 90. Son rétablissement a été lent comparativement au rétablissement rapide qui s’est produit à partir de niveaux d’abondance similaires au milieu des années 70. Cette différence s’explique par le taux de survie remarquablement élevé des pré-recrues dans la périod...|$|R
