The third scheme uses the present <b>lowest</b> <b>cost</b> route and re-computes a route by removing all the links used in the first route and using the Dijkstra algorithm. A number of tests are carried out on simulated networks to determine the throughput and stability of each scheme. It is found that the third scheme produces the best results. followed by the second and then the first. It is {{also found that the}} benefit of these schemes is only worthwhile when the number of nodes in the network is low...|$|R
40|$|To {{detect the}} {{differences}} in patterns of prescribing between general practitioners with high and <b>low</b> <b>costs,</b> the costs in prescribing seven symptomatic and seven systematic drug groups were studied in 23 practices with <b>low</b> <b>costs</b> and 23 with high costs in the Belfast area. This was done by extracting information about the individual practices from the Department of Health and Social Services (Northern Ireland) information technology unit's database on prescribing. General practitioners in practices with high costs issued prescriptions more often and for larger quantities of medicine than did their colleagues in practices with <b>low</b> <b>costs</b> {{for all of the}} drug groups studied. There was a lower patient to doctor ratio in the practices with high costs (1786 : 1 v 2039 : 1). The prescribers with high costs offered more surgery sessions than their colleagues with <b>low</b> <b>costs,</b> amounting to an average of 6 · 5 extra surgery sessions per 1000 patients per month...|$|R

5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E
