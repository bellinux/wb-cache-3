500|$|Historian Reuth {{observes that}} the modern German image of Rommel (a result of the Historikerstreit in the 1980s and debates on war guilt during the 1990s), as {{represented}} most notably by Maurice Remy, is that of both a National Socialist and a hero of the Resistance. Reuth argues that [...] "Rommel was neither one nor the other. He had understood neither National Socialism, nor the resistance to it. <b>Like</b> <b>millions</b> of Germans he followed Hitler into disaster and whilst doing so he believed he was only doing his duty".|$|E

500|$|Attempts {{were made}} {{as early as}} 1937 by Walt Disney to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, [...] "The Snow Queen", into a film.

Dennis Taylor asks Steve Davis about one shot in particular, a potentially key shot (if Taylor had potted his first clear chance at the black.)

Taylor, <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> of TV viewers watching that night, did not know which of the two shots Davis had played. Davis confirmed that he had in fact played the latter, but had not got the angle necessary to pull it off easily.

6000|$|Not merely so, but {{the girl}} felt in herself {{potentialities}} not yet drawn upon, unlimited capabilities leading towards the accomplishment of good. Money had not merely the magic of exalting, educating, refining, and ennobling the individual (herself); it had radiating, transforming power for others.

Several times he tried to gain a footing, and at each effort the juvenile daws--as yet ignorant of the desperate nature of man--opened their little eyes to the utmost in undisguised amazement. For full five minutes Maggot wriggled and the daws gazed, and the anxious comrade above watched the vibrations and jerks of the part of the rope that was visible to him while he listened intently. The bubbles on Zawn Buzzangein, <b>like</b> <b>millions</b> of watery eyes, danced and twinkled sixty feet below, as if in wonder at the object which swung wildly to and fro in mid-air.|$|E

The pavements of the streets were also loaf-sugar, and the trees and bushes and flowers were likewise sugar; but these last were not all white, because all sugar is not white, and they showed many bright colors of red sugar and blue sugar and yellow, purple and green sugar, all contrasting most prettily with the sparkling white buildings and the great white dome overhead.|$|E

To keep their canoe afloat the poor, naked Ogula oarsmen, shivering with cold and fear, baled furiously with their hands, or bowls of hollowed wood, and called back to Alan to save them as though he were the master of the elements. Even Jeekie was depressed and appeared to be offering up petitions, though whether these were directed to Little Bonsa or elsewhere it was impossible to know.|$|E
