40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate potential diet segregation in <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> by measuring coefficient of variation (CV) and mean salt concentration. The facility was a 1500 -head gestation barn with nine <b>feed</b> <b>lines,</b> transected by a central <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> that conveyed <b>feed</b> from one of two bulk bins. Quantab® chloride titrators were {{used to analyze the}} chloride concentration (salt) from samples collected at pre-determined <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> <b>locations</b> at various distances from the bulk bins. Thirty samples were collected from three <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> (row 1, 5, and 9), ten samples were collected from drop boxes close to the central <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> (<b>location</b> 1), ten samples were collected from a central location within the row (location 2), and ten samples were collected from the furthest end of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> (<b>location</b> 3). Samples of approximately 50 g were collected directly from the feed drop. The sample collection procedure was repeated four times. After the first two sample collections, a bin agitator was added to the bulk bin. There was a <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> × distance (within the <b>feed</b> <b>line)</b> × agitator interaction (P > 0. 02) observed for CV. The addition of the bin agitator improved the CV in <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 1 and 5, with no improvement observed in <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 9. The CV observed before the addition of the agitator averaged 17. 6, 18. 6, and 14. 3 % for <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> 1, 5, and 9, respectively, and the CV observed after the addition of the agitator averaged 13. 6, 16, and 14 % for <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 1, 5, and 9 respectively. Within all <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> (rows), distance CV was higher at locations 1 (17. 3 %) and 3 (17. 6 %), compared with CV at location 2 (15. 6 %) before the addition of the agitator, but was lower at locations 1 (14. 3 %) and 3 (13. 0 %), compared with CV at location 2 (15. 6 %) after the addition of the agitator. There was a mean-salt concentration effect (P< 0. 0001) observed for <b>feed</b> <b>line.</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>lines</b> 1 and 5 were similar in mean salt concentration, whereas <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 9 consistently had the highest salt concentration. There was little to no feed segregation observed...|$|R

(Young Scholars) Effects of feed truck {{unloading}} and swine barn <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> <b>location</b> on pellet {{quality and}} nutrient segregation. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 78 - 78. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 166 Two experiments were conducted at a commercial feed mill and 6 commercial wean to finish pig sites {{to determine the}} effects of feed truck unloading auger RPM on pellet quality and unloading time, and the effects of <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> <b>location</b> on pellet quality and nutrient concentration of intact pellets and their fines. In Exp. 1, pelleted feed was unloaded using 3 speeds (900, 1150, and 1400 RPM) from each of 8 compartments of a feed truck (Walinga Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada). Six samples per compartment were collected creating 16 replications/unloading speed. There was an unloading speed × trailer compartment interaction (P = 0. 031; SEM = 17. 4). The difference in unloading time from the front to rear compartment was greatest at the slowest unloading speed and similar at the 2 highest unloading speeds (70 vs. 35 and 37 s). The percentage of fines formed during unloading was not influenced by unloading speed, but tended to increase (quadratic; P = 0. 081; SEM = 2. 27) from the front (8. 2 %) to the rear compartment (10. 7 %). In Exp. 2, pelleted feed samples were collected during unloading into a commercial feed bin at 6 finishing pig sites with 2 <b>feed</b> <b>lines,</b> resulting in 12 replications per <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> <b>location.</b> Samples were collected from the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> at 6, 35, and 76 m from the feed bin. There were no interactions between <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> <b>location</b> and nutrient profile of the fines and pellets. There was no effect of <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> <b>location</b> on pellet durability index, percentage fines, percentage fines formed, or the nutrient profile of pellets or fines. Across locations, fines had decreased (P < 0. 05) CP (12. 4 vs. 15. 3 %; SEM = 0. 14) and P (0. 37 vs. 0. 40 %; SEM = 0. 006), but greater (P < 0. 05) ADF (3. 7 vs. 3. 2 %; SEM = 0. 24), crude fiber (2. 7 vs. 2. 2 %; SEM = 0. 09), Ca (0. 47 vs. 0. 44 %; SEM = 0. 012), ether extract (6. 2 vs. 5. 2 %; SEM = 0. 11), and starch (47. 4 vs. 44. 7 %; SEM = 0. 42) for the fines and pellets, respectively. In conclusion, the front compartments closer to the truck cab resulted in fewer fines formed from loading to unloading. Decreasing unloading speed significantly increased the amount of time taken to unload a feed truck but did not alter fines formed. Feeder distance from the bin did not influence fines formation. There were significant differences in nutrient profile between fines and pellets. Understanding the location of fines creation during the feed delivery process may allow for alternative methods to reduce the formation of fines and subsequent nutrient segregation...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{assembly}} {{systems are}} used for the assembly of an increasing amount of models, which are often mass-customized to meet customers’ demands. This results in a rising number of parts used for assembly and, consequently, space scarcity at the line. There-fore, parts must not only be fed to the line cost-efficiently, but also meet space constraints (Limère et al., 2015). The assembly <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> problem (ALFP) deals with the assignment of parts to <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies {{in order to reduce}} costs and obtain a feasible solution. Within this paper, we examine all distinct <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies at the same time, namely line stocking, kanban, sequencing and kitting (stationary and traveling kits). There is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no research conducted, including more than three <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies in a single model (cf. Sali and Sahin, 2016). Furthermore, we assume space at the border of line (BoL) being variable. For this reason, space is not constrained per individual station, but we assume one overall space constraint for the entire line (Hua and Johnson, 2010). The main focus of this work is on accurately modeling the problem. This includes a rep-resentation of all <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> processes, being storage, preparation, transportation, line side presentation and usage. By incorporating the variable space constraints at the BoL, we pro-vide a decision model reducing the overall costs for <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> in assembly systems, since rigid space constraints at the BoL usually lead to more expensive <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies. In contrast, variable space constraints enable balancing unequal space usage of different sta-tions, allowing cheaper <b>line</b> <b>feeding</b> policies to be selected. Some preliminary results on the cost impact of variable versus fixed space constraints will be discussed...|$|R
