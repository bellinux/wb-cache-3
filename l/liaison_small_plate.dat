5000|$|A study {{conducted}} by Jennifer Owlet Fisher at Temple's Centre for Obesity Research and Education, published in the Paediatrics Journal found that first-graders served themselves on average 90 calories less when they used <b>smaller</b> <b>plates</b> (7.25 inches - {{the size of a}} salad plate). These findings suggest that using a <b>smaller</b> <b>plate</b> could help to fight childhood obesity, although Fisher took care to state that she does not [...] "think that simply swapping a large <b>plate</b> for a <b>small</b> <b>plate</b> is the answer to controlling eating." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{place of}} the lost Book of Lehi, the {{translation}} from the <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> of Nephi was used, which covered the same time period. Both Nephi (...) and Mormon (...) recorded that the <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> were made for a [...] "wise purpose" [...] that was known to the Lord. The aforementioned sections of the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C 3, D&C 10) state {{that the loss of}} the Book of Lehi was foreseen by the Lord and that it was for this purpose that the <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> were provided.|$|R

5000|$|After Nephi {{had begun}} the large plates, he was {{instructed}} by the Lord to make another set of plates to record [...] "the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them." [...] These <b>smaller</b> <b>plates</b> were kept by Nephi's descendants until about 150 BC, when the prophet Amaleki delivered the plates to Benjamin, king of Zarahemla, who [...] "put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed down by the kings" [...] (...) [...] Amaleki's last writing was the statement that the <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> were full (...) and from this point there were no further additions to the <b>small</b> <b>plates.</b> Mormon did not abridge the <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> of Nephi but he did include them in the records he gave to his son Moroni (...)

30|$|It is {{possible}} that very <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> may reorganize themselves (an example being the Southern California Shear Zone) aperiodically. <b>Small</b> <b>plates</b> may be generated by forces different from those that form large plates. But {{if there is no}} internal deformation, then they should be called plates. Any attempt to divide the larger plates, which are assumed to last for a long time, from <b>smaller</b> <b>plates,</b> which may last for shorter times, {{seems to me to be}} arbitrary in that there is no easy way to define at what size this division should be made, apart from that discussed below.|$|R

30|$|These features, {{represented}} in Fig.  7, suggest that although some regions (especially Southeast Asia) exhibit complex spin directions {{probably due to}} interactions among the <b>small</b> <b>plates,</b> large fast-moving plates with subducting slabs induce spin motion in adjacent <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> through interactions along plate boundaries, which supports the idea presented above that T_PB drives the plate spin motions.|$|R

It shows {{that most of the}} plates lie in continental areas. There could be several reasons for this. (1) There is in fact a greater likelihood that very <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> fall in continental areas. (2) It is more difficult to do the detailed analyses necessary to find <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> in the ocean basins. (3) You cannot do GPS measurements attached to oceanic basin areas, a method that has produced many <b>small</b> <b>plates</b> on land.|$|R
