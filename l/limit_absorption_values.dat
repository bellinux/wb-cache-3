40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{the effects of}} material, structural and testing parameters of carbon epoxy braided composite tubes were analysed {{with respect to their}} performance in crush and impact conditions. An original method of manufacturing the composite tubes with vacuum infusion together with an expandable foam core to form multi-cellular structures was used. Low cost, 24 k tow carbon fibre braids were used and their performance was compared with that of the more expensive l 2 k tow size fibres. The specimens produced were axially crushed at constant quasi-static low velocities and at higher impact velocities using an instrumented falling weight machine. Load displacement data gathered from such tests were used to evaluate the test specimens with respect to their specific energy <b>absorption</b> <b>values.</b> The effects of a number of parameters including fibre tow size, braid architecture, resin content and loading type were evaluated. From the experimental results analysed from the test specimens it can be concluded that: - The 24 k fibre showed lower specific energy <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> than specimens made from l 2 k fibre. Epoxy resin content rather than epoxy resin type can significantly affect the specific energy <b>absorption</b> <b>values.</b> In general, specimens tested in impact loading exhibited lower specific energy <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> than the same specimens test in quasi-static crush.

40|$|The current {{paper is}} devoted to the {{scattering}} theory of a class of continuum Schrödinger operators with deterministic sparse potentials. We first establish the <b>limiting</b> <b>absorption</b> principle for both modified free resolvents and modified perturbed resolvents.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{two-dimensional}} problem of propagation of linear water waves {{in deep water}} {{in the presence of}} a critically submerged body (i. e., the body touching the water surface). Assuming uniqueness of the solution in the energy space, we prove the existence of a solution which satisfies the radiation conditions at infinity as well as at the cusp point where the body touches the water surface. This solution is obtained by the <b>limiting</b> <b>absorption</b> procedure. Next we introduce a relevant scattering matrix and analyze its properties. Under a geometric condition introduced by V. Mazya in 1978, we prove an important property of the scattering matrix, which may be interpreted as the absence of total internal reflection. This property also allows us to obtain uniqueness and existence of a solution in some function spaces (e. g., H-loc(2) boolean AND L-infinity) without use of the radiation conditions and the <b>limiting</b> <b>absorption</b> principle, provided a spectral parameter in the boundary conditions on the surface of the water is large enough. The fact that the existence and uniqueness result does not rely on either the radiation conditions or the <b>limiting</b> <b>absorption</b> principle is the first result of this type known to us in the theory of linear wave problems in unbounded domains...|$|R
