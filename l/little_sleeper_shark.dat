40|$|This paper {{provides}} length-weight relationships (LWR) {{for three}} species: long snouted lancetfish Alepisaurus ferox, kitefin shark Dalatias licha and <b>little</b> <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> Somniosus rostratus. Samples were collected occasionally from 2009 to 2013. A total of 49 D. licha and 24 S. rostratus {{samples from the}} western Mediterranean Sea, and 211 samples of A. ferox from the eastern North Atlantic Ocean were recorded for LWR. For each species, regression coefficients and parameters “a” and “b” were calculated with 95 % confidence interval. The LWR parameter b for all species ranged from 2. 889 to 3. 5048, with R 2 ranging from 0. 717 to 0. 823. Postprin...|$|E

50|$|Because food is {{relatively}} scarce on {{the deep sea}} floor, the <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> is able to store food in its capacious stomach. The <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark's</b> jaws are able to produce a powerful bite due to their short and transverse shape. The upper jaw teeth of the <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> are spike-like, while the lower jaw teeth are oblique cusps and overlapping bases. This arrangement allows grasping and sawing of food too large to swallow. Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> have a short caudal fin, which allows them to store energy for fast and violent bursts of energy to catch prey.|$|R

40|$|Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> Somniosus pacificus were {{captured}} near Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus rookeries {{during the period}} when Steller sea lion pups are most vulnerable to Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> predation (first water entrance and weaning). Analysis of stomach contents revealed that teleosts were the dominant prey in August and cephalopods were the dominant prey in May (n = 198). Marine mammals were found in 15 % of stomachs regardless of season, but no Steller sea lion tissues were detected. Molecular genetic analysis identified grey whale Eschrichtius robustus and harbour seal Phoca vitulina remains in some Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> stomachs. Most mammals were cetacean and at least 70 % of the cetaceans were probably scavenged. Although Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> and Steller sea lion ranges overlapped, so predation could potentially occur, the diet study suggested that predation on Steller sea lions is unlikely, at least when pups first enter the water or during weaning. Harbour seals were infrequent prey {{and may have been}} consumed alive. Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> consume fast-swimming prey like Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus sp., most likely live animals rather than scavenged animals. Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> appeared to be opportunistic consumers of the available prey and carrion, feeding both on the bottom and in the water column, and their diet shifted to teleosts and cetacean carrion as the fish grew larger...|$|R
50|$|Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{which are}} thought to be both predators and scavengers, can glide through the water with little body {{movement}} and little hydrodynamic noise, making them successful predators. They feed by suction and cutting of their prey. They have large mouths that can inhale prey and their teeth cut up any pieces that are too large to swallow. They show a characteristic rolling motion of the head when feeding. Only in Alaska has the shark's diet been studied - most sharks' stomachs contain remains of giant Pacific octopus. They are also known to feed on bottom-dwelling teleost fishes, as well as soles, flounders, Alaska pollock, rockfishes, shrimps, hermit crabs, and even marine snails. Larger Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> are also found to feed on fast-swimming prey such as squids, Pacific salmon, and harbor porpoises. The diet of the Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> seems to broaden as they increase in size. For example, a 3.7-m female shark found off Trinidad, California was found to have fed mostly on giant squid. <b>Sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> found in Alaskan waters from 2 to 3 m seem to feed mostly on flounder, pollock, and cephalopods, while <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> 3.3 to 4.25 m long seem to consume teleosts and cephalopods, as well as marine mammals. A recent study in the Gulf of Alaska suggests that <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> may prey on juvenile Steller sea lions.|$|R

50|$|The average mature size is 3.65 m and 318 - 363 kg.

50|$|The Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus pacificus) is a <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Somniosidae, found in the North Pacific on {{continental}} shelves and slopes in Arctic and temperate waters between latitudes 70°N and 22°N, from the surface to 2000 m deep. Records from southern oceans are likely misidentifications of relatives. Its length is up to 4.4 m, although it could possibly reach lengths in excess of 7 m.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> or Whitley's <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus antarcticus) is a deepwater benthopelagic <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Somniosidae found in the southern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. It is known from depths of 400 to 1,100 m. Its length is up to 4.4 m. It feeds primarily on cephalopods, especially the colossal squid, and fish; its stomach contents also less commonly contain remains of marine mammals and birds. Based on its generally sluggish nature and the speed of its prey, it {{is thought to be}} an ambush predator. A 3.6-m-long female caught off the coast of Chile had a whole southern right whale dolphin in its stomach. This dogfish is sometimes taken as bycatch in the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish fisheries; whether this poses a threat to the species is currently unknown.|$|R

5000|$|The Somniosidae are {{a family}} of sharks in the order Squaliformes, {{commonly}} known as <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks.</b> The common name [...] "sleeper shark" [...] comes from their apparent slow swimming, low activity level, and perceived non-aggressive nature.|$|R

Jeremy Wade, presenter of Animal Planet's River Monsters is among those who speculate these sightings of a reputed [...] "monster" [...] is a white sturgeon.

50|$|Many {{sperm whales}} have scars on their backs, {{believed}} {{to be caused by}} the hooks of colossal squid. Colossal squid are a major prey item for sperm whales in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the colossal squid, which indicates that colossal squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. Many other animals also feed on colossal squid, including beaked whales (such as the southern bottlenose whale), pilot whales, southern elephant seals, Patagonian toothfish, <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Somniosus antarcticus), and albatrosses (e.g., the wandering and sooty albatrosses). However, beaks from mature adults have only been recovered from large predators (i.e. sperm whales and <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks),</b> while the other predators only eat juveniles or young adults.|$|R
