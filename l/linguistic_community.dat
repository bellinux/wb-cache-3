Although both Albanian and Serbian are official languages, municipal civil servants are only required to speak one of them in a professional setting and, according to Language Commissioner of Kosovo Slaviša Mladenović statement from 2015, no organizations have all of their documents in both languages.|$|E
25|$|Bulgarian Millet or Bulgar Millet was an ethno-religious and <b>linguistic</b> <b>community</b> {{within the}} Ottoman Empire from the mid-19th to early 20th century. Initially as a {{separate}} Millet were recognized the Bulgarian Uniates, and then the Bulgarian Orthodox Christians (Eksarhhâne-i Millet i Bulgar). At that time the classical Ottoman Millet-system began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic identity and the term millet {{was used as a}} synonym of nation. In this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created. The establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870, meant in practice recognition of a separate Bulgarian nationality, and in this case the religious affiliation became a consequence of national allegiance. The founding of an independent church, along with the revival of Bulgarian language and education, were the crucial factors that strengthened the national consciousness and revolutionary struggle, that {{led to the creation of}} an independent nation-state in 1878.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the Proto-Germanic *lauda- is not agreed in the <b>linguistic</b> <b>community.</b> One {{hypothesis}} suggests it is derived from Proto-Indo-European *lAudh- ("lead"; capitalization of the vowel {{is equivalent to the}} macron). Another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from Proto-Celtic *ɸloud-io- ("lead"). This word is related to the Latin plumbum, which gave the element its chemical symbol Pb. The word *ɸloud-io- is thought to be the origin of Proto-Germanic *bliwa- (which also means [...] "lead"), from which stemmed the German Blei.|$|E

500|$|Such a [...] "meaning-vector" [...] {{provides}} {{a description of}} the reference and use of an expression within a particular <b>linguistic</b> <b>community.</b> It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. However, since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions which must be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.|$|E
500|$|Putnam, {{along with}} Saul Kripke, Keith Donnellan, and others, contributed {{to what is}} known as the causal theory of reference. In particular, Putnam {{maintained}} in The Meaning of [...] "Meaning" [...] that the objects referred to by natural kind terms—such as tiger, water, and tree—are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to Adam Smith's economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the [...] "experts" [...] in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term [...] "lion" [...] is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term [...] "elm tree" [...] is fixed by the community of botanists, and the reference of the term [...] "table salt" [...] is fixed as [...] "NaCl" [...] by chemists. These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the <b>linguistic</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following the Axis {{occupation}} of Yugoslavia, Drljević {{had become a}} proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs. As early as 1921, he had stated that Serbian and Montenegrin [...] "mentalities" [...] were diametrically opposed. He stated: [...] "The mentalities of Serbians and Montenegrins are irreconcilable. The visage of the former was speckled with [...] slavery; liberty gave the latter a new visage." [...] It was not until 1941 that Drljević advanced the notion that Montenegrins were not Slavs at all, but Dinaric people descended from the ancient Illyrians. He wrote:Races are communities of blood, whereas people are creatures of history. With their language, the Montenegrin people belong to the Slavic <b>linguistic</b> <b>community.</b> By their blood, however, they belong [...] According to the contemporary science of European races, [...] peoples are descended from the Illyrians. Hence, not just the kinship, but the identity of certain cultural forms among the Dinaric peoples, {{all the way from}} Albanians to South Tyroleans, who are Germanized Illyrians.|$|E

500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her <b>linguistic</b> <b>community</b> have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{has a number of}} New Brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of New Brunswick in each section relating to language (ex.
