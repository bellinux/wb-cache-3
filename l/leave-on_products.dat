40|$|Background: The use of methylisothiazolinone (MI) in {{cosmetic}} products has caused an unprecedented epidemic of MI contact allergy. Current data concerning exposures at a European level are required. Objectives: To describe demographics and MI exposures for European patients with MI contact allergy. Methods: Eleven European dermatology departments from eight European countries prospectively collected data between 1 May and 31 October 2015 among consecutive {{patients who had}} positive patch test reactions to MI (2000 ppm aq.). Results: A total of 6. 0 % (205 / 3434; range 2. 6 - 13. 0 %) of patients had positive patch test reactions to MI. Dermatitis most frequently affected the hands (43. 4 %), face (32. 7 %), arms (14. 6 %), and eyelids (11. 7 %); 12. 7 % had widespread dermatitis. For 72. 7 % (149 / 205), MI contact allergy was currently relevant mainly because of exposure to {{cosmetic products}} (83. 2 %; 124 / 149). Of these 124 patients, 19. 5 % were exposed to leave-on and rinse-off cosmetic products, 24. 8 % only to <b>leave-on</b> cosmetic <b>products</b> and 38. 9 % only to rinse-off cosmetic products containing MI or methylchloroisothiazolinone/MI. The majority of these (79 %) noted onset of their dermatitis between 2013 and 2015. Fifteen patients (7. 3 %) had previously experienced allergic reactions {{when they were in}} newly painted rooms.

50|$|IPBC is an {{effective}} fungicide at very low concentrations in cosmetic and other products, and has shown very low sensitivity in humans tested with this preservative. IPBC was approved in 1996 for use up to 0.1% concentrations in topical products and cosmetics. However, this preservative is mostly found in cosmetics at about one-eighth that level et al., 2009. IPBC Toxicity and Safety Tests show it to be generally safe: When used properly in <b>leave-on</b> skin <b>products,</b> IPBC is extremely safe 2002. Previous to being approved for cosmetic use in 1996, extensive safety and toxicity tests were conducted on IPBC and their results were gathered along with earlier studies in {{a report of the}} Safety Assessment of IPBC by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Final Report, Lanigan 1998. This final report found IPBC to be a non-carcinogen with no genotoxicity and in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies using rats and mice, IPBC had no significant effect on fertility, reproductive performance, or on the incidence of fetal malformation 1998.|$|R
40|$|Fragrances {{are added}} to food, {{cosmetics}} and other products primarily for enhancement of their sensory quality (taste and/or aroma). However, the usage of these compounds {{is associated with the}} wide range of various adverse biological effects. Some fragrances widely used in cosmetics are proved to cause e. g. skin sensitization, rashes, dermatitis, headache, cough etc. To protect the health of consumers, European union approved the cosmetic directive (ES/ 1223 / 2009) that requires the labeling of 26 allergen fragrances on the final product label, if concentration exceeds the given level (0, 01 % for rinse-off and 0, 001 % for <b>leave-on</b> <b>product).</b> However, some producers hide the presence of allergens in the final product under the general term „aroma“. For this reason {{it is very important to}} monitor the content of these substances in cosmetic products. Fragrances are found not only in cosmetics, but the various types of food are also aromatized by them. Unlike cosmetics, the food producers are not obliged to label the presence of fragrance allergens on the packaging. Therefore, the monitoring of these fragrances is highly desirable because of the potential health risks they pose. The aim of this study was to develop a method for simultaneous determination of regulated fragrance allergens in food and everyday use products. The method based on extraction of analytes by solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography with FID detection (HS-SPME-GC-FID) was chosen on the basis of the literature review. The fiber CAR/PDMS provided the highest extraction efficiency among the SPME fibers tested. Univariate and multivariate data analysis were used to optimize the main parameters affecting microextraction process. The final method validation was performed in terms of linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, recovery, limits of detection and quantification. The optimized and validated method was applied to a wide range of products including cosmetics, aromatized food and fragranced toys. These products were also subjected to sensory evaluation especially in terms of taste and/or aroma (i. e. flavour), which may be associated with the content of the monitored fragrances. The profile test (EN ISO 13299) and seven-point category ordinal scale (ISO 4121) were used for sensory evaluation...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{cosmetics}} regulation, 26 potential allergenic fragrance substances {{have to be}} {{indicated on}} the product containers if they are present above 0.001 percent in ‘leave-on’ products or above 0.01 percent in ‘rinse-off’ products [10, 38]. These 26 potential allergenic fragrance ingredients are chemically defined constituents. All ten manufacturers used several of them. 82 natural personal care products reported {{at least one of}} the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’. On average, the natural products analyzed declared 3.8 of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’, with a maximum of 11 per product. <b>Leave-on</b> <b>products</b> listed on average even more of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’ per product (3.4 on average) compared to rinse-off products (2.6 on average). On 58 products, it said that these fragrances originated from natural sources. It must be emphasized here, that the allergenic potential of a chemical is independent of whether a substance is of natural origin or synthetic. It depends on chemical structure, concentration, purity and interactions with other compounds.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on aroma {{compounds}} which are presented {{in a wide variety}} of products including perfume, cologne, cosmetics, toiletries, laundry products and detergens. The widespread use and exposure to aroma compounds of aforementioned products could cause a range of the adverse reactions such as contact dermatitis, asthma, eczema and breathing problems. There are a lot of aroma compounds triggering negative allergic reactions but EU regulations limit 26 the most important fragrance allergens. The presence of these substances has to be declared on the product label if a limit of 0, 01 % for rinse off and 0, 001 % for <b>leave-on</b> <b>products</b> is exceeded. Of these 26 substances, a methodology was elaborated for determination of 12 allergens in a experimental part of this thesis. A method by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was applied for fragrance allergens identification, extraction and measurement. The optimal extraction conditions of SPME-GC method were investigated including equilibrium time, extraction time and extraction temperature to increase extraction efficiency. Another important point is the method by SPME-GC-FID was validated and following performance parameters were determined: repeatability, linearity, limit of detection (LOD) limit of quantitation (LOQ).

40|$|Background: Incontinence-associated {{dermatitis}} (IAD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common skin problems in adults who are incontinent for urine, stool, or both. In practice, products and procedures are the same for both prevention and treatment of IAD. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of various products and procedures to prevent and treat incontinence-associated dermatitis in adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials. gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 28 September 2016). Additionally we searched other electronic databases: CENTRAL(2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1946 to May Week 3 2015), MEDLINE In-Process (inception to 26 May 2015), CINAHL(December 1981 to 28 May 2015), Web of Science (WoS; inception to 28 May 2015) and handsearched conference proceedings (to June 2015) and the reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors and experts in the field. Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, performed in any healthcare setting, with included participants over 18 years of age, with or without IAD. We included trials comparing the (cost) effectiveness of topical skin care products such as skin cleansers, moisturisers, and skin protectants of different compositions and skin care procedures aiming to prevent and treat IAD. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-texts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. Main results: We included 13 trials with 1295 participants in a qualitative synthesis. Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised. Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods.. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high. The data were not suitable for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in participant population, skin care products, skin care procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools. Nine trials compared different topical skin care products, including a combination of products. Two trials tested a structured skin care procedure. One trial compared topical skin care products alongside frequencies of application. One trial compared frequencies of application of topical skin care products. We found evidence in two trials, being of low and moderate quality, that soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD (primary outcomes of this review). The first trial indicated that the use of a skin cleanser might be more effective than the use of soap and water (risk ratio (RR) 0. 39, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 17 to 0. 87; low quality evidence). The second trial indicated that a structured skin care procedure, being a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising, and protecting properties, might be more effective than soap and water (RR 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 79; moderate quality evidence). Findings from the other trials, all being of low to very low quality, suggest that applying a leave-on product (moisturiser, skin protectant, or a combination) might be more effective than not applying a leave-on product. No trial reported on the third primary outcome ’number of participants not satisfied with treatment’ or on adverse effects. Authors’ conclusions: Little evidence, of very low tomoderate quality, exists on the effects of interventions for preventing and treating IADin adults. Soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD. Application of <b>leave-on</b> <b>products</b> (moisturisers, skin protectants, or a combination) and avoiding soap seems to be more effective than withholding these products. The performance of <b>leave-on</b> <b>products</b> depends on the combination of ingredients, the overall formulation and the usage (e. g. amount applied). High quality confirmatory trials using standardised, and comparable prevention and treatment regimens in different settings/regions are required. Furthermore, to increase the comparability of trial results, we recommend the development of a core outcome set, including validated measurement tools. The evidence in this review is current up to 28 September 2016...|$|E
30|$|Carcinogens, mutagens and {{substances}} {{toxic to}} reproduction (CMR substances) are in principle prohibited according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [1], but there are exceptions for these substances where ‘their use has been found safe’ by the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) [1]. Mutagens (such as m-phenylenediamine), carcinogens (such as carbomer) or substances toxic for reproduction (such as cyclomethicone) were listed in formulations of PCPs [26], but they usually are below the concentration thresholds for labelling and classification of the mixture thus exposing uninformed consumers. Butylphenyl methylpropional, classified as suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child (C&L Inventory [27]), is a frequently used masking agent present in products sold in retail shops where the exact percentage in the final product is not disclosed. Furthermore, Hutter and colleagues [28] identified synthetic musks in blood of young healthy adults which came from cosmetic products applied to the skin. In the USA, a correlation was observed {{between the use of}} PCPs containing estrogens (e.g., placenta or synthetic hormones such as estron or estradiol) and increased breast cancer incidence [29]. In another study in the USA, endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, parabens or nitrosamines, were identified in PCPs [30]. Assessing the human health risks posed by dangerous ingredients in PCPs is an important public health concern because of the high exposures resulting from PCP direct application to the human body surface both intentionally and frequently [31]. Some PCPs are diluted with water during application (rinse-off products), such {{as in the case of}} shampoo or soap, whereas others are applied undiluted onto the skin or hair (<b>leave-on</b> <b>products),</b> as is the case with lotion or deodorant, leading to higher exposures than rinse-off products. Users tend to use varied amounts of PCPs and several products at the same time which leads to a further increase of the exposure. Furthermore, application of PCPs on children potentially poses a greater risk of exposure to hazardous chemicals [32, 33]. Therefore, exposures and exposure risks will vary considerably for consumers using PCPs [34]. RC measures consequently must address these varied exposures and exposure patterns, as well as differences in consumer populations (e.g., children, culturally diverse).|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the risks posed by {{cosmetic}} products {{can also be}} larger compared with other consumer products due to the following reasons: (1) Repeated exposure increases the hazard ([1] Annex VI Part 1 1.2. 1.), which is clearly the case for cosmetic products since {{many of them are}} used daily, such as tooth paste, soap or shower gel. (2) Cosmetic products are applied intentionally directly on the body surface and lead therefore to a higher exposure compared with most other consumer products. <b>Leave-on</b> <b>products</b> such as lotions or decorative cosmetics should be differentiated from rinse-off products such as shower gels or shampoos. (3) Most consumers use several cosmetic products, not only one single product everyday, which increases the exposure. (4) Solvents in cosmetic products increase fat solubility and therefore skin penetration. (5) Combined exposure of an allergen with a detergent e.g. in washing liquids can increase the allergic reaction [19]. (5) There are further interactions of substances, e.g. musk compounds are known to inhibit cellular xenobiotic export systems [17]. (6) Cross-reaction is known e.g. for some fragrances which are contact allergens [18, 19]. (7) Many ingredients are not stable, especially in light and at warm temperatures. The metabolites can be more toxic than the original compounds. An example for this case is D-Limonene with a low allergenic potency that can be oxidized by air to strong allergens [20 – 22]. Further examples are carcinogenic nitrosamines which can be contaminants or reaction products of triethanolamin and Cocamide DEA, frequently used components in decorative eye cosmetics [23]. Cosmetics have been demonstrated to be the cause of contact allergies and many of them contain acids, bases, inorganic salts, aldehydes, and surfactants, substances which can be corrosive or irritant at concentrations < 1 % and would need to be considered with special care according to the CLP Regulation ([1] 3.2. 3.3. 4.1). (9) Cosmetic products are mainly discharged via waste water. Therefore, their toxicity to aquatic organisms is of greater relevance than for many other consumer products. (10) The products under scrutiny here correspond to the Cosmetic Regulation [6]. However, not all products in the retail shops comply with the requirements laid down there. Many products have to be withdrawn from the market because the levels of hydroquinone, methyl metacrylate, carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, di-n-butyl-phthalate, di(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate or heavy metals were too high [24]. It {{is interesting to note that}} microbiological contamination is another frequent reason why cosmetic products need to be withdrawn [24].|$|E
