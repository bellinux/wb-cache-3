5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during the chaos, and pinches her <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> make it seem that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated {{in front of her}} teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> serve as a support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce {{the problem in the}} spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
50|$|The {{exercise}} {{can be increased}} in difficulty by raising the <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> a 90-degree angle, and not allowing the <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> return fully to the floor between repetitions.|$|R

5|$|From Kilwa Kisiwani, {{the fleet}} {{departed}} to Malindi, which was reached on 2 August. Cabral met with its king, {{with whom he}} established friendly relations and exchanged gifts. Pilots were recruited at Malindi for the last <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> India and the fleet set sail. Land was reached at Anjadip, an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies {{on their way to}} Calicut. Here the ships were beached, recaulked and painted. Final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of Calicut.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{spell of}} the {{competition}} only being won by Brazilian clubs for four years began with Internacional defeating Guadalajara. In 2011, Santos won their third Copa, overcoming Peñarol by 2–1 in the final. In 2012, Corinthians won the tournament undefeated, beating Boca Juniors 2–0 in the final. It was Corinthians' first title. In 2013, Atlético Mineiro needed to beat Olimpia 2–0 in the second <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> take the match to penalties and did so; Victor, the goalkeeper, performed spectacularly and helped secure the title for the club. It was Atlético Mineiro's first title.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, van Grunsven {{sustained}} a fracture of a bone in her upper leg {{in a fall}} from a horse in training, and required surgery. A metal plate was embedded in her <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> immobilize the bone during the healing process, and van Grunsven recovered, winning the 2003 Dutch Dressage Championships in June. In September, she underwent a second surgery to have the plate removed. In 2004, {{she became the first}} Dutch rider to win the CHIO Aachen dressage competition, a top international competition.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Joel Selwood {{was born}} to Bryce and Maree Selwood in the country town of Bendigo, Victoria. He {{was raised in a}} family of sportspeople. His mother Maree was a top runner and tennis player, and elder twins Adam and Troy were {{identified}} as talented footballers at a young age. As a two-year-old, Selwood was forced to wear splints on his <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> help overcome a walking disability.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> move easily through the water.|$|E
50|$|Note: Order of <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> be decided.|$|R
50|$|He {{qualified}} {{again in}} 2010, losing to Canada's Ken MacNeil by 4 <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> 2 in the preliminary round.

5|$|Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey at 189/4, who {{continued}} attacking, unperturbed by Miller's departure. Cranston came on and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries. Yardley moved a man from fine <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> the location where the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Morris thus {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with a century under his belt. He held his {{position}} {{at the top of}} the order along with Barnes, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. Morris bowled three overs for four runs in the first innings as England were bowled out for 165 on the first day after winning the toss and electing to bat. During the innings, Morris took a reflex catch when Godfrey Evans hit a ball strongly, directly to him at short <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> leave England at 7/74.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as his 500m gold win, he earned a bronze medal in the men's 5000m relay, with an inside pass on Italian skater Nicola Rodigari on the final <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> put the United States in third position. Later, during the medals {{ceremony}} for the event, the winning South Korean team and the Americans embraced, followed by a group picture featuring the medalists.|$|E

5000|$|Belaty: The {{dance is}} {{accompanied}} by a moderately fast-paced Arabic rhythm (similar to belly dancing music). Dancers would connect hand-to-hand in the circle, lift <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> the beat whilst making a slight leap and kick their <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> the sides in the air (this would repeat). The beat is 125-135bpm[...]|$|R

5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake <b>leg.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|The United States sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. A total of 213 U.S. competitors took part in 18 sports; the only 2 sports Americans did not compete in were soccer 5-a-side and 7-a-side. The American delegation included 16 {{former members of the}} U.S. military, including 3 veterans of the Iraq War. Among them were shot putter Scott Winkler, who was paralyzed in an accident in Iraq, and swimmer Melissa Stockwell, a former United States Army officer who lost her left <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> a roadside bomb in the war.|$|E
