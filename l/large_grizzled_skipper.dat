50|$|The <b>large</b> <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> (Pyrgus alveus) is {{a species}} of skipper {{butterfly}} (family Hesperiidae). It is distributed throughout most of continental Europe but is absent from Denmark and practically all European islands including Great Britain, Ireland, Azores, Balearic Islands, Channel Islands, Canary Islands, Crete, Cyprus, Iceland, etc.|$|E
50|$|Like all Pyrgus species, {{it can be}} very {{difficult}} to identify in the field. The upperside of the forewings are often noticeably darker brown than other Pyrgus species, especially when fresh, with clear white markings. It resembles some smaller races of <b>large</b> <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> (P. alveus). It is slightly larger than Pyrgus malvae.|$|E
50|$|Helianthemum are food {{plants for}} the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{such as the}} <b>large</b> <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper.</b> The leaf miners Bucculatrix helianthemi and B. regaella both feed {{exclusively}} on Helianthemum sessiliflorum, as does Coleophora eupreta. C. ochrea is limited to Helianthemum, and C. bilineella and C. potentillae have been observed on the genus.|$|E

50|$|Spialia dromus, {{the forest}} sandman, dromus grizzled skipper or <b>large</b> <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family. It {{is found in}} tropical Africa. In South Africa it is found along the eastern Cape coast to KwaZulu-Natal into Swaziland. It is also present in Mpumalanga and the Limpopo Province into northern Gauteng and the extreme north-west of the North West Province.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} rather similar to Pyrgus alveus, Pyrgus armoricanus, Pyrgus serratulae and Pyrgus malvae. It can be {{difficult}} to separate this species from its congeners. It is most often confused with the <b>large</b> <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> (P. alveus) as the two species are often found in similar habitats. P. carthami can usually be separated from this species by the more closely grouped white spots on the forewing and a band of evenly sized pale spots in the postdiscal area of the hindwing.|$|E

50|$|The Appalachian <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> {{butterfly}} is a subspecies of {{the butterfly}} Pyrgus centaureae or northern <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper.</b> The Appalachian skipper {{is characterized by}} its gray and brown top color, distinctive white checkered markings on the wings and wing edges {{as well as its}} unusual flight pattern. The butterflies are known to grow anywhere from around 29 to 33 millimeters in size. The <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> rarely flies above three feet off the ground and does so in quick, jerky movements. The skipper is hard to spot while flying because of its dingy color and its likeness to the exposed ground. When threatened, the butterfly typically lands in the vegetation, making it hard to find for predators.|$|R
