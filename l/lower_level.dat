The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> merges with the innermost, express tracks located on the <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the upper level before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E

50|$|Levels: {{specific}} {{spheres of}} control in the built environment. The built environment {{can be seen as}} having an hierarchical structure in which higher levels serve as the setting and context in which <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> operate. As such, higher levels exercise dominance over <b>lower</b> <b>levels,</b> while <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> are dependant on higher-level structures. Examples of levels include urban design and architecture, or base building and fit-out.|$|R

The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73.

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> was {{looked at as}} part of the study for the reintroduction of F express service as it could reduce the impact of less local service at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require significant and expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E

5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Influenza is a {{significant}} worldwide public health issue. Knowledge and perceptions regarding the flu vaccination are associated with whether individuals obtain the vaccination. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how such perceptions were related to knowledge and self-efficacy regarding influenza and the flu vaccination in Vietnam and the US. Methods College students (n= 932) in Vietnam (n= 495) and the US (n= 437) completed a self-administered survey regarding knowledge and perceptions of influenza vaccinations in September and October 2016. Results Vietnamese participants reported significantly <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of awareness about flu risk, higher levels of negative attitudes toward flu vaccination, <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of knowledge about the flu and vaccination, and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of self-efficacy than US participants. Higher levels of flu and flu vaccination knowledge and self-efficacy regarding general responsible health practices were associated with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of negative perceptions of flu risk and attitudes toward vaccination. At the same time, self-efficacy regarding responsible health practices was associated with higher levels of awareness of flu risk and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of negative attitudes toward vaccination. Self-efficacy regarding exercise was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of perceptions of flu risk and higher levels of negative attitudes toward vaccination. Conclusions Vietnam could benefit from influenza education based on this comparison with the US. In both countries, knowledge and self-efficacy were found to be important factors influencing perceptions of influenza risk and vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of self-regulation {{is one of}} the major challenges of a child’s healthy development. In the current thesis, the contribution and interplay of parental and biological factors in the {{development of}} self-regulation in preschoolers are studied in a large population-based cohort, the Generation R Study. We found that attachment insecurity in infancy was related to higher levels of toddler active resistance during Clean-Up. Maternal negative discipline was related to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of committed compliance in toddlers, and the association between maternal positive discipline and child committed compliance was moderated by the child’s COMT rs 4680 genotype, indicating that the association was stronger in children with the Met/Met variant than for children with other COMT genotypes. Maternal family-related stress during pregnancy predicted <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of toddler committed compliance through <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of maternal positive discipline. Maternal sensitivity was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of executive function problems and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of internalizing problems in preschool age. In children with a relatively short corpus callosum in infancy, higher levels of maternal positive discipline predicted <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> of inhibition problems. Our studies demonstrate the role of various aspects of positive parenting and mother-child relationship quality in preschool children’s regulation of emotions and behavior. Promotores: M.
