50|$|In the United States, the {{practice}} originated with the DC distribution system developed by Thomas Edison. By dividing a <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> into two equal groups of lamps connected in series, the total supply {{voltage can be}} doubled {{and the size of}} conductors reduced substantially.|$|E
50|$|AC systems used a {{wide range}} of {{frequencies}} {{depending on the type of}} load; <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> using higher frequencies, and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies. The economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems, operating at a common frequency, were developed. The same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day, could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> in the evening, thus improving the system load factor and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall. Many exceptions existed, generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency, and rotating frequency changers and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network.|$|E

50|$|Ultrasonic sensors, {{similar to}} radar. {{they work on}} the doppler shift principle. An {{ultrasonic}} sensor will send high frequency sound waves in area and will check for their reflected patterns.

50|$|In a theatre, a {{specialty}} panel {{known as a}} dimmer rack is used to feed stage lighting instruments. A U.S. style dimmer rack has a 208Y/120 volt 3-phase feed. Instead of just circuit breakers, the rack has a solid state electronic dimmer with its own circuit breaker for each stage circuit. This {{is known as a}} dimmer-per-circuit arrangement. The dimmers are equally divided across the three incoming phases. In a 96 dimmer rack, there are 32 dimmers on phase A, 32 dimmers on phase B, and 32 on phase C to spread out the <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> as equally as possible. In addition to the power feed from the supply transformer in the building, a control cable from the lighting desk carries information to the dimmers in a control protocol such as DMX-512. The information includes lighting level information for each channel, by which it controls which dimmer circuits come up and go out during the lighting changes of the show (light cues), and over what fade time.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{lighting}} {{is one of}} important appliances that, in total, consume large amount of electricity. Establishment of residential <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> curve is therefore prominent as the curve will be useful for any further analysis. Nevertheless, {{it is difficult to}} develop residential <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> curve when the residential energy consumption is measured using conventional metering or other power monitoring device. This paper presents estimation of residential <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> curve using Baseline Energy Use method. A survey has been conducted to collect relevant data of lighting utilization in Surabaya. Important findings from the survey include determination of number of each lamp type, average number of lamps per household, total number of lamps in households, and average daily operating hours. Considering a 96. 2 share of ownership which consist of incandescent, fluorescent, and compact fluorescent lamp, it is found from the analysis that the lighting peak load is occured at 7 PM with average wattage per household of 100. 1 W.

40|$|A glazed atrium is {{a common}} feature in {{shopping}} centres and in the lobbies of residential and commercial buildings. This research aimed to discover the vertical temperature distribution and cooling load reduction relating to displacement ventilation in atrium spaces. The air temperatures at different levels (0. 1, 0. 7, 1. 2, 1. 7, 3, 5 and 7 m), within a 25 m high exhibition atrium, were monitored. Using the measured surface temperatures as boundary conditions, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed to examine the vertical temperature distribution. Further, by using parametric studies, the influences of occupant load, equipment load, <b>lighting</b> <b>load,</b> floor and wall surface temperatures, and supply air conditions were investigated with 12 CFD simulation cases. Based on the simulation results, load reduction factors - with three grouping methods of heat sources - were then developed. Temperature stratification was present even under the condition of a low cooling load. Load reductions were lower for occupant and equipment loads than for a <b>lighting</b> <b>load.</b> The best grouping method was to consider the heat released from the floor as an individual group of heat sources, which {{is an indication that}} secondary heat from the floor should not be neglected during the design of displacement ventilation.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the methodology and procedures that were followed {{to measure and}} verify {{the impact on the}} electricity use of a <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> reduction project implemented at a gold mine. The lighting retrofit was concentrated on the 100 level and 100 incline of the gold mine. Since the lights were underground, it was operational for 24 hours each day. The proposed project activity aimed to reduce the electric demand of the lighting system by replacing the current types of lighting fixtures with more energy efficient units. The possibility existed to reduce the <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> by 157 kW. These impacts needed to be assessed in order to verify the DSM impacts and savings for the client, the ESCO and Eskom.

40|$|In 2010 {{the town}} of Otaki decided to go "Off the Grid", obtaining all its {{electricity}} supply from renewable resources. To support this goal, this thesis documents and quantifies the electricity demand for the Otaki retail stores along State Highway 1. It was found {{the majority of the}} load in these 33 stores was for lighting. To minimise the renewable electricity generation capital requirements, the load was optimised by exploring energy efficiency opportunities. Energy audits to AS/NZS 3598 : 2000 Energy Audit Level 2 were undertaken in 23 of the stores. These created a consistent set of data on the <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> and energy consumption. Potential energy savings opportunities were then identified to reduce the <b>lighting</b> <b>load</b> by 26 % through lamp replacement and removal. When combined with improved lighting management, these could reduce annual electricity consumption by 34 % to 248, 321 kWh. An investigation of available renewable resources (Photovoltaic (PV), wind and hydroelectric) found that PV generation was the most suitable for this urban setting. PV generation using 53 by 4 kW panels, at a capital cost of $ 1. 3 million, which would generate 250, 425 kWh per year. This would meet the annual electricity demand, but there would be a summer surplus and winter deficit.

40|$|Abstract — A {{multi-mode}} {{control strategy}} for a synchronous buck converter operating {{over a wide}} load range, is presented. For heavy loads, the converter runs in fixed-frequency continuous conduction mode (CCM). At <b>light</b> <b>loads,</b> it enters discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with synchronous rectification. At still <b>lighter</b> <b>loads,</b> synchronous rectification is disabled in DCM. At very <b>light</b> <b>loads,</b> the converter operates in variable-frequency pulse skipping mode.

An on-line adaptive algorithm to optimize the SR timing, based on power loss minimization, is presented. This control strategy is particularly well suited for a digital controller implementation, since it uses sophisticated computations, while not requiring high analog-to-digital conversion rates.
