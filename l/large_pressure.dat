5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force winds were reported for 18hours, and tropical storm-force winds were reported for 30hours. As the eye was crossing the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness {{in the span of}} a few minutes; this created a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E

25|$|A nearly {{isobaric}} {{solution is}} possible if the compressed gas {{is used to}} drive a hydroelectric system. However, this solution requires <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> tanks located on land (as well as the underwater air bags). Also, hydrogen gas is the preferred fluid, since other gases suffer from substantial hydrostatic pressures at even relatively modest depths (such as 500 meters).|$|E
25|$|Axial flow {{compressors}} {{produce a}} continuous flow of compressed gas, {{and have the}} benefits of high efficiency and large mass flow rate, particularly {{in relation to their}} size and cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of airfoils to achieve a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> rise, making them complex and expensive relative to other designs (e.g. centrifugal compressors).|$|E

40|$|Openings in a {{building}} envelope can generate <b>large</b> internal <b>pressure</b> in strong winds, and in combination with <b>large</b> external <b>pressures</b> can result in <b>large</b> net <b>pressures</b> across the envelope. Such a scenario, is a common cause of structural failure during windstorms. Internal pressures have been studied using analytical methods, wind tunnel and limited full-scale tests for over 40 years. This paper presents a review of past studies and describes a proposed study to determine internal pressure fluctuations {{in a range of}} industrial type buildings using full scale and model scale measurements, and analytical methods...|$|R

It is also stable over a very <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> domain {{and has been}} the subject of numerous X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic and theoretical studies. It has been shown to have a monoclinic C2/m symmetry and its infrared absorption behaviour was attributed to the association of oxygen molecules into larger units.|$|E
25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect was}} {{investigated}} {{as early as}} 1925 by Brillouin. He found that the propagation velocity of acoustic waves would decrease proportional to an applied hydrostatic pressure. However, a consequence of his theory was that sound waves would stop propagating at a sufficiently <b>large</b> <b>pressure.</b> This paradoxial effect was later shown {{to be caused by}} the incorrect assumptions that the elastic parameters were not affected by the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Many multiunit CANDU {{stations}} utilize a {{water spray}} equipped vacuum building. All individual Candu units on site {{are connected to}} this Vacuum building by a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> relief duct which {{is also part of}} containment. The Vacuum building rapidly draws in and condenses any steam from a postulated break, allowing the reactor building pressure to return to subatmospheric conditions. This minimizes any possible fission product release to the environment.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} the intensity in forward flowing murmurs is much more evident in aortic stenosis rather than mitral stenosis. The {{reason for this is}} that there is a <b>larger</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient across the aortic valve. A complementary maneuver for differentiating disorders is the Valsalva maneuver, which decreases preload.|$|R

25|$|When an {{aircraft}} exceeds Mach 1 (i.e. the sound barrier), a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> difference is created {{just in front}} of the aircraft. This abrupt pressure difference, called a shock wave, spreads backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape (a so-called Mach cone). It is this shock wave that causes the sonic boom heard as a fast moving aircraft travels overhead. A person inside the aircraft will not hear this. The higher the speed, the more narrow the cone; at just over M = 1 it is hardly a cone at all, but closer to a slightly concave plane.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} light-water reactor (LWR) designs, {{the entire}} fissile core {{is placed in}} a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> vessel. The amount of heat that can be removed by a unit of a coolant {{is a function of}} the temperature; by pressurizing the core the water can be heated to much greater temperatures before boiling, thereby removing more heat and allowing the core to be smaller and more efficient. Building a pressure vessel of the required size is a challenge. At the time of CANDU's design, Canada lacked the heavy industry to cast and machine the pressure vessels of this size.|$|E
25|$|A Canadian design (known as CANDU), these {{reactors}} are heavy-water-cooled and -moderated pressurized-water reactors. Instead {{of using}} a single <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural uranium and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient {{in their use of}} uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania, and South Korea. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU-derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear weapon test.|$|E

25|$|North Korea, {{following}} its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics {{decided to hold}} the World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989. Coming {{one year after the}} most successful Olympics in years, there was <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> on the North Korean regime to hold a similarly successful event. Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for. In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was so prevalent during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Low {{pressure}} operation. Because {{the coolant}} salts remain liquid at high temperatures, LFTR cores {{are designed to}} operate at low pressures, like 0.6 MPa (comparable to the pressure in the drinking water system) from the pump and hydrostatic pressure. Even if the core fails, there is little increase in volume. Thus the containment building cannot blow up. LFTR coolant salts are chosen to have very high boiling points. Even a several hundred degree heatup during a transient or accident does not cause a meaningful pressure increase. There is no water or hydrogen in the reactor that can cause a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> rise or explosion as happened during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.|$|E
25|$|Early designs {{including}} Siemens, Westinghouse, and Combustion Engineering had {{a mostly}} can-like shape built with reinforced concrete. As concrete {{has a very}} good compression strength compared to tensile, this is a logical design for the building materials since the extremely heavy top part of containment exerts a large downward force that prevents some tensile stress if containment pressure were to suddenly go up. As reactor designs have evolved, many nearly spherical containment designs for PWRs have also been constructed. Depending on the material used, this is the most apparently logical design because a sphere is the best structure for simply containing a <b>large</b> <b>pressure.</b> Most current PWR designs involve some combination of the two, with a cylindrical lower part and a half-spherical top.|$|E
30|$|In {{early studies}} of {{reservoir}} engineering, the reservoirs {{are assumed to}} be homogeneous, isotropic and uniform. Absolute rock permeability (K) is defined as the ability of the rock to transmit fluid(s). Horizontal permeability (Kh) is parallel to bedding plan and is generally greater than vertical (Kv). Low vertical permeability creates a <b>larger</b> <b>pressure</b> drop near the wellbore and directly affects the skin factor.|$|R
50|$|The {{left hand}} {{side of this}} {{equation}} represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow. On the right hand side ρ is the density, v is the velocity, and R is the radius of curvature. This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create <b>larger</b> <b>pressure</b> differentials and that for straight flow (R → ∞) the pressure difference is zero.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the proper}} {{orthogonal}} decomposition (POD) and the autoregressive (AR) process {{is applied to}} simulate <b>large</b> wind <b>pressures</b> due to strong gusts on a tall structure. The POD is employed to identify the coherent structure characterizing strong wind pressures of the random pressure field. The eigenfunctions and the principal coordinates are computed using the covariance of the ensemble of <b>large</b> wind <b>pressures</b> in the POD analysis. The parametric autoregressive modeling technique is next employed to investigate and model the POD principal coordinates, and the fitted AR models are used to generate the new principal coordinates. The generated principal coordinates are used to simulate <b>large</b> wind <b>pressures.</b> It is shown that time series with <b>large</b> wind <b>pressures</b> are well reconstructed by the dominant modes obtained from the POD analysis, and that wind <b>pressures</b> with <b>large</b> peak values are simulated very well using both the principal coordinates generated by the AR models and the dominant POD modes...|$|R
25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E

500|$|The {{origins of}} Fabian {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave and a cold front that entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea on October12. The two systems interacted in the Gulf of Honduras, producing convection and low atmospheric pressures. An anticyclone developed over the system, which aided {{in the organization of}} the thunderstorms. At 1300UTC on October15, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) to the southwest of the Isle of Youth. Based on the report, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Fabian. Its development was typical for an October storm in the western Caribbean. With a high pressure area to the north, there was already a <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient that had produced tropical storm force winds over the area. By the time Fabian developed a circulation, it was able to be classified as a tropical storm. However, it is possible it was a tropical depression for about 12hours before the Hurricane Hunters report.|$|E

On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment {{near the center of}} tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|R
