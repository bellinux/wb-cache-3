40|$|Purpose – This paper operationalize and juxtaposes {{variables}} {{related to}} identity, strategy and communications and then focuses {{on the impact of}} such integration on organizational stakeholders’ trust, <b>loyalty</b> and <b>commitment.</b> Design/methodology/approach – This research design utilises explanatory research at the preliminary stage, as informed by the literature and conceptual framework. The subsequent model was examined via a positivist survey carried out among stakeholders in high-end retail stores in London. Structural equation modelling (SEM) via AMOS was conducted to gain insight into the various influences and relationships. Findings – The results indicate that identity and strategy are key drivers of integrated corporate communication, and they serve to build stakeholder trust, <b>loyalty</b> and <b>commitment.</b> Originality/value – The paper shows that while practitioners have indicated that integrated marketing communication is important for organizations, there are a few other areas of concern with regard to consequences related to trust, <b>loyalty</b> and <b>commitment,</b> especially in a retail context.

40|$|While the {{importance}} of customer loyalty has been recognized in the marketing literature {{for at least three}} decades, the conceptualization and empirical validation of a customer loyalty model for e-service context has not been addressed. This paper describes a theoretical model for investigating the three main antecedent influences on <b>loyalty</b> (attitudinal <b>commitment</b> and behavioral <b>loyalty)</b> for e-service context: trust, customer satisfaction, and perceived value. Based on the theoretical model, a comprehensive set of hypotheses were formulated and a methodology for testing them was outlined. These hypotheses were tested empirically to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical model. The results indicate that trust, customer satisfaction, perceived value, and commitment are separate constructs that combine to determine the <b>loyalty,</b> with <b>commitment</b> exerting a stronger influence than trust, customer satisfaction, and perceived value. Customer satisfaction and perceived value were also indirectly related to <b>loyalty</b> through <b>commitment.</b> Finally, the authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these results...|$|R

The aim of this research is to analyze the effect of customer satisfaction, customer <b>loyalty,</b> and brand <b>commitment</b> on word of mouth. To achieve the objectives, the research method used is causal research by using multiple regression analysis as the analytical tool. The population of this research is the consumers in Manado who ever taste walls Ice cream with sample size as many as 120 respondents. This research found that customer satisfaction, customer <b>loyalty</b> and brand <b>commitment</b> generally give the significant influence for word of mouth of walls ice cream in Manado.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that loyalty includes some degree of pre-dispositional commitment toward a brand. Brand loyalty is viewed as multidimensional construct. It is determined by several distinct psychological processes and it entails multivariate measurements. Customers perceived value, brand trust, customers satisfaction, repeat purchase behavior, and commitment are found to be the key influencing factors of brand <b>loyalty.</b> <b>Commitment</b> and repeated purchase behavior are considered as necessary conditions for brand loyalty followed by perceived value, satisfaction, and brand trust.Fred Reichheld, One of the most influential writers on brand loyalty, claimed that enhancing customer loyalty could have dramatic effects on profitability. However, new research shows that the association between customer loyalty and financial outcomes such as firm profitability and stock-market outcomes is not as straightforward as was once believed. Many firms may overspend on customer loyalty, and then do not reap the intended benefits. Among the benefits from brand loyalty — specifically, longer tenure or staying as a customer for longer — was said to be lower sensitivity to price. This claim had not been empirically tested until recently. Recent research found evidence that longer-term customers were indeed less sensitive to price increases. Byron Sharp showed empirically that behaviour affects attitudinal response not the other way round. Longer term customers are less sensitive because it is harder for them to completely stop using the brand.|$|E
50|$|Psychological Contracts {{are largely}} reliant on {{promises}} between the employer and employee, with trust being {{the basis for}} the social exchange. A breach in the Psychological Contract occur if employees perceive that their firm, or its agents, have failed to deliver on what they perceive was promised, or vice versa. Employees or employers who perceive a breach are likely to respond negatively as it may oftentimes result in an immediate response of mistrust from the other side. Responses may occur in the form of reduced <b>loyalty,</b> <b>commitment,</b> and organizational citizenship behaviors. These feelings typically increase negative tension in the environment. Perceptions that once psychological contract has been breached may arise shortly after the employee joins the company or even after years of satisfactory service. A breach in the contract may occur when the organizational changes are not necessarily beneficial for employees because of extenuating factors such as globalization and fast-changing markets. The impact may be localized and contained, but if morale is more generally affected, the performance of the organization may be diminished. The risk for breach may be reduced when the organization knows and respects the contracts of the employees. Further, if the activities of the organization are perceived as being unjust or immoral, e.g. aggressive downsizing or outsourcing causing significant unemployment, its public reputation and brand image may also be damaged.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "faith", {{translated}} from the Greek πιστις (pi'stis), was primarily used in the New Testament with the Greek perfect tense and translates as a noun-verb hybrid; which is not adequately conveyed by the English noun. The verb form of pi'stis is pisteuo, which is often translated into English versions of the New Testament as 'believe'. The adjectival form, pistos, is almost always translated as 'faithful'. The New Testament writers, following the translators of the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) rendered words in the Hebrew scriptures that concerned 'faithfulness' using pi'stis-group words. The pi'stis-group words are most appropriately translated into English by a range of words, {{depending on the context}} in which they occur. In both the New Testament and other Greek texts, pi'stis describes connections of firmness that can form between a wide variety of entities: people, traditions, practices, groups, purposes, facts or propositions. The appropriate English translation is often evident from {{the relationship between the two}} entities connected by pi'stis. The pi'stis-group words in the New Testament can thus be interpreted as relating to ideas of faithfulness, fidelity, <b>loyalty,</b> <b>commitment,</b> trust, belief, and proof. The most appropriate interpretation and translation of pi'stis-group words in the New Testament is a matter of recent controversy, particularly over the meaning of pi'stis when it is directed towards Jesus.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{tried to}} explain the role of calculative commitment, <b>loyalty</b> <b>commitment</b> and power asymmetry on behavioral commitment in a business to business scenario. We specifically looked at the trade promotion scenario since retailers face more trade promotions than they can accept and extant research suggests that retailers always choose trade promotions that offer the greatest immediate benefit. This dissertation addressed the following managerial question, “How does a firm select a program (trade deal) when all its vendors offer the same short term economic incentives”. We proposed that other aspects of retailer’s relationship with its vendors determine / influence the program selection decision. First, incentives imbedded in channel relationships namely economic incentives (e. g., access to new products) and social incentives (e. g., affect toward vendor / salesperson) lead to a selection decision. Second, the power asymmetry the retailer has with the various vendors directly impacts decision making and also moderates {{the impact of the}} embedded economic / social incentives. We used commitment theory and an experimental design to test our model. We find that calculative commitment has the greatest impact on decision making followed by power asymmetry. We also find that <b>loyalty</b> <b>commitment</b> has the least impact. We also found that under high power asymmetry, calculative commitment has a bigger impact than <b>loyalty</b> <b>commitment</b> on behavioral commitment than under low power asymmetry when <b>loyalty</b> <b>commitment</b> has a bigger impact...|$|E

40|$|Contracts between {{suppliers}} and customers frequently contain provisions rewarding the customer for exhibiting loyalty to the seller. For example, suppliers may offer customers preferential pricing for buying a specified percentage of their requirements from the supplier or buying minimum numbers of products across multiple product lines. Such loyalty-inducing contracts have come under attack on antitrust grounds because of their potential to foreclose competitors or soften competition by enabling tacit collusion among suppliers. This article defends loyalty inducement as a commercial practice. Although it can be anticompetitive under some circumstances, rewarding loyal customers is usually procompetitive and price- reducing. The two most severe attacks on loyalty discounting—that loyalty discounts are often disguised disloyalty penalties and that loyalty clauses soften competition—are unlikely to hold as a general matter. Nor are arguments that customers only accede to loyalty inducements because of collective action problems generally true. Dominant buyers who face few collective action problems frequently use <b>loyalty</b> <b>commitments</b> to leverage their buying power and obtain lower prices...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{this study}} {{highlight}} the importance of brand image for brand loyalty {{in the case of}} team sport. First, the existing conceptualization and operationalization of the brand image-construct in team sport is refined. It can be shown that a parsimonious three factor and 15 indicator structure successfully captures the construct's content. In contradiction to Keller's proposed model, effects of the image's attributes on the benefits were discovered. Thus, in line with means end theory, we suggest that brand image models should incorporate causalities between brand attributes and benefits. Second, both psychological commitment as an attitudinal construct and behavioral loyalty represent essential components of overall brand <b>loyalty.</b> <b>Commitment</b> positively influences behavioral loyalty. The hypothesized relationships between brand image and loyalty are confirmed via structural equations modeling. Important implications for the management of sport clubs can be derived...|$|E

Subjective personal introspection (SPI) and supporting vignettes of female humans in their families (all of which were high-involvement owners) explore the hows and whys of feline incorporation. The study identifies several categories of incorporation. The findings suggest that this complex process involves many factors — namely, consumer socialization, intergenerational influence, brand <b>loyalty,</b> <b>commitment,</b> near-instant loyalty, immediacy, distress, anthropomorphism, and nostalgia. These factors underpin the intimacy and care the human–feline relationship expresses.
