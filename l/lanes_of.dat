5|$|After {{crossing}} Matchette Road, where ramps {{provide access}} {{to and from the}} eastbound and westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the expressway, respectively, the opposing <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E

5|$|Long term {{proposals}} by {{the province}} call for Highway 404 {{to be extended}} to Highway12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> Highway48. It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who claim it will only serve to accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Route 25 {{begins at}} a trumpet {{interchange}} with I-495 and I-195 in Wareham, Massachusetts; the two left <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> Route 25 west mainline onto Route 495 north, with the right-hand lane serving I-195 via Exit 1. From I-195, Route 25 east is accessible via Exit 22A; I-195 terminates at the interchange. Interstate 495 also terminates at its junction with Route 25; the two southbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-495 default onto Route 25 east. After the interchange with I-195 and I-495, Route 25 begins to {{head in a}} southeastern direction into the town of Wareham as a six-lane freeway.

5|$|Route62 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the off-ramp from U.S. Route 46 eastbound and Passaic County Route 646 {{in the community}} of Totowa. The highway heads northward along Union Boulevard, intersecting with the on-ramp from Route 62 to U.S. Route 46 eastbound. The route heads across a long bridge over the eastbound and westbound divided <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> Route 46. After crossing the bridge, Route 62 heads into a small industrial part of Totowa, where it intersects with the off-ramp from the westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> Route 46. The highway continues northward, interchanging with Furler Street and Lackawanna Avenue on a partial cloverleaf. Route 62 continues along Union Boulevard, becoming a divided highway. The highway crosses over Interstate 80 at interchange 55A, where the route's designation terminates. The route continues into Paterson as County Route 646.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} {{with the}} Southfield Freeway (M-39) was closed entirely in 1985 {{to replace the}} original exit design, which included four on-ramps that sharply merged into the left <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-94.

5|$|After {{splitting}} from I-295, US 130 continues northeast as a four-lane {{divided road}} called Crown Point Avenue. The route passes past an oil refinery before forming {{the border between}} West Deptford Township {{to the north and}} Westville to the south, where it begins to pass residences along {{the south side of the}} road. The road fully enters Westville before encountering the northern terminus of Route 45 at a Y-intersection. Past this intersection, the <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> US 130 split briefly before rejoining.|$|E

5|$|Also in 2015, {{work began}} on {{bypassing}} the 1960s interchange with US23 near Brighton. A {{new set of}} through lanes was built on I-96 between the current eastbound and westbound lanes with three new bridges over northbound and southbound US23, and over Old US23. The existing <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-96 were changed to be collector-distributor lanes for ramp traffic. This project was completed in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the second}} bridge was {{interrupted}} several times by strikes, {{as well as by}} an algal bloom in the Swan River. The bridge was finally opened to traffic on 26 February 2001, and officially opened by new Transport Minister Alannah McTiernan (a strident critic of the project) on 30 May 2001. The bridge had originally been planned to be opened in August 2000, and was expected to carry 80,000 cars per day. The new traffic bridge carried six <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> traffic, including one bus lane, and the original bridge was modified at this time to carry six traffic lanes, as designed.|$|E

5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to {{the cumulative effect of}} heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, the state {{highways}} running concurrent with US 22 were removed. With {{the planning of}} the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s, an Interstate Highway connecting the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area to New York City was planned to run roughly along the US 22 corridor in New Jersey. This interstate was designated as I-78 in the final plans in 1958. The new interstate roughly followed the alignment of the unconstructed Route 11, which had been legislated in 1927 to run from US 22 between White House and Warrenville. Between the Alpha area and Annandale, I-78 was to directly follow US 22; the portion between exits 11 and 13 involved {{the creation of new}} eastbound lanes for I-78 and conversion of the eastbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> US 22 into the westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> I-78. The westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> US 22 were turned into a two-lane frontage road. This construction took place during the 1960s. US 22 was moved to the I-78 alignment between these two points in 1969. The former alignment between Alpha and Clinton became Route 173 while the portion east of there became county-maintained Beaver Avenue (currently designated CR 626). Originally, I-78 had been planned to use the Easton-Phillipsburg Toll Bridge across the Delaware River and follow US 22 through Phillipsburg and along the Lehigh Valley Thruway west through the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. However, opposition within Phillipsburg led to the cancellation of this routing, and I-78 was rerouted to head to the south of the Lehigh Valley. In addition to the construction of I-78 along the US 22 corridor, US 22 itself evolved into a multilane divided highway from a two-lane road.|$|E
5|$|NY92 {{begins as}} a city-maintained highway at an {{intersection}} with US11 (State Street) in downtown Syracuse. The route heads eastward on East Genesee Street, passing under I-81 before splitting into a one-way couplet at Almond Street. For the next two blocks, the eastbound and westbound <b>lanes</b> <b>of</b> NY92 are separated by a small park situated within the block formed by Almond Street, Forman Avenue, and both directions of Genesee Street. The couplet ends just east of Forman Avenue, at which point NY92 continues on as a highway two lanes wide with dedicated cycle lanes in each direction.|$|E
5|$|On November 27, 1998, King County Metro driver Mark McLaughlin, {{the driver}} of a {{southbound}} route 359 Express articulated bus, {{was shot and killed}} by a passenger, Silas Cool, while driving across the bridge.
