In support of this accelerator program, a pair of power leads needs to be developed to close the loop between the power supply and accelerator system. The magnet proposed to be used will be a modified transmission line magnet technology that would allow for accelerator quality magnetic field sweep of 2 T/s.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a thermal study of junction temperature variation {{across the surface}} of a large CPU resulting from nonuniform power generation. Results from Flotherm finite-difference thermal analysis software were compared to results from a SPICE simulation. Both simulations provided results close to measured values. Each tool offered strengths and benefits in different areas. Because of unevenly distributed functionality in large integrated circuits, power dissipation can vary significantly {{across the surface of}} a device. In very high-power devices, these power variations can lead to significant variations in junction temperature across the die surface. If these temperature gradients are not fully understood or anticipated, product reliability may be degraded.
