5000|$|Medium {{and large}} ladles which are {{suspended}} from a crane have a bail which holds the ladle on shafts, called trunnions. To tilt the ladle a gearbox is used {{and this is}} typically a worm gear. The gear mechanism may be hand operated with a large wheel or may be operated by an electric motor or pneumatic motor. Powered rotation allows the <b>ladle</b> <b>operator</b> to be moved to a safe distance and control {{the rotation of the}} ladle via a pendant or radio remote control. Powered rotation also allows the ladle to have a number of rotation speeds which may be beneficial to the overall casting process. Powered rotation obviously also reduces the effort required by the <b>ladle</b> <b>operator</b> and allows high volumes of molten metal to be transferred and poured for long periods without operator fatigue. Where the ladle is fitted with a manually operated gearbox, the type of gearbox most commonly used is the worm and wheel design because in most practical circumstances, and when correctly maintained it can be considered as [...] "self-locking" [...] and doesn't need an internal friction brake to regulate the tilting speed of the ladle. Other types of gear system can be also be used but they have to be fitted with an additional braking system that can hold the ladle if the operator takes his hand off the hand-wheel.|$|E

The metal bath is often stirred by an inert gas to achieve maximum compositional and thermal uniformity throughout the melt. <b>Ladle</b> <b>operators</b> often observe the top surface phenomena, such as level of meniscus disturbance, to evaluate the status of stirring. However, this type of monitoring has significant limitations in assessing the process accurately especially at low gas flow rate bubbling. The present study investigates stirring phenomena using ladle wall triaxial vibration at a low flow rate on a steel-made laboratory model and plant scale for the case of the vacuum tank degasser. Cold model and plant data were successfully modeled by partial least-squares regression to predict the amount of stirring. In the cold model, {{it was found that the}} combined vibration signal could predict the stirring power and recirculation speed effectively in specific frequency ranges. Plant trials also revealed that there is a high structure in each data set and in the same frequency ranges at the water model. In the case of industrial data, the degree of linear relationship was strong for data taken from a single heat...|$|R
