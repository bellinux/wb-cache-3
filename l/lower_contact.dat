25|$|A {{difficult}} shot {{in tennis}} is {{the return of}} an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the contact point {{is higher than the}} reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player will go for a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> point backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.|$|E
50|$|In circuit breakers, {{the vacuum}} {{interrupter}} contact materials are mostly copper-chromium alloy, copper and chromium each 50%. These {{may be made}} by welding a copper-chrome alloy sheet on the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>contacts</b> surface over a contact seat made of oxygen-free copper. Other materials are used in other interrupter designs, such as silver, tungsten and tungsten compounds, and others.|$|R

The authors recorded {{local field}} potentials (LFPs) from {{deep brain stimulation}} electrodes implanted in the pallidum of 13 dystonic patients. LFP power correlated {{with the level of}} dystonic EMG in the sternocleidomastoid, with maximal positive correlations at the <b>lower</b> <b>contacts</b> of pallidal electrodes.

2500|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> of the Dox Formation {{with the}} {{underlying}} Shinumo Quartzite {{appears to be}} gradational and {{is marked by a}} change in topographic expression and color. The basal [...] of the Dox Formation directly overlying Shinumo Quartzite consists of predominantly dark green to black, fissile, slope-forming shale that contains thin sandstone beds. This shale makes a distinct notch between the resistant cliff-forming quartzites of the Shinumo Quartzite underlying them and resistant cliff-forming arkosic sandstones of the Dox Formation overlying them. The change in topographic expression, color, and the facies change, from quartz arenite, to mudstone and fine-grained arkose [...] is gradational. The contact between the Dox Formation and the Shinumo Quartzite at Mile 74.7, where the quartzite forms a narrow V-shaped gorge below a platform carved on the soft shale of the Dox Formation, can be seen from Mile 74.|$|E
2500|$|Mainly {{due to the}} inhomogeneous {{nature of}} {{shoreline}} deposits, lateral variation is intense throughout the Burgsvik beds, making correlation difficult (Laufeld 1974). [...] However, using freshly available borehole data, Manten (1971) was able to further sub-divide the Burgsvik beds into 3 members, illustrated above. The upper bed can be recognised across the entire outcrop belt, varying slightly along strike, and has a distinctive <b>lower</b> <b>contact.</b> [...] The lower bed, however, is easily eroded and rarely exposed. [...] To further complicate the matter, the depositional area was being continually provided with sediment — and thus filling up — from the north west. [...] As bioherm detritus and terrigenous infill accumulated, the coast prograded, and the reef zone advanced {{in front of it}} to the south west. This pattern is complicated further by sea level changes, making precise interpretation troublesome, to say the least (Laufeld 1974).|$|E

2500|$|Basaltic sills and dikes intrude all {{strata of}} the Unkar Group that {{underlie}} the Cardenas Lava. Only sills, whose feeder dikes are not exposed, can be observed intruding the Bass Formation.

2500|$|The {{oldest of}} the three younger plains units is {{intermediate}} plains material. It forms planar to gently undulating surfaces and both embays tracts of cratered terrain and fills crater floors. Both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>contacts</b> with other plains units are gradational. These gradations suggest that the assignment of age to plains deposits on Mercury is partly dependent on the relative abundance of superposed secondary craters, whose densities vary widely {{as a function of}} nearby source craters.|$|R

50|$|The {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>contacts</b> of the Redwall Limestone are both unconformities. Its upper contact is a {{disconformity}} that characteristically is a nearly horizontal surface {{with little or}} no relief. (In the Grand Canyon, the upper disconformity forms a horizontal platform {{at the top of the}} Redwall Limestone.) Locally, the bottom unconformity of the Redwall Limestone contains a basal conglomerate that directly rests upon this bottom unconformity. This basal conglomerate is typically composed of gravel that is locally derived from either the underlying Temple Butte Limestone or Muav Limestone.|$|R
50|$|Relative contact order (CO) is {{formally}} defined as:where N is {{the total}} number of contacts, ΔSi,j is the sequence separation, in residues, between contacting residues i and j, and L {{is the total}} number of residues in the protein. The value of contact order typically ranges from 5% to 25% for single-domain proteins, with <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> order belonging to mainly helical proteins, and higher contact order belonging to proteins with a high beta-sheet content.|$|E
50|$|Copper-nickel {{mineralization}} at {{the mine}} {{is associated with}} semi-massive to disseminated pyrite at the <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> between altered gabbro and rhyolite of the Temagami Greenstone Belt. The gabbro is steeply dipping, approximately 250 m thick and has a strike extent of at least 5 km. The intensity of mineralization varies greatly but is present {{over most of the}} defined strike length of the gabbro. Copper is associated with chalcopyrite. Nickel is associated with millerite, gersdorffite, linnaeite and cobalt-nickel sulfarsenides.|$|E
50|$|The most {{intriguing}} geological {{feature of the}} sill is a 10-meter-thick olivine-rich zone roughly 10 meters (30 ft) from the <b>lower</b> <b>contact.</b> The modal percent of olivine goes from 0-2% within {{the main body of}} the sill to up to 28% within this layer. It is the origin of this layer, and subsequently, the sill as a whole, that has generated much of the attention, as well as the varying origin theories proposed for the intrusion (see below).|$|E
50|$|The {{upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>contacts</b> of the Temple Butte Limestone are major unconformities. Within the Grand Canyon region, its base {{is a major}} {{unconformity}} within the Paleozoic rock record. The time represented by this unconfomity spans about 100 million years, including part of Late Cambrian, all of Ordovician and Silurian, and most of Early and Middle Devonian time. The upper contact is a disconformity that typically consists of nearly horizontal surfaces {{with little or no}} relief and overlain locally by a basal conglomerate within the overlying Redwall Limestone.|$|R

50|$|Power {{handling}} {{defines the}} ability of a switch to handle power and is very dependent on the design and materials used. There are different power handling ratings for switches such as hot switching, cold switching, average power and peak power. Hot switching occurs when RF/microwave power is present at the ports of the switching {{at the time of the}} switching. Cold switching occurs when the signal power is removed before switching. Cold switching results in <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> stress and longer life.|$|E

The contact stiffness of grinding wheel is a variable. The relation between chatter growing index and contact stiffness is an increasing function.

40|$|We use a {{recently}} introduced combinatorial object, the interval-poset, to describe two bijections on intervals of the Tamari lattice.

40|$|Silurian mafic {{lava flows}} and {{rhyolite}} sills in the Passamaquoddy Bay area, southeastern Canada, interacted with wet sediment to produce peperitic breccia. The pahoehoe-type mafic flows flowed over and bulldozed into wet, unconsolidated silt and sand to produce both blocky and fluidal peperite at their <b>lower</b> <b>contacts.</b> Soft-sediment deformation {{structures in the}} siltstone adjacent to the flows, irregularly shaped vesicles in the siltstone, and siltstone-filled vesicles in the mafic lava all indicate the sediment was wet {{at the time of}} flow emplacement. Sills of rhyolite emplaced into the same sedimentary sequence also interacted with the wet sediment and produced peperite at both the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>contacts.</b> Evidence for the rhyolitic previous termmagmanext term interacting with wet sediment includes sediment-filled vesicles in rhyolite, quartz-filled vesicles in siltstone and angular, non-vesicular shards of rhyolite in clastic dykes. Peperite formed by this process is exclusively blocky. The rhyolitic previous termmagmanext term in the Passamaquoddy Bay sequence and other examples of high-previous termviscosity magmanext term producing only blocky peperite suggest that in contrast to low-previous termviscosity magmas,next term which produce a combination of blocky and fluidal peperite, only blocky peperite will form associated with highly viscous rhyolite previous termmagma. next term The sediment that interacted with both the mafic and rhyolitic lavas is of similar texture indicating that, in this case, sediment texture did not control peperite type. The change from fluidal to blocky peperite texture may also be controlled in part by the previous termmagmanext term temperature and/or confining pressure, and the generation and maintenance of a steam film at the previous termmagma/next termwet sediment interface. 18 page(s...|$|R
