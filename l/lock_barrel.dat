50|$|The first Automag {{was invented}} in 1985, but was revised several times before its release in 1990. As {{one of the first}} {{generation}} of semi-automatic paintball markers, its blow forward design was unique. Made mostly from stainless steel, the valve system was the first to incorporate a pressure regulator directly into the marker. The design also allowed for disassembly in the field without tools. The marker also introduced other innovations including a quick release twist <b>lock</b> <b>barrel</b> and the Power Feed, which was an angled feed system that prevented balls from being blown back up into the hopper.|$|E
50|$|Immobilisers {{have been}} {{mandatory}} in all new cars sold in Germany since 1 January 1998, in the United Kingdom since 1 October 1998, in Finland since 1998, in Australia since 2001 and in Canada since 2007. Early models used a static code {{in the ignition}} key (or key fob) which was recognised by an RFID loop around the <b>lock</b> <b>barrel</b> and checked against the vehicle's engine control unit (ECU) for a match. If the code is unrecognised, the ECU will not allow fuel to flow and ignition to take place. Later models use rolling codes or advanced cryptography to defeat copying of the code from the key or ECU.|$|E
50|$|The Ghia was {{the luxury}} model. It had black 14-inch steel wheels with {{full-size}} plastic wheel covers, power steering, body-coloured rear-view mirrors and bumpers, velour interior trim, tachometer, centre console with Ghia emblem, lockable glovebox, driver's seat with lumbar support and height adjust, storage drawer underneath {{the front passenger}} seat, full-size interior door trims, vanity mirror in passenger sunvisor, ticket holder in driver's sunvisor, felt interior headlining and sunvisors, rear headrests, additional warning lights in the instrument cluster, central locking with illuminated driver's door <b>lock</b> <b>barrel,</b> remote exterior mirrors, front door map pockets, front seatback pockets, additional reading lamps, chrome insert strips in the body side mouldings and bumpers, red tailgate garnish and orange beaver panel garnish. Air conditioning and power windows were optional. The stereo was a digitally tuned AM/FM unit, which featured a cassette player with Dolby enhanced sound. The 1.6-litre engine was fitted as standard, with EFI optional (standard on wagon), with either 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission (EFI automatic was 4-speed).|$|E
50|$|Bersa has {{recently}} introduced an eight-shot, single-stack 9mm polymer pistol called the BP9CC. This is a striker-fired pistol versus the hammer-fired Thunders. The BP9CC has a double-action trigger. The BP9CC {{also includes the}} <b>locking</b> <b>barrel</b> design.|$|R
50|$|The inertia {{needed to}} {{counteract}} the force of more powerful cartridges would result in inconveniently large blowback design firearms. For this reason most modern semi-automatic handguns firing high-powered cartridges employ a short recoil system, with a <b>locking</b> <b>barrel</b> and slide assembly instead of a bolt.|$|R

Jonathan attempts to escape from a <b>locked</b> <b>barrel</b> pushed down a large hill and rolling at 126 revolutions per minute, spins on a chair at incredible speeds and then navigates barefoot through piles of broken glass, and withstands two Gs of force on his body courtesy of the Water Wheel of Doom.|$|R
5000|$|P40/P45 - For 2013, a new larger grip frame sized {{to fit the}} [...]45 ACP {{cartridge}} was introduced. The P40 is chambered in [...]40 S&W, 10mm Auto and [...]357 SIG. The P45 is chambered in [...]45 ACP. Using {{the same}} rotary <b>locking</b> <b>barrel</b> system, and the same 108 mm barrel length, the larger-caliber guns use {{many of the same}} proven components of the 9mm models.|$|R

5000|$|An {{interior}} upgrade {{that would}} be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became [...] "piano black" [...] with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips and door <b>lock</b> <b>barrels</b> were also added. The original wood grain trim was retained until the BF.|$|R
50|$|Instead of the locking lugs and {{recesses}} milled {{into the}} barrel and slide of Browning-derived weapons {{such as the}} Colt M1911A1, Browning Hi-Power and CZ 75, the P220 variants (and many other modern pistols) <b>lock</b> the <b>barrel</b> and slide together using an enlarged breech section on the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> into the ejection port. The SIG Sauer System (embossed {{on the side of}} the Browning BDA) is a refinement of the Petter-Browning system.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 they {{introduced}} a full size sporting air rifle {{in the guise}} of the HW35 which was to become their most successful model and was the first to feature the famous Rekord two stage sporting trigger developed from the target trigger of the HW55T, a trigger design that remains across the range unchanged to this day, the HW35 furthermore boasted a <b>locking</b> <b>barrel</b> catch and an automatic safety located {{at the rear of the}} cylinder, the HW35 was such a successful model that despite its relatively modest power output it still remains in the company's range, almost unchanged to this day.|$|R
50|$|The grouped barrel concept {{had been}} {{explored}} by inventors since the 18th century, but poor engineering {{and the lack}} of a unitary cartridge made previous designs unsuccessful. The initial Gatling gun design used self-contained, reloadable steel cylinders with a chamber holding a ball and black-powder charge, and a percussion cap on one end. As the barrels rotated, these steel cylinders dropped into place, were fired, and were then ejected from the gun. The innovative features of the Gatling gun were its independent firing mechanism for each barrel and the simultaneous action of the <b>locks,</b> <b>barrels,</b> carrier and breech.|$|R

50|$|Instead of the locking lugs and {{recesses}} milled {{into the}} barrel and slide of other Browning-type weapons (such as the Colt M1911A1, Browning Hi-Power and CZ 75), the P226 <b>locks</b> the <b>barrel</b> and slide together using an enlarged breech {{section of the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> into the ejection port. This modified system, which was devised by SIG based on Charles Petter's Mod√®le 1935A pistol and their own SIG P210, has no functional disadvantages compared to the original system, and has since been copied by numerous firearm manufacturers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{term was}} first {{recorded}} in the letters of Sir Walter Scott in 1817, in the line [...] "Like the High-landman's gun, she wants stock, <b>lock,</b> and <b>barrel,</b> to put her into repair."http://www.word-detective.com/2008/04/lock-stock-and-barrel It is, however, thought that this term evolved into a popular saying some years before in England.|$|R

50|$|The M79 {{is easy to}} operate. To load, the {{grenadier}} {{pushes the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> latch on the receiver group to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened. A round then may be loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> latch to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.|$|R
50|$|The Strike One pistol {{features}} a low bore axis as {{the distance from}} the barrel central axis {{to the top of the}} grip is 12 mm.

Financed by WITU and Prexer company, the project continued and in 1994 a new prototype was developed. Called WIST-94 {{it is based on the}} B01 prototype. The new pistol was chosen by the Polish military as its new standard sidearm.|$|R
