5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included things such as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done. The developers wanted to focus on how the characters' faces were drawn and animated, {{and make sure that}} the characters matched their respective in-game 3D models, so Fuse gave detailed feedback on the <b>layouts,</b> and drew over them in red to indicate what he wanted to be changed. These changes included corrections to off-model drawings, facial expressions, body postures, and character acting. Once the <b>layouts</b> had been approved, the animators drew the key animation, after which the in-between frames were drawn. Once the animated footage was completed, it was put together and rendered in stereoscopic 3D. Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then done, and added to the cutscene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In an {{interactive}} environment {{such as a}} visual language editor, it {{is not sufficient to}} apply the same <b>layout</b> algorithm in every situation. Instead, the user often wants to select the <b>layout</b> behavior at runtime. With the approach presented, the user can control the <b>layout</b> behavior by choosing different <b>layout</b> patterns for different parts of a diagram, e. g., a graph drawing algorithm may be applied to some selected components while others are aligned vertically or horizontally. To enable the specification of <b>layout</b> behavior, we introduced the concept of <b>layout</b> patterns in previous work. Each <b>layout</b> pattern encapsulates certain <b>layout</b> behav-ior, and hence enables modularization and reuse. To specify user-controlled <b>layout</b> behavior, a flexible combination of arbitrary <b>layout</b> patterns needs to be enabled. Therefore, we introduce an approach that is capable of combining diverse <b>layout</b> ap-proaches, such as standard graph drawing algorithms, constraint-based algorithms, or rule-based <b>layout</b> algorithms. More specifically, an algorithm is presented that automatically computes the complete <b>layout</b> in a straightforward way...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Layout,</b> in {{the context}} of diagram editors, is the {{positioning}} of diagram components on the screen. Editor users enjoy automatic <b>layout,</b> but they usually like to control the <b>layout</b> at runtime, too. Our pattern-based <b>layout</b> approach allows for automatic and user-controlled <b>layout</b> at the same time: The diagram editor may au-tomatically apply <b>layout</b> patterns to diagram parts based on syntactic rules provided by the editor developer, but editor users may also select diagram parts and then ap-ply <b>layout</b> patterns to them. For instance, user-selected components may be aligned horizontally and remain aligned even after diagram modifications. This paper describes continued work on pattern-based <b>layout.</b> We present automatic ad-hoc <b>layout</b> which combines automatic and user-controlled <b>layout</b> in a new way. While automatic <b>layout</b> is syntax-based and must be specified by the editor devel-oper in advance, automatic ad-hoc <b>layout</b> is solely based on the current diagram lay-out. Whenever the <b>layout</b> engine detects a situation where a pattern may be applied with no or only small diagram changes, this <b>layout</b> pattern is automatically applied. For instance, if a set of components is almost horizontally aligned on the screen, the horizontal alignment pattern is automatically applied to these components. Such an editor behavior is known from so-called snap lines in commercial diagram ed-itors. Automatic ad-hoc <b>layout</b> generalizes on these manually programmed <b>layout</b> solutions and offers many additional <b>layout</b> features. This paper describes the concept of automatic ad-hoc <b>layout</b> as well as its integration into a diagram editor framework and discusses issues of this new <b>layout</b> approach...|$|R
