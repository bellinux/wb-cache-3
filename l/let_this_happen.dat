5000|$|Although George Black {{is often}} {{credited}} {{with the formation of}} the Crazy Gang, the start was more complicated. In 1931 three double acts (Nervo and Knox, Naughton and Gold and Billy Caryll and Hilda Mundy) were tentatively booked at the London Palladium. This caused Black to consider cancelling one of the couples. Nervo and Knox had a technique of entering other acts and Black was persuaded to overcome the difficulty by <b>letting</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen.</b> The show, which was called [...] "Crazy Week" [...] opened on 30 November 1931. Other Crazy Weeks followed with Flanagan and Allen added. The name Crazy Gang was not used until 1937.|$|R

2500|$|After {{failing to}} reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 {{on a tour of}} Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was {{appointed}} the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as [...] "the Indian cricket's worst hour". However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to <b>let</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.|$|E
2500|$|The 1983 electoral {{redistribution}} {{was even}} more politically influenced than the previous one in 1977. The Labour Party believed it had been disadvantaged in 1977 {{and it was not}} to <b>let</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> again. Every proposal was put to intense scrutiny, and this resulted in the electoral redistribution taking forty-one working days; the average length of the five previous redistributions was eight. As Social Credit had two MPs, the Labour Party nominee on the commission formally represented that party, which further increased tensions. The 1981 census had shown that the North Island had experienced further population growth, and three additional general seats were created, bringing the total number of electorates to 95. The South Island had, for the first time, experienced a population loss, but its number of general electorates was fixed at 25 since the 1967 electoral redistribution. More of the South Island population was moving to Christchurch, and two electorates were abolished ( [...] and [...] ), while two electorates were recreated ( [...] and [...] ).

As part of the partnership dissolution agreement, all rights to the Doves Type were to pass to Walker upon the death of Cobden-Sanderson. Instead of <b>letting</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen,</b> the matrices were destroyed by Cobden-Sanderson on Good Friday, 21 March 1913 by casting them into the Thames river off Hammersmith Bridge in London, a short walk from the Press.

In 1618, the upstart Jianzhou Jurchen leader Nurhaci united the tribes of Manchuria and declared war on the Ming. After the Fushun garrison within the Liaodong Wall surrendered to Nurhaci the next year, the Ming court assembled a Chinese–Korean army numbering above 100,000 men to contain him, but they were catastrophically defeated at the Battle of Sarhu. Nurhaci made substantial progress in his conquest of Liaodong until he was mortally wounded at the 1626 Battle of Ningyuan by Yuan Chonghuan. He was succeeded by his son Hung Taiji, who worked to undermine Yuan Chonghuan by spreading rumours of Yuan's collaboration with the Jurchens. To drive the point home, Hung Taiji sent an army around Ningyuan through Mongol territories to breach the Great Wall pass at Xifengkou {{in the fall of}} 1629, taking advantage of a rift in the Ming ranks due to Yuan Chonghuan's execution of his fellow commander Mao Wenlong. This breach, known as the Jisi Incident, {{was the first time the}} Jurchens had broken through the Great Wall into China proper since the troubles in the northeast began.

The most important question is why the psyche would want to enter into the death experience? Hillman says that the suicide impulse is actually a hidden desire for a radical existential, spiritual and psychological change.
