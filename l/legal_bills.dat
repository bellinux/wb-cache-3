5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting {{pressure from the}} police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to sustain the fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his <b>legal</b> <b>bills,</b> but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E
5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled {{its power}} to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to deal directly with American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void. Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E
50|$|Legal {{auditors}} {{conduct a}} detailed analysis of original time records, attorney work production, expenses and hourly rate benchmarks. The purpose of a <b>legal</b> <b>bill</b> auditing is to save money for the insurance company and their clients. Many audits measure performance and quality of services in addition to cost alone. <b>Legal</b> <b>Bill</b> Auditors may be responsible for monitoring the matter as it progresses for purposes of giving a second opinion in major cases or as a post-mortem. <b>Legal</b> <b>bill</b> audits give insurance companies and their clients peace of mind and avoid possible future mistakes.|$|R

5|$|In 1907, Barnette {{was accused}} of embezzling money from the Fairbanks bank he operated, and he was sued {{by the man who}} had funded the venture that led to the {{founding}} of Fairbanks. During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of larceny in Oregon. As his <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} case setting forth the {{parameters}} of this requirement is Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), in which the Court held that when Congress paid the <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> for both the plaintiffs and the defendant (in this case the U.S. Treasury department, by designation), then {{there was no real}} controversy between the parties, and a judgment of the Court would be the equivalent of an advisory opinion.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Cherokee Nation had {{encountered}} financial hard times. The U. S. government had stopped paying the agreed-upon $6,000 annuity for previous land cessions, Georgia had effectively cut off any {{income from the}} gold fields in Cherokee lands, and the Cherokee Nation's application for a federal government loan was rejected in February, 1831. With great difficulty (and private donations) Ross was able to pay the Cherokee Nation's <b>legal</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|E

25|$|Within {{an hour of}} his arrest, Wood was {{released}} on bail. He was apparently never brought to trial, as records seem to indicate, and civil courts later supported that the governor had no legal right to interfere in mayoral appointments of city officials. Several months following the riot, policemen who had been injured at City Hall sued Mayor Wood and received $250 each. Wood ignored the ruling, and the officers were later paid, including <b>legal</b> <b>bills,</b> by the city.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{started his}} own legal defense fund before resigning, a move he said was {{necessary}} to protect his family's assets. However, some IAHA insiders claimed {{that this was what}} really led to his ousting. He raised money from breeders for the fund as well as IAHA, creating what some called a conflict of interest. Despite his contract stipulating that IAHA was to pay all his personal legal expenses, on top of his $100,000 annual salary, the Association refused initially to pay the <b>legal</b> <b>bills.</b> It was claimed that Brown created the legal defense fund on the advice of IAHA's own legal counsel.|$|E
25|$|They {{said the}} investors' victory rate was {{misleading}} {{as a measure}} of arbitration's effectiveness since they often merely reimbursed investors for their losses, most of which then went to pay <b>legal</b> <b>bills,</b> and did not include punitive damages such as a court might award that could deter future misconduct. Nor did investors arbitrating claims have access to the full range of procedures they would in court. They could not force the brokerage to produce evidence, and they often charged that the brokerages falsified or improperly withheld documents. Arbitrators also did not have to provide a written explanation for their decisions.|$|E

It could not use those funds in response to any criminal investigations.|$|E
25|$|Intel {{had also}} {{for a number}} of years been embroiled in litigation. US law did not {{initially}} recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU. The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with <b>legal</b> <b>bills,</b> even if Intel lost the suits. Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition.|$|E

500|$|The jury convicted him in April 1988. He {{was sentenced}} to three years imprisonment, {{suspended}} to two years' probation and 250 hours of community service, which he discharged by painting a school bus and working at a library. He had to sell {{his share of the}} family farm to his sister to pay his <b>legal</b> <b>bills,</b> and was fired from his job driving a school bus in Newman Grove even though there was no evidence he had ever approached children sexually. He lowered his profile, often driving to more distant communities to run routine errands. Nonetheless, his hometown supported him. [...] "Any of us could be caught up in such a sting," [...] the Newman Grove local newspaper editorialized.|$|E
500|$|Republicans {{took over}} control of the House as the 112th Congress began in January 2011, meaning Rangel would have lost his Ways and Means chair even without his ethics issues.

[...] Nor were his issues completely over; the National Legal and Policy Center {{filed a complaint with the}} Federal Election Commission alleging that he had improperly paid <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> from a political action committee. To cover both ongoing and past legal expenses, he established a legal defense fund (whose creation was approved by the House Ethics Committee).|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at Ocean City.

He had hoped he could resume {{a career as}} a lawyer, but in 1974, the Maryland courts disbarred him. To earn his living, he founded a business consultancy, Pathlite Inc., which in the following years attracted a widespread international clientele. Describing his business methods, Agnew said: [...] "I have one utility, and that's the ability to penetrate to the top people." [...] One deal concerned a contract for the supply of uniforms to the Iraqi Army, involving negotiations with Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceaucescu of Romania.|$|E

500|$|Doggett has {{had five}} {{abortion}}s. After having her fifth abortion, {{which takes place}} at an abortion clinic in Fishersville, Virginia, the nurse remarks [...] "we should give you a punch card, get the sixth one free." [...] Doggett is so offended by this joke that she shoots the nurse with a shotgun. She agrees to have a Christian lawyer as it was {{likely to lead to}} a lighter sentence and her <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> being paid for. Since she shot an abortion nurse, she became a 'hero' of the pro-life movement. Doggett regularly receives cards praising her for her claims of defending the unborn as well as generous cash donations to her commissary account by fans & supporters. Although her Christian faith was initially fake, at some point Doggett did become a Christian; this was confirmed by Manning in an interview. Manning describes Doggett's faith as [...] "a hybrid of Christianity, Baptism, Presbyterian".|$|E
500|$|The consistory {{court had}} awarded the prosecution's costs against Davidson, who now faced {{enormous}} <b>legal</b> <b>bills</b> {{and had no}} regular source of income. His only recourse was to return to Blackpool and resume {{his career as a}} showman; this became his milieu for the next four years, interrupted by occasional prosecutions for obstruction and a nine-day spell in prison in 1933, for non-payment of rent owing to one of his former London landladies. He informed the press: [...] "While I am in the barrel I shall be occupied in preparing my case". Although the barrel act remained his staple performance, he introduced variations over the years: freezing in a refrigerated chamber, or being roasted in a glass-fronted oven while a mechanised devil prodded him with a pitchfork. In August 1935 the freezing routine led to Davidson's arrest and prosecution for attempted suicide; he won the case and was awarded £382 damages for false imprisonment. How much money Davidson made from his various acts is uncertain; Tucker believes that the main financial beneficiary was his agent, Luke Gannon.|$|E
