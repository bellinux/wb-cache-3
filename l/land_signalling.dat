50|$|Philae <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> was {{received}} by Earth communication stations at 16:03 UTC after a 28-minute delay. Unknown to mission scientists at that time, the lander had bounced. It began performing scientific measurements while slowly {{moving away from}} the comet and coming back down, confusing the science team. Further analysis showed that it bounced twice.|$|R
5000|$|He {{served as}} a <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer (LSO) from May 1940, {{surviving}} {{the sinking of the}} carrier [...] by a Japanese submarine near Guadalcanal on September 12, 1942. He returned to the United States, was promoted to Lieutenant Commander, and was stationed at Naval Air Station Melbourne, Florida as LSO Instructor until August 1943.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer (LSO) is a qualified, {{experienced}} {{pilot who}} is responsible for the visual control of aircraft in the terminal phase of the approach immediately prior to landing. LSOs ensure that approaching aircraft are properly configured, and they monitor aircraft glidepath angle, altitude, and lineup. They communicate with landing pilots via voice radio and light signals.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer (LSO) is a Naval Aviator {{specially}} trained {{to facilitate the}} [...] "safe and expeditious recovery" [...] of naval aircraft aboard aircraft carriers. Originally LSOs were responsible for bringing aircraft aboard ship using hand signals. Since the introduction of optical landing systems in the 1950s, LSOs assist pilots by giving information via radio handsets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer School (LSO School), where pilots {{selected}} to be LSOs (also known as [...] "paddles"...which {{is a very}} old term {{from the days when}} the LSO actually signaled to the approaching aircraft with brightly colored paddles) go to learn how to [...] "wave" [...] planes aboard the [...] "boat" [...] (aircrew speak for the aircraft carrier).|$|R

50|$|As {{with most}} {{approaches}} to a carrier landing, Hultgreen's incident was videotaped by two cameras. The tape shows an overshooting turn onto final, then apparent engine failure, {{followed by an}} audible wave-off and gear-up command from the <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer. Segments shown on broadcast television concluded with the rapid sequence of aircraft stall, roll, crew ejections, and impact with the water.|$|R
25|$|His first {{assignment}} {{was to the}} USS Mississippi, though he soon moved into flight training and was designated a naval aviator by 1932. Ellis served briefly aboard the USS Saratoga, his first carrier experience, and in 1937 was an aviation ordinance and <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer aboard the USS Enterprise. His last post before the outbreak of World War II was Commanding Officer (CO) of a training squadron from 1940 – 1942.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, Baker {{completed}} {{flight training}} and earned his Wings of Gold as a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Chase Field, Beeville, Texas, in 1977. In 1978, {{he was assigned}} to Attack Squadron 56 (VA-56), embarked on the aircraft carrier , homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, where he flew the A-7 Corsair II. In late 1980, {{he was assigned to}} Carrier Air Wing 30 as the Air Wing <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer.|$|R
50|$|Skybase is, essentially, an {{improved}} {{version of the}} original Cloudbase, carrying {{a wide variety of}} vehicles and weapons on board, and housing Spectrum officers. A notable addition is that, on the flight deck, the Angels use a robot (Nicknamed 'F.R.E.D.'), that is controlled through telepresence by a <b>Landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer, who operates inside the base for safety purposes. The officer gives the traditional hand signals to the pilots, such as the order to launch.|$|R
5000|$|Jett was {{designated}} a Naval Aviator in March 1983, and reported to VF-101 at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia for initial F-14 Tomcat training. Upon completion of this training, {{he was assigned}} to VF-74 and made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean aboard the aircraft carrier [...] While assigned to VF-74, he {{was designated}} as an airwing qualified <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer (LSO) and also attended the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN).|$|R
5000|$|The {{first human}} figure, which he managed with a {{computer}} for a film, however, was the <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer on a CV-A 59 aircraft carrier. The figure was shown in a short CV A-59 film but only as a silhouette and not as detailed elaboration as the First Man had been. Fetter published this in November 1964 in his book Computer Graphics in Communication in the section [...] "Aircraft Carrier Landing Depiction with images".|$|R
50|$|Captain Aaron Kelly is {{a fictional}} {{character}}, played by Ty Olsson, in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica TV program. The character {{has been part}} of the show since the 2003 Miniseries. Captain Kelly is the <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer (LSO) aboard the Battlestar Galactica. At the beginning of the second season, Captain Kelly was third in line of command, after then-Commander Adama and then-Colonel Tigh. The character of Aaron Kelly has no direct analog in the original Battlestar Galactica.|$|R
40|$|Approach {{training}} currently relies {{solely on}} manual observation of and verbal {{feedback to the}} pilot. This project aims to provide both pilots and <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officers (LSOs) with valuable information about individual approaches in the carrier landing environment. The author investigated fully automatic flight path acquisition by means of computer vision-based analyses of platform camera video. The obtained data supports enhanced LSO training, real-time approach analysis and pilot self-improvement through advanced review capabilities. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with NAS Glenview, the two paddle-wheelers afforded critical training in basic carrier operations {{to thousands of}} pilots and also to smaller numbers of <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officers (LSOs). Wolverine and Sable enabled the pilots and LSOs to learn to handle take-offs and landings on a real flight deck. Sable and Wolverine were {{a far cry from}} front-line carriers, but they accomplished the Navy's purpose: qualifying naval aviators fresh from operational flight training in carrier landings.|$|R
5000|$|The British first {{described}} aircraft {{that failed to}} arrest as bolters. When an aircraft bolters on a United States Navy carrier, the <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer (LSO) often transmits [...] "bolter, bolter, bolter" [...] over the radio. United States Navy LSOs [...] 'grade' each carrier landing attempt {{on a scale of}} 0-5. Assuming the approach was safe and at least [...] "average", a bolter is graded as 2.5. For unsafe or below average approaches that result in bolter, a grade of 2 is assigned.|$|R
50|$|Conventional ("tailhook") {{aircraft}} {{rely upon}} a <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer (LSO, radio call sign paddles) to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as Optical Landing System have provided information on proper glide slope, but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.|$|R
5000|$|McCool {{completed}} {{flight training}} and was designated a Naval Aviator in August 1986. He {{was assigned to}} Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington, for initial EA-6B Prowler training. His first operational tour was with Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 133 (VAQ-133), where he made two deployments aboard the aircraft carrier [...] to the Mediterranean Sea, and received designation as a wing-qualified <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer (LSO). In November 1989, he was selected for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School/Test Pilot School (TPS) Cooperative Education Program.|$|R
2500|$|In the North Africa {{invasion}} in November 1942, he sailed his scout ship from seven miles off-shore in complete darkness {{to the shore}} of French Morocco, located and marked landing beaches with <b>landing</b> <b>signals,</b> guided assault troops to their targets while being strafed by enemy planes, {{and became the first}} American in the invasion to capture two of the enemy when he personally captured two enemy officers. [...] In recognition of his efforts, including his extraordinary heroism, skill, courage, and fearless devotion to duty, he received a presidential citation and the Navy Cross.|$|R
50|$|As a Major, Adama {{served on}} the Battlestar Atlantia, where he had an ongoing feud with the ship's <b>landing</b> <b>signal</b> officer that {{inspired}} a celebration of his thousandth landing. He later served as the {{executive officer of the}} Battlestar Columbia, presumably as a Colonel, and skippered three Colonial escort vessels before earning his own command, the Battlestar Valkyrie. Adama brought his old friend, Saul Tigh, with him as his XO. At some point during this phase of his career, Adama either served aboard or visited a Mercury class battlestar.|$|R

50|$|During his career, Admiral Fitzgerald was {{assigned}} as Deputy Commander, Joint Air Force Component Commander for Provide Promise Yugoslav Operations and Assistant Commander for Deny Flight NATO operations (1993). He assumed command of Carrier Air Wing 14 (1994-95) while deployed to the Persian Gulf in Carl Vinson supporting Operation Southern Watch. Admiral Fitzgerald’s shore tours include VA-174 <b>Landing</b> <b>Signal</b> Officer (1979-82), Naval Maritime Intelligence Center, SPEAR (1991-92), and Executive Assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (1996-98). He holds a master's degree in Aeronautical Systems Engineering from the University of West Florida (1975) and attended the Naval War College, Newport, R.I. (1983-84).|$|R
40|$|The leakage of land {{hydrology}} has {{a sizeable}} {{effect on the}} oceanic mass estimated from GRACE in small ocean basins, as the <b>land</b> <b>signal</b> is typically much larger. Its magnitude depends on the dimension of the region, on the smoothing applied to GRACE {{and the type of}} the signal. Hydrological models are used to correct for this leakage effect. Departures between the models may cause significant differences in water mass change in the coastal regions. The resulting improvement in the seawater mass estimates is evaluated by comparison with steric-corrected altimeter basin averages. Results for the Mediterranean and the Black Sea are shown...|$|R
