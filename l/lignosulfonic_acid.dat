40|$|<b>Lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a waste}} lignin {{produced}} from the sulfite pulping of softwood. We investigated the effect of <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> on α-glucosidase and found that <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> produced a reversible and non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme activity. Moreover, in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited 2 -deoxyglucose uptake, while in vivo studies demonstrated {{a significant reduction in}} the blood glycemic response to sucrose or glucose ingestion in rats treated with <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Feces of rats fed a diet supplemented with 5 % <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> had higher sugar content compared to those of rats fed a control diet.

40|$|Objective Adipose tissue plays a {{key role}} in the {{development}} of obesity and diabetes. We previously reported that <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> suppresses the rise in blood glucose levels through the inhibition of α-glucosidase activity and intestinal glucose absorption. The purpose of this study is to examine further biological activities of <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Methods In this study, we examined the effect of <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> on differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. Results While <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited proliferation (mitotic clonal expansion) after induction of differentiation, <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> significantly increased the size of accumulated lipid droplets in the cells. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> increased the expression of the adipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), leading to increased glucose transporter 4 (Glut- 4) expression and 2 -deoxyglucose uptake in differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 cells.

Indulin AT increased the activity of B. pumilus MnP up to 31. 66 U/L after 8 h, but no improve was observed for Paenibacillus sp., which reached maximum activity (12. 22 U/L) after 20 h. Both MnPs produced by these microorganisms were purified in phenyl sepharose resin and the proteins from crude extracts were eluted in two fractions. However, only the first fraction of each extract exhibited MnP activities. Tests in different pH and temperature values, from pH 5. 0 to pH 10. 0 and 30 °C to 60 °C, respectively, were carried out with the purified MnP.

In {{the absence of}} inhibitors, nitrification of the applied ammonium was complete within one week at 35 °C, whereas it took {{two to three weeks}} at 16 °C. At 35 °C, ATC was the most effective compound causing 44 - 71 % inhibition up to four weeks when applied at 10 mg kg− 1. The inhibitory effect of ATC increased with increasing application rate to 30 mg kg− 1 (92 – 94 % inhibition for four weeks). Although another compound viz. PZ applied at 10 mg kg− 1 was also effective at 35 °C, the inhibitory effect persisted up to three weeks (44 - 48 % inhibition). At 16 °C, six of the test compounds (BTr, ATC, BTh, MPC, BMP and PZ) effectively inhibited nitrification at least up to four weeks. At 16 °C also, ATC was the most effective compound causing 84 - 90 % inhibition for four weeks when applied at 10 mg kg− 1.

40|$|In this work, {{we found}} that <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (LS), which is a waste {{byproduct}} from the paper industry, in ionic liquids (ILs) can catalyze the dehydration of fructose and inulin into 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) efficiently, which is a promising potential substitute for petroleum-based building blocks. The effects of reaction time, temperature, catalyst loading, and reusability of the catalytic system were studied. It was found that a 94. 3 ?% yield of HMF could be achieved in only 10 min at 100 degrees C under mild conditions. The reusability study of the LSIL catalytic system after removal of HMF by ethyl acetate extraction demonstrated that the catalytic activity decreased from 77. 4 to 62. 9 ?% after five cycles and the catalytic activity could be recovered after simply removing the accumulated humins by filtration after adding ethanol to the LSILs.

A polycarbonate was prepared from the bisphenol product and characterized as a model application, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that decomposition occurred in a single stage with the maximum rate of degradation at approximately 420 degrees C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that the glass transition temperature and melting peak of the polycarbonate were approximately 122 and 314 degrees C, respectively.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of manganese lignosulfonates by a two-step method has been reported. It {{was based on}} the conversion of technical sodium derivative of lignosulfonate to its hydrogen form i. e., <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> and its further reaction with manganese hydroxide. The obtained product was electroactive, and could be applied as the precursor of electroactive manganese oxide. The product showed a reversible redox activity in the potential range of 0 to 1 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electroactivity of the obtained product can be tentatively assigned to the redox activity of both the electrodeposited MnOx and the presence of lignosulfonate-derived quinones since the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of organic matter in the deposit. It also showed substantial electrocatalytic activity towards the anodic oxidation of hydrogen peroxide. This suggests that manganese lignosulfonates could be a valuable compound for the electrochemical preparation of electroactive layers that are suitable in the development of electrochemical sensors...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} lignin, alkali lignin and <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt, are blended into {{thermoplastic}} zein through melt mixing {{in order to}} develop biodegradable insulator materials for multifunctional applications in electronics. The effects of lignin type and content on the dielectric properties of the resulting bio-nanocomposites are investigated. The results indicate that, by modifying the structural arrangement of the zein with the use of lignin, it is possible to obtain bio-nanocomposites characterized by tunable dielectric properties. The bio-nanocomposites containing low amounts of lignin derivatives exhibit extensive protein structural changes together with a modification of the dielectric properties compared to the pristine thermoplastic zein. Changes in the dielectric properties of these systems are also observed to change over time, indicating a loss of plasticizer, as is evident by a decrease in the glass-transition temperature. At high frequencies, the resulting values of the dielectric permittivity and of the loss tangent demonstrate that the bio-nanocomposite can be used as biodegradable dielectric material for transient (temporary) electronics...|$|E
40|$|The {{reinforcement}} {{effect of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been examined {{as a function}} of their loading and aspect ratio in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) based hybird fibers. <b>Lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt (LSA) was used to disperse CNTs to produce consistently high CNT loaded PVA-LSA-CNT hybrid fibers using an electrospinning process. The elastic modulus of individual fibers was measured using atomic force microscopy. The presence of CNTs significantly increased the average elastic modulus of PVA-LSA-CNT fibers compared to PVA-LSA fibers. The elastic modulus, however, exhibited no fiber diameter dependency. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the loading and the aspect ratio of CNTs in each hybrid fiber. The CNT loading in PVA-LSA-CNT fibers varied widely due to non-uniform CNT dispersion and displayed no relationship with the elastic modulus. Our results also demonstrated that the average value of CNT aspect ratio significantly affected the elastic modulus of the hybrid fibers. Such a result was in agreement with theoretical prediction in which the stress transfer efficiency in a composite matrix is strongly dependent on the CNT aspect ratio.

40|$|Some {{secondary}} metabolites {{from plants}} show to have potent inhibitory activities against microbial pathogens, such as {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, etc. Here we report that <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (LSA), a polymeric lignin derivative, exhibits potent and broad activity against HIV- 1 isolates of diverse subtypes including two North America strains {{and a number of}} Chinese clinical isolates values ranging from 21. 4 to 633 nM. Distinct from other polyanions, LSA functions as an entry inhibitor with multiple targets on viral gp 120 as well as on host receptor CD 4 and co-receptors CCR 5 /CXCR 4. LSA blocks viral entry as determined by time-of-drug addiction and cell-cell fusion assays. Moreover, LSA inhibits CD 4 -gp 120 interaction by blocking the binding of antibodies specific for CD 4 -binding sites (CD 4 bs) and for the V 3 loop of gp 120. Similarly, LSA interacts with CCR 5 and CXCR 4 via its inhibition of specific anti-CCR 5 and anti-CXCR 4 antibodies, respectively.

Conductivity measure-ments performed on dry Ppy pellets showed {{a sharp increase in}} conductivity when adding the anionic polymers to the polymerization liquor. For a polyanion/pyrrole weight ratio ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 6, the highest conductivity was given by PpyCMC (82 S/m) and PpyPSS (80 S/m), followed by PpyLS (6 S/m). On the other hand, for a polyanion/pyrrole ratio higher than 0. 6, the conductivity of PpyPSS systems sharply decreased, and for polyanion/pyrrole ratios higher than 1, the highest conductivity was given by PpyCMC (~ 10 S/m), followed by PpyLS (~ 7 S/m) and PpyPSS (~ 5 S/m). Zeta-potential measurements showed that the surface charge of Ppy was strongly affected by the polyanion type and amount. Cationic Ppy particles were obtained {{in the presence of the}} two polymers bearing strongly acidic moieties (PSS and LS).

During the charge cycle, pure lead (Pb) and lead dioxide (PbO 2) from the soluble lead (II) species are electrodeposited {{onto the surface of}} the negative and positive current collectors, respectively. Both the electrodeposited materials are characterized by XRD, XPS and SEM. Phase purity of synthesized lead (II) methanesulfonate is unequivocally established by single crystal X-ray diffraction followed by profile refinements using high resolution powder data. During the discharge cycle, electrodeposited Pb and PbO 2 are dissolved back into the electrolyte. Since lead ions are produced during oxidation and reduction at the negative and positive plates, respectively there is no risk of crossover during discharge cycle, preventing the possibility of lowering the overall efficiency of the cell.

40|$|Changes in binding affinity, acrosomal status, and {{motility}} {{of living}} sperm on the zona pellucida {{were for the}} first time in any mammalian species directly observed and analyzed with video microscopy. A single zona was air-dried and rehydrated on a microscope slide, and a coverslip supported by glass beads was added. Capacitated sperm were added together with Alexa-SBTI, a probe for acrosin that can detect the acrosome reaction. The heads of loosely attached sperm oscillated on the zona and the flagella beat symmetrically with a sigmoid-shaped waveform. Tight binding was observed after 16 sec as the sperm head became fixed in place on the zona. The shape of the flagellar beat simultaneously shifted to a more rigid, C-shaped waveform. The first signs of the acrosome reaction were detected within 11 sec of tight binding. Rapid flushing removed approximately 65 % of sperm that were loosely attached but only 2 % of those that were tightly bound. In the 2 min following the onset of tight binding, the lateral displacement of the flagellum increased by approximately 30 % and the beat frequency decreased by 25 %. <b>Lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (LSA) inhibited loose sperm attachment and the development of tight binding. LSA had no effect on the time of the acrosome reaction following tight binding or on changes in motility that followed tight binding.

40|$|Breakdown {{products}} of the wood structural polymer lignin are major components in the effluent from commercial pulp and paper manufacturing mills. Polar lignin-derived macromolecules (LDMs) isolated from vastly different pulping processes and from different source wood have surprisingly similar properties and biological activity. Our group has previously reported that a LDM from bleached Kraft mill effluent (BKME) inhibits sea urchin fertilization by binding to sperm cells and blocking the egg jelly induced acrosome reaction. <b>Lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (LSA), an LDM from sulfite mill effluent, is structurally distinct from BKME-LDM and data presented herein indicate {{that it was a}} more potent inhibitor of fertilization. LSA ranged in molecular size from 300 K, with higher molecular size fractions being the more potent inhibitors of fertilization. The mode of action of LSA on sea urchin fertilization was characterized by examining its effects on two critical prerequisite sperm-egg interactions: acrosome reaction induction by egg jelly and sperm-to-egg binding. LSA inhibited both of these processes at low concentrations. Microscopically, a biotinylated LSA derivative (LSA-b) bound to localized domains of the sperm surface, particularly over the head and acrosomal regions. The interaction of LSA with binding sites on the sperm surface was further characterized using a quantitative solid phase whole-cell binding assay and the LSA-b probe. LSA-b behaved {{in a manner consistent with}} receptor-ligand binding models in that its interaction with sperm was specific, saturable, kinetically dependent, and reversible. LSA specifically inhibited the binding of antibodies to proteins that entirely co-localize within its binding domain, sea urchin receptor for egg jelly (suREJ 3) and bindin. These results support the hypothesis that LSA exerts its biological action by binding to key molecules involved in gamete recognition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (LA), a {{low-cost}} lignin-derived polyanionic macromolecule, was extensively studied for its anti-HIV and anti-HSV activity in various cellular assays, its mechanism of viral inhibition and safety profile as potential microbicide. LA demonstrated potent inhibitory activity of HIV replication against {{a wide range}} of R 5 and X 4 HIV strains and prevented the uptake of HIV by bystander CD 4 + T cells from persistently infected T cells in vitro (IC 50 : 0. 07 - 0. 34 μM). LA also inhibited HSV- 2 replication in vitro in different cell types (IC 50 : 0. 42 - 1. 1 μM) and in rodents in vivo. Furthermore, LA neutralized the HIV- 1 and HSV- 2 DC-SIGN-mediated viral transfer to CD 4 + T cells (IC 50 : ~ 1 μM). In addition, dual HIV- 1 /HSV- 2 infection in T cells was potently blocked by LA (IC 50 : 0. 71 μM). No antiviral activity was observed against the non-enveloped viruses Coxsackie type B 4 and Reovirus type 1. LA is defined as a HIV entry inhibitor since it interfered with gp 120 binding to the cell surface of T cells. Pretreatment of PBMCs with LA neither increased expression levels of cellular activation markers (CD 69, CD 25 and HLA-DR), nor enhanced HIV- 1 replication. Furthermore, we found that LA had non-antagonistic effects with acyclovir, PRO 2000 or LabyA 1 (combination index (CI) : 0. 46 - 1. 03) in its anti-HSV- 2 activity and synergized with tenofovir (CI: 0. 59) in its anti-HIV- 1 activity. To identify mechanisms of LA resistance, we generated in vitro a mutant HIV- 1 NL 4. 3 LAresistant virus, which acquired seven mutations in the HIV- 1 envelope glycoproteins: S 160 N, V 170 N, Q 280 H and R 389 T in gp 120 and K 77 Q, N 113 D and H 132 Y in gp 41. Additionally, HIV- 1 NL 4. 3 LAresistant virus showed cross-resistance with feglymycin, enfuvirtide, PRO 2000 and mAb b 12, four well-described HIV binding/fusion inhibitors. Importantly, LA did not affect the growth of vaginal Lactobacilli strains.

40|$|Laccases are multi-copper oxidases that {{catalyze}} the oxidation {{of various}} organic and inorganic compounds by reducing O 2 to water. Here we report the crystal structure at 1. 8 Å resolution {{of a native}} laccase (designated nLcc 4) isolated from a white-rot fungus Lentinus sp. nLcc 4 is composed of three cupredoxin-like domains D 1 -D 3 each folded into a Greek key β-barrel topology. T 1 and T 2 /T 3 copper binding sites and three N-glycosylated sites at Asn 75, Asn 238, and Asn 458 were elucidated. Initial rate kinetic analysis revealed that the kcat, Km, and kcat/Km of nLcc 4 with substrate ABTS were 3, 382 s- 1, 65. 0 ± 6. 5 μM, and 52 s- 1 μM- 1, respectively; and the values with <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> determined using isothermal titration calorimetry were 0. 234 s- 1, 56. 7 ± 3. 2 μM, and 0. 004 s- 1 μM- 1, respectively. Endo H-deglycosylated nLcc 4 (dLcc 4), with only one GlcNAc residue remaining {{at each of the}} three N-glycosylation sites in the enzyme, exhibited similar kinetic efficiency and thermal stability to that of nLcc 4. The isolated Lcc 4 gene contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp with a deduced polypeptide of 521 amino acid residues including a predicted signaling peptide of 21 residues at the N-terminus. Recombinant wild-type Lcc 4 and mutant enzymes N 75 D, N 238 D and N 458 D were expressed in Pichia pastoris cells to evaluate the effect on enzyme activity by single glycosylation site deficiency. The mutant enzymes secreted in the cultural media of P. pastoris cells were observed to maintain only 4 - 50 % of the activity of the wild-type laccase. Molecular dynamics simulations analyses of various states of (de-) glycosylation in nLcc support the kinetic results and suggest that the local H-bond networks between the domain connecting loop D 2 -D 3 and the glycan moieties {{play a crucial role in}} the laccase activity.

40|$|The {{removal of}} colour, organics and {{phosphorus}} from {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent {{and the development of}} colour of the wastewater were investigated. These contaminants are considered {{to be the most important}} due to their resistance over common treatment applied by the mill. Two approaches, adsorption and coagulation, were chosen for investigation of the removal of colour, organics and phosphorus from aqueous discharges of a bisulphite pulp and paper mill. Additionally, the colour generation induced by UV irradiation of the treated effluents was investigated. This study was carried out to explore the possibility of UV-induced colour development of the effluent over the long term and to characterize the colour producing species from the wastewater. Cheap and highly abundant brown coal (or lignite) was utilized as adsorbent for colour, phosphorus, and organics from the industrial effluent. Knowledge on the mechanism of brown coal adsorption, selectivity, the effect of pre-treatment and physical properties of brown coal is crucial for the future application of brown coal in the water industry. The mechanism of brown coal adsorption was investigated using various brown coal samples differing in physical and chemical composition and two model dye solutions, cationic (safranin) and anionic (alizarin red) dyes. The capacities of some brown coals (Loy Yang high Na and Yallourn) were higher than commercial coal-based activated carbon. However, the adsorption capacities of all brown coal samples for an anionic dye were very low, less than 3 % of that for activated carbon. This result reveals the potential of brown coal to remove positively charged contaminants from aqueous solutions and suggests cation-exchange as the major mechanism involved. Effects of brown coal pre-treatment, drying and washing, were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption data were analysed using the two most popular adsorption isotherms, Langmuir and Freundlich. The Langmuir isotherm fitted most adsorption data of brown coal better than the Freundlich isotherm, supporting the concept of monolayer adsorption and the role of chemical adsorption in the mechanism. When applied to actual wastewater from a magnesium bisulphite pulp and paper mill, brown coal exhibited multi-component adsorption of colour, organics and phosphorus from the solution. Brown coal showed an ability to remove phosphorus from the wastewater, which could not be achieved with activated carbon; yet brown coal had significantly lower adsorption capacities for colour and organics than did activated carbon. This can be explained by the nature of organics and colour that carried negative charge in the wastewater as indicated by the zeta potential analysis. Another powerful technique for organic removal, coagulation, was then chosen to significantly reduce colour and organics content of the effluent. Coagulation using trivalent salts was selected to efficiently remove colour, organics and total phosphorus in the treated and untreated wastewater solution. Selectivity of salt-induced coagulation was achieved and showed the following trend of removal efficiency: colour ~ total phosphorus > TOC. The removal of colour and total phosphorus from concentrated pulp mill effluents were above 90 %. The coagulation method was proven to be superior for the remediation of both treated and untreated effluent from pulp and paper industry. However, a small amount of colour and organics still persisted in the wastewater which may lead to colour development after treatment at the collecting discharge point. The Photometric Dispersion Analyzer (PDA) and Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) techniques were utilised to study the coagulation kinetics of the wastewater upon addition of salt. The involvement of fast aggregation and adsorption in the coagulation mechanism were revealed. The high critical coagulation concentration (CCC) and the significant role of trivalent salts in the coagulation process indicated the involvement of complexation reactions prior to coagulation. In coagulation, pH was also found to be a dominant factor affecting efficiency. The UV-induced colour generation of the effluent from pulp and paper industry was studied using UV-irradiation at 302 nm and 254 nm. Lignin derived compounds were suspected to be responsible for colour growth of pulp and paper wastewater. Three model compounds, <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid,</b> humic acid and vanillin, were selected and studied as comparison. The yellowing rate of the wastewater solution was found to be similar to that of the model <b>lignosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> solution supporting the occurrence of lignin compounds in the wastewater. The yellowing rate of humic acid was lower than the wastewater solution, but the yellowing rate for vanillin was significantly higher than that of the wastewater solution. The irradiation products were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), UV spectroscopy, Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (ES-MS), Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The mechanism of wastewater yellowing upon irradiation was suspected to mimic the mechanism of photo-yellowing of paper. The result also suggested that UV-induced chemical reactions may be important in the aqueous discharge of pulp and paper mill effluent that could potentially enhance its colour...|$|E
