40|$|In this thesis, we will {{consider}} the distributed architecture for communication protocol conformance testing, where there are two remote testers, called the <b>lower</b> <b>tester</b> and the upper tester. During {{the application of a}} predetermined test sequence in the distributed architecture, the upper and the lower testers are bound to synchronize with each other only through their interaction with the implementation. However, this requirement may lead to a synchronization problem when the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>tester</b> processes are forced to consider the timing of an interaction in which they have not taken part. We present a heuristic for generating a minimum length synchronizable test sequence for protocol conformance testing. The approach is based on a variation of a well-known problem in graph theory known as the Chinese postman problem. In this variation, for each edge e = (i,j) in a digraph D, we specify a subset of edges leaving j as the eligible successors for e, and require that each edge in the postman tour be followed by an eligible successsor. We present a heuristic to solve this variation of the Chinese postman problem, and develop a specialized version of this heuristic for the problem of generating a minimum length synchronizable test sequence. We show empirically that our specialized heuristic has superior performance compared to other known heuristics for this problem...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report their}} {{experience}} in utilizing formal conformance testing techniques to test as an {{implementation of the}} CCITT Q. 931 protocol, for an ISDN business network being developed by a government telecom R&D concern in India. The Q. 931 standard is modelled as a FSM. A tool is implemented to generate conformance test sequences. This tool is based on graph theory and finite automata concepts, namely unique input output sequences, the rural Chinese postman algorithm, Euler tours, and optimization techniques such as linear programming and network-flow algorithms. In the tester design part, they use the single layer local test method, and give the detailed design of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>tester</b> and control process which is the test driver. They briefly report on the first cycle of testin...|$|E
40|$|In an {{external}} architecture for testing communication protocols, the service provider is an abstraction {{of the stack}} of protocols and the public data network interconnecting the <b>lower</b> <b>tester</b> with the implementation under test. In this paper, {{the effects of a}} public data network are studied (i. e. the service provider) when testing a protocol implementation's conformity to its speci"cation. The three main characteristics of a service provider are dynamic round trip delay (RTD), message buffering and lossy transmission. It is shown that if proper care is not taken in test architectures and test cases, the dynamic attributes of a service provider may make correct test cases useless. The outline of the paper is as follows. First, the notion of a time server protocol (TSP) in a test architecture to estimate the RTD dynamically in the service provider is introduced. The generalization capability of neural networks is used as the central idea in the dynamic estimation of RTDs from previous actual measurement of delays. Second, the notion of a test architecture's reliability and the properties that a reliable architecture must satisfy are de"ned. A reliable test architecture is obtained by augmenting a basic test architecture with a TSP and a "lter protocol to discard spurious events. Finally, some dif"culties in assigning test verdicts are studied and measures are suggested for overcoming them. Thus, an extended service provider is designed by augmenting the actual service provider with the new components. This work proposes an interface to an extended service provider to conceal the side-effects of the bare service provider...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} testing 3 -colorability in the bounded-degree model. We show that, for small enough ε, every tester for 3 colorability must have query complexity Ω(n). This is the first linear lower bound for testing a natural graph property in the bounded-degree model. An Ω (√ n) lower bound was previously known. For one-sided error testers, we also show an Ω(n) <b>lower</b> bound for <b>testers</b> that distinguish 3 -colorable graphs from graphs that are (1 / 3 − α) -far from 3 -colorable, for arbitrarily small α. In contrast, a polynomial time algorithm by Frieze and Jerrum distinguishes 3 -colorable graphs from graphs that are 1 / 5 -far from 3 -colorable. As a by-product of our techniques, we obtain tight unconditional lower bounds on the approximation ratios achievable by sublinear time algorithms for Max E 3 SAT, Max E 3 LIN- 2 and other problems. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{homogeneous}} {{group of}} Rhizoctonia solani isolates from tobacco, which showed intermediate features be-tween anastomosis groups BI and 2 - 1 (AG-BI and AG- 2 - 1), was recently characterized. It was not conclusively assigned to any previously known AG and was provi-sionally named ‘Nt-isolates’. The rDNA sequence simi-larity in the ITS 1 {{region of the}} Nt-isolates was evaluat-ed and a high similarity (> 90 %) was found with AG- 2 - 1 tester isolates, while it was remarkably <b>lower</b> with <b>tester</b> isolates from AG-BI and other AG- 2 subgroups. Therefore, despite a low anastomosis frequency, Nt-iso-lates are to be considered members of AG- 2 - 1. Key words: Rhizoctonia solani, anastomosis groups, tobacco, rDNA sequence similarity. Among plant pathogenic fungi, Rhizoctonia solani Kühn [teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris (Frank) Donk] is conspicuous on account of its infraspecific taxonomy based on the anastomosis group (AG) con-cept (Parmeter et al., 1969). Isolates of the fungus are classified according {{to their ability to}} anastomose with tester isolates belonging to establishe AGs. Anastomosis frequency as well as some morphological, physiological and biomolecular features, may vary within a given AG; such a variability has led to the characterization of sub-groups which are currently considered the evolutionary units of the species. Moreover, several ecological types have been described on account of variation in patho-genicity on different hosts. So far 12 anastomosis groups (AG- 1 through 11, and AG-BI) and a number of subgroups and ecological types have been character-ized (Sneh et al., 1991; Carling, 1996). A homogeneous group of R. solani isolates from to-bacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) fields was recently charac-terized by means of anastomosis behaviour, as well a...|$|R
40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{designing}} one-sided error property testers for cycle-freeness in bounded degree graphs. Such a property tester always accepts forests. Furthermore, when it rejects an input, it provides a short cycle as a certificate. The problem of testing cycle-freeness in this model was first considered by Goldreich and Ron [13]. They give a constant time tester with two-sided error (it does not provide certificates for rejection) and prove a Ω (√ n) <b>lower</b> bound for <b>testers</b> with one-sided error. We design a property tester with one-sided error whose running time matches this lower bound (upto polylogarithmic factors). Interestingly, this has connections to a recent conjecture of Benjamini, Schramm, and Shapira [3]. The property of cycle-freeness is closed under the operation of taking minors. This is the first example of such a property that has an almost optimal Õ(√ n) -time one-sided error tester, but has a constant time two-sided error tester. It was conjectured in [3] that this happens for a vast class of minor-closed properties, and this result can seen as the first indication towards that. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} testing 3 -colorability in the bounded-degree model. A 3 -colorability tester is an algorithm A that is given oracle access to the adjacency list representation of a graph G of maximum degree d with n vertices; A is required to, say, accept with probability at least 2 / 3 if G is 3 -colorable, and to accept with probability at most 1 / 3 if G is ɛ-far from 3 -colorable (meaning that at least an ɛ fraction of edges must be removed from G to make it 3 -colorable); there is no requirement on A in the remaining cases. If A accepts 3 -colorable graphs with probability one, then {{it is said to}} have one-sided error. For sufficiently small ɛ, the testing problem is NP-complete, so it is unlikely that polynomial-time, or even sub-exponential time testers exist. In this paper we are interested in unconditional lower bounds on query complexity. The strongest known lower bound is due to Goldreich and Ron, who show that, for small enough ɛ, every tester must have query complexity Ω (√ n). In this paper we show unconditionally that, for small enough ɛ, every tester for 3 colorability must have query complexity Ω(n). This is the first linear lower bound for testing a natural graph property in the bounded-degree model. For one-sided error testers, we also show an Ω(n) <b>lower</b> bound for <b>testers</b> that distinguish 3 -colorable graphs from graphs that are (1 / 3 − α) -far from 3 -colorable, for arbitrarily small α.
