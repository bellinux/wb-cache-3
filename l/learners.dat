5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English <b>learners</b> {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin <b>learners.</b> This early noun bias in English <b>learners</b> is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E

In {{six out of}} six experiments, <b>learners</b> who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} to recall the structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than <b>learners</b> whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when <b>learners</b> are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the <b>learner</b> model ontology and <b>learner</b> model agent in a multi-agent architecture of learning support systems. The <b>learner</b> model ontology facilitates 1) sharable specification of the functionalities of <b>learner</b> model agent; 2) fluent communication between the <b>learner</b> model agent and other agents. The example of a <b>learner</b> model ontology and <b>learner</b> model agent shows that {{with the help of}} ontology, a standard for sharable and reusable agents in learning support systems may be established. The goal of the research presented in this paper is to exemplify the benefit of the <b>learner</b> model ontology through the development of an ontology-based <b>learner</b> model agent and the exchange of information between the <b>learner</b> model agent and other agents...|$|R

30|$|By a Deep <b>Learner</b> Model (DLM) we mean {{extending}} the core <b>learner</b> model to track {{not only what}} a <b>learner</b> knows, but also what the <b>learner</b> knows about their knowing, {{how they feel about}} their learning, their desires and motivations, the learning strategies they employ, and how they interact socially with others. A DLM also incorporates <b>learner</b> preferences and broader <b>learner</b> characteristics such as accessibility and the need for assistive technologies.|$|R
25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the <b>learners</b> are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between <b>learners</b> and tasks in the shaping of meaning. <b>Learners</b> compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow <b>learners</b> to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that <b>learners</b> and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sometimes, {{gathered}} {{information from}} tracking <b>learner</b> interactions is not precise. In fact, existing e-learning systems only know {{the number of}} previewed pages precisely. They can deduce that how much the <b>learner</b> is mastered using some <b>learner's</b> characteristics such as time of doing exercises {{and the number of}} mistakes. But these deductions may be not precise. Because the time of doing exercises depends on <b>learner's</b> emotional states and environmental conditions. Thus we have introduced a new concept as two-partial <b>learner</b> model. Our proposed model divides <b>learner</b> model into two parts: Permanent <b>Learner</b> Model (PLM) and Temporary <b>Learner</b> Model (TLM). In the two-partial <b>learner</b> model, system's deductions are placed in the TLM at first. Then, system should validate accuracy of these deductions. Valid deductions are used in the updating of PLM for making them usable in other sessions. Otherwise, they should be ignored. Two-partial <b>learner</b> model is suitable for example-based educational systems. Because these systems are making deductions about the <b>learner</b> based on his/her interactions with the system...|$|R
40|$|The tutor tries, {{by using}} feedbacks, {{to keep the}} <b>learner’s</b> {{attention}} and to increase his motivation and then his performance.

It depends essentially on the <b>learner’s</b> traits and it is reflected in the <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction. Consequently, it is important to detect the <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction following the tutor’s intervention in order to personalize the feedback type. Our proposal consists of a methodology, based on machine learning technique, able to predict the <b>learner’s</b> emotional reaction starting from the analysis of descriptive variables of the <b>learner’s</b> current situation, such as: personality, motivation and tutor’s feedback type...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Open <b>learner</b> models (OLM) are <b>learner</b> models {{which are}} {{accessible}} to the <b>learner,</b> allowing them to view, and sometimes modify, their model. This openness may raise questions of <b>learner</b> trust in their <b>learner</b> model: if users do not agree with, or trust the information they can see about themselves, their trust in the interaction will likely be reduced. Using a Wizard-of-Oz approach, we consider <b>learner</b> trust and possibilities for developing trust in OLMs. ...|$|R

Ethical issues (for example, relating to climate change, consumerism, economic globalisation, fair trade, migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, terrorism, war) are also addressed. <b>Learners</b> are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. <b>Learners</b> also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Open <b>learner</b> models (OLM) {{enable users}} to access their <b>learner</b> model to view {{information}} about their understanding. Opening the <b>learner</b> model to the <b>learner</b> may increase their perceptions of how a system evaluates their knowledge and updates the model. This raises questions of trust relating to whether the <b>learner</b> believes the evaluations are correct, and whether they trust {{the system as a}} whole. We investigate <b>learner</b> trust in various OLM features: the complexity of the model presentation; the level of <b>learner</b> control over the model contents; and the facility to release one's own model for peer viewing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Maintaining a {{model of}} the <b>learner’s</b> {{understanding}} as they interact with an e-learning environment allows adaptation to the <b>learner’s</b> educational needs. An Open <b>Learner</b> Model makes this machine's representation of the <b>learner</b> available to them. Typically, the state of the <b>learner's</b> knowledge is presented in some form, ranging from a simple overall mastery score, to a detailed display of how much and what the <b>learner</b> appears to know, their misconceptions and their pro-gress through a course. This means that an Open <b>Learner</b> Model provides a suitable interface onto the <b>learner</b> model for use by the <b>learner,</b> and in some cases for others who support their learning, including peers, parents and teachers. This chapter considers some of the similarities between the goals of supporting and encouraging metacognition in intelligent tutoring systems and learning in general, and the benefits of opening the <b>learner</b> model to the user. We provide examples of two important classes of open <b>learner</b> models: those within a particular teaching system and those that are first-class citizens with value independently of a teaching system. The chapter provides a foundation for understanding the range of ways that Open <b>Learner</b> Models have already been used to support learning as well as directions yet to be explored, with reference to encouraging meta-cognitive activity and self-directed learning. ...|$|R
