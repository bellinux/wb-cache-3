The last one was cool, but I didn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it wasn't funky. When I don't work on a project, it's not that funky. When I do work on it, it's funky, and it has soul to it...I'm proud of my funky sounds right now." [...] Fanatik J was not named as the album's producer. Thornton stated that with Dr. Octagonecologyst, Thornton had given Nakamura his first successful album as a producer, and that with The Return of Dr. Octagon, he would [...] "make another person and create another star." ...|$|E
500|$|The Badmotorfinger logo {{consists}} of a jagged, cyclone-like design. In {{the center of the}} logo is a triangle with the album's title, containing a spark plug. The album's cover art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of {{off the top of my}} head. I simply <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Disney {{began to}} {{consider}} producing a sequel, {{but rather than}} using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. [...] "I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind," [...] Burton explained. [...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} <b>like</b> <b>it...</b> <b>Because</b> it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it." [...] The 2004 video game [...] did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice, and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.|$|E

Lyrically, [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja" [...] revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective, with Arjona singing [...] "She loves me either if i gor as a guerrilla, or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does't care if i'm last or first, if i'm going as a conformist or as tenacious."

500|$|Smith's first album, Faryl, was {{recorded}} at Air Studios, London, in December 2008, during Smith's Christmas holiday; it was completed on 3 January 2009 and features a 60-piece orchestra. Smith described the song [...] "River of Light" [...] {{by saying that}} The Blue Danube [...] "music now has words put to it. I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's different. Everyone knows the tune and everybody has got high hopes for it." [...] Smith said that her favourite song on the album was her version of the Welsh hymn, [...] "Calon Lân". Other songs include Smith's version of [...] "Amazing Grace", a cover of John Denver's [...] "Annie's Song", and a version of [...] "The Way Old Friends Do", rewritten for Smith by Björn Ulvaeus. Smith spoke about the song, saying [...] "It was about divorce ... They didn't think it was appropriate for me to sing about that, so Björn changed the lyrics so it's about friendship." [...] The album was produced by Jon Cohen, who had previously worked with artists including the Operababes and Vanessa Mae.|$|E
500|$|... "Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay. Frusciante notes that the sound is [...] "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. If you listen to the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't sound <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the effects." ...|$|E
5000|$|Giné {{has often}} proclaimed the band's music as [...] "punk parranda", which {{translates}} as [...] "punk party".

It features a 60-piece orchestra, which {{was recorded}} at Air Studios, in London. The album includes the song [...] "River of Light". The track is a recording of The Blue Danube, a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II, with newly written lyrics.

500|$|In the {{interlude}} {{before the}} first encore, U2 had a worried discussion over the introduction to [...] "Miss Sarajevo". [...] The song had only been played once prior—at a benefit concert in 1995 with Bono, The Edge, Eno, and Pavarotti. They returned to the stage and played [...] "Discothèque", [...] "If You Wear That Velvet Dress", [...] "With or Without You", and a rough version of [...] "Miss Sarajevo". Pavarotti {{was not at the}} concert to sing his part and so an antique gramophone was brought onto the stage in his place. Eno came on stage to sing backing vocals, and Bono invited Nogić on stage during the chorus. During the song, the video screen showed images from Carter's Miss Sarajevo documentary, including footage of the girls taking part in the beauty contest and the banner reading [...] "Please don't let them kill us". Bono apologized for the rocky performance {{at the end of the}} song, saying [...] "Sarajevo, this song was written for you. I hope you <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> we can't fucking play it." [...] The concert concluded with a second encore of [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me", [...] "Mysterious Ways", [...] "One", and an abbreviated cover of [...] "Unchained Melody".|$|E
500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} magazine Films of the Golden Age (Fall 2015), Young revealed about the radio program: [...] "I never quite <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> had to have laughs.

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{was very}} pleased with the episode, stating that it was [...] "a very good and well-acted episode. I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it {{actually}} seemed too real to me. It played less as a paranormal science fiction show than as whether or not something could really happen. The entire cast was wonderful. Overall that was a terrific episode". In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lazarus" [...] was rated a C+, being described as [...] "as exciting as Scully's taste in men (not very)". The episode's supporting cast, however, was described as [...] "solid". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated episode a B-, finding that it had [...] "no real thematic resonance". He found that the episode left its premise [...] "largely unexplored", and would have benefited from a stronger focus on the relationship between the characters of Willis and Dupre. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, feeling that it [...] "wasn't up to much", and that it [...] "plays more like an episode of [...] than anything else". However, the exploration of Scully's character history was cited as a positive aspect of the episode. Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, was critical of [...] "Lazarus", stating that its opening scene was [...] "the only good part" [...] of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they going to <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it."

500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told me I should listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E

However, the system was also large and complex. The flexibility of the Open Transport architecture, into which one could plug any desired protocol, was felt by some to be thoroughly overcomplicated. Additionally, most Unix code still used sockets, not STREAMS, and so MacTCP offered real advantages in terms of porting software to the Mac.|$|R

Of the album's title, Rossdale said, [...] "I just <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> kind of sexy enough, it's powerful, it's one word.
