5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, and at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> vessel {{suffered}} structural damage. Although {{it is included}} in the Weather Prediction Center's publication, Texas Hurricane History, {{little is known about the}} nature of the storm.|$|E
5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part of at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> individual. The skull was only partially preserved, {{and the fact that}} the vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{perceived}} threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted by at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Dukovac was the top-scoring Croatian {{pilot of}} World War II. During his life, {{there was much}} {{controversy}} surrounding {{the exact number of}} aircraft that he had downed. Croatian wartime documents discovered in the Military History Institute in Belgrade after his death show that the ZNDH credited him with 44 confirmed kills. At <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> source indicates a tally of 40 confirmed kills with five unconfirmed. The ZNDH total of 44 included 18 LaGG-3s, 12 Ilyushin Il-2s, three P-39s, two DB-3s, two Yak-1s, and one each of the following aircraft; II-16, MiG-3, Spitfire, La-5, Yak-9, Pe-2, and A-20. The ZNDH records also noted one unconfirmed claim.|$|E
5|$|In the Outer Hebrides {{all of the}} {{inhabited}} {{islands are}} now connected to at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> island by a land transport route, but only four Inner Hebridean islands are connected by road, all to the mainland. The Clachan Bridge from Argyll to Seil was designed by Thomas Telford and dates from 1792. Skye has been connected to Kyle of Lochalsh by the Skye Bridge since 1995. Danna is also connected to the Tayvallich peninsula in Argyll by a stone causeway; and tiny Eilean Donan, dominated by its castle, has had {{a connection to the}} mainland perhaps from as early as the 13th century. The arched bridge in use today was constructed in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Phillip, 58, and his wife, Nancy Garrido, 54, of Antioch, {{were arrested}} by police for {{kidnapping}}, imprisonment, and sexual assault. On April 28, 2011, they {{pleaded guilty to}} Dugard's kidnapping and sexual assault. Law enforcement officers believe Dugard was kept in concealed tents, sheds, and lean-tos in an area behind the Garridos' house in Antioch for 18 years. During this time, Dugard bore two daughters who were ages 11 and 15 {{at the time of}} her reappearance. On June 2, 2011, Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; his wife, Nancy, received 36 years to life. Garrido is a person of interest in at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> San Francisco Bay Area missing person case.|$|E

5|$|Saari {{initially}} {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} students taking a business studies exam, and entered at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> classroom. According to the three students who were able to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 students taking the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them. It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly. He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room alight.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{frequently}} {{received attention}} in the 1980s and 1990s due to his atheism activism. He filed lawsuits against numerous American municipalities, against the Boy Scouts of America in 1997, and against Township High School District 214 in 2007 for what he considered unconstitutional endorsements of religion. He was involved in numerous other lawsuits, of which at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> went to the Supreme Court in the late 2000s. After 10 years of membership in American Atheists, he formed his own organization, Rob Sherman Advocacy.|$|E
5|$|The habitat {{includes}} {{various kinds}} of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. Oryzomys species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a gestation period of 21 to 28days, about four young are born. Species of Oryzomys are infected by numerous parasites and carry at least three hantaviruses, one of which (Bayou virus) also infects humans. Two, maybe three, species have gone extinct {{over the last two}} centuries and at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and O.couesi are not threatened.|$|E

5|$|The known {{material}} {{includes two}} cervical vertebrae, nine dorsal vertebrae, a few ribs, {{a fragment of}} a pubis, and many gastroliths. Of the material, only the vertebrae are diagnostic, with the ribs and pubis being too fragmentary or general to distinguish Dinheirosaurus. This material was first described as in the genus Lourinhasaurus, but differences were noticed and in 1999 Bonaparte and Mateus redescribed the material under the new binomial Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis. Another specimen, ML 418, thought to be Dinheirosaurus, is now known to be from another Portuguese diplodocid. This means that Dinheirosaurus lived alongside many theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans and ornithopods, {{as well as at}} <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> diplodocid.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of hybridisation between homo sapiens and other human species of the genus Homo. In 2010, the Neanderthal genome project showed that 1–4% of DNA from all people living today, apart from most Sub-Saharan Africans, are of Neanderthal heritage. Analyzing the genomes of 600 Europeans and East Asians found that combining them covered 20% of the Neanderthal genome {{that is in the}} modern human population. Ancient human populations lived and interbred with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> extinct Homo species. Thus, Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA has been incorporated into human DNA by introgression.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} for at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise {{in the value of}} their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

5|$|At <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> AJ-2 was {{purchased}} {{and used as}} a water bomber before it {{was purchased}} in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting to separate from the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} major Mayan {{languages}} have been confidently identified in hieroglyphic texts, with at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> language probably identified. An archaic language variety known as Classic Maya predominates in these texts, {{particularly in the}} Classic-era inscriptions of the southern and central lowland areas. This language is most {{closely related to the}} Ch'olan branch of the language family, modern descendants of which include Ch'ol, Ch'orti' and Chontal. Inscriptions in an early Yucatecan language (the ancestor of the main surviving Yucatec language) have also been recognised or proposed, mainly in the Yucatán Peninsula region and from a later period. Three of the four extant Maya codices are based on Yucatec. It has also been surmised that some inscriptions found in the Chiapas highlands region may be in a Tzeltalan language whose modern descendants are Tzeltal and Tzotzil. Other regional varieties and dialects are also presumed to have been used, but have not yet been identified with certainty.|$|E
5|$|Like Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas {{was not a}} Catholic at {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} to the Court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Roman Catholic seminary, but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the Court. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Alito became the fifth on the Court, and the eleventh in the history of the Court. Alito's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Roman Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the Court.|$|E

50|$|A {{composite}} {{number is}} a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying together two smaller positive integers. Equivalently, it {{is a positive}} integer that has at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> divisor <b>other</b> than 1 and itself. Every positive integer is composite, prime, or the unit 1, so the composite numbers are exactly the numbers that are not prime and not a unit.|$|R
5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|Traits of O.hammondi that {{supported}} the latter placement include: a relatively short palate that does not extend behind the maxillary bones; simple posterolateral palatal pits; absence of a capsular process (a raising of the bone of the mandible, or lower jaw, at {{the back end of}} the incisor); and presence of the posteroloph on the upper third molar (a crest {{at the back of the}} tooth). In these characters, O.hammondi differs from many or most Oryzomyini and is similar to some species outside Oryzomyini, but all traits of O.hammondi are present in at <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> member of the tribe. Traits shared by O.hammondi and Oecomys included: tail with the same coloration above and below (unicolored); parietal bones extending to the sides of the skull; narrow zygomatic plate, without a zygomatic notch; posteroloph present on upper third molar; mesoflexus (a valley in the molar crown in front of the mesoloph crest) on upper second molar not divided in two.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander got close to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At <b>least</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
