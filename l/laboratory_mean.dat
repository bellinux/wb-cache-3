40|$|The use of calibrants {{properly}} characterized {{with respect}} to identity and purity is an important requirement to achieve accurate, reliable results in chemical measurements. In particular, in generating data that contribute to assigning a property value to a certified reference material (CRM), compromises often made for routine measurements (non-verification of calibrant purity) are unacceptable, and strict adherence to calibrant quality requirements is indispensable. We compared two approaches to calibration {{within the framework of}} laboratory intercomparisons for assigning values to two recently released CRMs in the veterinary drug-residue field, namely chloramphenicol in pork (ERM-BB 130) and oxytetracycline in milk (ERM-BB 492). First, all laboratories used the same calibrant (common calibrant, a commercially available substance, extensively characterized for purity and identity), and second, each laboratory used its in-house calibrant (commercially available substance, purity as indicated by the provider). The laboratories, mostly accredited to ISO/IEC 17025, used validated methods based on gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Each measurement series included two calibration curves, one with the common calibrant, and one with the in-house calibrant. For both materials, when the common calibrant was used, the mean of accepted <b>laboratory</b> <b>mean</b> values was 7 % and 4 % lower for BB 130 and BB 492, respectively. This shows the impact on accuracy and hints at an overestimation of the purity of the in-house calibrants. Moreover, when the common calibrant was used, the variation among the <b>laboratory</b> <b>mean</b> values in the intercomparisons decreased by 9 % (BB 130) and 39 % (BB 492), respectively. The smaller uncertainty from the characterization study resulted in a lower expanded uncertainty of the certified values (4 % lower for BB 130, and 7 % lower for BB 492, compared to using in-house calibrants). The use of a common calibrant thus significantly affects and improves the accuracy and provides the basis for a proper metrological traceability statement for the certified values in the CRMs. JRC.

Perceptions of poor access at an academic pulmonary function laboratory prompted analysis of system demand and capacity to identify factors contributing to poor access. Methods. Surveys and interviews identified stakeholder perspectives on operational processes and access challenges. Retrospective data on testing demand and resource capacity was analyzed to understand utilization of testing resources. Results. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that stakeholder groups had discrepant views on access and capacity in the <b>laboratory.</b> <b>Mean</b> daily resource utilization was 0. 64 (SD 0. 15), with monthly average utilization consistently less than 0. 75.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{differentiation}} of {{white blood cells}} is a worldwide-accepted method to obtain medical information. The conventional microscopic differential, however, is a laborious and expensive test with a low statistical value. Especially for band cell identification {{there is a wide}} range of variance. In this report we describe the intervariability of band cell enumeration. METHODS: From a septic patient, an EDTA anti-coagulated blood sample was obtained and a smear was made and stained (May-Grunwald Giemsa). A PowerPoint presentation was made twice of 100 random cells and sent to 157 different hospital laboratories in the Netherlands for a leukocyte differential. In the first survey neutrophils were differentiated in segmented and band neutrophils whereas in the second survey no discrimination was made between segmented and band neutrophils. RESULTS: The first survey was responded by 68 % of the laboratories (756 individuals) and the second survey by 73 % of the laboratories (637 individuals). The <b>laboratory</b> <b>mean</b> values of the segmented neutrophils were 42. 9 % (SD: 7. 8, range 22 - 64 %) and 69. 9 % (SD: 1. 4, range 62 - 72 %) for the first and second survey respectively.

Results: Peak local pain was higher in two of the three subjects (2. 5, 4. 0, 9. 5) than the average pain ratings in 34 healthy age-matched (21 – 27 years old) women from our <b>laboratory,</b> <b>mean</b> 3. 0 / 10 (standard deviation (SD) 2. 2; range 0. 5 to 10). Peak referred pain was also higher in the same two subjects (0, 4. 25, and 7. 5) than the average of the controls (mean 1. 5; SD 1. 8; range 0 – 9. 0). Similarly, vulvar pain patients all exhibited greater mechanical pain sensitivity (lower PPT values) than the average of the healthy controls (mean [SD] 246. 3 [101. 7] kPa in patients vs. 431. 3 [109. 33] in controls). Conclusion: Preliminary data suggests women with vestibulodynia may exhibit greater generalized pain sensitivity to noxious stimuli than the general population of women...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) results between 2003 and 2013 {{suggest that}} the {{variation}} in respirable crystalline silica analysis is much smaller {{today than it was}} in the period 1990 - 1998, partly because of a change in sample production procedure and because the colorimetric method has been phased out, although quality improvements in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) or infrared (IR) methods may have also played a role. There is no practical difference between laboratories using XRD or IR methods or between laboratories which are accredited or those which are not. Reference <b>laboratory</b> <b>means</b> (assigned values) are not different from the means of all participants across the current range of mass loading, although there is a small difference in variance in the ratios of all participants to reference <b>laboratory</b> <b>means</b> based on method because the reference laboratories are much more likely to use XRD than are the others. Matrix interference does not lead to biases or substantially larger variances for either XRD or IR methods. Data from proficiency test sample analyses that include results from poorly performing laboratories should not be used to determine the validity of a method. PAT samples are not produced below 40 and variance may increase with lower masses, although this is not particularly predictable. PAT data from lower mass loadings will be required to evaluate analytical performance if exposure limits are lowered without change in sampling method. Task-specific exposure measurements for periods shorter than a full shift typically result in lower mass loadings and the quality of these analyses would also be better assured from being within the range of PAT mass loadings. High flow rate cyclones, whose performance has been validated, can be used to obtain higher mass loadings in environments of lower concentrations or where shorter sampling times are desired.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} anti-GM 1 titres are raised in polyneuropathies of unknown origin and whether determination of these titres is useful for diagnosing these conditions. The study population comprised 20 controls (aged 36 - 88 years), 12 patients with polyneuropathies of known origin (aged 31 - 81 years) and 15 patients with polyneuropathies of unknown origin (aged 40 - 77 years). Antibody levels were measured using a commercial GM 1 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit (Buehlmann <b>Laboratories).</b> <b>Mean</b> anti-GM 1 IgG and IgM antibody titres were not raised in patients with polyneuropathies of unknown origin. Anti-GM 1 IgG antibody titres were raised in one and GM 1 IgM antibody titres in none of the patients with polyneuropathies of unknown origin. In conclusion, GM 1 antibody levels are rarely raised in polyneuropathies of unknown origin and probably play a minor role in the pathogenesis of these conditions...|$|R
