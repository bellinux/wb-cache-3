5000|$|<b>Linagliptin</b> {{belongs to}} a class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the hormone {{incretin}} from being degraded, allowing insulin {{to be released from}} the pancreatic beta cells. While incretin remains in the blood stream, the pancreas is stimulated to produce more insulin. Meanwhile, glucagon release from the pancreas is staggered, preventing glucose level increase. In other words, <b>linagliptin,</b> along with diet and exercise, can help the body produce more insulin and lower blood glucose. Managing blood sugar can mean a lower HbA1c, an index for glycemia control that theoretically correlates with glucose level in the blood. However, the use of HbA1c to predict diabetes in patients can sometimes be limited due to other external factors, such as blood transfusion, acute blood loss, or drug interference.|$|E

Voglibose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor but also increases glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1). Exendin- 4 is a GLP- 1 receptor agonist. Male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were dosed for 3 days, fasted overnight and a sucrose/glucose tolerance test was performed. <b>Linagliptin</b> (1 mg/kg po) improved glucose tolerance by increasing plasma GLP- 1 (active) and insulin secretion, whilst having no effect on body weight.

The combination of <b>linagliptin</b> and voglibose significantly reduced body weight, improved glycaemic control and reduced plasma insulin compared to <b>linagliptin</b> alone. Furthermore, <b>linagliptin</b> plus voglibose produced a marked increase in GLP- 1 (active) at 5 min post-sucrose, compared to <b>linagliptin,</b> possibly because <b>linagliptin</b> prevented the degradation of GLP- 1 secreted in response to voglibose.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Metformin is the first-choice {{drug in the}} {{management}} of type 2 diabetes. However, most patients require a combined therapy to reach and/or maintain targets of glucose control. Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors offer new options for combined therapy with metformin. <b>Linagliptin</b> shares a similar pharmacodynamic (PD) profile with other gliptins, but has a unique pharmacokinetic (PK) profile characterized by negligible renal excretion. AREAS COVERED: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the potential PK/PD interactions between <b>linagliptin</b> and metformin. They are not prone to PK drug-drug interactions. The two compounds may be administered together, either separately or using a fixed-dose combination (FDC) as shown by bioequivalence studies. The addition of <b>linagliptin</b> in patients not well controlled with metformin alone has proven its efficacy in improving glucose levels with a good safety profile. Initial co-administration of <b>linagliptin</b> plus metformin improves glucose control more potently than either compound separately, without hypoglycemia, weight gain or increased metformin-related gastrointestinal side effects. EXPERT OPINION: The <b>linagliptin</b> plus metformin combination may offer some advantages over the classical sulfonylurea-metformin combination. Even if <b>linagliptin</b> is safe in patients with renal impairment, the use of metformin (and thus of the <b>linagliptin</b> plus metformin FDC) is still controversial in this population.

40|$|AbstractDipeptidyl {{peptidase}} (DPP) - 4 {{plays an}} important role in endothelial cell biology. We have shown that the DPP- 4 inhibitor <b>Linagliptin</b> can inhibit the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and ameliorate diabetic kidney fibrosis associated with the suppression of DPP- 4 protein levels via the induction of miR- 29. The current study demonstrated that such effects of <b>Linagliptin</b> on endothelial cell profibrotic programs were drug-specific but not class effects. In the cell-free system, both <b>Linagliptin</b> and Sitagliptin inhibited recombinant DPP- 4 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. <b>Linagliptin</b> can inhibit all of the following: DPP- 4 activity and protein level, integrin β 1 protein levels, EndMT, and DPP- 4 3 ′UTR activity; Sitagliptin, however, inhibited none of these in the current study. Additionally, TGF-β 2 induced both the induction of VEGF-R 1 and the suppression of VEGF-R 2 levels in endothelial cells, and both were inhibited by <b>Linagliptin</b> but not by Sitagliptin. miR- 29, the miR that negatively regulates the 3 ′UTR of DPP- 4 mRNA, was suppressed by TGF-β 2 and restored by <b>Linagliptin</b> but not by Sitagliptin. Following the overexpression of pCMV-DPP- 4 -GFP and pCMV 6 -Myc-DPP- 4 in endothelial cells, the proximity of Myc-DPP- 4 and DPP- 4 -GFP was suppressed by <b>Linagliptin</b> but not by Sitagliptin, suggesting that only <b>Linagliptin</b> inhibited the homo-dimer formation of DPP- 4 in endothelial cells; this difference in activity between the two gliptins could explain their diverse effects on endothelial cell biology.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor <b>linagliptin</b> 5 mg when given for 24 weeks to patients with type 2 diabetes who were either treatment-naive or who had received one oral antidiabetes drug (OAD). Methods: This multicentre, randomized, parallel group, phase III study compared <b>linagliptin</b> treatment (5 mg once daily, n = 336) with placebo (n = 167) for 24 weeks in type 2 diabetes patients. Before randomization, patients pretreated with one OAD underwent a washout period of 6 weeks, which included a placebo run-in period during the last 2 weeks. Patients previously untreated with an OAD underwent a 2 -week placebo run-in period. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1 c from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment. Results: <b>Linagliptin</b> treatment resulted in a placebo-corrected change in HbA 1 c from baseline of - 0. 69 % (p < 0. 0001) at 24 weeks. In patients with baseline HbA 1 c ≥ 9. 0 %, the adjusted reduction in HbA 1 c was 1. 01 % (p < 0. 0001). Patients treated with <b>linagliptin</b> {{were more likely to}} achieve a reduction in HbA 1 c of ≥ 0. 5 % at 24 weeks than those in the placebo arm (47. 1 and 19. 0 %, respectively; odds ratio, OR = 4. 2, p < 0. 0001). Fasting plasma glucose improved by - 1. 3 mmol/l (p < 0. 0001) with <b>linagliptin</b> vs. placebo, and <b>linagliptin</b> produced an adjusted mean reduction from baseline after 24 weeks in 2 -h postprandial glucose of - 3. 2 mmol/l (p < 0. 0001). Statistically significant and relevant treatment differences were observed for proinsulin/insulin ratio (p = 0. 025), Homeostasis Model Assessment-%B (p = 0. 049) and disposition index (p = 0. 0005). There was no excess of hypoglycaemic episodes with <b>linagliptin</b> vs. placebo and no patient required third-party intervention. Mild or moderate renal impairment did not influence the trough plasma levels of <b>linagliptin.</b> Conclusions: Monotherapy with <b>linagliptin</b> produced a significant, clinically meaningful and sustained improvement in glycaemic control, accompanied by enhanced parameters of β-cell function.

40|$|Introduction: Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors {{offer new}} {{options for the}} {{management}} of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM). The novel compound <b>linagliptin</b> has important different pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, when compared with previously commercialized DPP- 4 inhibitors, which may offer some advantages in clinical practice. <b>Linagliptin</b> has a unique PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile and is the first DPP- 4 inhibitor with a nonrenal elimination route. Therefore, it can be administered in patients with renal impairment without dose adjustment or monitoring of renal function. The drug has a low potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and no clinically relevant ones were reported so far. Areas covered: An extensive literature search was performed to analyse primarily PK and secondarily PD characteristics of <b>linagliptin</b> in both healthy volunteers and patients with T 2 DM (treated with <b>linagliptin</b> as monotherapy or combined therapy). Updated information about <b>linagliptin</b> PK either after single administration (large dose range) or after chronic administration (steady state) were also included. A special focus has been put on DDIs and on PK/PD of <b>linagliptin</b> in patients with renal impairment. Expert opinion: Head-to-head comparative studies and/or increased clinical experience with DPP- 4 inhibitors will determine the clinical advantage, if any, of one agent over another.

40|$|AbstractPurposeDipeptidyl {{peptidase}} (DPP) - 4 inhibitors are {{an increasingly}} used antihyperglycemic therapy {{for patients with}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). <b>Linagliptin,</b> an orally administered DPP- 4 inhibitor, has demonstrated favorable efficacy/safety in clinical trials. The aim of this post hoc pooled analysis was to expand current knowledge of the safety of <b>linagliptin.</b> MethodsSafety data for once-daily <b>linagliptin</b> 5 mg (1 study of <b>linagliptin</b> 2. 5 mg twice daily) were analyzed from 22 randomized, double-blind, Phase I–III, placebo-controlled clinical trials of ≤ 102 weeks’ duration. Assessments of pooled data included incidence of patient-reported adverse events (AEs). FindingsData from 7400 patients (<b>linagliptin,</b> 4810; placebo, 2590) were pooled. Most patients (58. 4 %) had T 2 DM diagnosis for > 5 years; approximately 75 % were receiving ≥ 1 type of background therapy in addition to linagliptin/placebo. Overall exposure to the study drug was 2412. 8 years for <b>linagliptin</b> and 1481. 4 years for placebo (mean [SD], 183 [120] days and 209 [150] days, respectively). Overall frequencies of AEs were similar for linagliptin- and placebo-treated patients (57. 3 % and 61. 8 %, respectively). The incidence of neoplastic AEs was low (0. 6 % and 0. 9 %, respectively); there were no reports of pancreatic neoplasia. Pancreatitis was observed in 2 linagliptin-treated patients (< 0. 1 %) and 1 placebo-treated patient (< 0. 1 %). The occurrence of cardiac disorder AEs was similar in linagliptin- and placebo-treated patients (3. 2 % [n = 153] and 3. 3 % [n = 83], respectively); the incidence of heart failure AEs for linagliptin- and placebo-treated patients was 0. 2 % (n = 11) and 0. 3 % (n = 7), respectively. Overall, <b>linagliptin</b> was weight neutral. Occurrence of investigator-defined hypoglycemic AEs was low for both <b>linagliptin</b> and placebo (11. 5 % vs 14. 0 %). In patients receiving concomitant sulfonylurea therapy, investigator-defined hypoglycemic AEs were more frequent with <b>linagliptin</b> versus placebo (22. 1 % [238 / 1079] vs 14. 5 % [61 / 421], respectively). Subgroup analyses showed similar frequencies of AEs for linagliptin- and placebo-treated patients across different age groups and renal function levels. ImplicationsThis updated and expanded pooled, post hoc analysis of 22 placebo-controlled trials of <b>linagliptin</b> 5 mg daily supports previous findings of the acceptable overall safety/tolerability profile of <b>linagliptin</b> when administered to {{a broad range of}} patients with T 2 DM. Linagliptin-treated patients demonstrated a low overall risk of hypoglycemia (risk increased by concomitant sulfonylurea therapy). As with all pooled analyses, this study is limited by the use of data from different studies, and the relatively short duration of some included studies, although use of individual patient data from consistently designed trials should minimize methodological differences between trials. Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide additional insight into the long-term safety/tolerability of <b>linagliptin...</b>|$|E
