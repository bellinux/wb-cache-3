50|$|<b>Lonidamine</b> is a {{derivative}} of indazole-3-carboxylic acid, which {{for a long}} time, {{has been known to}} inhibit aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. It seems to enhance aerobic glycolysis in normal cells, but suppress glycolysis in cancer cells. This is most likely through the inhibition of the mitochondrially bound hexokinase.

50|$|Overexpression of ANT2 {{has been}} linked to tumor cell growth and {{attributed}} to its anti-apoptotic function. One study found that specific silencing of the ANT2 gene failed to induce apoptosis to tumor cells without a combining treatment with <b>lonidamine,</b> an anti-tumor drug, thus indicating that additional factors may be involved to mediate membrane permeability and programmed cell death. According to a study by Oishi et al., knockdown of ANT2 upregulated DR5, resulting in Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, studies by Ji-Young Jang et al. confirmed the effectiveness of silencing ANT2 in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma using small hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Thus, ANT2 inhibitors could contribute to anticancer therapies.|$|E
40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel is {{blocked by a}} broad range of organic anionic compounds. Here we investigate the effects of the indazole compound <b>lonidamine</b> on CFTR channels expressed in mammalian cell lines using patch clamp recording. Application of <b>lonidamine</b> to the intracellular face of excised membrane patches caused a voltage-dependent block of CFTR currents, with an apparent Kd of 58 μM at − 100 mV. Block by <b>lonidamine</b> was apparently independent of channel gating but weakly sensitive to the extracellular Cl− concentration. Intracellular <b>lonidamine</b> led to the introduction of brief interruptions in the single channel current at hyperpolarized voltages, leading to a reduction in channel mean open time. <b>Lonidamine</b> also introduced a new component of macroscopic current variance. Spectral analysis of this variance suggested a blocker on rate of 1. 79 μM− 1 s− 1 and an off-rate of 143 s− 1. Several point mutations within the sixth transmembrane region of CFTR (R 334 C, F 337 S, T 338 A and S 341 A) significantly weakened block of macroscopic CFTR current, suggesting that <b>lonidamine</b> enters deeply into the channel pore from its intracellular end. These results identify and characterize <b>lonidamine</b> as a novel CFTR open channel blocker and provide important information concerning its molecular mechanism of action...|$|E

40|$|<b>Lonidamine</b> is a {{substituted}} indazole {{carboxylic acid}} {{with a unique}} mechanism of action and early clinical studies have reported anti-tumour activity. In a phase II study 32 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer were given <b>Lonidamine</b> in a daily divided oral dose of 600 mg. Of 28 patients evaluable for response, three (11 %) achieved a partial response (4 - 24 + months) and three (11 %) a minor response. Two patients have stable disease (greater than 3 months) and 20 progressed. Toxicity was very mild. Sixteen (53 %) of 31 patients had myalgia which lasted a median of 2 weeks. This was investigated with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in four patients but the changes were unrelated {{to the degree of}} myalgia. No other major side-effect was seen, and no dose reduction was required. <b>Lonidamine</b> pharmacokinetics have been investigated in 17 patients 1 month after the start of therapy. <b>Lonidamine</b> was detected in the plasma of all patients, but there was no clear relationship between <b>Lonidamine</b> levels and clinical response or toxicity. <b>Lonidamine</b> appears to be active against advanced breast cancer and its low toxicity would allow combination studies with chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lonidamine,</b> a dichlorinated {{derivative}} of indazole- 3 -carboxylic acid, {{was shown to}} {{play a significant role}} in reversing or overcoming multidrug resistance. Here, we show that exposure to 50 microg/ml of <b>lonidamine</b> induces apoptosis in adriamycin and nitrosourea-resistant cells (MCF- 7 ADR(r) human breast cancer cell line, and LB 9 glioblastoma multiform cell line), as demonstrated by sub-G 1 peaks in DNA content histograms, condensation of nuclear chromatin, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, we find that apoptosis is preceded by accumulation of the cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, <b>lonidamine</b> fails to activate the apoptotic program in the corresponding sensitive parental cell lines (ADR-sensitive MCF- 7 WT, and nitrosourea-sensitive LI cells) even after long exposure times. The evaluation of bcl- 2 protein expression suggests that this different effect of <b>lonidamine</b> treatment in drug-resistant and -sensitive cell lines might not simply be due to dissimilar expression levels of bcl- 2 protein. To determine whether the lonidamine-induced apoptosis is mediated by p 53 protein, we used cells lacking endogenous p 53 and overexpressing either wild-type p 53 or dominant-negative p 53 mutant. We find that apoptosis by <b>lonidamine</b> is independent of the p 53 gene...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{interest in}} <b>lonidamine</b> {{is related to}} its ability to enhance the cytotoxic effects of several DNA-damaging anti-tumour agents. This study was undertaken {{to better understand the}} in vivo interaction between <b>lonidamine</b> and cisplatin in the treatment of human tumour xenografts, including three carcinoma models characterized by a different responsiveness to cisplatin, in spite of the presence of a wild-type p 53 gene in all tumours. The drug combination was more effective in tumour growth inhibition than cisplatin alone against MX- 1 breast carcinoma and A 2780 ovarian carcinoma, both highly responsive to cisplatin, whereas no influence of ionidamine was observed on anti-tumour activity of cisplatin in the treatment of the relatively resistant IGROV- 1 ovarian carcinoma. As cisplatin activity is related to induction of apoptosis, the modulation of drug-induced apoptosis by <b>lonidamine</b> was investigated. Under conditions in which <b>lonidamine</b> itself had negligible effects on tumour growth and apoptosis, the modulating agent stimulated the apoptotic response induced by cisplatin in the responsive but not in the resistant tumours. Tumour response was dependent not only on the drug activation of apoptosis, but mainly on the persistence over time of the event. In the breast carcinoma MX- 1, hypersensitive to cisplatin and to the lonidamine+cisplatin combination, the efficacy of drug treatment was associated with phosphorylation of bcl- 2 followed by down-regulation of the protein. <b>Lonidamine</b> itself caused a delayed phosphorylation of bcl- 2. These results are consistent with the interpretation that <b>lonidamine</b> is effective in modulating biochemical factors involved in regulation of apoptosis...|$|E

40|$|Abnormal {{metabolism}} {{is another}} cancer hallmark. The two most characterized altered metabolic pathways are {{high rates of}} glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which are natural targets for cancer therapy. Currently, a number of newer compounds to block glycolysis and glutaminolysis are being developed; nevertheless, <b>lonidamine</b> and 6 -diazo- 5 -oxo-L-norleucine (DON) are two old drugs well characterized as inhibitors of glycolysis and glutaminolysis, respectively, whose clinical development was abandoned {{years ago when the}} importance of cancer metabolism was not fully appreciated and clinical trial methodology was less developed. In this review, a PubMed search using the words <b>lonidamine</b> and 6 -diazo- 5 -oxo-L-norleucine (DON) was undertaken to analyse existing information on the preclinical and clinical studies of these drugs for cancer treatment.

40|$|We {{assessed}} the activity and tolerability of a cisplatin, epirubicin, and <b>lonidamine</b> combination regimen as first-line chemotherapy in 28 advanced breast cancer patients. The schedule of treatment was as follows: 60 mg/ m 2 epirubicin followed by 40 mg/m 2 cisplatin given on days 1 and 2 every 21 days, with 450 mg <b>lonidamine</b> being given per os (three tablets) on days of chemotherapy administration {{and in the}} period intervening between one cycle and the next. Patients received a median of 5 (range 1 - 6) cycles. Overall, 22 patients were evaluable for response and 28, for toxicity. Four patients refused to continue the treatment after the first course, one was lost to follow-up, and one died due to toxicity (septic shock). The incidence of grade 3 / 4 nausea and vomiting {{was found to be}} greater than that expected with epirubicin and <b>lonidamine</b> alone. The addition of cisplatin resulted in an increase in platelet and hemoglobin toxicities, whereas the WBC toxicity did not differ from that expected with epirubicin and <b>lonidamine.</b> The hematological toxicity was found to be cumulative, leading to treatment delay in about 50 % of patients at the fifth and sixth courses. The activity of this cytotoxic regimen was noteworthy, with the overall response rate being 81. 8 % (31. 8 % complete responses and 50. 0 % partial responses) in evaluable patients. This response rate decreased to 64. 2 % when all registered patients were included according to an intent-to-treat analysis. In conclusion, the association of cisplatin, epirubicin, and <b>lonidamine</b> given on the schedule described herein, appears to be very active but substantially toxic.

A marked variability in cellular response to a 1 -h treatment with the individual anticancer agents was observed. The concentrations able to inhibit SW 13 cell proliferation by 50 % (IC 50) were 0. 45 microg/ml and 0. 4 microg/ml for doxorubicin and epidoxorubicin, respectively, thus indicating a relative sensitivity to anthracyclines.

Here, we demonstrate that the apoptotic action of ATO is greatly increased when combined with subcytotoxic curcumin concentrations in U 937 and HL 60 human acute myeloid leukemia cells, and with lower efficacy in K 562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Curcumin exerts similar cooperative effect with the mitochondria-targeting drug <b>lonidamine,</b> whereas the response is negligible in combination with the DNA-targeting drug cisplatin. Curcumin plus ATO or <b>lonidamine</b> stimulates typical events of the mitochondrial executioner pathway (Bax and Bid activation, cytochrome c release, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis down-regulation, and caspase- 9 /- 3 activation) and causes mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation, which nevertheless represents a late event in the apoptotic response. Curcumin increases anion superoxide production, and its proapoptotic action in combination with ATO and <b>lonidamine</b> is mimicked by pro-oxidant agents (2 -methoxyestradiol and H(2) O(2)) and prevented by antioxidant agents [Mn(III) tetrakis(4 -benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride and N-acetyl-l-cysteine]. Within the assayed time period (16 - 24 h), curcumin does not significantly modify p 38 -mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun NH(2) -terminal kinase phosphorylation/activation or nuclear factor-κB activity, but it greatly stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and decreases Akt phosphorylation. Experiments using mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK inhibitors [2 '-amino- 3 '-methoxyflavone (PD 98059) and 1, 4 -diamino- 2, 3 -dicyano- 1, 4 -bis(2 -aminophenylthio) butadiene (U 0126) ] and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase inhibitor 2 -(4 -morpholinyl) - 8 -phenyl- 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one (LY 294002) indicate that ERK activation does not mediate and even restrains apoptosis potentiation, whereas Akt down-regulation facilitates apoptosis generation. In summary, cotreatment with curcumin may represent a useful manner of increasing the efficacy of ATO and <b>lonidamine</b> as antitumor drugs in myeloid leukemia cells.
