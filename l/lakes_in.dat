5|$|The Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} was {{the most}} recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> North America because their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers.|$|E

5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} formed of {{sediment}} which deposited during the various Missoula Floods, around 16,450 to 13,750BCE, {{and during the}} Bonneville Flood that occurred in approximately 12,500BCE.

The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Ohio State's dental school in 1945, Horvath signed {{to play for}} the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League. Horvath, however, applied for a {{commission}} to join the U.S. Navy and was sworn in as a lieutenant j.g. that August. He was sent at first to Naval Station Great <b>Lakes</b> <b>in</b> Illinois for training, where he practiced dentistry and acted as an assistant to Brown, who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team. Horvath served in Hawaii and coached a football team there that won a service national championship. He later traveled on assignment as far as China as a naval dental officer.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} {{at the edge of}} <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E

Near Golden Lake and the Golden Lake National Forest Campground, FFH16 and US Highway 2 (US2) intersect. FFH16 continues north and curves to the northwest around the end of Golden Lake. The routing of the road provides access to several more <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> rural Iron County such as Paint, Silk and Hehe lakes, as well as an older routing of US2, before crossing into southern Houghton County.|$|E

5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes {{incident}} of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice <b>Lakes.</b> <b>In</b> turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in exchange for their prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate. Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland <b>lakes</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|Lake Calhoun, a lake of the Chain of <b>Lakes</b> <b>in</b> Minneapolis, {{was named}} after Calhoun by {{surveyors}} sent by Calhoun during his tenure as Secretary of War to map the area around Fort Snelling in 1817.

Bde Maka Ska in the Dakota language means White Banks Lake.|$|E

Most of the watershed is developed, but there are still a few undeveloped reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|M-137 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan {{that serves as a}} spur route to the Interlochen Center for the Arts and Interlochen State Park.
