In <b>layered</b> <b>networks,</b> each failure {{at the lower}} layer may lead to multiple failures at the upper layer. We generalize the classical polynomial expression for network reliability to the multi-layer setting. Using random sampling techniques, we develop polynomial time approximation algorithms for the failure polynomial. Our approach gives an approximate expression for reliability {{as a function of}} the link failure probability, eliminating the need to resample for different values of the failure probability. Furthermore, it gives insight on how the routings of the logical topology on the physical topology impact network reliability. We show that maximizing the min cut of the (<b>layered)</b> <b>network</b> maximizes reliability in the low failure probability regime. Based on this observation, we develop algorithms for routing the logical topology to maximize reliability. I...|$|R

5000|$|In 2008-09, {{concerned}} about the rapidly growing demand for cloud computing, the IT industry was contemplating converting the prevalent multi-rooted tree based network topology, of oversubscribed data center networks, to a fat tree topology or to a non-blocking full bisection bandwidth clos topology. The difficulty was that re-hauling these networks with complex aggregate <b>layer</b> <b>network</b> switches, as required in a fat tree network topology, or with thousands of simpler commodity network switches inter-connected with miles of wires as required in a clos network topology, was very expensive. In a study of a production mega data center, published in Oct. 2009, Bahl, Kandula, and Padhye showed that barring a few outliers, traffic demands could be met in existing, slightly-oversubscribed data center networks. Then, to manage the outliers, they augmented the small (i.e. low port density) network switches, {{commonly referred to as}} top-of-the-rack or ToR switches, which connect the server racks {{to the rest of the}} network, with extremely high frequency point-to-point radio frequency links. [...] Notwithstanding concerns about link reliability due to interference, they used these short range, highly directional links advantageously, exploiting frequency_reuse to light-up many links concurrently and interference-free at multi-Gbps rates. The steerable radio beams provided additional inter-rack capacity on an as needed bases thus relieving congestion hot-spots. By building such a network, they became the first researchers to introduce mm-wave (60 GHz) wireless communications in data centers. Three years later, their invention was covered by the New York Times in an article published on Jan. 14, 2012 titled “A wireless road around data traffic jams.” Others have followed up on their seminal work by developing similar networks.|$|E
