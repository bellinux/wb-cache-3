5|$|The {{precursor}} to Kyle produced torrential rainfall over Puerto Rico, resulting in six fatalities and $48million in damages. <b>Little</b> <b>impact</b> {{was recorded in}} Hispanola and Bermuda as the system tracked northward. Along the eastern United States, rough seas resulted in two fatalities and as the storm made landfall in Canada, heavy rains fell in eastern Maine. In Canada, Kyle had relatively <b>little</b> <b>impact,</b> leaving $9million in damages and no fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, {{the storm had}} relatively <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E

While crossing Cuba {{and later the}} Bahamas, the storm caused <b>little</b> <b>impact,</b> limited to some crop damage.

5|$|Tropical Storm Elena brought {{flooding}} to the Greater Houston area, {{with five}} deaths and about $10million in damage. However, <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> was reported elsewhere. Hurricane Henri remained offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and disrupted efforts {{to stop the}} Ixtoc I oil spill. Henri also caused flooding in portions of Mexico. In mid and late-September, a tropical depression caused flooding in the Southern United States, especially Texas. Four deaths were reported, two in Texas and two in Kentucky. Toward the end of October, a brief subtropical storm struck Newfoundland, but left <b>little</b> <b>impact.</b> Other than Tropical Depression One and the tropical depression that brought flooding to the Southern United States in mid and late-September, {{none of the other}} depressions caused significant effects of land. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season resulted in $4.63billion in damage and at least 2,136deaths. Pacific Storm Blanca originated in the basin.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{developed over}} the central Atlantic Ocean on August30 and ultimately affected Bermuda with heightened tides as it passed to the east. Elsewhere, the hurricane had <b>little</b> <b>impact,</b> becoming extratropical on September5. After the third system, a series of four tropical depressions formed, but failed to become severe. The fourth hurricane brought devastation to Jamaica, Cuba, and portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially western parts of the Florida Panhandle. Overall, the storm left six deaths and inflicted at least $170,000 (1917USD) in damage.|$|E

His debut in first-class cricket came later that season for Somerset County Cricket Club at Tunbridge Wells, when he was 20 years old. Against Kent in late August, he scored 14 and 0 batting as part of the middle order, and claimed his only two wickets in first-class cricket. He made one other appearance in 1884, against Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had <b>little</b> <b>impact,</b> it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E
5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E

The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse's Globe colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall sketches, and a play, Brother Alfred. Wodehouse {{would return to the}} character in short stories over the next six decades.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final match. However, he was not {{prominent}} in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among the frontline bowlers who played in four or more Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. Johnson had <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but took five catches in the slips.|$|E

40|$|We utilize T-jump UV {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy (UVRR) {{to study}} the impact of ion binding on the equilibrium energy landscape and on (un) folding kinetics of poly-l-lysine (PLL). We observe that the relaxation rates of the folded conformations (including π-helix (bulge), pure α-helix, and turns) of PLL are slower than those of short alanine-based peptides. The PLL pure α-helix folding time {{is similar to that}} of short alanine-based peptides. We for the first time have directly observed that turn conformations are α-helix and π-helix (bulge) unfolding intermediates. ClO 4 - binding to the Lys side chain -NH 3 + groups and the peptide backbone slows the α-helix unfolding rate compared to that in pure water, but <b>little</b> <b>impacts</b> the folding rate, resulting in an increased α-helix stability. ClO 4 - binding significantly increases the PLL unfolding activation barrier but <b>little</b> <b>impacts</b> the folding barrier. Thus, the PLL folding coordinate(s) differs from the unfolding coordinate(s). The-π helix (bulge) unfolding and folding coordinates do not directly go through the α-helix energy well. Our results clearly demonstrate that PLL (un) folding is not a two-state process. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R
