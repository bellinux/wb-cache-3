2500|$|The {{success of}} forming is in {{relation}} to two things, the flow and stretch of material. [...] As a die forms a shape from a flat sheet of metal, {{there is a need}} for the material to move into the shape of the die. [...] The flow of material is controlled through pressure applied to the blank and lubrication applied to the die or the blank. [...] If the form moves too easily, wrinkles will occur in the part. [...] To correct this, more pressure or <b>less</b> <b>lubrication</b> is applied to the blank to limit the flow of material and cause the material to stretch or set thin. [...] If too much pressure is applied, the part will become too thin and break. [...] Drawing metal requires finding the correct balance between wrinkles and breaking to achieve a successful part.|$|E

5000|$|Model diesels have {{variable}} compression ratios. This variable compression {{is achieved}} by a [...] "contra-piston," [...] {{at the top of}} the cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed [...] "T-bar". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead center is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the compression ratio (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly.There also exist model diesels with fixed compression heads. A few examples are the British 5cc OWAT or the American DRONE.These engines have a fixed compression ratio, but the compression can be altered slightly with the use of more or <b>less</b> <b>lubrication</b> oil in the fuel.Also the engine's load affects the compression and ignition timing.Larger propellers give a longer combustion time and so higher compression.Smaller propellers reduce the load, and therefore the compression pressure build up, which changes the ignition timing to earlier.|$|E

50|$|An {{array of}} {{firearms}} accessory makers have offered gas piston conversion kits for the M4. The claimed benefits include <b>less</b> needed <b>lubrication</b> for the bolt carrier group to run reliably and reduced fouling. The argument against it is increased weight and reduced accuracy. The Enhanced M4 uses an articulating link piston operating system.|$|R
5000|$|Before Zerk {{fittings}} existed, bearings were lubricated {{in various}} other ways that {{tended to be}} more maintenance-intensive and often provided <b>less</b> effective <b>lubrication.</b> For example, a typical machinery bearing of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a plain bearing with a cross-drilled hole to receive oil or grease, with no clever fitting at its mouth, or at best a cap or cup. Often lubricant was delivered under no more pressure than gravity or a finger push might provide. For example, oil was gravity-fed into the hole, or grease was pushed in. Grease guns to feed the grease with higher pressure existed, but their pre-Zerk fittings were not as good for making clean, sealed contact easily, and they were less widely used than today.|$|R
50|$|The Prosser Twin Cylinder {{freight car}} was {{intended}} to revolutionize the transport of grain by carrying it in two enormous iron cylinders about 8½ feet long and 6½ feet in diameter, each revolving on an axle running through its center, {{at the ends of}} which were the journal boxes. Effectively, the car would possess no superstructure, and instead the cargo would be carried inside the car's axles themselves. Steel tires, flanged and fitted to the gauge of track, were put around the cylinders, which served as the wheels of the car. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company developed a system of air brakes specifically for this type of freight car.The prototype car underwent trials on the CB&Q Railroad, making six round trips of 200 miles each, carrying the grain magnificently and supposedly turning it {{out at the end of}} each trip one grade better than when it was first loaded. Railroad personnel were satisfied with it, since there was said to be no trouble in passing curves, frogs and switches. In addition, the car required <b>less</b> <b>lubrication</b> than conventional cars, and experienced significantly less rolling resistance due to a lower dead weight and a lower center of gravity. Due to the extremely large large wheel diameter, track wear was reduced. Due to its all-iron construction, the car was even supposedly fireproof. Despite all these advantages, the Prosser Twin Cylinder design was eventually deemed too radical, and was never replicated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Independently of {{the choice}} of refrigerant, {{environmental}} and/or safety issues can be minimized by reducing leakage {{and the amount of}} refrigerant charge in heat pump or refrigeration systems, preferably both. In the investigation reported here, a laboratory test rig was built, simulating a water-to-water heat pump with a heating capacity of 5 kW. The system was designed to minimize the charge of refrigerant mainly by use of minichannel aluminium heat exchangers and a compact system design. It was shown that the system could be run with 200 g of propane at typical domestic heat pump operating conditions without reduction in the heating coefficient of performance (COP 1) compared with a traditional design. Additional charge reduction is possible by selecting proper compressor lubrication oils or by employing a compressor simply using <b>less</b> <b>lubrication</b> oil...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the problems with miction, defecation, and sexuality after a radical hysterectomy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy for the treatment of cervical cancer stage I-IIA. This study included an observational longitudinal study of self-reported bladder, defecation, and sexual problems with a baseline score. Ninety-four women were included in the study. An age-matched control group consisted of 224 women. The patients showed significantly more negative effects on sexual function compared with both the controls and their situation before the treatment throughout 24 months of follow-up. The problems included <b>less</b> <b>lubrication,</b> a narrow and short vagina, senseless areas around the labia, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. Up to 12 months after the treatment, the patients complained significantly more of little or no urge to urinate and diarrhea as compared with the controls. Adjuvant radiotherapy did not increase the risk of bladder dysfunction, colorectal motility disorders, and sexual functions. We conclude that a radical hysterectomy for the treatment of early-stage cervical carcinoma is associated with adverse effects mainly on sexual functionin...|$|E
50|$|Not all {{automobile}} {{engines are}} suitable for use with LPG as a fuel. LPG provides <b>less</b> upper cylinder <b>lubrication</b> than petrol or diesel, so LPG-fueled engines {{are more prone to}} valve wear if they are not suitably modified. Many modern common rail diesel engines respond well to LPG use as a supplementary fuel. This is where LPG is used as fuel as well as diesel. Systems are now available that integrate with OEM engine management systems.|$|R
5000|$|While {{young women}} may become sexually aroused quite easily, and reach orgasm {{relatively}} quickly {{with the right}} stimulation in the right circumstances, there are physiological and psychological changes to women's sexual arousal and responses as they age. Older women produce <b>less</b> vaginal <b>lubrication</b> and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and fantasies, sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, {{and the ability to}} reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after menopause. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status. It is therefore seen as important always to understand the [...] "context of women's lives" [...] when studying their sexuality.|$|R
5000|$|The LD9 Twin Cam was a 146 cuin L Quad 4 variant with balance shafts, and a {{redesigned}} {{cylinder head}} which debuted in 1996. In the mid-nineties, these engines, like their earlier 2.3L counterparts, were known for timing chain failures, {{as well as}} water pump failures, in which the water pumps were often difficult and costly to access and replace. They also had very small oil passages, making for <b>less</b> than adequate <b>lubrication,</b> and costly engine repairs if not maintained properly. Bore was decreased from 92 mm to 90 mm and stroke increased from 85 mm to 94 mm for better torque. Power came in at [...] This engine received a minor update halfway through the 1999 model year that eliminated the exhaust gas recirculation, increased the compression ratio from 9.5:1 to 9.7:1, and switched from low impedance fuel injectors to high impedance. For increased reliability this engine also saw other minor updates in the 2000s {{towards the end of}} its use in General Motors vehicles. In 2001, changes included a smaller knock sensor, flat-top pistons instead of dished, new oiling passages, newer stronger timing chain, a newer-designed water pump, a redesigned starter motor and a higher capacity catalytic converter. An improved belt tensioner was introduced in 2002.|$|R
