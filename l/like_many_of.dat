5|$|Cory Edwards {{chose to}} {{approach}} the film predominantly as an action/comedy, instead of as a typical animated film, and wrote the script to appeal to audiences of any age <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the films produced by Pixar or Disney.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Valois, Isabeau was an appreciative art collector. She loved {{jewels and}} was {{responsible}} for the commissions of particularly lavish pieces of ronde-bosse—a newly developed technique of making enamel-covered gold pieces. Documentation suggests she commissioned several fine pieces of tableaux d'or from Parisian goldsmiths.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the final}} film for {{director}} Edwards, who died the following year, {{and was one of}} the last produced at Fox Film's New York studio. Contemporary reviews were generally positive. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} to his Jewish origins is displayed both {{in his life}} and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a {{good state of repair}} and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the appeal}} of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and not seeing much {{opportunity}} to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in the final weeks of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, he did not see combat in it. Unfamiliar with the intricasies of Polish politics, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.|$|E
5|$|Formed on 13 November 1939 at Redbank Camp, Brisbane, the 2/9th Battalion was {{the first}} of four {{infantry}} battalions raised in Queensland for the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Initially assigned to the 6th Division, the battalion formed part of the 18th Brigade, along with the 2/10th, 2/11th and 2/12th Battalions. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel James Eric Gifford Martin, formerly of the 42nd Battalion, a Militia battalion based in Rockhampton. The majority of the battalion's officers were drawn from the Militia; although, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd AIF units, it was initially supplied with a Regular officer to serve in the role as adjutant.|$|E

5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun. The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox origin', <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the other weapons produced {{for use by the}} Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E
5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to {{be divided into two}} Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, MacArthur became Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, which Chief of Staff Peyton March felt {{had become}} {{out of date}} in many respects and was much in need of reform. Accepting the post allowed MacArthur to retain his rank of brigadier general, instead of being reduced to his {{substantive}} rank of major <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries. When MacArthur moved into the superintendent's house with his mother in June 1919, he became the youngest superintendent since Sylvanus Thayer in 1817. However, whereas Thayer had faced opposition from outside the Army, MacArthur had to overcome resistance from graduates and the academic board.|$|E

5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Verne's novels, {{the play}} is deeply imbued with themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and transformative journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially trapped by obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> her Rothschild {{relatives}} she {{was also}} deeply involved with the welfare of young working-class women of the Jewish faith who inhabited the poorer areas of London, in particular Whitechapel. There she founded the Club for Jewish Working Girls. She also donated to numerous other charities connected with Jewish causes. However, {{within a week of}} her death her husband began to cancel many of these subscriptions, prompting charges of antisemitism.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

The company has established a preference for purchasing eggs and pork-based products from those suppliers that use cage-free production methods.|$|E

In 1970 their first son, Alexander, was born and in 1972 their second son, Patrick. On 5 May 2009, Alexander, a restaurateur, was found dead at his home. He was thirty-nine. At an inquest on 10 June 2009 the Westminster coroner declared that he had died due to non-dependent drug abuse.|$|E
