50|$|Cosimo's elder son, Ferdinando, {{was not yet}} of <b>legal</b> <b>maturity</b> {{to succeed}} him, thus Maria Maddalena and his grandmother, Christina of Lorraine, acted as regents. Their {{collective}} regency {{is known as the}} Turtici. Maria Maddelana's temperament was analogous to Christina's, and together they aligned Tuscany with the Papacy, re-doubled the Tuscan clergy, and allowed the heresy trial of Galileo Galilei to occur. Upon the death of the last Duke of Urbino (Francesco Maria II), instead of claiming the duchy for Ferdinando, who was married to the Duke of Urbino's granddaughter and heiress, Vittoria della Rovere, they permitted it to be annexed by Pope Urban VIII. In 1626, they banned any Tuscan subject from being educated outside the Grand Duchy, a law later overturned but resurrected by Maria Maddalena's grandson, Cosimo III. Harold Acton, an Anglo-Italian historian, ascribes the decline of Tuscany to the Turtici regency.|$|E

50|$|By the 1990s, there {{remained}} about 3,000 {{survivors and}} a large group formed to start a campaign. They called themselves the Duplessis Orphans after Maurice Duplessis, the Premier of Quebec during that time whose government was responsible for their plight. In addition to government and Church responsibility, the College of Physicians of Quebec came under fire after some of the orphans found copies of their medical records that had been falsified. Labelled as mentally deficient, {{many of these children}} were subjected to electroshock, a variety of drug testing and used in other medical experiments.

50|$|The {{definition}} and determination of maturity {{has been applied}} to the issue of criminal responsibility of juvenile offenders and to a number of legal ages. The age of majority, the most broadly applied legal threshold of adulthood, is typically characterized by recognition of control over oneself and one's actions and decisions. The most common age threshold is 18 years of age, with thresholds ranging from 14 to 21 across nations and between provinces. Although age of majority is referred to as a jurisdiction's legal age, the legal ages of various other issues of <b>legal</b> <b>maturity</b> like sexual consent or drinking and smoking ages are often different from the age of majority.Aside from age-based thresholds of maturity, restrictions based in a perceived intellectual immaturity also extend to those with a variety of mental impairments (generally defined as anyone with a mental disability that requires guardianship), with laws in place in most regions limiting the voting rights of the mentally disabled and often requiring the judgment of a court to declare fitness. Similar to those restrictions placed on children, persons with mental disabilities also have freedoms restricted and have their rights assigned to parental guardians.|$|E

On 3 October 1856, today's {{lower part of the}} building was consecrated by Cardinal Joseph Othmar von Rauscher of the Immaculate Conception, which had just been proclaimed a Roman Catholic faith dogma. The house was occupied by 68 pupils. In 1857, the building was expanded by the present part of the gate and a mirrored part of the rectory. In 1858/59 the three-storey {{building of the}} hostel (today's Gymnasium) was completed. In 1875 a large fire from the former workshops destroyed part of the building. In {{the last quarter of the}} nineteenth century reconstructions were carried out, the reconstruction of the hostel and rectory as well as the construction of the music-house with a gymnasium before the hostel. The first edition of the Schulzeitschrift Kalksburger Korrespondenz was published in 1886. In 1897, the school received the right to publicize all classes as well as the <b>legal</b> <b>maturity</b> tests, after it had already been granted the public right for the first three classes in 1891. From 1902 until his death in 1931, Fr. Anton Straub served as chaplain and theologian there. In 1904 :de:Karl Maria von Andlau, S.J., (1865-1935) became the rector of the house. He later became the Jesuit Provincial Superior and a confidant of the Emperor Charles I of Austria.After the Anschluss in 1938 the Jesuit College was dissolved by the National Socialists. Until 1945, a police school was housed in the {{main building}}. The occupying troops after the Second World War left the house in 1947. In the autumn of the same year classes resumed, but from 1948 to 1951 part of the collegiate building was still used by the Red Army. In July 1954, the first post-war matriculation was held. The first half-years were in 1964, the year with the lowest number of pupils (241) after the war. In 1968 the Father General of the Jesuits Pedro Arrupe visited Kalksburg, the same year the Jesuit Stella Matutina College in Feldkirch was closed. Significant changes were undertaken under the rector Rudolf Reichlin-Meldegg (even Old kalksburger). More recent directors of the gymnasium have been Erich Schmutz (1969-1994), Walter Schauer (1994-2004), and Michael Dobes (2004- [...] ).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Professionals {{treating}} {{adolescents with}} cancer must communicate well {{with them and}} their parents. Evidence suggests that the communication needs of this population are rarely met. Skills training can improve professional communication, but {{has been criticized for}} not being based on the experience {{of the participants in the}} clinical encounter. We took a multiperspective approach, drawing on perspectives of former adolescents with cancer, patients' parents, physicians, and nurses with the aim to provide suggestions for improvement in communication in adolescent cancer care. METHODS Adolescent cancer survivors (n = 16), parents (n = 8), pediatric oncologists (n = 12), and pediatric oncology nurses (n = 18) participated in 11 focus groups. They discussed their experiences communicating with each other. Transcripts were analyzed by thematic analysis. RESULTS We identified themes within the following sections: (1) The framework in which professionals communicate with adolescents with cancer (regression in a time of detachment, adolescents' perception and knowledge of illness, cognitive versus <b>legal</b> <b>maturity,</b> "lost in transition" between pediatric and adult oncology); (2) communication difficulties between professionals and patients and parents (professionals and patients/parents identified the other party as the source of difficulties), and (3) effective professional communication (there was some overlap on how doctors and nurses should communicate, along with substantially different expectations for the two professions). CONCLUSIONS The framework within which professionals communicate, the different perspectives on the factors that make communication difficult, and the different expectations regarding good communication by doctors and nurses should be considered when communication skills training courses are developed for professionals who work in adolescent oncology...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test {{different}} theories on debt maturity {{that can be}} ascribed to either the demand or the supply side of the market. Firm risk, asymmetric information, agency costs are all aspects {{that should be considered}} in the analysis. We also include leverage in the firm decision process regarding debt maturity, relying on a simultaneous equations approach. Among Italian industrial firms, theories based on lenders using debt maturity to address information problems and default risk seem to have strong explanatory power. The demand side of the market appears to be less important in determining debt maturity. The role of the supply side of the market is confirmed when considering legal enforcement of loan contracts. Where legal enforcement is low, the negative consequences of asymmetric information are worse for lenders and this explains why they give more importance to asymmetric information proxies in determining debt maturity. corporate finance, debt <b>maturity,</b> <b>legal</b> enforcement...|$|R
40|$|Insights from {{developmental}} psychology provide a useful perspective {{from which to}} understand why young people might engage in higher levels of antisocial behavior than adults. They can also be useful in term of highlighting which aspects of development result in young people making less mature judgments. Yet despite this extensive body of knowledge, there is no psychological or <b>legal</b> definition of <b>maturity</b> {{that can be applied}} to legal decision making. Within a criminal context, investigations of adolescent immaturity have emphasized cognitive factors, influenced by the informed consent model which places a premium on factors such as “knowledge” and “competence”, with an emphasis on cognitive functioning (e. g., thinking, reasoning, and understanding). This approach has been criticized for failing to adequately illustrate differences between adolescent and adult decision making. This paper reviews the notion of psychological maturity and comments on the importance of a broader assessment that includes psychosocial factors {{in the face of a}} growing trend in many jurisdictions to transfer juvenile offenders to the adult jurisdiction based on the severity of crime committed rather than their level of culpability. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{awareness}} {{as a set}} {{of social}} attitudes to crime and criminals, punish and mainly to the law, law enforcement, judicial and penal systems today is the most relevant topic. Despite the decline in crime in recent years, the level of crime is still at a high level. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of the <b>legal</b> disciplines on <b>maturity</b> of <b>legal</b> awareness. We tested the hypotheses that the level of legal development in law-oriented students is higher than that of other students. We revealed that in legal psychology students, legal awareness is more formed than in the students of educational psychology. In particular, such a level of legal awareness as law-making, is more pronounced in students of legal psychology. We also suggested that students of legal psychology demonstrate a creative approach to the law. The results showed that students of educational psychology prefer to take a proactive legal and civic position, and students of legal psychology treat the law as a dynamic system. The study involved 30 students, whose average age was 21 years. The techniques used were focused on the level of legal awareness, as well as on the value orientation. The study revealed that students studying in the law-oriented departments, are more predisposed to move to a higher level of legal awareness. ...|$|R
40|$|Across {{numerous}} {{areas of}} the law — including family law, criminal law, labor law, health law, and other fields — when children are involved, maturity determinations are pivotal to outcomes. Upon reaching maturity, an individual has access {{to a range of}} rights not previously available and is expected to fulfill certain duties. Despite the central importance of maturity, the law’s approach to it has been to consider the concept in a piecemeal and issue-specific fashion. The result is a <b>legal</b> construct of <b>maturity</b> that is anything but consistent or coherent. For example, every state has a minimum age below which a child is considered not mature enough to consent to sex. However, if money is involved, more than forty states deem that child mature enough to have consented to sex for money and be charged with the crime of prostitution (even if the money is paid to a pimp and the child never sees it). This Article seeks to undertake a holistic assessment of the law’s approach to maturity. Markers of maturity in the law frequently occur at different points in time. Children are deemed mature enough to participate in the polity (e. g., vote) at a different age from when they are deemed mature enough to exercise independent economic power (e. g., work), control their own bodies (e. g., engage in consensual sex), or assume adult social responsibilities (e. g., drink alcohol in public places). In short, the law provides little clear guidance on how maturity should be understood and treated. Recent research on brain development and the work of cognitive psychologists provide some answers. To date, however, a significant consideration has been largely overlooked: cultural conceptions of maturity. Thus, this Article seeks to incorporate cultural perspectives on maturity into the dialogue. More broadly, this Article aims to bring some clarity to the issue of maturity and examine whether cultural practices can inform the legal, policy, and moral questions in the law’s approach to maturity...|$|R
