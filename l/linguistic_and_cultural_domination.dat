40|$|Due {{to their}} small numbers and {{historical}} domination by others, the Khoesan {{groups in the}} southern African region {{are among the most}} marginalized and endangered communities in Africa (Batibo, 1998; Chebanne & Nthapelelang, 2000; Smieja, 2003). This situation has also led to their <b>linguistic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>domination</b> and an associated dilemma: on the one hand, the speakers of these minority languages wish to use and safeguard their linguistic and cultural heritage and identity; on the other hand, they desire to use other languages to enable wider communication and socioeconomic advancement. This study examined this dilemma among Khoesan youth in three villages in the Central Kalahari and Ghanzi areas of western Botswana. The primary aim {{of the study was to}} determine the extent to which ambivalence regarding linguistic and cultural options has affected the use of, attitudes toward, and attachment to languages and identities. The study focused on two Khoesan languages: Naro, a Central Khoesan language spoken in the Ghanzi sub-district, and !X坦探, a Southern Khoesan language spoken in south Central Kalahari. This study found that, in general, the youth in these communities preferred to use other languages and even altered their cultural and autonymic identity for socioeconomic reasons...|$|E
40|$|By {{the end of}} this century, {{according}} to Unesco, more than 3000 languages people {{in various parts of the}} world use for communications today will disappear. In Indonesia, Unesco notes that 137 local languages are in the state of endangeredment. The causes for such a cultural change are varied from geographical to political, from sociological to <b>linguistic,</b> <b>and</b> from philosophical to pragmatic. An important aspect of the extinction of a language is the disappearance of certain philosophical <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> values contained in the language expressions which are very relevant with the dynamics of the society needing more effective instruments for maintaining its identity against globalization values. With all the background in mind, this paper tries to investigate a number of steps a multilingual country like Indonesia could possibly take to enhance the preservation of indigenous languages by researching their philosophical <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> values <b>and</b> formulating policies for future action plans. The basic assumption is that in every language there are living values the speakers believe and maintain from time to time. However, time changes and the language changes, too, to cope with, among other things, newer values coming from outside and the need to be accepted in wider communities. In the process of exchanging <b>linguistic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> phenomena <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> submission take place as a consequence. Therefore, dominating languages would place a certain language as a receiver of the exchange and this is where the state of endangeredment begins. In cooperation with international organizations like Unesco and local universities the government must take an initial plan to maintain the submitting language from further unexpected situations. The big number of Indonesian endangered local languages necessitates attentions from the central government to make a national campaign for preserving indigenous languages thorugh a more intregrated national cultural strategy. This must be the first test case for the combination of educational <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> affairs under a new ministerial roof. ...|$|R
