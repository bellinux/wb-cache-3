25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, after DNA testing {{had become more}} prominent, the LAPD formed a new unit, which <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{forensic}} evidence collected from the department's cold case files to determine whether any had the potential for new leads through DNA testing. Among the evidence seen as likely to do so was that collected from the Rasmussens' residence. However, {{it was not until}} 2004 that another criminalist, Jennifer Butterworth, was able to analyze it.|$|E

25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger looked through {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had found the right actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't remember exactly which was the one he liked. Eichinger <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tape and found {{what he thought was a}} suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

He <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Prelinger Archives to find a film which matched the mood he wanted for the Chroma Key album. One of the first films he found was the social {{guidance}} film Age 13. [...] "It was kind of rich for musical accompaniment and the cinematography and everything is really beautiful, kind of surreal," [...] Moore said. The film served as Moore's main inspiration and source of audio samples.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{versions}} of the story of how Lennon and Ono first met. [...] According to the first account, on November 9, 1966 Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. [...] When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> spyglass and saw the word [...] "YES" [...] which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was [...] "anti" [...] everything.|$|E

500|$|The rescuers, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt to force open the van with hatchets, sledgehammers, and crowbars, called upon Police Sergeant Brett, who {{was inside the}} van with the prisoners, to open the door. Brett refused, {{so one of the}} rescuers placed his revolver at the keyhole of the van to blow the lock, just as Brett <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> keyhole {{to see what was happening}} outside. The bullet passed through his eye into his brain and killed him. The door was opened when one of the women prisoners took the keys from Brett's pocket, and passed them through a ventilator to the Fenians outside, allowing Kelly and Deasy to escape. Brett was the first Manchester police officer to be killed on duty, in an incident that became known locally as the [...] "Manchester Outrages".|$|E
500|$|Talking about {{bringing}} {{the character of}} Franklin Hall from the comics to the series, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said that the writers had <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> comics for a character to fill the episode's role, and felt that Hall had an interesting history. Subsequently, changes were made to fit the comics character into the existing role for the series, and he ultimately appears in an origin story-type role rather than as the fully formed supervillain from the comics. As a hint at his potential to become the villain [...] "Graviton" [...] in the future, the series changed his original scientific interests from matter transportation {{to the study of}} [...] "gravitonium", a substance created for the episode. The episode's ending, which sees Hall fall into some gravitonium, indicates that this is how he gains his Graviton abilities in the series.|$|E
500|$|They then built a six-foot (1.8m) {{wind tunnel}} in their shop and between October and December 1901 {{conducted}} systematic tests {{on dozens of}} miniature wings [...] The [...] "balances" [...] they devised and mounted inside the tunnel to hold the wings looked crude, made of bicycle spokes and scrap metal, but were [...] "as critical to the ultimate success of the Wright brothers as were the gliders." [...] The devices allowed the brothers to balance lift against drag and accurately calculate the performance of each wing. They could also see which wings worked well as they <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> viewing window {{in the top of}} the tunnel. The tests yielded a trove of valuable data never before known and showed that the poor lift of the 1900 and 1901 gliders was entirely due to an incorrect Smeaton value, and that Lilienthal's published data were fairly accurate for the tests he had done.|$|E

500|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Yellow Pages {{for jobs}} and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. He said {{when he heard the}} two gunshots, he <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window and saw a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him to tell him about the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E

2500|$|At a later time, a famine {{struck the}} land of Israel and Isaac moved his family, upon God's command, to Gerar, which was ruled by Abimelech, king of the Philistines. Like Abraham before him, who called Sarah his [...] "sister" [...] rather than his [...] "wife" [...] so that the Egyptians would not kill him and take his wife, Isaac told the people of Gerar that Rebecca was his sister. She was not molested, but one day Abimelech <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window and saw Isaac [...] "sporting" [...] (a {{euphemism}} for sexual play) with her.

Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold.|$|E
