In her diary she wrote, [...] "When my brother... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in The History of Japan that [...] "Women... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese." [...] Murasaki was aware that others saw her as [...] "pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful". Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had [...] "a forceful personality that seldom won her friends".|$|E

500|$|Rain in England {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B's {{broad range of}} styles. Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work. In Seattle Weekly, Eric Grandy called Rain in England an [...] "oddity" [...] and said Lil B's music is better served by randomly <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on YouTube then in a long-form album format. In a 2012 profile of Lil B's career so far, The Wires Lisa Blanning said the album [...] "feels like a new musical expression." [...] Lil B himself described Rain in England as [...] "my favorite work ... I think that's my most powerful work, to myself. ... That's my favorite, because I know no one else has done that, and that's what I'm most proud of, when I do things that I know nobody else has done before." ...|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, {{thought she might}} be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless." [...] He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|Flashback is a [...] "fusion of the past, present, and future, {{consisting}} of a totally contagious medley of the best hits and entrancing rhythms". The album's repertoire consists of previously released material along with four new melodies. [...] "Cuéntale" [...] (""), the lead single off the album, has Ivy Queen exploring lyrically as she [...] "plays a mistress who tells her lover to pick between her and his wife". She explained [...] "the mistress just gets tired of seeing him {{for a short time}} and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> complain about his unloving wife". Musically, it features danceable grooves, synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers while taking influences from Afro Latin and reggae music; it is set in minor key. [...] "Marroneo" [...] is the second of four newly produced tracks by Rafi Mercenario, [...] "the most highly requested producer in reggaetón" [...] at the time. It received comparisons to Daddy Yankee's [...] "Gasolina". [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] ("") was originally written by Pete Astudillo along with A.B. Quintanilla III and performed by American singer Selena in 1994 on her album Amor Prohibido. Ivy Queen's interpolation of the lyrics tell a story of a [...] "woman who looks back at a lover and wonders why she even loved the lout who abused her love". She choose to cover [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] over other songs by Selena including [...] "Como La Flor" [...] ("") and [...] "La Carcacha" [...] because it was the one she could identify with the most, being more inline with what Queen stands for; citing Selena as her primary influence. The [...] "reggaetón-ed up twist" [...] on Selena's classic, features bitter-romantic lyrics, synthetic instrumentation and synthesizers, while taking reggae influences similar to the original. [...] "I feel honored to be able to sing one of Selena's songs," [...] Queen explained. [...] "She was the first artist to make a successful crossover before Jennifer Lopez and all the rest." [...] "Libertad" [...] (""), the last of the four new tracks on the album was composed in minor key tonality. Queen appears infuriated in the lyrics as the songs takes influences from Afro-Latin music.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964, {{director}} Yuri Lyubimov invited Vysotsky to {{join the}} newly created Taganka Theatre. [...] "'I've written some songs of my own. Won't you listen?' – he asked. I agreed to listen to just one of them, expecting our meeting to last {{for no more than}} five minutes. Instead I ended up <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for an entire 1.5 hours," [...] Lyubimov remembered years later of this first audition. On 19 September 1964, Vysotsky debuted in Bertholt Brecht's The Good Person of Szechwan as the Second God (not to count two minor roles). A month later he came on stage as a dragoon captain (Bela's father) in Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time. It was in Taganka that Vysotsky started to sing on stage; the War theme becoming prominent in his musical repertoire. In 1965 Vysotsky appeared in the experimental Poet and Theater (Поэт и Театр, February) show, based on Andrey Voznesensky's work and then Ten Days that Shook the World (after John Reed's book, April) and was commissioned by Lyubimov to write songs exclusively for Taganka's new World War II play. The Dead and the Living (Павшие и Живые), premiered in October 1965, featured Vysotsky's [...] "Stars" [...] (Звёзды), [...] "The Soldiers of Heeresgruppe Mitte" [...] (Солдаты группы [...] "Центр") and [...] "Penal Battalions" [...] (Штрафные батальоны), the striking examples of a completely new kind of a war song, never heard in his country before. As veteran screenwriter Nikolay Erdman put it (in conversation with Lyubimov), [...] "Professionally, I can well understand how Mayakovsky or Seryozha Yesenin were doing it. How Volodya Vysotsky does it is totally beyond me." [...] With his songs – in effect, miniature theatrical dramatizations (usually with a protagonist and full of dialogues), Vysotsky instantly achieved such level of credibility that real life former prisoners, war veterans, boxers, footballers refused to believe that the author himself had never served his time in prisons and labor camps, or fought in the War, or been a boxing/football professional. After the second of the two concerts at the Leningrad Molecular Physics institute (that was his actual debut as a solo musical performer) Vysotsky left a note for his fans in a journal which ended with words: [...] "Now that you've heard all these songs, please, don't you make a mistake of mixing me with my characters, I am not like them at all. With love, Vysotsky, 20 April 1965, XX c." [...] Excuses of this kind he had to make throughout his performing career. At least one of Vysotsky's song themes – that of alcoholic abuse – was worryingly autobiographical, though. By the time his breakthrough came in 1967, he'd suffered several physical breakdowns and once was sent (by Taganka's boss) to a rehabilitation clinic, a visit he on several occasions repeated since.|$|E

Opinion was, however, divided.
