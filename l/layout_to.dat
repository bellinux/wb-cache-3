5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA903, {{surplus to}} Blue Steel trials, was {{converted}} to a similar <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971. In April 1973, XA903 flew with an underslung Rolls-Royce RB.199 turbofan destined for the Panavia Tornado. The RB.199 engine included both the reheat and thrust reverser functions. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit {{underwent}} substantial reconfiguration in the build-up to the event. The first corner complex was tightened on entry, {{while the}} middle {{part of the}} track was completely re-profiled, retaining much of the original design whilst reducing the reliance on aerodynamic grip. The most significant changes {{were made in the}} final part, with the Peraltada corner cut in half and the circuit redirected through the Foro Sol stadium complex in the circuit infield beginning with turn 12, following a similar <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> the one used by Champ Car between 2002 and 2007. The track layout featured two drag reduction system (DRS) zones, one on the main straight and another between turns three and four.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of both serial and parallel implementations of matrix multiplication is highly sensitive to memory system behavior.

5|$|The game's {{control scheme}} uses a two-way {{joystick}} and five buttons. Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both Space Invaders and Asteroids simultaneously. The player's left hand manipulates the joystick similar to Space Invaders {{and the right}} hand pushes buttons similar to Asteroids. The button functions also use a similar <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> Asteroids, with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate {{on the far right}} and left, respectively. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games, and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.|$|E
5|$|Three stone hearths and {{traces of}} red ochre found on Jura and dated to 6000BC are the {{earliest}} stone-built structures found {{so far in}} Scotland. However, in general the Neolithic sites in the Inner Hebrides lack the scale and drama of those found in Orkney and the Western Isles. There are numerous Iron Age sites including the remains of Dun Ringill fort on Skye, which are similar in <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> that of both a broch and a complex Atlantic roundhouse.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E

5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab <b>layout</b> <b>to</b> improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Despite {{the use of}} mask defect {{avoidance}} and mitigation techniques, {{finding a}} usable defective mask blank remains a challenge for Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) at sub- 10 nm node due <b>to</b> dense <b>layouts</b> and low CD tolerance. In this work, we propose a pattern shift-aware metric called critical density, which can quickly evaluate the robustness of EUV <b>layouts</b> <b>to</b> mask defects (300 − 1300 × faster than Monte Carlo, with average mask yield {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) ranging from 0. 08 %− 6. 44 %), thereby enabling design-level mask defect mitigation techniques. Our experimental results indicate that reducing layout regularity improves the ability of <b>layouts</b> <b>to</b> tolerate mask defects via pattern shift...|$|R
