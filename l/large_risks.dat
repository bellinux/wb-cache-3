Of course, if possible, one should avoid exposure to <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> (often {{referred to as the}} black swan approach). However, in many developments, exposure to risk is a necessity, and a trade-off between risk and return needs to be navigated. This nontrivial case is the one that must be considered.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{questions}} that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree. A tree that is too <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples. A small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space. However, it is hard to tell when a tree algorithm should stop because it is impossible to tell if the addition of a single extra node will dramatically decrease error. This problem is known as the horizon effect. A common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information.|$|E
5000|$|In more {{economically}} developed countries, {{a slowdown in}} electricity demand growth {{in recent years has}} made large-scale power infrastructure investments difficult. Very large upfront costs and long project cycles carry <b>large</b> <b>risks,</b> including political decision making and intervention such as regulatory ratcheting. In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for clean energy projects. Former Exelon CEO John Rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the US [...] "don't make any sense right now" [...] and would not be economic as long as gas prices remain low.|$|E

The <b>largest</b> <b>risks</b> for PTS are having an altered level of consciousness for a protracted time after the injury, severe injuries with focal lesions, and fractures. The single <b>largest</b> <b>risk</b> for PTS is penetrating head trauma, which carries a 35 to 50% risk of seizures within 15years. If a fragment of metal remains within the skull after injury, the risk of both early and late PTS may be increased. Head trauma survivors who abused alcohol before the injury are also at higher risk for developing seizures.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1870s W:m Crichton & C:o {{employed}} 400 people. Most {{of the sales}} came from steam engines and other machinery, and just 30% of turnover came from ships. The company produced most of the needed tools, even drilling and turning machines, in its own workshops. Rapid growth {{of the company and}} the large orders required investments and various financial arrangements, creating <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> to its owners. At about the same time with making quotation for S/S Finland in 1874, the owners converted W:m Crichton & C:o a limited company in order to assure their personal property. The capital was 1 500 000 marks which was divided into 30 shares, each of 50 000 marks value; 20 shares were owned by William Crichton and 10 shares by trading house Julin. Erik Julin died already in the same year, after which the trading house was led by his son John Julin.|$|E
5000|$|An {{application}} of micromorts is measuring {{the value that}} humans place on risk: for example, one can consider {{the amount of money}} one would have to pay a person to get him or her to accept a one-in-a-million chance of death (or conversely the amount that someone might be willing to pay to avoid a one-in-a-million chance of death). When put thus, people claim a high number but when inferred from their day-to-day actions (e.g., how much they {{are willing to pay for}} safety features on cars) a typical value is around $50 (in 2009). [...] However utility functions are often not linear, i.e. the more a person has already spent on their safety the less they are willing to spend to further increase their safety. Therefore, the $50 valuation should not be taken to mean that a human life (1 million micromorts) is valued at $50,000,000. Furthermore, the local linearity of any utility curve means that the micromort is useful for small incremental risks and rewards, not necessarily for <b>large</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Stratfor {{concluded}} {{in an analysis}} of the raid that Israel took <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> and allotted huge military resources in carrying out the raid [...] "well in excess of its achievements." [...] Former chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon, a sharp critic of IDF conduct during the Lebanon war, questioned whether the raid was [...] "justified in terms of risk, cost and benefit" [...] and whether it was not simply [...] "an adventure." [...] HRW concluded that [...] "the operation appears to have been based on questionable intelligence and had a disproportionate impact on civilians". Hezbollah leader Nasrallah mocked the raid during a speech on al-Manar TV in which he said [...] "They stormed a hospital and threw a grenade...to search for injured fighters who they didn’t capture...they kidnapped five civilians and they are hostages. This is intelligence, this is the Mossad?" [...] According to Ofer Shelach and Yoav Limor, the operation had a psychological influence on Hezbollah leadership as the attack was in the heart of their stronghold, the local commander of Bekaa area was dismissed, movement on the roads was minimized, and more energy was put on self-defense.|$|E

5000|$|Wolfgang Kröger {{recognized}} {{early on}} that the classical technical risk analysis has to be enriched and modified to changing situations in our modern society. At an early stage far-reaching changes {{of the character of}} <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> to so-called systemic risks, triggered by an increasing integration and globalization of systems, became obvious and he realized the urgent need to develop new approaches to deal with such risks. Supported by the Swiss Government, he put the management of man-made technological trans-boundary risks into a broader context by establishing the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) as an independent organization. Founded in 2003, the IRGC follows a trans-sectorial and multi-disciplinary approach and promotes multi-stakeholder participation, where appropriate. As its Founding Rector he has provided valuable contributions to its undeniable success to date. From mid-2011 to end of 2014 he helped to build up the ETH Risk Center, which pools the expertise of professors from various departments. Its joint research output should support society and industry to better manage risk portfolios and design novel solutions for collaborative risk reduction and resilience enhancing schemes. Furthermore, he accountably prepared the proposal for a huge integrated research project on Future Resilient Systems, integrating combinations from ETH and top Singaporean universities; it was finally approved by the National Research Foundation of Singapore (NRF) for funding and launched in November 2014.|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{faithful}} {{representation of the}} heavy tail multivariate distribution of asset returns introduced previously (Sornette et al., 1998, 1999) that we extend {{to the case of}} asymmetric return distributions, we generalize the return-risk efficient frontier concept to incorporate the dimensions of <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> embedded in the tail of the asset distributions. We demonstrate that it is often possible to increase the portfolio return while decreasing the <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> as quantified by the fourth and higher order cumulants. Exact theoretical formulas are validated by empirical tests. ...|$|E
