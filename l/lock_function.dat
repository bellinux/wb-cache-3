5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation <b>lock</b> <b>function</b> to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E

50|$|Since {{most modern}} desktop {{computers}} have a full-size keyboard {{with both a}} numeric pad and separate arrow keys, Num Lock is rarely used (always on) for its original purpose, and ends up confusing the user if it has for some reason been turned off without the user being aware of this. This can be more of an issue on most laptop computers, since activating the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> typically requires use of the Fn key and if a user accidentally switches it on they may {{have no idea how}} to switch it off. If a full-size keyboard is plugged into a laptop, then the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> is normally on (as expected) for the external keyboard, and the user would not have to activate the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> to use the numeric keypad for numeric entry. Since Apple keyboards never had a combination of arrow keys and numeric keypad (but some lacked arrow keys, function keys and a numeric keypad altogether), Apple has keyboards with a separate numeric keypad but no functional Num Lock key. Instead, these keyboards include a Clear key.|$|E

Under normal driving conditions, most power is {{transferred}} to the front wheels while some {{is sent to the}} back wheels. If wheel slippage is detected up front, up to 50% of power can be sent to the rear wheels. The system features a VTM-4 lock button on the dashboard which locks the rear differential and sends 25% of the power to each rear wheel.

50|$|Naoto Takizawa/Time Fire (28-49,Timeranger vs GoGoV): Tatsuya's 28- year-old rival {{and leader}} of the City Guardians {{established}} by the Asami Corporation. Unlike Tatsuya, Naoto came {{from the other side of}} the tracks, getting by on a scholarship as the two of them attended college. Naoto envied Tatsuya and wanted to be the better of the two. After Naoto becomes Time Fire, the Asami group attempts to analyze the technology for mass production, but cannot fully understand the 30th century technology. He finds out through Sion that the Londers' monsters are just prisoners and only need to be recaptured. Eventually, he learns that the Timerangers came from the 30th century and, because of his desire for power, he chooses to find a way to use his new knowledge of the Timerangers to his advantage. After Wataru is hospitalized, Naoto is able to use that knowledge to gain full control of the City Guardians. Naoto also owns two pet birds, Tora and Sakura, which he later gives to a little girl. After Naoto is injured during the battle against Neo-Crisis, he finds out that Wataru was able to regain control of the City Guardians through a legal maneuver, since the Guardians were able to remove the Voice <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> on the V-Commander, which meant they no longer needed him. Naoto is stripped of his command and flees with the V-Commander. A girl who is supposed to be being evacuated instead goes home to rescue her pet bird. The Zenitt would have killed her, but Naoto protects her and is shot in her stead. At an emergency shelter he is treated for his injuries. When the little girl comes to thank him, they see her bird outside. Unaware of how badly he is already injured, Naoto goes out to catch the bird. He succeeds, but is shot down by a Zenitt, which mortally wounds him and causes him to lose his balance and fall over a high stairwell railing. Naoto relinquishes the V-Commander to Tatsuya, telling him to change the future as he dies. In the 20th century, Tatsuya comes across an individual resembling Naoto.|$|E
30|$|Multi-agent {{systems are}} {{involved}} today for solving {{different types of}} problems. They {{could be used in}} real-time applications and for solving complex problems in different domains as bio-informatics, ambient intelligence, semantic web (Jennings et al. 1998; Warneke et al. 2001; Wooldridge 2013). The main properties of agents are the autonomy, reactivity, pro-activeness, cooperation, mobility and not at last learning capabilities. With the exception of the last one, all of them are implemented in the presented JADE platform for Android. The autonomy refers to the ability of each client to perform a connection and to enjoy the service from the platform. The reactivity of an agent is provided by the graphic interface, which listens and reflects the events taking place on the server. The pro-activeness feature is implemented as sensing the automatic Smart <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> of Android. Cooperation is offered by the group management functions, and mobility is offered by the intrinsic characteristics of both JADE and Android.|$|E

40|$|The {{security}} aspect {{that the}} computer user encounters most often is the password prompt - a demand that they verify their identity by providing a shared secret. Authentication, for the deployer, regulates access and enforces accountability. Authentication, for the user, obstructs, intrudes and delays gratification. Whereas users could probably {{put up with this}} if it happens relatively infrequently, this tends not to be the case. An authentication prompt is presented a number of times during the day. Sometimes it has serious consequences, such as when it is required to authorise the purchase of a digital item, and the permits consequent credit card charge. Other times it merely identifies the user to allow the system to customise the interface. The range of consequences and the multiplicity of systems mandating shared secrets collide with human limitations and the current password bloat and general end-user exasperation. Is it at all possible to improve authentication? As researchers, we have primarily addressed this problem in one of three ways: (1) by trying to find a password replacement, (2) by formulating rules and regulations to coerce users into choosing stronger passwords, or (3) fostering a security culture within the organisation, hoping that the social pressure will induce people to behave more securely. These endeavours have met with limited success. Alternatives have not been embraced by the developer community, rules and regulations are often ignored, subverted or deliberately flouted. Fostering a security culture has had more success, in relative terms, but still has not really addressed the “authentication problem”. The one thing these approaches have in common is their focus on the human agent: the end user. Consider a related problem in the physical world: locks on doors. These have not changed in centuries and the doors themselves are probably weaker than they were a hundred years ago. Yet do locks really prevent intrusion? A determined intruder finds the average lock an minor deterrent, and the door itself is sometimes even made of glass, allowing the thief to subvert the lock entirely. Yet one never hears about a desperate search for a door or lock replacement. One doesn’t hear the refrain, ‘How do you solve a problem like the door lock? This even though they, too, are lost, copied and shared. Why, when it comes to virtual locks, is there such a drive {{to come up with the}} perfect locking mechanism? The password and the average door <b>lock</b> <b>function</b> similarly: neither is perfect but both provide an acceptable measure of security. Here we will argue that it might be time to suspend our unrealistic expectations that we can find a perfect lock in the virtual world when we live quite happily with imperfect security in the physical world...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{combined}} InfraRed thermography and thermal wave techniques to perform microscale, ultrafast (microsecond) temperature field measurements.

The principle is based on electronic stroboscopic sampling where the low IR camera acquisition frequency facq (25 Hz) undersamples a high frequency thermal wave. This technique permits the measurement of the emissive thermal response at a (microsecond) short time scale (microsecond) with the full frame mode of the IR camera with a spatial thermal resolution of 7 μm. Then it becomes possible to study 3 D transient heat transfer in heterogeneous and high thermal conductive thin layers.
