HCL preserves the L (<b>luminance)</b> <b>axis</b> of L*a*b*, but transforms ab to polar coordinates, where the distance from zero is the chroma (an alternative measure of colorfulness), and the phase (angle) is our familiar hue. The older Munsell color system is based on different mathematics, but has some similarity to HCL.|$|E

Observers freely named 1044 CRT-displayed colour-background combinations, sampled regularly along the (u′,v′) axes of the 1976 UCS, and along a <b>luminance</b> <b>axis.</b> Three response measures — response times, confidence ratings and consistencies — were obtained. These measures were collapsed by principal components analysis (PCA) into ‘nameability’, a single measure of ease of naming of colours. The structure of colour naming space {{and the use of}} different colour name types, were investigated. Data confirmed the uniqueness of basic colour terms as compared with the non-basic terms, agreeing with previous constrained naming studies. Colour naming space was found to exhibit regular structure, which appears to be linked to fundamental response categories, and to previous observations that colour naming space may be divided into five major regions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe luminance–response {{function}} of the brief flash full-field photopic electroretinogram (ERG) rises to a peak before falling to a sub-maximal plateau – the ‘photopic hill’. The combination of on- and off-responses inherent in the brief flash photopic ERG suggests that this luminance–response function could be modelled by the sum of a Gaussian function and a logistic growth function. Photopic ERGs to a luminance series of brief flashes against three different background luminances recorded from seven healthy adults showed the characteristic ‘photopic hill’ function for b-wave amplitudes which were satisfactorily fitted with the sum of a Gaussian curve and a logistic growth curve. As background luminance increased, both components shifted to the right on the <b>luminance</b> <b>axis.</b> The Gaussian component increased in amplitude while the logistic growth function component decreased in amplitude. The luminance–response {{function of}} a complete congenital stationary night blindness patient had almost no logistic growth component...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of glaucoma, at {{different}} stages of the disease process, on the two color-opponent systems and on the luminance system. Discrimination thresholds were measured along the two equiluminant cardinal color axes (RG and YV) and along an achromatic <b>luminance</b> <b>axis</b> (LD) in 27 patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and in 13 glaucoma suspects. Patients with OAG showed increased thresholds along all three axes. The threshold increases correlated significantly with the level of visual field loss. For glaucoma suspects, thresholds were also increased along all three axes. A subgroup of patients with OAG, those with pigmentary glaucoma, showed minimal increases in threshold along the RG axis. To further investigate this finding an additional 15 patients, seven with primary OAG and eight with pigmentary glaucoma were run in a two-alternative forced-choice experiment. For patients with pigmentary glaucoma, thresholds were increased less along the RG axis. The results of the study for OAG patients and glaucoma suspects are consistent with deficits in the two color-opponent systems, and in the luminance system...|$|E

In a given experiment, the observer obtained a perceptual match between the contrasts of two gratings whose chromaticities or luminances varied along differing chromatic directions which were selected from among five axes: an achromatic <b>luminance</b> <b>axis</b> (lum), an isoluminant axis where only S-cone activation varied (S-axis), an isoluminant axis where L- and M-cone activation varied in a complementary manner (LM-axis), an axis where only L-cone activation varied (L-axis), and an axis where only M-cone activation varied (M-axis). Even though these chromatic axes were chosen to activate independent mechanisms involved {{in the early stages}} of spatiochromatic visual processing, and despite the distinctly differing appearance of patterns from variations along differing directions, we find that observers can reliably make such pairwise contrast matches. Furthermore there is reasonable consistency of matching contrasts among observers and the pairwise contrast matches exhibit the properties of homogeneity and transitivity. This observed homogeneity and transitivity allows, for each color direction, the specification of a single scaling factor which relates perceptual contrast to physical contrast...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the state of}} adaptation of the eye on the Broca-Sulzer phenomenon has been investigated by measuring equal-brightness curves as a function of flash duration for circular 1 °-fields, projected against a photopic and a dark background. The results show that the Broca-Sulzer effect is present in both conditions. In the dark-field condition the Broca-Sulzer effect was found to shift to shorter durations with increasing flash luminance. For flashes presented against the photopic background, however, this shift is absent. Furthermore, the equalbrightness curves were found to be isomorphous. They coincide after translation along the <b>luminance</b> <b>axis</b> in the photopic background condition and after translation along the duration and luminance axes in the dark-field condition. It is argued that both the isomorphism of the equal-brightness curves and the absence of the shift in the photopic background condition confirm our earlier conclusion (De Ridder 2 ̆ 6 amp; Theelen, 1983, 1984) that the exponent of the power function, relating brightness to luminance, is independent of flash duration. The shift of the Broca-Sulzer effect in the dark-field condition is attributed to disturbances of the adaptation level...|$|E
40|$|Apparatus. The {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} a chamber whose illumination was under computer control. Subjects were seated {{at a distance of}} 130 cm from the wall in front of the chamber. The monitor was placed in a tunnel 57 cm behind the wall, and was viewed through an opening of 10. 6 × 8 deg. Stimuli were displayed on a Sony GDM-F 520 CRT monitor with a spatial resolution of 800 × 600 pixels and refresh rate of 120 Hz, driven by a Cambridge Research VSG graphics card. The C. I. E. 1931 chromaticity of the white point of the monitor was x = 0. 32, y = 0. 34 with a luminance of 29 cd m-. Calibration of the setup is described in detail in Rinner & Gegenfurtner (2002). Stimuli. Seven digitized photographs of fruit and vegetables were selected as stimuli due to their distinct object colour. Each stimulus contained one fruit object on a grey background. As control stimuli we used homogeneously coloured discs and noise discs with an amplitude spectrum resembling the average amplitude spectrum of natural scenes (1 /f, pink noise). The stimuli were defined in the DKL colour space, which is spanned by a <b>luminance</b> <b>axis</b> (L + M) and two chromatic axes (L – M and S – (L + M) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Craik–O’Brien–Cornsweet effect (COCE) is {{a visual}} {{illusion}} {{in which a}} difference in brightness is observed between two regions of equal luminance separated by a contrast edge with opposite luminance gradients on each side. The COCE also occurs with chromatic contrasts. It has been hypothesized that the COCE is mediated by a cortical filling-in process. According to the filling-in hypothesis, the filling-in or spreading of neural activity proceeds at finite speed, and therefore exhibits some temporal tuning {{as a function of}} the width of the area to be filled in. In the present study, observers varied the temporal frequency of a COC grating to determine the maximum temporal frequency at which a temporal modulation of brightness or color was perceived. In the achromatic COCE, contours were modulated along the <b>luminance</b> <b>axis</b> of the DKL color space; in the chromatic COCE, contours were modulated either along the L−M or the S−(L+M) axis. For the achromatic condition, the critical temporal frequency at which the COCE was still perceived had the shape of an inverted U, inconsistent with the filling-in hypothesis: the critical temporal frequency increased with increasing spatial frequency only up to 0. 2 cycles/deg, but then decreased for higher spatial frequencies. For the chromatic COCE, the critical temporal frequency decreased with increasing spatial frequency, which is also inconsistent with filling-in. Thus, the results of the present study are inconsistent with the idea that the temporal dynamics of the COCE, both achromatic and chromatic, are due to filling-in. Instead, our results are consistent with the spatial filtering properties of the luminance and chromatic systems...|$|E
