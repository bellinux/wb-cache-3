5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, {{slightly}} to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waiting room and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council <b>level,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E

5|$|State law {{requires}} that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed {{the population of the}} smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> municipal clerk. Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward.|$|E
5|$|The Volt {{features}} OnStar Mobile {{application for}} owners to access vehicle information without being {{in or near}} the car.

The application also is able to control features such as locking/unlocking doors, and acts as a remote starter. A five-year OnStar Directions and Connections service was bundled into the 2011 Volt's base price, which was reduced to three years for the 2012 model year.|$|E

Each tier at a given difficulty is unlocked in order, and a tier is completed once three to five songs (depending on the difficulty <b>level)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tier's encore song are successfully completed. Once a song is unlocked in a tier at any difficulty, it is available for the quick play, competitive, and co-operative modes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor—the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the last ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, I-196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.|$|E

5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, {{known as the}} Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|E
5|$|Enugu city covers three local {{government}} areas: Enugu East, Enugu North and Enugu South. A Local Government Council exists {{for each of}} these seats that manages sectors including primary education and health; an elected Executive Chairman and a group of elected Councillors form the Local Government Council that heads each Local Government Area. Enugu South is split between its rural and urban parts when electing an Executive Chairman. The Executive Chairmen include Paul Ogbe for Enugu South Urban, Theresa Egbo for Enugu South Rural, Emeka Nnamani for Enugu North, and Christopher Ugwu for Enugu East; these chairmen represent their LGA's in the Enugu State House of Assembly. The Ministry of Lands, Survey and Town Planning (at the state <b>level)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Local Planning Authority (at the {{local government}} level) are responsible for the administration of urban lands and town planning. Government House, Enugu is where the government of the state is based. On the federal level, the city of Enugu is split between two congressional areas; Enugu North/South represented by Chukwuegbo Ofor and Enugu East represented by Gilbert Nnaji; both representatives are in the People's Democratic Party (PDP) as is Sunday Chukwuebuka Agbo, the governor of Enugu State.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
