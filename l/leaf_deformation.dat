Leafy gall is a gall originated from a bud which would not develop under normal conditions.All effects coming from the infection of R. fascians do not depend on plant cells transformation (as for Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Agrobacterium rhizogenes), but on expression of virulence-related genes of bacterium and on the production of compounds that can interfere with normal plant growth and development. During the infection, R. fascians usually stays outside vegetal tissues, near a junction or cavity of a plant's cell walls, maybe to avoid environmental stresses. Presence of R. fascians was also observed in intercellular spaces inside tissues (in leaf or galls) and even inside cell walls. Presence of R. fascians on the infected plant is necessary, {{not only for the}} initiation of infection, but also for its maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Breeding for {{a certain}} trait is only {{possible}} when the phenotypic variation that is caused by genotypic variation can be estimated. For traits that strongly depend on environmental conditions, this can be extremely difficult and knowledge and collaboration with experts from other disciplines becomes essential. A well-known example is breeding for disease resistance. Here, we describe a similar approach to assist breeding against adverse <b>leaf</b> <b>deformations</b> that severely reduce the ornamental value of some chrysanthemum (Dendranthema × grandiflora) genotypes during greenhouse cultivation in winter. These <b>leaf</b> <b>deformations</b> occur rather unpredictably, but seem {{to be related to}} the increased use of assimilation light. To breed against this trait knowledge is needed (i) about inductive environments in which sensitive and insensitive genotypes are distinguishable, and (ii) about the physiological background associated with leaf epinasty. In this paper hypothetical physiological factors and mechanisms are discussed, which may mediate effects of light spectrum and greenhouse climate on leaf epinasty. One factor involved could be starch accumulation, since leaf epinasty usually aggravates after disbudding - a practice that most probably alters the sink-source balance. Additionally, light spectra can affect the circadian clock and thereby disturb starch synthesis and breakdown resulting in accumulation. Both within and independent of this process, plant hormones such as auxin and ethylene may play a role in leaf epinasty. This theoretical framework will be used to further investigate the physiological background of leaf epinasty and to come up with a test in which susceptibility for leaf epinasty can be assessed...|$|R

40|$|Many horticultural crops (food and ornamental) are {{produced}} year-round in greenhouses at high latitudes, where the limited availability of natural sunlight restricts plant production during {{large parts of}} the year. To enable year-round plant production supplemental light is necessary to enhance photosynthesis, the primary process that drives growth and production. It is therefore not surprising that during the last two decades most of the research effort related to light in greenhouse horticulture has been directed towards optimizing the supplemental light use efficiency for photosynthesis, with emphasis on light intensity, duration and since recently also on light quality. For a long time, high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps were the preferred lamps for supplemental lighting. Nowadays, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are gaining importance, mostly because of their potentially higher energy efficiency. Another important, less-well known attribute of LEDs is the much better possibility to control light quality. Besides the effect on photosynthesis, light quality also influences plant morphological and developmental processes, mostly mediated by a set of blue, red and far-red photoreceptors (i. e., cryptochromes, phototropins and phytochromes). Several of these processes, such as for instance internode and petiole elongation growth and leaf expansion have a direct impact on productivity via plant photosynthesis as mediated by light interception. Light quality can also induce <b>leaf</b> <b>deformations</b> and epinasty, which can negatively influence biomass production via reduced light interception. In ornamental crops, such as chrysanthemum, <b>leaf</b> <b>deformations</b> can have severe negative impact on the final ornamental value. Other important effects of light quality involve the development of stomatal density and the control of stomatal aperture, which both attribute to stomatal conductance and therefore potentially influence productivity, while also the leaf hydraulic resistance is influenced by light quality. This paper will overview some plant morphological and developmental processes that are influenced by light quality and are important for plant production in protected environments...|$|R

40|$|The Tomato bushy stunt virus-encoded P 19 forms dimers {{that bind}} duplex short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to {{suppress}} RNA silencing. P 19 is {{also involved in}} multiple host-specific activities, including the elicitation of symptoms, and in local and/or systemic spread. To study the correlation between those various roles and the siRNA binding by P 19, predicted siRNA-interacting sites were modified. Twenty-two mutants were generated and inoculated onto Nicotiana benthamiana plants, to reveal that (i) they were all infectious, (ii) symptom differences did not correlate strictly with mutation-associated variation in P 19 accumulation, and (iii) substitutions affecting a central domain of P 19 generally exhibited symptoms more severe than for mutations affecting peripheral regions. Three mutants selected to represent separate phenotypic categories all displayed a substantially reduced ability to sequester siRNA. Consequently, these three mutants were compromised for systemic virus spread in P 19 -dependent hosts but had differential plant species-dependent effects on the symptom severity. One mutant in particular caused relatively exacerbated symptoms, exemplified by extensive morphological <b>leaf</b> <b>deformations</b> in N. benthamiana; this was especially remarkable because P 19 was undetectable. Another striking feature of this mutant was that only {{within a few days}} after infection, viral RNA was cleared by silencing. One more original property was that host RNAs and proteins (notably, the P 19 -interactive Hin 19 protein) were also susceptible to degradation in these infected N. benthamiana plants but not in spinach. In conclusion, even though siRNA binding by P 19 is a key functional property, compromised siRNA sequestration can result in novel and diverse host-dependent properties...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in LACERATA (LCR), FIDDLEHEAD (FDH), and BODYGUARD (BDG) cause {{a complex}} {{developmental}} syndrome {{that is consistent}} with an important role for these Arabidopsis genes in cuticle biogenesis. The genesis of their pleiotropic phenotypes is, however, poorly understood. We provide evidence that neither distorted depositions of cutin, nor deficiencies in the chemical composition of cuticular lipids, account for these features, instead suggesting that the mutants alleviate the functional disorder of the cuticle by reinforcing their defenses. To better understand how plants adapt to these mutations, we performed a genome-wide gene expression analysis. We found that apparent compensatory transcriptional responses in these mutants involve the induction of wax, cutin, cell wall, and defense genes. To gain greater insight into the mechanism by which cuticular mutations trigger this response in the plants, we performed an overlap meta-analysis, which is termed MASTA (MicroArray overlap Search Tool and Analysis), of differentially expressed genes. This suggested that different cell integrity pathways are recruited in cesA cellulose synthase and cuticular mutants. Using MASTA for an in silico suppressor/enhancer screen, we identified SERRATE (SE), which encodes a protein of RNA-processing multi-protein complexes, as a likely enhancer. In confirmation of this notion, the se lcr and se bdg double mutants eradicate severe <b>leaf</b> <b>deformations</b> as well as the organ fusions that are typical of lcr and bdg and other cuticular mutants. Also, lcr does not confer resistance to Botrytis cinerea in a se mutant background. We propose that there is a role for SERRATE-mediated RNA signaling in the cuticle integrity pathway...|$|R

The aims of this study were identify the causal agent of intense mosaic and <b>leaf</b> <b>deformation</b> observed in anthurium commercial crops from four cities of the São Paulo state, Brazil; to assess the extent of the virus occurrence in these cities and the methods for its detection, as well as to analyse the anthurium genotypes reactions in relation to the virus. Anthuriums were sampled from the following cities: Mogi das Cruzes, Pariquera-Açu, Iguape and Registro. Leaves and spathes from symptomatic plants were used in mechanical transmission assays. The virus was transmitted only when spathes were used to prepare the inocula, and it induced Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) -like symptoms in the indicator hosts. PTA-ELISA and RT-PCR were performed to identify the virus species, since CMV was detected in all agricultural areas sampled. Anthuriums from IAC varieties, 'Jureia', 'Garoa', 'Eidibel' and 'Astral' and from 'Caipira' and 'Branco' cultivars were inoculated with CMV and all of them were susceptible to the virus.

Investigation on occurrence of this virus, in Khuzestan province was carried out in November 2009, April and May 2010 by collecting cucurbits samples from different cucurbits fields. After DAS-ELISA test, ZYMV was maintained in squash. Then total RNA were extracted and were tested by RT-PCR. Using RT-PCR, fragments belonging to N-terminal of coat protein and C-terminal of nuclear inclusion bodies were replicated. PCR product for investigation of replication was loaded in 1 % agarose gel. From seven regions in Khuzestan, 175 leaf samples showing different symptoms (yellowing, mosaic, deformation and blistering) were collected. Seventy one samples out of total samples (175 samples) showed ZYMV infection. Occurrence of Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus in Khuzestan province was confirmed, using serological and RT-PCR tests. Infection of ZYMV in Khuzestan province (40. 5 %) is higher than the average of Iran’s infection (38 %). This article is first report of occurrence ZYMV in different regions of Khuzestan province except Dezful...|$|R
40|$|Begomoviruses as 			well as potyviruses infect {{cucurbits}} {{in different}} parts of the world 			but are shown to be independent pathogens able to cause severe 			disease on their own. A devastating disease suspected to be of viral 			origin was found in traditional muskmelon growing-areas of Punjab in 			the districts of Sahiwal, Pakpatten and Vehari during 2003. 			Characteristic symptoms of the disease in Punjab province were 			mosaic and chlorotic spots, <b>leaf</b> distortion and <b>deformation,</b> vein 			thickening, enations on the upper side of the leaves, leaf yellowing 			and stunting of affected plants. Initial screening of diseased 			samples revealed the presence of a bipartite begomovirus and the 			potyvirus Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). For comparison with 			Punjab, surveys were also conducted in Mardan district of North 			Western Frontier Province (NWFP) where plants showed leaf curling, 			mosaic and enations on the upper side of the leaf. Results showed 			that the disease found on muskmelon in Mardan district was caused by 			multiple infections of two viruses, ZYMV and Cucumber mosaic virus 			(CMV, family: Cucumoviridae). Dual infection of a potyvirus and a 			bipartite begomovirus associated with a severe yellow leaf curl 			disease of muskmelon in Punjab was a novel phenomenon and was 			investigated in detail. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence 			of the DNA A and DNA B of the begomovirus showed it to be a new 			species that is closely related to Tomato leaf curl new Delhi virus 			(ToLCNDV), another bipartite begomovirus widely distributed across 			the Indian subcontinent. The intergenic region of DNA A showed a 			high level of nucleotide identity with DNA A of ToLCNDV and was 			infectious when inoculated with DNA B of ToLCNDV to Nicotiana 			benthamiana. The DNA B of this new species named as Muskmelon yellow 			leaf curl virus (MYLCV) shows unusual features such as an intergenic 			region that did not match with ToLCNDV or any other begomovirus but 			retained some of features required for trans-replication, including 			the hairpin structure with nonanucleotide sequence conserved in all 			geminiviruses, and the rep-binding domains identical to those found 			on ToLCNDV. The movement protein (MP) shows high level (87...|$|R
