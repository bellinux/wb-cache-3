After the model validation, several geometric features were changed to assess their influence on the volumetric efficiency in conditions of incomplete filling, such as the thickness and the diameter of the gears, the position of the inlet pipe with respect to the rotors (radial, axial and tangential), the shape of the port plate...|$|R

40|$|High Technology Systems (HTS) with {{sensitive}} surfaces, such as superconducting {{radio frequency}} (SRF) accelerating cavities, polarized electron sources (PES) for accelerators and many others, {{are prone to}} degradation when subjected to particulate or hydrocarbon contaminants. Particulate contamination control of SRF cavity surfaces and vacuum components have been discussed by several authors at this contamination workshop. Hydrocarbon contamination mainly results from prolonged evacuation with conventional oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>pumping</b> systems and/or prolonged leak detection with conventional leak detectors. The sensitivity of the conventional leak detectors suffers due to the back-streaming of atmospheric helium (5 x 10 {sup {minus} 1 } Pa) through the pumping systems and/or the trapping of helium in the O-rings and oils of the pumping systems. This reduced sensitivity leads {{to the use of}} the leak detectors over long periods of time for detecting small (1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } atm. cc s{sup {minus} 1 }) leaks in HTS thereby exposing the sensitive surfaces to contamination. In this paper, a review of the work in progress, at Thomas Jefferson Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), in reducing the contamination of sensitive surfaces is presented...|$|R
40|$|Air/Oil {{filtration}} through filters {{is commonly}} utilised in the vacuum industry where oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>pumps</b> are used across {{a number of}} different applications such as food and packaging, industrial, pharmaceutical, R&D, forming and drying. The air/oil filters are crucial in the reduction of exhaust emissions, which, when suspended as fine particulate matter can cause great harm to the environment, climate, equipment life and public health. However, the behaviour of flow through the filters is not fully understood and much of the design and development work is based on historical know-how and experimental studies. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool to understand the flow characteristics and droplet trajectory through the filters which is challenging through experimental techniques. In this study, a CFD model is developed by using the commercial ANSYS FLUENT code. Oil droplets from the pump entering the filter are treated as a discrete phase. Euler-Lagrangian frame is used to characterise the multiphase flow, K-Ɛ as a turbulence model, Rosin-Rammler distribution of oil droplets, User Defined Functions (UDF) are written for droplet injection, distribution and deposition. Various methodologies and tests were developed to obtain the required data to feed into the model and validate the data predicted by the computational model. The obtained computational data agrees well with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental procedure for comparing different families of IC Engine <b>lubricating</b> <b>pumps</b> {{in terms of}} total consumed energy in a NEDC driving cycle. Measures are performed on a test rig able to reproduce the oil temperature profile, the lubrication circuit permeability and its variation during the engine warm-up. The pump under test is driven by a variable speed electric motor supplying the engine velocity profile of the driving cycle. The load on the pump is generated {{by means of a}} variable restrictor controlled in a closed loop by a proper combination of speed, temperature, flow rate and pressure signals in order to replicate the typical permeability of the lubricating circuit. The method has been applied to a 15 cc/rev crankshaft mounted gerotor pump for a medium displacement Diesel engine; the flow-pressure characteristics of the lubricating circuit at different temperatures and the oil heating rate measured on the engine have been supplied to the test rig control system. The reference pump has been contrasted with a crankshaft mounted variable displacement vane pump with absolute pressure limiter device and an off-axis external gear pump with the same displacement and pressure setting. Experimental tests bring to evidence the advantage of the variable displacement pump during short trips with cold start, while the external gear pump prevails at the end of NEDC cycle where highest engine speeds and oil temperatures are reached...|$|R

5000|$|Rifle {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to sleeve bearings, but are quieter and have almost as much lifespan as ball bearings. The bearing has a spiral groove in it that pumps fluid from a reservoir. This allows them to be safely mounted with the shaft horizontal (unlike sleeve bearings), since the fluid being <b>pumped</b> <b>lubricates</b> {{the top of the}} shaft. The pumping also ensures sufficient lubricant on the shaft, reducing noise, and increasing lifespan.|$|R
40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting pad bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted tilting pad bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting pad bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a {{tilting pad thrust bearing}} while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is the elimination of the bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting pad bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting pad bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product <b>lubricated</b> <b>pumps</b> and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|R
40|$|A key {{technical}} {{problem in}} the exploitation of hot water geothermal energy resources is down-well pumping to inhibit mineral precipitation, improve thermal efficiency, and enhance flow.

This steam powers a high-speed turbine-driven pump. The exhaust steam is brought to the surface through an exhaust pipe, condensed, and recirculated. A small fraction of the high-pressure clean feedwater is diverted to <b>lubricate</b> the turbine <b>pump</b> bearings and prevent leakage of brine into the turbine-pump unit.

40|$|Lubrication {{systems and}} {{equipment}} are essential components of manufacturing and industrial machinery and technology. They are used to provide and apply controlled or metered amounts of lubricant to a part or piece of equipment. Companies that provide lubrication equipment are often capable of creating, and may specialize in, custom units of lubrication technology. Lubrication systems are useful in many industries, including packaging, printing, water and sewage pumping, textiles, food processing, chemical processing, mining, brewing and bottling, pellet mills and machinery production. Some of the equipment for which lubrication systems are used includes dies, chains, cables, rails, gears, pumps and any other moving and rotating parts commonly found on conveyer or assembly machinery. To ensure reliable and efficient operation of such equipment, these moving parts often need a constant supply of lubricating fluids, and the lubrication system is able to provide this at the proper temperature, viscosity, flow rate and pressure. Other, more specific examples of machinery that uses lubricants include rock crushers, gearboxes, large blowers and fans, turbines and industrial centrifuges. The most important components of a lubricating system are the reservoir, pump and filter. The reservoir is {{the area in which}} the lubricant is stored after coming back from the area it <b>lubricates.</b> The <b>pump</b> is used to move the lubricant through the system and into areas that need to be lubricated.

40|$|An elastohydrodynamic {{analysis}} of a rotary lip seal is performed numerically, incorporating both the fluid mechanics of the lubricating film and the elastic deformation of the lip, by solving the Reynolds equation with flow factors. Asperities on the lip surface dominate {{the behavior of the}} flow field in the lubricating film and the elastic deformation of the lip. Since previous analyses treated those asperities deterministically, they required very large computation times. The present approach is much less computationally intensive because the asperities are treated statistically. Since cavitation and asperity orientation play important roles, these are taken into account in the computation of the flow factors. An asperity distortion analysis is introduced to obtain a more realistic model of the complex variations in the asperity distribution {{on the surface of the}} seal. Results of the analysis show how the operating parameters of the seal and the characteristics of the asperities affect such seal characteristics as the thickness of the <b>lubricating</b> film, reverse <b>pumping</b> rate, power dissipation and load carrying capacity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to provide design and {{operational}} information for the conversion of small turboprop engines into land-based shaft power drives. These can provide economical solutions to individual power requirements such as standby electrical generators, {{combined heat and power}} units, fan drives or centrifugal compressor drives. Considerable numbers of ex-military engines are currently becoming available at economical prices. One such engine is the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop gas turbine which, although there are over 2000 still in civil and military service worldwide, is now being phased out of Royal Air Force operation. This paper describes the modification of a Dart RDa 12 engine to drive a centrifugal compressor from a smaller RDa 7, Mk 552, engine for a compressed air facility on a university campus. The modified engine has a power of over 2400 hp (1790 kW) at 15000 r/min and the compressor was driven directly from the engine output shaft supplying 10. 5 kg/s of air at a pressure ration of 3. 3 : 1. To achieve this, the turboprop's main reduction gearbox was removed, the teeth on the engine drive pinion ground down and a flexible coupling fitted to it to drive the RDa 7 compressor which was flange mounted on the engine gearbox-air intake casing. The removal of the main gearbox removed the drives to the <b>lubricating</b> oil <b>pumps</b> the fuel pump and the engine control system. The manner in which these problems were overcome and the method of operating the system are described. One of the most important considerations in starting such a direct drive system is the complete closing off of the air intake to the driven compressor and the design of an annular valve to perform this duty is described.

50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} {{of light}} fuel oil, very similar to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to <b>lubricate</b> the injector <b>pump</b> and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, cetane number). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} world {{demand for}} oil has pushed oil companies to extract it from the ocean at extreme depths. With the increase in depth comes an increase in operation costs, especially the deep-sea equipment changeover cost. To be able to push the oil to the ocean surface, Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) are commonly used as artificial lift. The changeover cost of these pumps in deep-water has been estimated to sometimes {{be as much as}} forty times the cost of a new pump. One common reason for the failure of ESPs is the erosion and abrasion created by the fine sands that seep through the gravel pack mesh in the well hole. These fine sand particles are most destructive to the bearings and bushings due to their capability to enter the clearances <b>lubricated</b> by the <b>pumped</b> fluid. Over time, the sustained abrasion and erosion in the different components of the ESP will affect the performance of the pump and could lead to its damage. This work describes the design, construction and evaluation of an erosion test rig built at the facilities of the Turbomachinery Laboratory in Texas A&M University. The test rig is capable of introducing 100 mesh (6 mil) sand into the flow loop, measure its concentration and separate it at the exit with minimal water loss. The pump under study is a Baker Hughes 10. 25 " WJE 1000. The performance of the pump is described by measuring the head, flow rate, power and efficiency. The pump is equipped with accelerometers to detect the casing vibration as well as proximity probes in five locations along the pump to detect the internal vibrations of the shaft near the bearings as well as impeller radial movement.

40|$|LectureSide channel pumps {{typically}} {{are used in}} applications with low specific speed. The ratio of the low flow and high head tends to result in this niche product, located in between the classical displacement and centrifugal pumps, but uniting the advantages of both. ?Best experience {{in the design of}} these multistage ring section pumps is in using bearing bushings in the stages that are <b>lubricated</b> by the <b>pumping</b> media itself. This guarantees them to be low in service and maintenance time and cost and the pump has no need for another lubricant which contaminates the pumped media. The side channel pumps are a good solution for use with low density (below 5. 8 lb/gal / 700 kg/m 3), and low viscosity hydrocarbons (lower than 4. 3 e- 8 lbf s/in 2 / 0. 3 cP), e. g. in fracking applications or petro- chemical use. The investigated side channel pump is able to generate and handle high pressures at low flows, but in a number of hydrocarbon applications with low viscosities, low NPSH-values or with relatively high percentage of entrained gas, some material failure in the bearings is discovered. ?The working principle of the pump and the performance characteristic is briefly explained. One of those characteristics is a highly transient pulsating pressure, resulting in high forces on the shaft and the impeller. The reasons for the pulsation and some methods to deal with the resulting forces are shown and explained. The high radial load, together with the low viscosity, could lead to an overload of the standard bearings and material failure. New journal bearings have to be designed. Some other possible solutions and ways to deal with the high forces are shown. ?The head and efficiency curves are tested on a test rig and the results are compared to numerical investigations. The pulsations and the force are determined in numerical investigations. The NPSH-value is measured and an optimized NPSH-impeller is designed and manufactured using Rapid-Prototyping. The newly manufactured impeller is compared to the original design, manufactured in two different ways (sand casting and investment casting). ?In the end, a modified pump, ready for the use in hydrocarbon-processing and fracking applications with amounts of gas and a low NPSH requirement is presented and the characteristics are tested on a test-rig, applying affinity laws...|$|R
