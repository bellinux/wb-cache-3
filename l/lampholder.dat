50|$|Lightbulb sockets, {{light sockets}} lamp sockets or <b>lampholders</b> provide {{electrical}} {{connections to the}} lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of sockets allows lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for these <b>lampholders,</b> created by de facto and by various standards bodies. A general coding system is a letter or abbreviation followed by a number. Some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to wires; some reflector lamps have screw terminals for wire connections.|$|R
25|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the cost of electricity for lighting was lower than that for other purposes. This led to portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, electric fans, and hair driers) being connected to light bulb sockets using <b>lampholder</b> plugs.|$|E

25|$|Raylite reflectors can {{be added}} to PAR64 and PAR56 lamp {{housings}} to achieve a narrow spot effect. A conventional quartz halogen lamp is used in place of the reflector lamp. A spider or bulb shield may optionally be added, which enhances the parallel nature of the beam and makes it more visible when used with smoke or fog effects. Raylites are generally less rugged than sealed beam bulbs. The lamp can easily shake loose of the <b>lampholder</b> in transit.|$|E

The company acquired Vossloh-Schwabe’s North American operations in 2009. This allowed them to also offer a full range of HID products, ignitors, transformers, <b>lampholders,</b> capacitors, and other components.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{standard}} for lamp sockets {{is published by}} ANSI and developed by NEMA. It is standard number C81.64, titled Guidelines and General Information for Electric Lamp Bases, <b>Lampholders,</b> and Gauges and outlines the dimensions and tolerances of standardized lamp sockets. Lamp bases are standardized in C81.61 Standard for Electrical Lamp Bases - Specifications for Bases (Caps) for Electric Lamps. [...] Both standards are harmonized with IEC standard 600061 and include dimensional data sheets as printed in the IEC standard.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>lampholder</b> plug {{fits into}} the bayonet cap or Edison screw socket of a <b>lampholder</b> {{in place of a}} light bulb and enables an {{electrical}} appliance to be powered from a wall or ceiling light fitting. As mentioned in Early History above, they were first introduced in the late 1800s and in use to the 1960s in situations where wall sockets were scarce and sometimes non-existent in some rooms (bathrooms, cellars, attics, etc.). Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, <b>lampholder</b> plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|E
2500|$|An early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} was invented by Harvey Hubbell and patented in 1904.

2500|$|A {{prominent}} landmark is the Edwardian Town Hall, built 1905-1910, {{a sumptuous}} building [...] "the most convincing {{expression in the}} county of Edwardian prosperity". The architect was E. E. Fetch of London. Ornamentation includes several references to the town's nautical heritage: Britannia and other sculpted figures in the pediment above the front entrance, a figure of Mercury atop a globe on {{the dome of the}} Council chamber, fountains and nymph <b>lampholders</b> in the forecourt alongside a statue of Queen Victoria. The 145-foot clock tower contains a Potts chiming clock and five bells, and is topped by a weathervane {{in the shape of a}} galleon.|$|R
5000|$|In debt, Pierre Mérault {{sold the}} estate in 1684 to Clair Gilbert d'Ornaison known as Chamarande, top [...] "valet de chambre" [...] to Louis XIV. The {{year after the}} sale, Louis {{promoted}} Bonnes into the [...] "county of Charamande" [...] by letters patent. At d'Ornaison's death in 1737, the château passed to his first cousin and heir, Louis de Talaru, marquis de Chalmazel, maître d'hôtel of queen Marie Leszczyńska. The architect Pierre Contant d'Ivry worked on the château for de Talaru, building new service quarters beyond the secondary route near the village, and to the estate added an orangery, a belvédère, an oval bosquet for [...] "Jeu de l'oie" [...] with a temple of love at its centre and a cascatelle. He demolished {{the wall of the}} courtyard along the moat and put an ironwork gate with two <b>lampholders</b> in front of the bridge. He also modernised the interior decor, creating a little salon gros near the vestibule and the grand salon d'angle.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this program {{was to develop a}} ballast system for plug-in CFLs (compact {{fluorescent}} lamps) that will directly replace standard metal shell, medium base incandescent <b>lampholders</b> (such as Levition No. 6098) for use with portable lamp fixtures, such as floor, table and desk lamps. A secondary goal was to identify a plug-in CFL that is optimized for use with this ballast. This Plug-in CFL Ballastin-a-Socket system will allow fixture manufacturers to easily manufacture CFL-based high-efficacy portable fixtures that provide residential and commercial consumers with attractive, cost-effective, and energy-efficient fixtures for use wherever portable incandescent fixtures are used today. The advantages of this proposed system over existing CFL solutions are that the fixtures can only be used with high-efficacy CFLs, and they will be more attractive and will have lower life-cycle costs than screw-in or adapter-based CFL retrofit solutions. These features should greatly increase the penetration of CFL's into the North American market. Our work has shown that using integrated circuits it is quite feasible to produce a lamp-fixture ballast of a size comparable to the current Edison-screw 3 -way incandescent fixtures. As for price points for BIAS-based fixtures, end-users polled by the Lighting Research Institute at RPI indicated that they would pay as much as an additional $ 10 for a lamp containing such a ballast. The ballast has been optimized to run with a 26 W amalgam triple biax lamp in the base-down position, yet can accept non-amalgam versions of the lamp. With a few part alterations, the ballast can be produced to support 32 W lamps as well. The ballast uses GE's existing L-Comp[1] power topology in the circuit so that the integrated circuit design would be a design that could possibly be used by other CFL and EFL products with minor modifications. This gives added value by reducing cost and size of not only the BIAS, but also possibly other integral CFL and future dimmable integral and plug-in versions of the EFL products...|$|R
2500|$|Several early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} arrangements were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin plugs and adaptors for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a <b>lampholder</b> (like the early <b>lampholder</b> plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an adaptor plugged into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows <b>lampholder</b> adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar flat pin plugs. The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|E
2500|$|Where the {{building}} wiring system defines a [...] "neutral" [...] conductor that {{is close to}} earth potential, it is an advantage for appliance designers to preserve that distinction. For example, appliances may ensure single-pole switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or ensure that screw-base <b>lampholder</b> shells {{are connected to the}} neutral side of the supply, minimizing the chance of contact with live parts. This requires a plug that can only be connected in one way to the socket, so that the energised and neutral conductors are not interchanged. In most designs, such [...] "polarized" [...] plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth do not benefit from polarized plugs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} domestic {{plug and}} socket {{is believed to be}} that patented by T.T. Smith in 1883. [...] This was shortly followed by patents from WB Sayers and G Hookham; these early designs had rectangular plugs with contact plates on either side. In 1885, two-pin plug designs appeared and in 1889 there were two-pin plugs and sockets in the GEC catalogue. [...] The 1893 GEC Catalogue included 3 sizes of what was described as Double plug Sockets with capacities described not in amps, but as 1 to 5 lights, 5 to 10 lights and 10 to 20 lights. [...] These were clearly recognisable as two-pin plugs and sockets, but with no indication as to pin size or spacing, they were sold as pairs. [...] The same catalogue included <b>lampholder</b> plugs for both BC and ES lampholders (capacity unspecified), and also a type of two-pole concentric {{plug and socket}} (similar to a very large versions of the concentric connectors used for laptop PC power connections) in the 1 to 5 lights and 5 to 10 lights capacities. [...] Crompton and Company introduced the first two-pin socket with protective shutters in 1893, the Edison Swan Company was also manufacturing two-pin plug and sockets in the 1890s.|$|E
