5|$|The {{origins of}} the myth can be found first in Rommel's drive for success as a young officer in World War I, and then in his popular 1937 book Infanterie Greift An (Infantry Attacks) that was written in a style that diverged from the German {{military}} <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.

5|$|According to Hossein Nasr, the {{earliest}} European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. A few learned circles of Middle Ages Europeprimarily Latin-literate scholarshad access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad {{as a person}} who seduced the Saracens into his submission under religious guise. Popular European <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time portrayed Muhammad as though he were worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.|$|E
5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E

5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of <b>Literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E
