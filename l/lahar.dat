5|$|The {{volcanic}} risk {{is somewhat}} mitigated by <b>lahar</b> warning sirens and escape route signs in Pierce County. The more populous King County {{is also in}} the <b>lahar</b> area, but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard. More recently (since 2001) funding from the federal government for <b>lahar</b> protection in the area has dried up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons from}} the Armero tragedy have {{inspired}} a <b>lahar</b> warning system for Mt. Rainier, which has a similar potential for lahars.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major explosive eruption where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, volcanic glass, and scoria of red tone. Thirteen craters, all {{located in the}} fissure, contributed to this episode. All are most likely phreatic. During the eruption, pyroclastic flows convened with tephra, as suggested by deposits. <b>Lahar</b> also streamed from the summit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lahars</b> (a type of mudflow of {{pyroclastic}} material and water) {{are an important}} hazard on the mountain, and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. <b>Lahars</b> can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which <b>lahars</b> are often generated.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens, <b>lahars</b> (volcanically-induced mud and debris flows) swept through its channel. About 135 mi of stream channels around the volcano {{were affected by}} <b>lahars.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since these events, Glacier Peak has {{produced}} several <b>lahars.</b> The largest events were 5,900 and 1,800 {{years ago and}} were associated with dome-building eruptions. In both cases, the <b>lahars</b> traveled down the Skagit River to Puget Sound.|$|R
5|$|One of the lahars {{virtually}} {{erased the}} small town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived. The second <b>lahar,</b> which descended through the valley of Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchiná, in the department of Caldas. In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed. The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history. It is also the deadliest known <b>lahar,</b> and Colombia's worst natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|Vesuvius {{entered a}} new phase in December 1631, when a major {{eruption}} buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of <b>lahar</b> were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>lahar</b> {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E
40|$|Remnants of five catastrophic <b>lahars</b> {{have been}} discovered, described, and dated by the carbon- 14 method.

5000|$|The eye of Durian passed near Mayon Volcano as {{it struck}} the Bicol region. In the mountainous region, {{a process known}} as {{orographic}} lift produced heavier rainfall than near the coast, with totals possibly as high as 600 mm (24 in). On November 30, the rainfall became very heavy and prolonged, saturating the soil. <b>Lahars</b> [...] - [...] a type of landslide originating from a volcanic ash [...] - [...] formed quickly along the southern and eastern rims of Mayon Volcano, which had produced a fresh layer of ash in August 2006. The <b>lahars</b> destroyed dykes and dams meant to contain the debris flow, which were not designed to prevent major landslides. Warnings were issued for potential <b>lahars,</b> but the rapid development of the debris flows as well as power outages meant populations did not receive adequate warning. Initially, the <b>lahars</b> were contained by a layer of grasslands, although the unstable nature of the volcanic soil caused the grounds to collapse. Within 21 minutes, the <b>lahars</b> descended Mayon Volcano, quickly covering and wrecking six communities. After the initial series of <b>lahars,</b> further ash flow descended to the ocean to the north of Mayon Volcano.|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{although}} <b>lahars</b> {{are typically}} associated {{with the effects of}} volcanic activity, <b>lahars</b> can occur even without any current volcanic activity, as long as the conditions are right to cause the collapse and movement of mud originating from existing volcanic ash deposits.|$|R
5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older <b>lahar</b> deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old <b>lahar</b> deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a {{small lake}} that {{was observed in}} Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the <b>lahar</b> flow.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the <b>lahar</b> {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>lahars</b> were {{produced}} repeatedly, scientists {{realized that they}} could use these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed to measure the movement of rocks against each other. This device, now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor, alerts nearby stations to possible <b>lahars.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Lahars</b> are {{extremely}} destructive: they can flow tens of metres per second (22 mph or more), be 140 m deep, and destroy any structures in their path. Notable <b>lahars</b> include those at Mount Pinatubo and Nevado del Ruiz, {{the latter of}} which killed thousands of people.|$|R
500|$|The {{collapse}} of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create <b>lahars</b> (volcanic mudflows). The <b>lahars</b> flowed many miles down the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers, destroying bridges and lumber camps. A total of [...] of material was transported [...] south into the Columbia River by the mudflows.|$|R
5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the <b>lahar</b> that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected {{enormous}} amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a <b>lahar</b> at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E
25|$|After the 1996 {{eruption}} it was recognised that {{a catastrophic}} <b>lahar</b> could again occur when Crater Lake bursts the volcanic ash dam blocking the lake outlet. This {{is the same}} mechanism that caused the 1953 <b>lahar.</b> The lake gradually filled with snowmelt and had reached {{the level of the}} hard rock rim by January 2005. The <b>lahar</b> finally occurred on 18 March 2007 (see below).|$|E

25|$|The 1945 {{eruption}} emptied Crater Lake and dammed {{the outlet}} with tephra. The crater slowly refilled with water, until on 24 December 1953 the tephra dam collapsed causing a <b>lahar</b> in the Whangaehu River. The <b>lahar</b> caused the Tangiwai disaster, {{with the loss}} of 151 lives, when the Tangiwai railway bridge across the Whangaehu River collapsed while the <b>lahar</b> was in full flood, just before an express train crossed it.|$|E

The Department of Conservation had received warning signals from the <b>lahar</b> warning system (ERLAWS) at around 10:30 that morning and closed all major roads in the area, preventing thousands of motorists from travelling, and shut down the main rail system for the North Island. The river banks held and no spill overs occurred. No serious damage was done {{and no one was}} injured.

5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous <b>lahars</b> such as the one generated by the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia.

In 1991, damage to crops and property was estimated at $374 million, to which continuing <b>lahar</b> floods added a further $69 million in 1992. 42 percent of the cropland around the volcano was affected by more <b>lahar</b> floods, dealing a severe blow to the agricultural economy in the region.|$|E

25|$|Large volcano-associated debris flows {{known as}} <b>lahars</b> {{pose a threat}} to {{populated}} areas downstream from glaciated volcanoes. Although <b>lahars</b> are typically associated with the effects of volcanic eruptions, they can occur whenever conditions allow collapse and movement of mud originating from existing volcanic ash deposits. Melting snow and ice, intense rainfall or the breakout of a summit crater lake can all generate <b>lahars.</b> Landslides at Mount Meager may also be indirectly related to climate change. Several tension cracks extend up to the summit, and as global warming causes glaciers to melt, the meltwater reaches deep into the massif. It then flows along the ruptured surfaces making these landslide zones.|$|R
