60|$|I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it,</b> for at best such a spell {{must have}} been brief indeed; and for that I pity her--I, who once blamed her so very bitterly. Before ever I was born it must have ceased; whilst still she bore me she put from her lips the cup that holds the warm and potent wine of life, and turned her once more to her fasting, her contemplations, and her prayers.|$|E

[...] "Well, {{for the most}} part, I have been a slave to my notions of {{efficiency}} and order since I was a boy; but at times other feelings rebelled. Then I, so to speak, ran loose and broke things, {{like the rest of}} mankind. Moreover, I'm not repentant when I look back on the short-lived outbreaks.

The last time she was able to talk to me, she showed me the cross still round her neck, and said she should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be as much comfort to any one else as it had been to her.

5000|$|The chief {{opponents to}} the {{proposed}} division of the county comes from the residents of south Fulton County, {{who say that the}} proposed separation is racially motivated.

[...] "If it gets to the floor, there will be blood on the walls", Fort stated.

60|$|Do {{you know}} the outer look and aspect of the banana plant? If not, then you have never voyaged to those delusive tropics. Tropical vegetation, as ordinarily {{understood}} by poets and painters, consists entirely of the coco-nut palm and the banana bush. Do you wish to paint a beautiful picture of a rich ambrosial tropical island, à la Tennyson--a summer isle of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea?--then you introduce a group of coco-nuts, whispering in odorous heights of even, in the very foreground of your pretty sketch, just to let your public understand at a glance {{that these are the}} delicious poetical tropics. Do you desire to create an ideal paradise, à la Bernardin de St. Pierre, where idyllic Virginies die of pure modesty rather than appear before the eyes of their beloved but unwedded Pauls in a lace-bedraped peignoir?--then you strike the keynote by sticking in the middle distance a hut or cottage, overshadowed by the broad and graceful foliage of the picturesque banana. ('Hut' is a poor and chilly word for these glowing descriptions, far inferior to the pretty and high-sounding original chaumière.) That is how we do the tropics when we want to work upon the emotions of the reader. But it is all a delicate theatrical illusion; a trick of art meant to deceive and impose upon the unwary who have never been there, and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> all genuine. In reality, nine times out of ten, you might cast your eyes casually around you in any tropical valley, and, if there didn't happen to be a native cottage with a coco-nut grove and banana patch anywhere in the neighbourhood, you would see nothing in the way of vegetation which you mightn't see at home any day in Europe. But what painter would ever venture to paint the tropics without the palm trees? He might just as well try to paint the desert without the camels, or to represent St. Sebastian without a sheaf of arrows sticking unperceived in the calm centre of his unruffled bosom, to mark and emphasise his Sebastianic personality.|$|E

Writing for Variety, Leslie Felperin says that [...] "Barry Stone's lensing, favoring a soft, Northern-climes afternoon light for the sex scenes in particular, looks dreamy throughout", but that [...] "with its drawn-out last act and sentimental ending, this pic {{is a long}} way from being the Gen-Y [...] "Last Tango in Paris" [...] it would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|E
50|$|Othello {{is such a}} {{difficult}} part:I had this fantasy, and I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> probably very near the truth, that Shakespeare and Burbage went out on a binge one night, each trying to outdrink the other, the yards of ale slipping down their throats and thickening their tongues. Just before one or other slid under the alehouse table, Burbage looked at Shakespeare and said, 'I can play anything you write - anything at all'. And Shakespeare said, 'Right, I'll fix you, boy', and wrote Othello for him. I'm sure something like that must have happened.|$|R

5000|$|The film {{received}} largely negative reviews. The Big Wedding holds a 7% {{rating on}} Rotten Tomatoes based on 102 reviews with the sites consensus stating that its [...] "all-star cast is stranded in a contrived, strained plot that features broad stabs at humor but few laughs." [...] On Metacritic, the film scores 28% based on reviews from 32 critics. One observer {{pointed out that}} The Big Weddings reviews are among {{the worst of the}} year. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Id rather gouge my eyes out with hot spoons! De Niro exclaims at one point. Im not sure exactly what he was talking about, but Id <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> referred to the prospect of being forced to watch The Big Wedding." ...|$|E
5000|$|What do you {{remember}} about that infamous tackle by Terry Lamb?"I don’t {{know if it was}} caused by Terry Lamb, or if it was just my head hitting the ground. I couldn’t tell you because I have never looked at it since. Some people have said Terry got a good shot on me. I suspect, however, it was more a case of my head hitting the ground. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was accidental. Afterwards, I was concussed and didn’t know where I was. I didn’t regain all my faculties immediately so, from a safety point of view, I had to come off the football field. It was a shame, but it is a physical game and sometimes things like that happen." ...|$|E
5000|$|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace is Richard Brautigan's fifth poetry publication. Like {{several of}} his early works, the entire edition (of 1,500 copies) was {{distributed}} for free. The title poem envisions a world where cybernetics has advanced to a stage where it allows {{a return to the}} balance of nature and an elimination of the need for human labor. All thirty-two of the poems in this collection were republished in The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> (<b>it</b> has to be!) of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over by machines of loving grace.Excerpt from All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (1967) ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} writing the song by MTV News, guitarist James McVey explained: [...] "We really enjoyed making {{previous}} single Can We Dance but with Wild Heart {{we kind of}} experimented more with musical genre {{in the sense that}} we added a banjo and mandolin. We <b>like</b> <b>to</b> try and push ourselves into directions to try new things really and we've gone for more of a folky vibe so we hope people <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> We <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a feel good song I guess." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson admitted that the song [...] "influenced the rest of the album sound almost just because it was such a key song for us." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{regard to}} {{her role as}} a woman editor, Sixel has stated that she doesn't {{consider}} her gender to be relevant in the editing process.

We don't <b>think</b> about <b>it.</b> I'm really into cutting film, and while George Miller <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a positive, I don't feel very female about it." [...] In regard to her editorial team, Sixel has noted that 25 percent of her staff are women. Additionally, throughout her entire career working with Miller, Jason Ballantine has been her first assistant and additional editor on every feature film since Babe: Pig in the City in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|Raised without religion, in 1986, Suchet {{underwent}} a religious conversion after reading Romans 8 {{in a hotel}} Bible; soon afterwards, he was baptised into the Church of England. Suchet stated {{in an interview with}} Strand Magazine, [...] "I'm a Christian by faith. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> sees me through a great deal of my life. I very much believe in the principles of Christianity and the principles of most religions, actually—that one has to abandon oneself to a higher good." [...] In 2012, Suchet made a documentary for the BBC on his personal hero, Saint Paul, to discover what he was like as a man by charting his evangelistic journey around the Mediterranean. Two years later, he would film another documentary, this time on the apostle Saint Peter.|$|E

In 1976, his entry to the Chicago International Film Festival garnered the First Place Award for Animated Television Commercials.Later, while creating numerous freelance assignments for the recording industry the marketing departments {{of some of the}} major Hollywood studios began to take note. [...] "A turning point came" [...] relates the artist, [...] "with the creation of a movie poster design for the film Lassiter starring Tom Selleck and Jane Seymour."

50|$|Jeffrey Hazard {{was about}} 23 {{years old when}} he married a 17-year-old named Delight Wilbour (or Wilbur, or Wilbor). Again, records are in {{conflict}} about whether Delight and her younger sister Prudence were born in Rhode Island or Dutchess County. The year after the marriage, Delight died (1795). It is possible her death was related to childbirth, but we do not know. The following year, Jeffrey married her sister Prudence, who {{could not have been more}} than 17 herself at that time. When Jeffrey and Prudence’s first baby was a boy, they named him Hazard. He would father nine children and live to the age of 72. When Hazard was 2½, a baby sister was born. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was her mother who gave her the name Delight in honor of her lost sister—not Jeffrey naming his daughter after his first wife. Three and a half years later, in November 1802, twins George and Allis joined the family.3 A brother John was born in 1808.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the birth}} of her {{daughter}} in 2006 she suffered from postpartum depression, a period she then addressed in her memoir, Black Milk: on Motherhood, Writing and the Harem Within which combines fiction and non-fiction genres. Şafak has commented concerning the book: [...] "I named this book Black Milk for two reasons. First, it deals with postpartum depression and shows that mother's milk is not always as white and spotless as society <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is. Second, out of that depression I was able to get an inspiration; out of that black milk I was able to develop some sort of ink."In an interview with William Skidelsky for The Guardian, she said: [...] "In Turkey, men write and women read. I want to see this change." ...|$|R
