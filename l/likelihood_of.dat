40|$|This study's {{goal was}} {{to examine the effects of}} nursing home (NH) and county racial mix on quality of care in NHs. We {{examined}} quality indicator (QI) outcomes for residents in 408 urban New York NHs in July through September, 1995. The QI outcomes studied were restraint and antipsychotic drug use (for low and high-risk residents), and at study commencement, these QIs were being used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to monitor the quality of care in USA Medicare and/or Medicaid-certified NHs. A hierarchical modeling approach was used to properly reflect the nesting of both residents within NHs and NHs within counties. Separate regression models were fit to the two strata of interest (Urban Non-Hispanic Whites and Urban African Americans) to test, for each race group, the effect on quality of residing in NHs and counties with higher proportions of African Americans (than state medians). Descriptive analyses found that, compared to Whites, the unadjusted restraint rate was lower for African Americans while the antipsychotic drug rate was higher. For both race groups, multi-level analyses showed residence in for-profit NHs was associated with higher <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> being restrained, and of receiving antipsychotic drugs. Also, for both race groups, residence in NHs with higher proportions of African-Americans was associated with lower <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> being restrained and with higher, statistically nonsignificant, <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> receiving antipsychotic drugs. Higher NH nurse staffing ratios were associated with higher <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> being restrained and with lower <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> antipsychotic drug use (statistically significant for low-risk African-Americans). Findings support the notion that differential care is provided in USA NHs caring for higher proportions of African-American residents and thereby suggest intervention at the organizational level is warranted to improve QI outcomes for both race groups.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we take a}} {{different}} modeling approach based on the component driven (CD) model developed in Kuan, Huang, and Tsay~(2003) to test the permanent income hypothesis (PIH), an example of intertemporal choice models. A key feature {{of this approach is}} that it explicitly allows for state uncertainty. By assuming that the labor income follows a CD process, we show that the agent's perception on the <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> income innovations being permanent and transitory plays a crucial role in determining the optimal forecasts on the change of consumption. In particular, the effect of a current innovation is a weighted average of two distinct effects (resulted from permanent and transitory innovations), with the weights being the perceived <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> respective states. Also, past innovations may affect consumption when there is a revision on the perceived <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> previous states. If there is no state uncertainty, our result reduces to that of an existing model. Our empirical study shows that, while the CD model can characterize the U. S. consumption data well, the estimation results do not agree with the predictions of the PIHcomponent driven model, intertemporal choice model, permanent income hypothesis, permanent innovation, state uncertainty, transitory innovation...|$|R
