5|$|Painted illuminations in Balthasar Behem Codex are of {{exceptional}} quality, but draw their inspiration <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> Gothic art. Stanisław Samostrzelnik, a monk in the Cistercian monastery in Mogiła near Kraków, painted miniatures and polychromed wall frescos.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Chinese Daoism, {{ancestor}} worship, and foreign-originated Buddhism {{were the}} most prominent religious practices in the Song period. Daoism developed <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> {{the teachings of the}} Daodejing, attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ("Old Master"), considered one of the Three Pure Ones (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by Yuezhi, Persian, and Kushan missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|Dairy {{products}} such as milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, buttermilk and cheese are manufactured <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used {{in some parts of}} the world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo milk is used to make mozzarella in Italy and gulab jamun dessert in India, while sheep milk is used to make blue Roquefort cheese in France.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) {{did not leave}} behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.|$|E
5|$|Religion in Jersey has {{a complex}} history, drawn <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> {{different}} Christian denominations. In 2015, Jersey's first ever {{national survey of}} religion found that two fifths of Jersey people have no religion, with only small handfuls of Jersey people belonging to the non-Christian religions. In total, 54% said they had some form of religion, and 7% were not sure.|$|E

5|$|The English Parliament granted him {{an annual}} income {{to run the}} {{government}} of £1.2million, generated <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> customs and excise duties. The grant, however, proved to be insufficient for most of Charles's reign. For the most part, the actual revenue was much lower, which led to attempts to economise at court by reducing the size and expenses of the royal household and raise money through unpopular innovations such as the hearth tax.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean had at {{this time}} fallen {{into the hands of}} pirates, <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> Cilicia. The pirates not only strangled {{shipping}} lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia. Pompey was nominated as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates. It took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates and restore communication between Iberia (Spain), Africa, and Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{densities of}} wood turtle populations {{have also been}} studied. In the {{northern}} portion of its range (Quebec and other areas of Canada), populations are fairly dilute, containing an average of 0.44 individuals per , while in the south, over the same area, the densities varied <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> 6 to 90 turtles. In addition to this, {{it has been found}} that colonies often have more females than males.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} diversities of bovids {{occur in}} Africa. The maximum concentration of species {{is in the}} savannas of eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Bovidae includes {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese are manufactured <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> domestic cattle. Bovids also provide leather, meat, and wool.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} {{found in}} the Liber physiognomiae {{seems to have been}} derived <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> Arabic copies of Aristotelian and Pseudo-Aristotelian works. The work was written in the early 13th century for Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor, but was first officially printed in 1477. Liber physiognomiae would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} summoned {{everyone in}} the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary's, but found {{that no one was}} certain of Jennings's role in the commission. After a short debate, the House passed a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|Thus, a {{political}} wire-puller such as Grigori Rasputin enjoys power best when playing off another person's hereditary power, {{or when the}} organisation benefits <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> an air of mystery. By contrast, the wirepuller suffers a wane in power when the organizational élite {{is made up of}} competent individuals (Russell 1938:34).|$|E
5|$|After Marius, {{the legions}} were drawn <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> {{volunteer}} citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers {{came forward and}} were accepted not from citizens {{of the city of}} Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as veterans, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> the hardcore {{scene in the}} 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which {{laid the groundwork for}} underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{attempt to}} bring a {{professional}} ice hockey team to Nottingham was made in 1939 following {{the completion of the}} Ice Stadium in Nottingham City Centre. A team was assembled and brought to the United Kingdom from Canada to compete in the 1939–40 English National League season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3–2 home victory over the Wembley Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film <b>largely</b> <b>from</b> such a perspective.|$|E
