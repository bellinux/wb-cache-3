40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The {{non-contact}} seal technology, {{referred to}} as clearance seals, is used in linear compressors and promises to maintain the linear compressor for long life operation. The present effort analyzes the aerodynamics in the small clearance package with the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FluentTM. Two types of the clearances, the <b>linear</b> <b>seal</b> and the labyrinth seal, are modeled, and the results, such as the pressure and velocity distribution, are described. The clearance loss was quantitatively compared by changing inflation pressure and the gap of the clearance. The results {{will be used to}} optimize the design of the linear compressor in the future...|$|R
50|$|A gland is {{a general}} type of {{stuffing}} box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in {{the head of a}} tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The <b>linear</b> <b>seal</b> around the piston rod of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.|$|R
40|$|Inflatable space {{structures}} {{have the}} potential to significantly reduce the required launch volume for large pressure vessels required for exploration applications including habitats, airlocks and tankage. In addition, mass savings can be achieved via the use of high specific strength softgoods materials, and the reduced design penalty from launching the structure in a densely packaged state. Large inclusions however, such as hatches, induce a high mass penalty at the interfaces with the softgoods and in the added rigid structure while reducing the packaging efficiency. A novel, Non-Axisymmetric Inflatable Pressure Structure (NAIPS) was designed and recently tested at NASA Langley Research Center to demonstrate an elongated inflatable architecture that could provide areas of low stress along a principal axis in the surface. These low stress zones will allow the integration of a flexible <b>linear</b> <b>seal</b> that substantially reduces the added mass and volume of a heritage rigid hatch structure. This paper describes the test of the first full-scale engineering demonstration unit (EDU) of the NAIPS geometry and a comparison of the results to finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, fire {{resistance}} of <b>linear</b> joints <b>seal</b> made of elastomer spacers under standard fire conditions, and thermal degradation range of EPDM elastomeric spacers are investigated. The geometry of elastomer spacer joints {{is important not}} only for their load capacity under normal conditions - thickness, width, and cavity depth can also influence {{fire resistance}} performance. Linear joints of different thicknesses and widths have been tested. The fire insulation and fire integrity were verified for various arrangements. Relatively low thermal degradation rates have been measured, given that EPDM is a combustible material...|$|R

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} flow field in a <b>linear</b> brush <b>seal</b> configuration is modeled {{and the flow}} field determined numerically using an FEM model consisting of a matrix of 6 x 6 uniformly spaced circular bristles with a uniform flow field upstream of the simulated brush element. Results from the numerical model are compared to earlier work for a circular seal of similar configuration. Temporal disturbance of the upstream flow field is studied to elucidate system dynamics; however, only the local velocity field is investigated. The effect of tangential flow at the upstream boundary is also studied. Tangential flow produces changes in the pressure applied to the bristle but has {{little effect on the}} axial flow rates...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{visualize}} and characterize the complex flow fields in simulated brush seals is presented. The brush seal configuration was {{tested in a}} water and then in an oil tunnel. The visualization procedure revealed typical regions that are rivering, jetting, vortical or lateral flows and exist upstream, downstream or within the seal. Such flows are engendered by variations in fiber void that are spatial and temporal and affect changes in seal leakage and stability. While the effects of interface motion for linear or cylindrical configurations have not been considered herein, {{it is believed that}} the observed flow fields characterize flow phenomenology in both circular and <b>linear</b> brush <b>seals.</b> The axial pressure profiles upstream, across and downstream of the brush in the oil tunnel have been measured under a variety of inlet pressure conditions and the ensuing pressure maps are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Actuators {{for control}} and {{articulation}} aboard Mariner spacecraft have employed output shaft seals {{to maintain an}} internal gaseous atmosphere. On future missions, considerably greater expected lifetimes, temperature ranges, and radiation exposures {{have led to a}} need to determine the limitations of the present O-ring output shaft seal and to examine other candidate seals. Seals suited both to dynamic and static sealing were examined for potential use in three specific actuator applications and the following candidate seals were selected: (a) O-ring seal, (b) chevron seal, (c) bellows <b>seal</b> (<b>linear</b> actuator only), (d) magnetic fluid seal (rotary actuators only) and as a backup seal to any of the foregoing, (e) the labyrinth seal...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiple}} beam interference {{of parallel}} layers and/or the Bragg peaks of multilayers are {{measured in the}} angle-resolved dispersive mode with a position sensitive proportional counter. The specimen is illuminated by a divergent X-ray beam produced by a <b>sealed</b> <b>linear</b> focus tube. The arrangement permits either to obtain spectra {{in a short time}} and to eliminate any movement during measurement. Furthermore, this configuration has the advantage of analysing a small surface area of the specimen (less than 1 mm 2). Consequently, a scanning of a layer or a multilayer is possible. Both examples concerning a deposited layer and a multilayer will be given, showing variation in thickness according to the distance between the sputtering or evaporation system and the sample holder...|$|R
30|$|Photoelectrochemical {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760 E, Chen Hua Instruments Co. Ltd.). A three-electrode system was employed with a FTO as a working electrode (photoelectrode), an Hg/HgCl 2 /KCL electrode (saturated calomel reference electrode, SCE) as a reference electrode, and a 2.5  cm 2 platinum plate as a counter electrode. All tests were conducted with a self-built 2  cm[*]×[*] 2  cm[*]×[*] 1  cm quartz electrolytic cell in 0.01  M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Ultra violet light Source (MUA- 165, Japan) was used to irradiate the work electrode under UV light (λ: 180 – 420  nm, 15  mW/cm 2). The experimental {{measurements were}} carried out at room temperature without <b>seal.</b> <b>Linear</b> sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded at a scan rate of 50  mV/s. The amperometric i–t curve was recorded to measure photocurrent response under open circuit potential-time with intermittent light irradiation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Technical/Engineering {{aspects of}} Lithium Lens (LL) considered. LL {{dimensions}} and parameters adopted for undulator based positron source for International <b>Linear</b> Collider. <b>Sealing</b> technique for windows represented in this publication also. This publication {{is a part}} of preparation work for numerical modeling of LL. OVERVIEW Usage of Lithium Lens (LL) for positron collection was suggested years ago [1]-[4]. Lithium lens with solid Lithium is in exploitation for decades now. Usage of LL for antiproton collection is also a well developed topic [5]-[11]. Naturally, usage of LL for positron collection in a scheme with undulator [13], developed in Novosibirsk, included LL from the very beginning [14]-[15]. From the other hand usage of LL for positron collection still not a widely accepted idea, so Novosibirsk lens remains the only one in operation. In resent times we applied some efforts to implement LL into ILC positron source [16]-[21]. Development of positron source for ILC as it is now in baseline design described in [22]. Latest results on practical test undulator-based positron source demonstrated positron polarization ~ 80 % and electron polarization ~ 90 % respectively obtained with Tungsten target [23]. Also interesting looks a possibility for implementation of LL for muon collider [24]-[25]. System with Liquid Lithium is under consideration for Fusion Materials Irradiation studies [26]. Current publication is the first one in series dedicated to demonstration of benefits from potential usage of LL in International Linear Collider. Support for this investigation obtained from ILC GDE Regional Directorship of America...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic fluid <b>seal</b> for <b>linear</b> motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic fluid seals have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic fluid seal is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic fluid from the seal clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer. The proposed magnetic fluid seal performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic fluid seal is useful as a <b>linear</b> motion <b>seal,</b> and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{device is}} {{concerned}} with sealing the sliding interfaces between structural panels that are roughly perpendicular to each other or whose edges are butted against one another. The gap which the seal element must seal is not uniform along the seal length requiring significant seal flexibility. The seal is mounted in a rectangular groove in a moveable structural panel. The seal comprises a plurality of rectangular shaped wafers stacked next {{to one another and}} preloaded in the axial direction to minimize leakage between wafers. The wafers are laterally preloaded to maintain sealing contact along the wafer faces which engage the adjacent wall of a sidewall using one of several approaches, such as the pressurized <b>linear</b> bellows. The <b>seal</b> accommodates distortions in the adjacent panel by relative sliding between adjacent wafers. Leakage between wafers is further minimized with good wafer surface finishes. Leakage between the seal nose and the adjacent structural panel is minimized when sealing against a distorted sidewall with relatively thin wafers and suitable seal preload apparatus. Leakage behind the seal is minimized with good groove tolerances and good sealing contact between the preload system and the back of the peripheral edge of the wafers...|$|R
40|$|One {{reason that}} heat {{transfer}} processes {{are not well}} understood is the difficulty of obtaining reliable temperature measurements when gas temperatures vary rapidly. In the work described here gas temperatures have been measured using a fine wire resistance thermometer with a 3. 8 micron active sensor. The equipment represented {{the basic elements of}} a cryocooler: a clearance <b>seal</b> <b>linear</b> compressor and a wire mesh regenerator. Both were operated close to ambient temperature, with gas temperatures being measured close to the regenerator. The test rig was run at different volume ratios, frequencies (8 - 50 Hz), gases and filling pressures (1 - 26 bar). The waveforms of the gas temperature were found to vary dramatically for differing flow regimes. The results suggested that the thermometer was measuring the temperatures of two distinct volumes of gas, and that the gas must remain stratified in the compression space. A flow transition was identified from the cycle-by-cycle variations in temperature. The critical Reynolds number was determined to be 9. 6 - 11. At the critical condition, the temperature was so unstable that fluctuations up to 250 Hz were observed. A series of validation tests have confirmed that the observed temperatures were not artifacts. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
