5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of <b>locational</b> choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species of}} {{cetaceans}} inhabit or migrate through the waters in vicinity, however {{very little about}} their biology in the area is known {{due to lack of}} studies and sighting efforts caused from <b>locational</b> conditions. Bottlenose dolphins are the most commonly observed and is the only species confirmed to be seasonal or yearly residents while some other dolphin species have also been observed. Humpback whales are the only of large whales showing slow but steady recoveries as their numbers annually migrating past the island of Lord Howe are much smaller than that of those migrating along Australian continent.|$|E
5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and <b>locational</b> decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who have been critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
25|$|Directional and <b>locational</b> prefixes can modify many {{anatomical}} and morphological terms, {{sometimes in}} formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.|$|E
25|$|Tariana has two oblique cases: the <b>locational</b> and the instrumental/comitative, {{but only}} nouns may be marked for bot. Pronouns are marked {{only for the}} instrumental/comitative.|$|E
25|$|Demonstratives are {{associated}} either to nouns for reference tracking, {{or have the}} whole clause as their scope. Although they syntactically behave partially like <b>locational</b> adverbs, demonstrative words form a specific paradigm, which is easily identified morphologically.|$|E
25|$|Leaning {{heavily on}} work {{developed}} by the relatively unknown Wilhelm Launhardt, Alfred Weber formulated a least cost theory of industrial location which tries to explain and predict the <b>locational</b> pattern of the industry at a macro-scale. It emphasizes that firms seek a site of minimum transport and labor cost.|$|E
25|$|These <b>locational</b> {{features}} {{can be seen}} {{by considering}} the trilinear or barycentric coordinates given above for the circumcenter: all three coordinates are positive for any interior point, at least one coordinate is negative for any exterior point, and one coordinate is zero and two are positive for a non-vertex point on a side of the triangle.|$|E
25|$|Because oblique {{cases are}} {{inherently}} non-A/Sₐ/S, {{they may be}} double-marked if they serve as {{the topic of the}} sentence as well. The following example is from a hunter's narrative about improving his house, with 'house' being the topic of the narrative. Note that in this sentence, 'house' is marked both as a topical non-A/Sₐ/S and <b>locational.</b>|$|E
25|$|For invertebrates, {{standard}} {{application of}} <b>locational</b> terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when {{the differences in}} morphology are so radical that common concepts are not homologous and do not refer to common concepts. For example, many species are not even bilaterally symmetrical. In these species, terminology depends on their type of symmetry (if any).|$|E
25|$|The lion was {{equipped}} with a satellite tracking device (Africa Wildlife Tracking, GPS Satellite collar) from which <b>locational</b> data were recorded every 2 h. Subsequently, location data was pieced together and is depicted in the map herein. This interpretation of events was corroborated by the subsequent investigation by Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife management and {{is consistent with the}} satellite data.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} simple place cells with purely <b>locational</b> {{correlates}} and also complex place cells that increase their firing rate when the rat encounters a particular object or experience. Others fire when a rat's expectations {{in a particular}} location are not met or when they encounter novelty along their path: the cells that fire in these situations are known as misplace cells.|$|E
25|$|Gilbert Cavan (died 1420) was a cleric based {{primarily}} in Galloway {{in the early}} 15th century, a servant of the earls of Douglas and briefly Bishop of Galloway-elect. His name is also written Caven, Cawan, Caben, with other variants, perhaps representing Gaelic or Irish Cabhan, although the name is not <b>locational,</b> it is a dictus rather than a de name.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>locational</b> term above {{can define}} the {{direction}} of a vector, and pairs of them can define , that is, lines of orientation. For example, blood can be said to flow in a proximal or distal direction, and anteroposterior, mediolateral, and inferosuperior axes are lines along which the body extends, like the X, Y, and Z axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. An axis can be projected to a corresponding plane.|$|E
25|$|The damage {{model is}} another difference. In the {{standard}} scrolling shooter, touching almost any object {{results in the}} immediate destruction of the player's craft. In Star Fox, the Arwing has {{a certain amount of}} shield energy that represents how much damage can be absorbed before the destruction of the craft. The game also has a small degree of <b>locational</b> damage detection: if the ship's wings clip against obstacles or the ground too much, they will break off, adversely affecting the craft's handling and removing the ability to upgrade weapons.|$|E
25|$|Surnames were {{uncommon}} {{prior to}} the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or <b>locational,</b> and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common, for example on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland, many residents have the family name MacLeod (son of Lewis) and so may still be known by a surname symbolising their occupation such as 'Kevin the post' and 'Kevin Handbag'.|$|E
25|$|Settlements in {{the region}} of Rapperswil date back at least 5000 years. Atop the Lindenhof hill {{overlooking}} a former small village (Endingen), Rapperswil Castle was built around 1220 by the Counts of Rapperswil and is first mentioned in 1229. The town was founded when the nobility of Rapperswil moved from Altendorf across the lake to Rapperswil. The town was soon acquired by the Habsburg family who, in 1358/60, built the wooden bridge across the upper Lake Zürich. Later, the town bought itself free, and ending Old Zürich War made an alliance with the Swiss Confederation. Because of its strategic location along important infrastructure the town grew rich because of flourishing trade. This allowed a certain degree of freedom which was ended with the formation of Swiss cantons by Napoleon. Rapperswil was at first part of the Helvetic canton of Linth. After 1803's Act of Mediation, it joined the canton of St. Gallen. The <b>locational</b> advantage of the place attracted the national Circus Knie who built its headquarters in Rapperswil in 1919. The circus is now also responsible for the Knie's Kinderzoo and the Circus Museum.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} post-detection {{courses of}} action, {{it is also}} useful to consider the relative technological capabilities both in relation to signal relay time and in relation {{to whether or not}} the ETI is thought to pose a militaristic threat. If the ETI in question is transmitting from outside the Solar System, there will be a significant lag in time between transmission and receipt by either party. The relative sophistication of the communication technology available to each party would play heavily into the feasibility of certain types and content of messaging. In a similar vein, the potential disparities in sophistication of weapons technology hold grave implications for how humankind should react to ETI. Due to the perceived risk of revealing the precise location of the Earth to alien civilizations, METI has been heavily criticized as irresponsible considering the lack of information available about any real or potential ETI threat. Even in the likely scenario that accurate <b>locational</b> coordinates of Earth were available, there is question as to whether humankind should reveal anything more about itself that could be a boon to hostile ETI. Notable among the critics of METI are British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and science fiction author David Brin.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{the museums}} have {{experienced}} simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have {{been marked by}} a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience {{and led to a}} 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and <b>locational</b> factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the factory tried to enter new markets with the {{production}} of bromine, but closed production after a fire destroyed the production facility only two weeks after completion in 1985. Due to increasing competition {{in the market for}} fertilizers and the lack of new products, company revenue fell from 570 million DM in 1985 to 370 million DM. The company posted increasing financial losses, partly due to its <b>locational</b> disadvantage as all raw materials and all final goods had to be transported by truck from the factory to Cologne's Rhine harbor. Another disadvantage was the location of the factory in a densely populated residential area and a decreasing acceptance of the pollution caused by the factory. Without operating profits a relocation of the factory was not feasible, and thus, without any prospects, the fertilizer production was shut down in 1989. Employment fell from 1400 employees in 1985 to 830 in 1990, with the factory only producing sodium carbonate, calcium chloride and phosphate for animal feed. Although losses were reduced to almost zero in 1990, the financial situation deteriorated in 1992 when the prices for sodium carbonate fell. The fall in prices was partly due to the lifting of anti-dumping on sodium carbonate imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC) by the European Commission. Another factor in the worsening financial situation was an antitrust fine of US$1.38 million imposed by the European commission for participating in a sodium carbonate cartel together with Solvay and Imperial Chemical Industries. Company revenue fell to 225 million DM and losses increased to 9.6 million DM. On December 23, 1993 all remaining production was shut down and all remaining 700 workers were laid off. Since then Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH is the name of a wholesale distributor of chemicals and subsidiary of K+S AG (named Kali und Salz AG until 1999). Company revenue in 2007 was 7.86 million Euro, down from 10.07 million Euro in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Who's Your City?: How the Creative Economy Is Making Where You Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Richard Florida. The book {{advances}} Florida's previous {{work on the}} <b>locational</b> choices of people and businesses. [...] He adds a dimension of environmental psychology by assigning psychological profiles to urban regions according to the dominant personality traits {{of the people who}} live there. For example, the New York metropolitan area and the ChiPitts area have the highest concentration in the United States of people whose dominant personality trait is neuroticism. The book ends with a ten step guide to choosing a location best suited to the reader's personality and life situation.|$|E
500|$|Video game {{journalists have}} praised GoldenEye 007 for proving {{that it is}} {{possible}} to create a [...] "fun" [...] first-person shooter experience on a console in both single-player and multiplayer modes; when the game was released, the first-person shooter was primarily a genre for PC gamers. Journalists noted that the game [...] "opened the genre to a completely new market" [...] and that it was [...] "the first big console [...] that truly got it right." [...] The game has subsequently become credited alongside Shiny Entertainment's MDK for pioneering and popularising the now-standard inclusion of scoped sniper rifles in video games. The game's use of context-sensitive hit locations on enemies added a realism that was previously unseen in video games, though the Quake computer mod Team Fortress already featured <b>locational</b> damage like headshots.|$|E
500|$|Ticks, like mites, are {{arthropods}} {{that have}} lost the segmentation of the abdomen that their ancestors had, and there has subsequently been a fusion of the abdomen with the cephalothorax. The tagmata typical of other Chelicera {{have been replaced by}} two new body sections, the anterior capitulum (or gnathosoma), which is retractable and contains the [...] mouthparts, and the posterior idiosoma which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The capitulum is a feeding structure with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood; it is only the front of the head and contains neither the brain nor the eyes. The ventral side of the idiosoma bears sclerites, and the gonopore is located between the fourth pair of legs. In the absence of segmentation, the positioning of the eyes, limbs and gonopore on the idiosoma provide the only <b>locational</b> guidance.|$|E

2500|$|To further {{explore the}} {{location}} of firms Weber also created two concepts. [...] The first is of an isotim, which is a line of equal transport cost for any product or material. [...] The second is the isodapane which is a line of total transport costs. [...] The isodapane is found by adding all of the isotims at a location. [...] The reason for using isodapanes is to systematically introduce the labor component into Weber's <b>locational</b> theory.|$|E
2500|$|To the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions él and ektá {{sound like}} {{they can be}} interchangeable, but {{although}} they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as <b>locational</b> and directional tools.

2500|$|In {{use with}} his theory {{he created the}} <b>locational</b> {{triangle}}. [...] His triangle is used with one market and two sources of material. [...] This illustrated that manufacturing that utilizes pure materials will never tie the processing location to the material site. [...] Also industries utilizing high weight loss materials will tend to be pulled toward the material source {{as opposed to the}} market. Furthermore, many industries will select an intermediate location between market and material. [...] The last generalization is considered to be wrong because he never takes into account terminal costs and therefore is considered biased toward intermediate locations.|$|E

2500|$|The player {{typically}} must {{complete a}} linear sequence of certain quests {{in order to}} reach the end of the game's story, although quests in some games such as [...] or Geneforge can limit or enable certain choices later in the game. Many RPGs also often allow the player to seek out optional side-quests and character interactions. Quests of this sort can be found by talking to a non-player character, and there may be no penalty for abandoning or ignoring these quests other than a missed opportunity or reward. Quests may involve defeating one or many enemies, rescuing a non-player character, item fetch quests, or <b>locational</b> puzzles such as mysteriously locked doors.|$|E
2500|$|Weber has {{received}} much criticism. [...] It {{has been said}} that Weber did not effectively and realistically take into account geographic variation in market demand, which is considered a <b>locational</b> factor of paramount influence. [...] Also his treatment of transport did not recognize that these costs are not proportional to distance and weight, and that intermediate locations necessitate added terminal charges. [...] Labor is not always available in unlimited quantity at any location and is usually quite mobile through migration. [...] Plus most manufacturing plants obtain a large number of material inputs and produce a wide range of products for many diverse markets, so his theory doesn’t easily apply. [...] Furthermore, he underestimated the effect of agglomeration.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variant of}} Wick, {{which is an}} English {{topographic}} name for someone who lived in an outlying settlement dependent on a larger village; from the Old English wic an early loan word from the Latin vicus, or a habitational name from a place named with this word. Examples of such places include Week Green in Cornwall, and Wick in Somerset. As the term was especially used to denote an outlying dairy farm or salt works, it {{may also have been}} an occupational name for someone who worked at such a facility. The addition of a final [...] "s" [...] to topographical and <b>locational</b> surnames was a usual medieval practice, denoting one who was resident at a place, rather than from it.|$|E
2500|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} {{characterized}} by the integration of information gathered prior to the execution of a saccade (pre-saccadic) and information gathered after the saccade (post-saccadic stimuli. This involves attention, [...] locating the targets necessary to perform a saccade and continuous updates of the environmental information. Attention occurs prior to the movement of the eyes, therefore it has a strong influence on the location of the saccade, what information is being encoded, remembered across saccades and stored into transsaccadic memory. In order to perform a successful and accurate saccade an individual is required to make an attentional shift to the saccadic target. This attentional shift causes the encoding of information to occur near the saccade target location. Attention to the target of the saccade results in better object identification and an increase in accuracy of identification. As well as, improvement in coding of <b>locational</b> information. Attention is restricted to one saccade target per area. It is impossible to keep attention on a target in one area, while performing another saccade simultaneously in another. This will cause prolonged saccadic latency periods (the time it takes to make a saccade from one area to another), and increased reaction times. However, attention can be distributed around the saccade target, rather than the precise location that will fall on the fovea, allowing for the detection of one or two objects situated around the saccadic target. Kowler (1995) proposed two models to explain the relationship between attention, saccades and transsaccadic memory. The spatial model, states that attention is distributed among the perceptual site (visual field) and the saccadic target during the latency period, which allows for the identification of the saccadic target and object surrounding that area. The temporal model states that attention determines [...] where the saccade will occur and releases a “go” signal to initiate a saccade within that area.|$|E
