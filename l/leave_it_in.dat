5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters {{can go from}} one time to another. Characters can come into the building from any time, but can <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E

In May he visited with Ian Kishizawa from Eiheiji and, with So-on's blessing, asked to {{continue}} studies under him. He went to Gyokuden-in for his instruction, where Kishizawa trained him hard in zazen and conducted personal interviews with him.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, if this pronoun is {{the subject}} of the {{relative}} clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition et, used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew—unlike in English—a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, she- might more properly be called a relativizer than a relative pronoun.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s the Oregon Department of Transportation {{proposed}} {{options for}} replacing the bridge {{in order to}} alleviate traffic problems in downtown Corvallis. Funding was never secured and the project was dropped in 1993, but the plans were revived in 2004. Plans included options to move the existing structure to a park, <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place, and build a new span that could be located {{in a variety of}} locations along the river in downtown. These options were narrowed to two in 2006, one adding a bridge parallel to the existing bridge and the other building a curved bridge between the old span and the Harrison Street Bridge. The existing structure would have remained in-place under both options, and costs were estimated at around $18 million.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{unless the}} {{placenta}} {{can be easily}} tied off or removed, it may be preferable to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place and allow for a natural regression. This process may take several months and can be monitored by clinical examination, checking human chorionic gonadotropin levels and by ultrasound scanning (in particular using doppler ultrasonography. Use of methotrexate to accelerate placental regression is controversial as {{the large amount of}} necrotic tissue is a potential site for infection, mifepristone has also be used to promote placental regression. Placental vessels have also been blocked by angiographic embolization. Complications of leaving the placenta can include residual bleeding, infection, bowel obstruction, pre-eclampsia (which may all necessitate further surgery) and failure to breast feed due to placental hormones.|$|E

25|$|On May 8, 1869, James and Sarah {{had another}} son, James Rowland Angell, who later served as {{president}} of Yale University. That same year, the University of Michigan offered Angell its presidency following the resignation of Erastus Haven. He visited Ann Arbor with his wife, but felt that he owed it to his supporters in Vermont to stay on with the University of Vermont. The offer was repeated in 1871, his former teacher Henry S. Frieze having served as acting president in the meantime. This time, Angell felt that the University of Vermont had made enough progress that he could <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> good conscience, and he accepted the offer. He made a trip to Ann Arbor to deliver his inaugural address at Commencement on June 28, 1871, then returned to Vermont to finish out the academic term before moving his family to Ann Arbor for good in September of that year.|$|E

[...] Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeletal crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.

500|$|The {{creation}} of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio. It took fourteen days {{to prepare for the}} single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki convinced the director to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> According to Owen, [...] "Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, when we come to shoot, we have to make feel completely random." ...|$|E
500|$|Generally {{one wants}} to have the wing's centre of {{pressure}} (CP, or [...] "lift point") close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CG, or [...] "balance point") {{to reduce the amount}} of control force required to pitch the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this. With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.|$|E
500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces."

In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. [...] "As we move into the back half of the season, we'd like to get [...] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles." [...] In the same interview, Baldwin noted, [...] "Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug is not where I'd like him to end up." [...] Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says [...] "shark farts", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term [...] "was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in.
