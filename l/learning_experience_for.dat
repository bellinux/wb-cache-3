5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} a <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> the young Arsenal squad and Fàbregas. The club again failed to secure any major honours and were {{defeated}} by city rivals Chelsea in the League Cup Final. Fàbregas, however, {{emerged as one}} of the key creative players for the team, playing in every single league game. He kick-started Arsenal's 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign when he scored a brace in a 3–0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in a qualifier match. In the Premier League, he notched up 13 assists, which was the second-highest total in the league. He ended the season with several individual honours, including the Golden Boy award, presented by the Italian paper TuttoSport, based on a poll of leading writers across Europe. He was also named in the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year, and named FA Premier League Player of the Month for January 2007. Additionally, he was nominated for both PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year, although both awards went to Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. In June 2007, he was named Arsenal's Player of the Season, taking in 60% of the votes.|$|E

Olivia claimed that she was forced to be the bad girl while label mate Alicia Keys was promoted as the good girl.

40|$|Abstract – First-year {{engineering}} curricula are {{vitally important}} {{in improving the}} quantity and quality of engineering graduates. Many innovative approaches to first-year engineering curriculum development have been created and implemented over the past twenty years. Often, innovative approaches incorporate one or more engineering projects as <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> first-year students. Further, problem-based and project-based pedagogical theories have offered the framework <b>for</b> many innovative <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> engineering students in all four years of engineering curricula. As Texas A&M University improves its first-year engineering curricula, faculty members are re-examining the nature of the project-based <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> both to improve the <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> and to develop specifications <b>for</b> future project-based <b>learning</b> <b>experiences.</b> This paper presents the rationale behind the five specifications and offers experiences in developing and implementing the design projects for the prototype first-year engineering curricula. The paper also describes the assessment and evaluation plan as well as assessment data that has been analyzed to date. Index Terms ⎯ first-year curriculum, design, integratio...|$|R

He was the chief army adviser to the overall operation commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Metcalf III, Commander, United States Second Fleet/Commander Joint Task Force 120. The operation was plagued by logistical difficulties, exacerbated by poor communication and lack of cooperation between the branches of the United States military. Schwarzkopf was named deputy commander of the invasion at the last minute, leaving him with little say in the planning. Schwarzkopf helped lead the initial landing operations while aboard [...] He was involved in an incident where the colonel commanding the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit initially refused to fly Army troops in Marine helicopters. He flew into St. George's {{on the second day of}} the operation. While he initially did not think the U.S. should have been involved in the conflict, he later said he considered the mission a success because it re-asserted the dominance of the U.S. military after the Vietnam War. Following the invasion, Schwarzkopf returned to the 24th Infantry Division and completed his tour as its commander. He was subsequently among those leaders who were criticized for the poor inter-service cooperation in the operation, particularly poor communication between forces of the different branches in combat. The operation was a <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> <b>for</b> Schwarzkopf, who saw the need to develop greater cooperation between the services for future joint operations. He would later push for more policies to make joint warfare and inter-service cooperation standard practice in warfare. Specifically, the operation demonstrated a need for greater joint roles in planning, deploying troops, and communicating operations. Subsequent operations gave more authority to joint commanders in operations and doctrine emphasized joint warfare doctrine over service-centered doctrine.|$|E
