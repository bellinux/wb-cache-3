5|$|Lathrop stands five stories {{tall with}} an {{additional}} basement level. The dormitory, Elizabethan in style, is a brick building with elements of brownstone trim. The roof is a Vermont slate and from it rise five chimneys, each built with two wythes of brick and capped with bluestone. There are also multiple cupolas that are framed with wood, include painted <b>louvered</b> slats, and have topped with a coat of terne. The building also has parapets, unlike neighboring Strong.|$|E
5|$|The stable was {{designed}} by McKim, Mead & White and built in the late 19th century using the same yellow brick used for the main residence. The stable is {{two and a half}} stories high, 29 bays wide, and 5bays deep, and it has a gable roof covered with asbestos shingles that replaced its original ceramic tile. On the roof's ridge sits a shallow monitor, flanked by two taller octangular monitors with <b>louvered</b> ventilating elements and bell-cast copper roofs.|$|E
5|$|The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine panes of glass within each sash. The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. The windows are framed by white wooden <b>louvered</b> window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a <b>louvered</b> design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
25|$|Features {{that arrived}} during the 1860s and stayed until the Peter Drummond days were the <b>louvered</b> {{chimneys}} and counter-pressure brake.|$|E
25|$|To {{starboard}} is {{a curved}} settee that converts to a double berth when required. An inlaid teak table with two drop leaves surrounds the keel stepped mast. There are teak shelves and <b>louvered</b> locker storage behind both settees.|$|E
25|$|The rear facade is {{identical}} to the front, except that the right first-floor opening is a plain board door rather than a window and that some of the second-floor doors still retain their original <b>louvered</b> and paneled shutter systems and have not had glass inserted.|$|E
25|$|All {{windows are}} six-over-six double-hung sash. Those {{on the front}} are flanked by <b>louvered</b> shutters. On the {{northwest}} corner is an enclosed smaller porch supported by square columns with simple pedestals and capitals. The overhanging eaves of the rooflines are decorated with saw-cut vergeboards.|$|E
25|$|Within the verandah, four bays are {{organized}} into an ABA rhythm of two paired, central bays flanked by singular bays at the extremes. Each bay is intricately {{articulated in the}} same manner: a circular arch defined by an ornate hood mould with floral and festoon plaster ornament above. Each bay contains wooden, <b>louvered</b> double-doors with ornate leaded glass panels and a stained-glass fanlight.|$|E
25|$|Buildings in Bintaran are {{fusion of}} Javanese-Dutch style with thick white walls, tall main door and tall windows. The area has a {{distinct}} style which makes it different with buildings in Loji Kecil or Kota Baru: the yard are more spacious while the porch smaller with many pillars. The front doors are usually <b>louvered</b> and the inner doors are often completed with glass.|$|E
25|$|The bumpers {{were very}} small, {{no more than}} trim pieces. A strange and sour-looking front gave way to an ovoid rear end, {{culminating}} in an engine cover perforated by at least 50 vent openings. On the rear fenders two <b>louvered</b> vents allow air to the engine compartment; the right-hand one also opens to allow access to the fuel filler. Finally, a frameless opening rear glass provides a measure of hatchback practicality.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} stages to the bell tower, all {{set off by}} smooth-finished belt courses. Its corner buttresses {{continue}} to the top, gradually changing from square to circular as they do and {{becoming part of the}} crowning parapet along with a small pediment on each side. The stages are fenestrated, from top to bottom, with a single lancet arched window, double lancet-arched windows, a diamond panel and <b>louvered</b> Gothic window.|$|E
25|$|From the street, {{through the}} {{staircase}} {{and the main}} entrance, a foyer leads to an interior courtyard from which all the spaces of the house are distributed. Special features of the interior are the stained glass panels in the living room, showing a strong moorish influence in its form (lobulated arches) and its colour. The doors have <b>louvered</b> panels and stained glass insets. The living room, the studio and the bedrooms have pressed tin ceilings.|$|E
25|$|In plan, {{the living}} room, dining room, {{and finally a}} <b>louvered</b> gallery {{overlooking}} the side garden are disposed in sequence from front to rear. Bedrooms open onto the gallery around the court. Interior spaces are large and generally have high ceilings and the floors are covered with Loza Islena (Native ceramic tile) in intricate designs. Of particular significance are the stained-glass panels found at the transoms of the main doors and the circular window in the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|Cooling the {{building}} in an environmentally conscious way was also a challenge. During the summer, Yellowknife's days get as long as its winter nights, making it the sunniest Canadian city during that season. In 20 hours of daylight with only four-hour white nights to provide respite, the overuse of air conditioning frequently leads to brownouts {{and as many as}} 50 power outages a year. The engineers compensated by adding the <b>louvered</b> steel shades to the south end of {{the building}}.|$|E
25|$|Again, the 1973 GTO {{option was}} offered on two models {{including}} the base Le Mans coupe or the LeMans Sport Coupe. The base LeMans coupe featured a cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat while the more lavish Le Mans Sport Coupe had all-vinyl interiors with Strato bucket seats or a notchback bench seat with folding armrest. The Le Mans Sport Coupe also had <b>louvered</b> {{rear side windows}} from the Grand Am {{in place of the}} standard triangular windows of the base Le Mans.|$|E
25|$|At {{the second}} story of the front facade, there is a balustraded {{projecting}} portico three bays wide with freestanding engaged Ionic columns and Doric pilasters supporting a full entablature with denticulated pediment. It is in turn topped with a three-stage wooden clock tower with round-arched <b>louvered</b> openings, paired Corinthian columns supporting block entablatures and paired scroll brackets. The very top of Town Hall is the clock tower's domed roof. This feature has made the clock tower one of Irvington's most recognizable local landmarks.|$|E
25|$|The Lake–Peterson House {{property}} has an extant outbuilding, {{the carriage}} house, {{which is also}} cast in the Gothic Revival style. The Lake-Peterson Carriage House was built {{around the same time}} as the main house. The building features clapboard siding, arched windows and decorative vergeboards. The carriage house's most striking feature is its multi-gabled <b>louvered</b> cupola. Surviving, contemporary outbuildings are unusual. The carriage house, aside from the Lake–Peterson House itself, was identified as architecturally significant by the Illinois Historic Sites Survey in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of the towers has a {{slightly}} projecting central section, topped by a pediment, on each of its two outward faces, with a large clock in the center. Above it is a metal section with two smooth Ionic columns in the corners and a round-arched <b>louvered</b> vent with a keystone. Broad overhanging eaves set off the next section, {{the base of the}} cupola, with a shingled face and oculus. Above another set of eaves is a small domed top with an acorn-shaped finial.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{are divided}} into three separate apartments: two similarly distributed residential units at the first level and a single large apartment at the second. The living quarters, kitchen, and servants' quarters of the upper floor are reached via a series of <b>louvered</b> galleries that open to the courtyard. The living room boasts original crystal chandeliers and electric features. Floors are generally of polished wood and ceilings of ornate pressed sheet-metal. The living room windows open to the balcony which has marble floors and iron railings.|$|E
25|$|A string-course runs {{between the}} tower lower and belfry stages. Each belfry side {{contains}} a pointed arch opening of same style {{surrounded by a}} hood mould. A straight reveal leads to a <b>louvered</b> twin-light window with trefoiled ogee head, and a quatrefoil device above. The south belfry window also contains the tower clock: circular, blue, with gold numerals and hands. The tower parapet is embattled with a pinnacle at each corner. It projects slightly at the eaves and contains one gargoyle each side offset to the right.|$|E
25|$|A simple cornice {{marks the}} {{roofline}} around the entire building, with modillions {{in the end}} gables. On the front side, the central bay projects to form {{the base of the}} steeple. All three bays on the front elevation have a red paneled double wooden door surrounded by fluted pilasters with a projecting cornice on top. Above each one on the second story is a window topped with semicircular fanlight. At the attic is a decorative circular light. This is echoed by a round-arched <b>louvered</b> vent {{on each side of the}} steeple.|$|E
25|$|The pilasters' Ionic capitals {{support a}} molded frieze with an egg-and-dart pattern {{underneath}} the modillioned cornice at the roofline. Above it is a balustrade. The gently pitched hipped roof is pierced by two brick chimneys {{at either end}} with a copper roofed cupola in the middle. It has keystone-arched <b>louvered</b> vents in its lower stage, separated by pairs of smooth Corinthian columns. They support a broad overhanging modillioned cornice, above which is a frieze decorated with swag. Atop the cupola is a flared domed roof with a weathervane.|$|E
25|$|The corners on this {{rear part}} of the {{building}} are rounded, a somewhat unusual condition for corners in buildings of this type of architecture. After a recent remodeling, most windows and doors were finished in near-duplicative (usually <b>louvered</b> casement) designs. The new annex on the side features arched openings to the street and has glass fenestration. This addition does not contribute to the property's architectural value but due to its disposition and volume it does not harm the main structure's integrity. Even with the 1928 alterations this building is still a magnificent example of Spanish architecture in Ponce and of the neoclassical style.|$|E
25|$|Following {{its debut}} as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975. This time, it wore a rakishly slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose {{designed}} for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later {{to show up}} on the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), <b>louvered</b> opera windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available {{for the first half of}} the model year after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package, affirming again that the age of muscle was long gone.|$|E
25|$|On {{either side}} of the {{entrance}} section are recessed narrow Gothic arched windows in molded surrounds set with tinted glass, one horizontal mullion at centre and two curved ones curving inward from the edges, in contrast to those on the entrance transom. On each side of the pavilion is a similarly treated, narrower window. At the roofline of the entrance pavilion is a plain frieze; above it on {{either side of}} the entrance projection are <b>louvered</b> vents. At the eaves of the roof a flap of wood hangs down, broad near the bottom and narrow at the top, following the surround of the vents beneath. Behind the pavilion is a more gently pitched engaged gabled face with vertica battens.|$|E
25|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{residence}} consists of eye-catching peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden <b>louvered</b> characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|E
25|$|Fenestration on {{both side}} {{profiles}} consists of five large round-arched stained glass windows framed by molded limestone casings with bracketed sills. On the east in the center is an engaged buttress added {{to shore up the}} wall. A three-bay projecting pavilion on the west supports the bell tower. Its entrance is a single door with round-arched window above and on the sides. Its lowest stage is a three-story masonry tower with wooden cornices separating the stories, topped by three frame ones above a curved cornice. The lower two are octagonal, one featuring a clock and the next <b>louvered</b> round-arched vents. The uppermost stage, the conical steeple, has ribs defining its eight facts and is covered with diamond-shaped wooden shingles. Kingston's city ordinances prohibit the construction of any building taller than its base in the Stockade District.|$|E
25|$|The west {{tower is}} Perpendicular style of three stages surmounted on its parapet by eight crocketed pinnacles, one at each corner and one along each {{side at the}} centre. The bases of the corner pinnacles contain {{grotesque}} gargoyles. The centre pinnacles sit on triangular projections that run below the parapet, with grotesque corbels at their base that intersect with the hood mould archmoulded arch projections against the wallabove the belfry openings on the tower third stage. The belfry openings are of four lights each, twin-tiered and <b>louvered,</b> topped with trefoil openings. The 13th-century tower lower stage is supported by buttresses at the centre of each wall, its socle, or plinth, topped by a scotia, or rolled moulding. Within the tower north wall middle stage is embedded a fragment of Anglo-Saxon sculpture. The tower contains six bells, and a clock offset to the north on its east face.|$|E
25|$|The oldest records found {{indicate}} that this structure was built in 1885 consisting of a one-story building organized around two identical anterior courtyards. This original spatial distribution is still preserved. The southern half was altered in 1928 after the 1918 earthquake damaged part of this side. During this remodeling a second story was added to this half. This southern facade is set back from the street by a fence and front yard. Its main element is the entrance portico articulated by flat tuscan pilasters and three arches, the central one slightly protruding to the front (This portico {{is part of the}} original 1885 construction). Over the portico, separated by cornice and parapet with the building's name in sans serif letters. Other decorative elements at this level include overhangs, a segmental round cornice over the recessed center window, <b>louvered</b> casement windows with segmental round openings and plain glass transoms and a rosette on top of the center recess between the two volumes. In contrast, the first floor of this south facade presents large rectangular windows with wide planar moldings and a simple cornice with a segmental pyramidal profile on the top molding, a cornice and rectangular windows with false segmental arch crowned by an equally false keystone all part of the original 1885 construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower is}} of three stages. The lower stages might {{be part of}} an 11th-century {{previously}} unbuttressed tower, and contains at its west side an early 15th-century chamfered reveal window opening with pointed arch surrounded by a hood mould with label stops in human form. The inset Perpendicular window is of three lights of panel tracery below, and six above. The panels are headed with trefoils, the lower within ogee heads. A church clock is just below the belfry stage. Between the window and clock is a hooded slit window, a repeat slit window is on the north and south sides. The Belfry stage was added in the 13th century and is defined at its base by a string course with repeating dentils. Central to each side of the belfry stage is a chamfered window opening with a plain hood mould following a semi-circular head. Within the opening are <b>louvered</b> and pointed twin-lights, these separated by a central octagonal shaft with a trefoil opening above in the north and south windows. The roof line is defined by a further string course with repeated grotesque bosses, and pairs of gargoyle drains on each side. An embattled roof parapet with crocketed corner pinnacles sits above. The tower is partially clasped at the north and south by the church aisles, and on the north side by an ashlar three-stepped angled buttress against the lower stages.|$|E
500|$|A {{maple syrup}} {{production}} farm {{is called a}} [...] "sugarbush" [...] or [...] "sugarwood". Sap is often boiled in a [...] "sugar house" [...] (also known as a [...] "sugar shack", [...] "sugar shanty", or cabane à sucre), a building <b>louvered</b> at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.|$|E
500|$|The church's {{north and}} south sides consist of two symmetrically placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, along with {{operable}} green-painted <b>louvered</b> wooden window shutters. The clapboard sidings vary between [...] in width. At {{the base of the}} church's north side, concrete blocks are visible under the foundation. On the church's south side, a small strip of the roof's eave confirms the original location of the chimney.|$|E
500|$|The Office of the President {{is located}} in McMillan Hall, which is the oldest {{building}} on campus, dating to 1793. Prior to 1912, the Office of the President was located in Old Main, taking the two rooms {{on either side of}} that building's main entrance. The President's House is a 17-room Victorian mansion on East Wheeling Street between the U. Grant Miller Library and The Burnett Center. It was built in 1892 by the Duncan family and is an archetypical Queen Anne Victorian style building, with ornate [...] "gingerbread" [...] details, stained and beveled glass, recessed doors and windows, and <b>louvered</b> wooden shutters.|$|E
500|$|A large round-headed {{window is}} located {{between the two}} towers on the south side, and another between the two towers on the east side. [...] Smaller round-headed windows occur on {{the east and west}} sides of the bell tower, at about the same level as the south entrance. [...] On {{the south side of the}} bell tower, above the doorway, is a pair of {{diamond-shaped}} windows set in a raised rectangle of light-tan brick; on the east and west sides, at the same level, are similar arrangements, but with diamond-shaped decorations of corbelled light-tan brick instead of windows. [...] Above these are paired round-headed windows with wood <b>louvered</b> shutters.|$|E
500|$|The President's House is a 17-room Victorian mansion {{where the}} College President [...] resides. [...] It {{was built in}} 1892 by the Duncan family, of Duncan glass fame. [...] Its design is archetypical Queen Anne Victorian style, with ornate [...] "gingerbread" [...] details, stained and beveled glass, {{recessed}} doors and windows, and <b>louvered</b> wooden shutters. [...] In 1944, Walter Hudson Baker, class of 1907, donated {{the house to the}} college in memory of his wife, Amy Duncan Baker; it has been used as the President's House since. [...] It was profiled in a book of regional architecture by the Washington County History and Landmarks Foundation.|$|E
