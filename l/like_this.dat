5|$|A call <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{might be}} a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were {{on the side of the}} status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|His second book, It Doesn't Have To Be <b>Like</b> <b>This,</b> {{an outline}} of his views on the environment, was {{published}} in 1989, and he was regularly invited to high-profile events. That year he discussed animal rights during a televised debate at the Royal Institution, alongside Tom Regan, Mary Warnock and Germaine Greer, and in 1990 his name appeared on advertisements for a children's charity, along with Audrey Hepburn, Woody Allen and other celebrities.|$|E

5|$|I {{think we}} all know that we're going to hear {{announcements}} <b>like</b> <b>this</b> more often. A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people think}} of deserts as {{consisting}} of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes {{because that is the}} way they are often depicted on TV and in films, but deserts do not always look <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E

5|$|Morrison met Irish socialite Michelle Rocca in {{the summer}} of 1992, and they often {{featured}} in the Dublin gossip columns, an unusual event for the reclusive Morrison.

5|$|Much of Clock Towers {{plot and}} artistic style are {{inspired}} by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and wanted the game to feel like one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena.|$|E
5|$|On a rainy Sunday of 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: {{at the same}} time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events <b>like</b> <b>this</b> made CF Barcelona represent {{much more than just}} Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.|$|E

5|$|The 1994 live double album A Night in San Francisco {{received}} favourable reviews as well {{as commercial}} success by reaching number eight on the UK charts. 1995's Days <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> also had large sales – though the critical reviews were not always favourable. This period also saw a number of side projects, including the live jazz performances of 1996's How Long Has This Been Going On, from the same year , and 2000's The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998, all of which found Morrison paying tribute to his early musical influences.|$|E
5|$|The album, eponymously titled Avril Lavigne, was {{released}} in November 2013 and sold 125,000 copies in the US; in Canada, it was certified gold and received a Juno Award nomination for Pop Album of the Year.

5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques <b>like</b> <b>this</b> are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is <b>like</b> <b>this</b> because they are only children, not adults.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn {{are kept in}} the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), two obbligato violins (Vs), viola (Va) and basso continuo. A festive scoring <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> including brass, was usually performed on holidays. The duration of the cantata is given as 25 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, three {{countries}} applied {{to make their}} debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having originally accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 {{in an attempt to}} prevent situations <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> The Union set a limit of forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held {{for the first time in}} 2008.|$|E

5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases <b>like</b> <b>this</b> have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
