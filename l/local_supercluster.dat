Following Mathis et al. (2002), the initial conditions have been statistically constrained to reproduce the density field within a sphere of 110 Mpc around the Milky Way, as observed in the IRAS 1. 2 -Jy all-sky redshift survey. As a result, the positions and masses of prominent galaxy clusters and superclusters in our simulations coincide closely with their real counterparts in the local universe. We present the results of two different runs, one with adiabatic gas physics only, and one also including cooling, star formation and feedback. By analysing the full-sky maps for the thermal and kinetic SZ signals extracted from these simulations, we find that for multipoles with ℓ < 100 the power spectrum {{is dominated by the}} prominent <b>local</b> <b>superclusters,</b> and its amplitude at these scales is a factor of two higher than that obtained from unconstrained simulations; at lower multipoles (ℓ < 20) this factor can even reach one order of magnitude.

40|$|We {{study the}} morphology, {{luminosity}} and {{mass of the}} superclusters from the BOSS Great Wall (BGW), a recently discovered very rich supercluster complex at the redshift z = 0. 47. We have employed the Minkowski functionals to quantify supercluster morphology. We calculate supercluster luminosities and masses using two methods. Firstly, we used data about the luminosities and stellar masses of high stellar mass galaxies with (M_*/h^- 1 M_) ≥ 11. 3. Secondly, we applied a scaling relation that combines morphological and physical parameters of superclusters to obtain supercluster luminosities, and obtained supercluster masses using the mass-to-light ratios found for <b>local</b> rich <b>superclusters.</b> We find that the BGW superclusters are very elongated systems, with shape parameter values of less than 0. 2. This value is lower than that found for the most elongated <b>local</b> <b>superclusters.</b> The values of the fourth Minkowski functional V_ 3 for the richer BGW superclusters (V_ 3 = 7 and 10) show {{that they have a}} complicated and rich inner structure. We identify two Planck SZ clusters in the BGW superclusters, one in the richest BGW supercluster, and another in one of the poor BGW superclusters. The luminosities of the BGW superclusters are in the range of 1 - 8 × 10 ^ 13 h^- 2 L_, and masses in the range of 0. 4 - 2. 1 × 10 ^ 16 h^- 1 M_. Supercluster luminosities and masses obtained with two methods agree well. We conclude that the BGW is a complex of massive, luminous and large superclusters with very elongated shape. The search and detailed study, including the morphology analysis of the richest superclusters and their complexes from observations and simulations can help us to understand formation and evolution of the cosmic web.

40|$|Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have {{revealed}} an unexpected quadrupole-octopole alignment along a preferred axis {{pointing toward the}} Virgo cluster. We here investigate whether this feature can be explained {{in the framework of}} the concordance model by secondary anisotropies produced by the non-linear evolution of the gravitational potential, the so-called Rees-Sciama (RS) effect. We focus on the effect caused by the <b>local</b> <b>superclusters,</b> which we calculate using a constrained high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation, based on the IRAS 1. 2 -Jy all-sky galaxy redshift survey, which reproduces the main structures of our Universe out to a distance of 110 Mpc from our Galaxy. The resulting RS effect peaks at low multipoles and has a minimum/maximum amplitude of - 6. 6 μ K 1. 9 μ K. Even though its quadrupole is well aligned with the one measured for the CMB, its amplitude is not sufficient to explain the observed magnitude of the quadrupole/octopole alignment. In addition, we analyze the WMAP- 3 data with a linear matched filter in an attempt to determine an upper limit for the RS signal amplitude on large scales.

40|$|The Northern Local Void {{is a huge}} underdense {{region of}} the nearby Universe {{situated}} between the Hercules, Coma and <b>Local</b> <b>Superclusters.</b> We present {{an investigation of the}} galaxy distribution in the Northern Local Void using void statistics. In particular galaxies of different morphological type and luminosity have been studied separately and void catalogues have been compiled from three different luminosity limited galaxy samples for the first time. Our approach is complementary to most other methods usually used in Large-Scale Structure studies and has the potential to detect and describe subtle structures in the galaxy distribution. We found that the resulting sets of voids form a hierarchical system: The fainter the limiting luminosity of the galaxies the smaller are the voids defined by them. Voids outlined by bright galaxies are interlaced by a fine network of faint galaxy filaments dividing them into smaller subvoids. This Void Hierarchy is an important property of the Large-Scale Structure in the Universe which constrains any realistic galaxy and structure formation scenario. In addition, this concept of Void Hierarchy may help to devise new concepts {{for the study of the}} Large-Scale Structure in the Universe.

We determine a refined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local Universe.

Moreover, visual morphological classification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharp increase in the fraction of visually-classified strong bars with mass, hinting that strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the sSFR above M_knee. We test this hypothesis using a simple but physically-motivated numerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quench star formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. We conclude that strong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the inner parts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely required to quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies.

40|$|We {{apply the}} Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE) to {{reconstruct}} and analyse the matter distribution and cosmic velocity flows {{in the local}} Universe {{on the basis of}} the PSCz galaxy survey. The prime objective of this study is the production of optimal resolution 3 D maps of the volume-weighted velocity and density fields throughout the nearby universe, the basis for a detailed study of the structure and dynamics of the cosmic web at each level probed by underlying galaxy sample. Fully volume-covering 3 D maps of the density and (volume-weighted) velocity fields in the cosmic vicinity, out to a distance of 150 h(- 1) Mpc, are presented. Based on the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation defined by the spatial galaxy sample, DTFE involves the estimate of density values {{on the basis of the}} volume of the related Delaunay tetrahedra and the subsequent use of the Delaunay tessellation as natural multidimensional (linear) interpolation grid for the corresponding density and velocity fields throughout the sample volume. The linearized model of the spatial galaxy distribution and the corresponding peculiar velocities of the PSCz galaxy sample, produced by Branchini et al., forms the input sample for the DTFE study. The DTFE maps reproduce the high-density supercluster regions in optimal detail, both their internal structure as well as their elongated or flattened shape. The corresponding velocity flows trace the bulk and shear flows marking the region extending from the Pisces-Perseus <b>supercluster,</b> via the <b>Local</b> <b>Superclusters,</b> towards the Hydra-Centaurus and the Shapley concentration. The most outstanding and unique feature of the DTFE maps is the sharply defined radial outflow regions in and around underdense voids, marking the dynamical importance of voids in the local Universe. The maximum expansion rate of voids defines a sharp cut-off in the DTFE velocity divergence probability distribution function. We found that on the basis of this cut-off DTFE manages to consistently reproduce the value of Omega(m) approximate to 0. 35 underlying the linearized velocity data set...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of the galaxy structural parameters from Halpha 3, an Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey of ~ 800 galaxies selected from the HI ALFALFA Survey in the <b>Local</b> and Coma <b>Superclusters.</b> Taking advantage of Halpha 3 which provides the complete census of the recent star-forming, HI-rich galaxies in the local universe, we aim to investigate the structural parameters of both the young (1 Gyr) stellar populations. By comparing the sizes of these stellar components we investigated the spatial scale on which galaxies are growing at the present cosmological epoch {{and the role of the}} environment in quenching the star-formation activity. We computed the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness structural parameters. To quantify the sizes we computed half-light radii and a new parameter dubbed EW/r. The concentration index computed in the r band depends on the stellar mass and on the Hubble type, these variables being related since most massive galaxies are bulge dominated thus most concentrated. Going toward later spirals and irregulars both the concentration index and the stellar mass decrease. Blue Compact dwarfs represent an exception since they have similar stellar mass but they are more concentrated than dwarf irregulars. The asymmetry and the clumpiness increase along the spiral sequence then they decrease going into the dwarf regime, where the light distribution is smooth and more symmetric. When measured on Halpha images, the CAS parameters do not exhibit obvious correlations with Hubble type. We found that the concentration index is the main parameter that describes the current growth of isolated galaxies but, for a fixed concentration, the stellar mass plays a second order role. At the present epoch, massive galaxies are growing inside-out, conversely the dwarfs are growing on the scale of their already assembled mass.
