His only detracting feature is a slight {{projection}} of the oral region, that unmistakable proof of African blood. His movements have the grace of strength and suppleness: {{he is a good}} jumper, runs well, throws the spear admirably, and is a tolerable shot. Having received a liberal education at Mocha, he is held a learned man by his fellow-countrymen. Like his father he despises presents, looking higher; with some trouble I persuaded him to accept a common map of Asia, and a revolver. His chief interest was concentrated in books: he borrowed my Abu Kasim to copy [6], and was never tired of talking about the religious sciences: he had weakened his eyes by hard reading, and a couple of blisters were sufficient to win his gratitude. Mohammed is now the eldest son [7]; he appears determined to keep up the family name, having already married ten wives: the issue, however, two infant sons, were murdered by the Eesa Bedouins. Whenever he meets his father in the morning, he kisses his hand, and receives a salute upon the forehead. He aspires to the government of Zayla, and looks forward more reasonably than the Hajj to the day when the possession of Berberah will pour gold into his coffers.

60|$|Here, I am afraid, I shall require {{once more}} the {{assistance}} of the giraffe, or, as he was called {{in the days of the}} celebrated Buffoon, the camelopard (by children, cammyleopard). I do not remember how this animal imposed himself illustratively on the Evolution controversy; but there was no getting away from him then; and I am old-fashioned enough to be unable to get away from him now. How did he come by his long neck? Lamarck would have said, by wanting to get at the tender leaves high up on the tree, and trying until he succeeded in wishing the necessary <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> into existence. Another answer was also possible: namely, that some prehistoric stockbreeder, wishing to produce a natural curiosity, selected the longest-necked animals he could find, and bred from them until at last an animal with an abnormally long neck was evolved by intentional selection, just as the race-horse or the fantail pigeon has been evolved. Both these explanations, you will observe, involve consciousness, will, design, purpose, either on the part of the animal itself or on the part of a superior intelligence controlling its destiny. Darwin pointed out--and this and no more was Darwin's famous discovery--that a third explanation, involving neither will nor purpose nor design either in the animal or anyone else, was on the cards. If your neck is too short to reach your food, you die. That may be the simple explanation of the fact that all the surviving animals that feed on foliage have necks or trunks long enough to reach it. So bang goes your belief that the necks must have been designed to reach the food. But Lamarck did not believe that the necks were so designed in the beginning: he believed that the long necks were evolved by wanting and trying. Not necessarily, said Darwin. Consider the effect on the giraffes of the natural multiplication of their numbers, as insisted on by Malthus. Suppose the average height of the foliage-eating animals is four feet, and that they increase in numbers until a time comes when all the trees are eaten away to within four feet of the ground. Then the animals who happen to be an inch or two short of the average will die of starvation. All the animals who happen to be an inch or so above the average will be better fed and stronger than the others. They will secure the strongest and tallest mates; and their progeny will survive whilst the average ones and the sub-average ones will die out. This process, by which the species gains, say, an inch in reach, will repeat itself until the giraffe's neck is so long that he can always find food enough within his reach, at which point, of course, the selective process stops and the length of the giraffe's neck stops with it. Otherwise, he would grow until he could browse off the trees in the moon. And this, mark you, without the intervention of any stockbreeder, human or divine, and without will, purpose, design, or even consciousness beyond the blind will to satisfy hunger. It is true that this blind will, being in effect a will to live, gives away the whole case; but still, as compared to the open-eyed intelligent wanting and trying of Lamarck, the Darwinian process may be described as a chapter of accidents. As such, it seems simple, because you do not at first realize all that it involves. But when its whole significance dawns on you, your heart sinks into a heap of sand within you. There is a hideous fatalism about it, a ghastly and damnable reduction of beauty and intelligence, of strength and purpose, of honor and aspiration, to such casually picturesque changes as an avalanche may make in a mountain landscape, or a railway accident in a human figure. To call this Natural Selection is a blasphemy, possible to many for whom Nature is nothing but a casual aggregation of inert and dead matter, but eternally impossible to the spirits and souls of the righteous. If it be no blasphemy, but a truth of science, then the stars of heaven, the showers and dew, the winter and summer, the fire and heat, the mountains and hills, may no longer be called to exalt the Lord with us by praise; their work is to modify all things by blindly starving and murdering everything that is not lucky enough to survive in the universal struggle for hogwash.|$|E

40|$|Myosin V and myosin VI are {{two classes}} of two-headed {{molecular}} motors of the myosin superfamily that move processively along helical actin filaments in opposite directions. Here we present a hand-over-hand model for their processive movements. In the model, the moving direction of a dimeric molecular motor is automatically determined by the relative orientation between its two heads at free state and its head's binding orientation on track filament. This determines that myosin V moves toward the barbed end and myosin VI moves toward the pointed end of actin. During the moving period in one step, one head remains bound to actin for myosin V whereas two heads are detached for myosin VI: The moving manner {{is determined by the}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> domain. This naturally explains the similar dynamic behaviors but opposite moving directions of myosin VI and mutant myosin V (the neck of which is truncated to only one-sixth of the native length).

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Helmholtz {{resonator}} geometry influence on its eigenfrequency is investigated using acoustic calculations. To perform acoustic calculations the {{finite element method}} was used. First of all, ANSYS software was {{used to create a}} resonator geometry model using finite elements of a certain size and shape. Thus, we used non-uniform partitioning of the model into finite elements. A more detailed partitioning was done in the vicinity <b>of</b> the resonator <b>neck.</b> Then, the resulting configuration was imported in SYSNOISE program to perform acoustic calculations. The calculation results allowed us to determine resonator eigenfrequency and identify dependences of the eigenfrequency on the geometric features of the resonator and of the duct in which it is located. The work considers the concentric Helmholtz resonators in ducts of circular and square cross-sections, when the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the resonator is a hole in the wall of the duct. Then for a duct of square cross-section two Helmholtz resonator models with its different location are considered. In the first model the resonator is located on the sidewall of the duct, and the second resonator is concentric. For a concentric resonator also the relationship between the attached <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> resonator and the chamber diameter was studied. Carried out researches have allowed us to establish that the shape of the resonator camera has a smaller effect on the eigenfrequency of the resonator than the geometry <b>of</b> its <b>neck.</b> The main parameter that defines the eigenfrequency of Helmholtz resonators with the same geometrical parameters is the attached <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> resonator. In turn, the attached <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> resonator is determined, mainly, by the ratio <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> diameter to the diameter of the duct.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{evaluated}} two different hip arthroplasty concepts trough {{in vitro studies}} andnumerical analyses. The cortical strains in the femoral neck area were increased by 10 to 15 % after insertion of aresurfacing femoral component compared to values of the intact femur, shown in an in vitrostudy on human cadaver femurs. There is an increased risk for femoral neck fracture after hipresurfacing arthroplasty. An increase of 10 to 15 % in femoral neck strains is limited, andcannot alone explain these fractures. Together with patient specific and surgical factors,however, increased strain can contribute to increased risk of fracture. An in vitro study showed that increasing the neck length in combination with retroversion orreduced neck shaft angle on a standard cementless femoral stem does not compromise thestability of the stem. The strain pattern in the proximal femur increased significantly at severalmeasuring sites when the version and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> were altered. However, the changes wereprobably too small to have clinical relevance. In a validation study we have shown that a subject specific finite element analysis is able toperform reasonable predictions of strains and stress shielding after insertion of a femoral stemin human cadaver femurs.
