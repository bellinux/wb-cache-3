50|$|Corneal {{epithelial}} cells present a physical barrier to prevent microbes {{from reaching the}} interior of the eye chamber, which is effectively separated {{from the rest of the}} body via tight junctions. At the same time, corneal {{epithelial cells}} also secrete cytokines to activate microbial defense. One cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1α, is stored in epithelial cells and automatically released when the cell membrane is ruptured by infection or trauma. However, long-term effects of IL-1α can lead to not only enhanced immune infiltration of the cornea, but also neovascularization (formation of new blood vessels), which can lead to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> corneal <b>transparency.</b> Therefore, the cornea has also been found to secrete an IL-1α antagonist, IL-1RN, which decreases leucocyte invasion of the cornea and suppresses neovascularization, both of which can help preserve vision.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of ammonia, {{in the range}} of temperatures from ≈ 100 K to ambient, on the IR spectrum of p+-type silicon (60 % porosity) has been investigated. In contrast with the case of NO 2 [1], interaction with NH 3 at low pressures and room temperature does not cause any reactivation of carriers (as monitored by the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> in the IR). Extensive reactivation is instead observed at low temperatures and high NH 3 pressures, the sample becoming strongly opaque below 2000 cm- 1.

Ammonia is an electron-donor molecule, so in principle chemisorption could occur, but plays no role in reactivation, in contrast with the NO 2 case. The findings, resembling those reported for polar liquids wetting p+-type PS, are explained on the basis of dielectric effects [2]: the observed <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> is related to the presence of a high-density gas filling the pores, possibly in a sort of supercritical state or at the most physisorbed on the walls...|$|E
