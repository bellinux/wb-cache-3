Fruits are naturally produced for local consumption and processed products. Most of tropical fruits are cultivated in developing countries. Due to <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> fruits growers, limited fruit harvesting and handling facilities, long distance between production fields and fruit markets/destination, and fruits are perishable in mature, these horticultural products are prompted to physical damages.

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain {{how much of the}} Prayer Book is actually Cranmer's personal composition. Generations of liturgical scholars have been able to track down the sources that he used, including the Sarum Rite, writings from Hermann von Wied, and several Lutheran sources including Osiander and Justus Jonas. More problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. Despite the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> who might have helped him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.|$|E

When Peter leaves, he kisses Fauxlivia and the three leave to get dinner.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{examine the}} impact <b>of</b> channel <b>knowledge</b> on the {{secondary}} user (SU) in a cognitive radio system. Under a mini-mum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraint {{for the primary}} user (PU) receiver, we determine the SU capacity under four channel knowledge scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the capacity cumulative distribution functions which are verified by means of simulations. We show that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> exact <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the PU-PU channel gain by the SU-Tx either prohibits SU transmission or necessitates high interference level at the PU. We also show that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> exact <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the SU-Tx to PU-Rx link {{has little or no}} impact on SU capacity. I...|$|R

25|$|Another {{factor was}} the {{solidarity}} {{shown by the}} families who refused to be separated. This desire undermined individual initiatives. Some older Jews also had difficulty remaining in hiding because of their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Greek language, which had only become the city's dominant language after annexation by Greece in 1913. Additionally, the large size of the Jewish population rendered impossible the tactic of blending into the Greek Orthodox population, as in Athens.|$|E

25|$|The {{first version}} of the town was a single large walled building, called the Habitation. A similar Habitation was {{established}} in Port Royal in 1605, in Acadia. This arrangement was made for protection against perceived threats from the indigenous people. The difficulty of supplying the city of Quebec from France and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the area meant that life was hard. A significant fraction of the population died of hunger and diseases during the first winter. However, agriculture soon expanded and a continuous flow of immigrants, mostly men in search of adventure, increased the population.|$|E
25|$|Cathay (1915) is a {{collection}} of classical Chinese poetry translated into English by modernist poet Ezra Pound based on Ernest Fenollosa's notes that came into Pound's possession in 1913. At first Pound used the notes to translate Noh plays and then to translate Chinese poetry to English, despite a complete <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese language. The volume's 15 poems are seen less as strict translations and more as new pieces in their own right; and, in his bold translations of works from a language he was unfamiliar with, Pound {{set the stage for a}} modernist translations.|$|E

Both Clough and Taylor resigned on 15 October 1973, to widespread uproar from Rams fans, who demanded the board's resignation along with Clough and Taylor's reinstatement at the following home game against Leicester City five days later.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{explanations}} {{have been offered}} for the relatively poor performance of Somali pupils in British schools. These include {{the fact that many}} Somalis enter the British education system late due to their arrival as refugees and have had their education interrupted, stereotyping and a lack of cultural awareness on the part of school staff, an inability of parents to offer sufficient support due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the system and lack of maternal literacy, poverty and overcrowding in Somali homes, and a lack of role models. Lack of English language ability is a key factor. In the London Borough of Lambeth, around 87 per cent of Somali pupils are not fluent in English.|$|E
25|$|The Common Pursuit, another {{collection}} of his essays from Scrutiny, {{was published in}} 1952. Outside of his work on English poetry and the novel, this is Leavis’s best-known and most influential work. A decade later Leavis was to earn much notoriety when he delivered his Richmond lecture, Two Cultures? The Significance of C. P. Snow at Downing College. Leavis vigorously attacked Snow's suggestion, from a 1959 lecture and book by C. P. Snow (see The Two Cultures), that practitioners of the scientific and humanistic disciplines should have some significant understanding of each other, and that a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> twentieth-century physics was comparable to an ignorance of Shakespeare. Leavis's ad hominem attacks on Snow's intelligence and abilities were widely decried in the British press by public figures such as Lord Boothby and Lionel Trilling.|$|E
25|$|When Gaines reached Fort Brooke, {{he found}} it low on {{supplies}}. Believing that General Scott had sent supplies to Fort King, Gaines led his men on to Fort King. Along the road they found {{the site of the}} Dade Massacre, and buried the bodies in three mass graves. The force reached Fort King after nine days, only to find it was very short on supplies. After receiving seven days worth of rations from General Clinch at Fort Drane, Gaines headed back for Fort Brooke. Hoping to accomplish something for his efforts, Gaines took his men on a different route back to Fort Brooke, intending to engage the Seminoles in their stronghold in the Cove of the Withlacoochee River. Due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the country, the Gaines party reached the same point on the Withlacoochee where Clinch had met the Seminoles one-and-a-half months earlier, and it took another day to find the ford while the two sides exchanged gunfire across the river.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of 206 Portuguese {{managers}} enrolled in training courses in the lnstituto Superior de Gestao during the 1999 - 2000 academic year, this article aims at establishing priorities for executive development in this country by detecting the <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> those managers. The article explores the importance given by the managers to four areas of a manager's role (strategic vision, management tools, managerial skills and emotional capacities) and to several factors used to improve a company's performance. It also addresses the degree of knowledge/skill the managers interviewed think they have in relation to those areas and factors. Finally, the assessment of different learning methods frequently used on management training programmes is also addressed. The results obtained showed that Portuguese managers are in urge for training in strategic and market-related areas. Leadership and decision-making skills should also be trained. When designing and implementing training programmes in these subjects, it {{should be taken into}} account that Portuguese managers prefer participated and realistic learning techniques...|$|R
