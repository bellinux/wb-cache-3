25|$|Some Green Minibus Unions {{have called}} for the Government to provide a new fleet of buses which can hold up to 20 people, 4 more people than the current 16 people. They say it could help ease traffic {{congestion}} during rush hour and possible push up profits which may turn away possible fare increases. There {{are a few of}} the new buses in service at the moment, but because it is only legal to have 16 passengers in a minibus, the extra area is used as a <b>luggage</b> <b>rack.</b> The Government has responded saying that it would be prudent to first study the implications of such expansion in the context of a Public Transport Strategy Study first, which should take two years ending in 2017 or 2018.|$|E
25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic hay fever which, {{according to}} Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the <b>luggage</b> <b>rack</b> to get some sleep and some respite from the dust.|$|E

25|$|However, these <b>luggage</b> <b>racks</b> {{were always}} underutilised. Travellers {{preferred}} {{holding on to}} their bags where they were standing or sitting, as opposed to placing them on the <b>luggage</b> <b>racks,</b> probably due to convenience and fear of theft. Some commuters were also complaining that these racks took up critically needed space which could be occupied by other passengers which often filled the train. Furthermore, the service to Changi Airport was cancelled and replaced by a shuttle service to and from Tanah Merah station, dismissing {{the need to provide}} these racks for non-airport bound train services. Therefore, in 2003, trains with the <b>luggage</b> <b>racks</b> had them removed, and replaced with an empty standing area, with a dual purpose of serving as a wheelchair area.|$|R

At Eton he played tricks on John Crace, his Master in College, among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a College magazine implying pederasty.

[...] With 150hp more than the Pioneer III cars (550hp total) the Silverliners could achieve a 1.7mph/s acceleration rate which was quite higher than the older MP54s and multi-function couplers and disc brakes further improved performance. [...] The 38 PRR cars were numbered in two series, 201-219 and 251-269 and given PRR classification MP85B, while the 17 Reading cars were numbered 9001-9017 and given Reading classification REB-13. [...] There were also minor differences between the two sets of vehicles with the PRR units being fitted with only one overhead <b>luggage</b> <b>rack,</b> a bar pilot, a metal framed engineer's window and cab signals, with the Reading cars being fitted with a cowcatcher and twin overhead luggage racks.
