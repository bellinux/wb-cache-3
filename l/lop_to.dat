For proper {{evaluation of the}} LOP, fractional cointegration analysis seems to be appropriate because of its flexibility in capturing {{a wider range of}} mean reversion behavior than standard cointegration analysis. Out of nine pairs of price series examined, fractional cointegration supports the existence of the LOP in eight cases, as compared to three cases using standard cointegration procedures.

50|$|The {{background}} of the American Fuzzy Lop is interwoven {{with the history of}} the Holland Lop. When first introduced, the Holland Lop rabbit was only available in solid colors, and some breeders wanted to add the broken pattern <b>to</b> the Holland <b>Lop</b> gene pool. <b>To</b> do this, they bred their Holland <b>Lops</b> <b>to</b> English Spots. While they achieved the goal of producing broken pattern rabbits, they failed to keep the rollback fur the Holland must have. The offspring instead had the flyback fur of the English Spot. The breeders then bred Holland <b>Lops</b> <b>to</b> French Angoras, a breed that has a very gentle rollback coat. The result of these manipulations was that the wool gene was also introduced into the Holland Lop gene pool and a Holland with long wool was occasionally found in Holland Lop litters. These were generally sold to people who were enchanted with a small wooled lop-eared rabbit.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{imperfections}} in {{butt welds}} is referred as {{the lack of}} penetration (LOP). Lack of penetration occurs due to weld metal fails to reach {{the root of the}} joint which is inevitable considering both the cost of the edge preparation and machining time into account.

States of stress at these highly stress concentration regions are evaluated by two important fracture parameters namely stress concentration factor (SCF) and stress intensity factor (SIF) using FEA. The SIF & SCF are evaluated at lack of penetration defects for double-V, single-V, double-J, and single-J butt welded joints subjected to axial loading with varying defect length (<b>LOP)</b> <b>to</b> plate thickness ratios to find an acceptable defect length.

Lewis rat islets were isografted into three different transplantation sites in streptozotocin-induced diabetic recipient rats. The SBSS was created by configuring part of the deserosalized jejunum into a U shape whilst the inferior surface of the liver and greater omentum were used to form the LOP. At postoperative day 30, normoglycemia was achieved in 100 % (12 / 12), 80 % (8 / 10), and 50 % (5 / 10) of the PV, SBSS and LOP groups respectively. In successful transplants, the majority of recipients exhibited sustained graft function. Oral glucose tolerance tests revealed that glucose tolerance was comparable in rats with either SBSS or PV islets. Morphologically, many intact islets were evident in the SBSS of normoglycemic recipients, whereas only islets adjacent to the liver surface survived in the LOP group. SBSS is easily accessible for surgical implantation and biopsy and well placed for portal delivery of insulin. In addition, {{it is capable of}} local drug delivery.

40|$|Total Allowable catches (TACs) for {{whitefish}} in European Union (EU) waters {{have been}} reduced each {{year for the past}} five years, thereby reducing fleet revenue. During the same period prices increased, partly offsetting income reductions. However, price changes depend on the structure of the market within which they are formed. Therefore, this paper examines the structure of the European first-hand market for whitefish. A Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) model in Error Correction form (ECM) is used to analyse landing prices among the main fishing nations, using co-integration tests and tests for the Law of One Price (<b>LOP)</b> <b>to</b> determine the degree of market integration. A partially integrated European first-hand market for whitefish is identified and as a part of this, a perfectly spatially integrated cod market.

The turbine had a relatively long slender shaft and the subsynchronous frequency was near the first critical speed of 1800 rpm. In an effort to allow the machine to reach full load a bearing redesign was undertaken. The bearing design was changed from the original 5 pad tilting pad journal (TPJ) bearings, orientated with the load on the bottom pad (<b>LOP),</b> <b>to</b> three pad TPJ?s also in the LOP configuration. Analysis indicated that the additional asymmetry in the dynamic coefficients would significantly increase the system logarithmic decrement (log dec) and allow the machine to run at full load without going unstable. With the three pad bearings installed the machine {{was brought up in}} speed and experienced subsynchronous vibration before reaching full speed. A design review of the bearings indicated that the top two pads of the three pad bearing were operating in the fully starved condition; that is they were not receiving sufficient oil to develop a hydrodynamic oil film. As such the horizontal stiffness went to near zero. This paper will present the results of the analysis work performed, including the starved bearing analysis, and the resulting redesign of the three pad bearing to run flooded. Operation as a flooded bearing allowed the machine to run fully loaded with no indications of unstable operation...|$|E
40|$|It is time {{to begin}} the next {{technology}} revolution in software development, and the shape of this revolution {{is becoming more and}} more clear. The next programming paradigm is nearly upon us. It is not yet fully formed—different parts have different names: Intentional programming, MDA, generative programming, etc. I suggest uniting all of these new approaches under one name, ‘language-oriented programming’, and this article explains the main principles of this new programming paradigm. Today’s mainstream approach to programming has some crucial built-in assumptions which hold us back like chains around our necks, though most programmers don’t realize this. With all the progress made so far in programming, we are still in the Stone Age. We’ve got our trusty stone axe (object-oriented programming), which serves us well, but tends to chip and crack when used against the hardest problems. To advance beyond stone, we must tame fire. Only then can we forge new tools and spark a new age of invention and an explosion of new technologies. I’m talking about the limitations of programming which force the programmer to think like the computer rather than having the computer think more like the programmer. These are serious, deeply-ingrained limitations which will take a lot of effort to overcome. I’m not being pretentious when I say that this will be the next big paradigm shift in programming. We will need to completely redefine the way we write programs. In this article, I present my view and my current work toward Language Oriented Programming (LOP). First I will show what is wrong with mainstream programming today, then I’ll explain the concept of LOP by using the example of my existing implementation, the Meta Programming System (MPS). This article is intended to give you a bird’s-eye-view of <b>LOP,</b> <b>to</b> spark interest in the idea, and hopefully to generate feedback and discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of phenylalanine in {{the presence}} of methyl 13 -hydroperoxyoctadeca- 9, 11 -dienoate (LOOH), 2, 4 -decadienal (DD), 4, 5 -epoxy- 2 -decenal (ED), 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HN), and 4 -oxo- 2 -nonenal (ON) was studied both to explore the potential of lipid oxidation products (<b>LOP)</b> <b>to</b> produce amino acid decarboxylation and to understand the reaction pathways responsible for this degradation. All assayed LOP were able to decarboxylate phenylalanine, but their reactivity decreased in the following order when the reaction was carried out under non-oxidative conditions: DD>ED≈LOOH>HN≈ON. The reaction pathway is proposed to take place by decarboxylation of the imine formed between the amino group of the amino acid and the carbonylic group of the oxidized lipid. This decarboxylation is facilitated due to the formation of a relatively stable azomethine ylide after the loss of carbon dioxide from a 5 -oxazolidinone intermediate. The azomethine ylide would, finally, evolve into new conjugated imines, which are the origin of both β-phenylethylamine and phenylacetaldehyde, which was also detected in the reaction mixtures. The activation energy (E a) for the phenylalanine decarboxylation {{in the presence}} of 2, 4 -decadienal was 54 kJ/mol. Although additional studies are needed to determine the contribution of the chemical pathways described in this study to the overall biogenic amine formation in foods, this study provides the chemical basis both to understand how biogenic amines can be produced chemically from amino acids {{in the presence of}} lipid-derived carbonyls and to propose potential inhibitors in this route. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Packet {{classification}} is {{an important}} method implemented in modern network processors used in embedded systems such as routers. Packet classification methods also serve to detect network intrusion, enable the deployment of Quality of Service techniques, and facilitate the use of firewalls in large networks. Current software-based packet classification techniques exhibit low performance, prompting researchers to move their focus to architectures encompassing both software and hardware components. Some of the newer hardware architectures exclusively utilize Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) to improve the performance of rule matching. However, this results in systems with high power consumption. A novel SRAM-based multi-stream architecture, named LOP which significantly reduces power consumption while improving throughput beyond that of the TCAM approaches is proposed in this thesis. Compared with a state-of-the-art TCAM implementation (throughput of 495 Million Searches per Second (495 Msps)) in 65 nm CMOS technology, on average, LOP saves 43 % of energy consumption with a throughput of 590 Msps. Moreover, hardware-based packet-side range encoding units have been introduced to integrate with <b>LOP</b> <b>to</b> further reduce power consumption without sacrificing throughput. The combinational architecture, named LOP_RE, can save 65 % energy consumption of TCAM. To reduce area, a hardware-based state machine {{has been designed to}} share range-encoded memories between multiple streams. In addition, hybrid packet classification architecture, named HybridLOP, is proposed to implement network intrusion detection system. A signature-based intrusion detection system, SNORT has been tested to show that the hybrid packet classification system achieves high throughput. The LOP-based architectures are customized architectures which can be configured according to the required throughput and/or power consumption. The architectures with different configurations have been implemented using VHDL and synthesized using Synopsys Design Compiler with TSMC's 65 nm process library. PrimeTime-PX was used to estimate the power consumption of the circuits and Modelsim was used to simulate the design under the Linux environment. Network anomaly detection is one of the emerging network applications. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, a novel network anomaly detection system, named MCAD is introduced, which utilizes packet classification systems.
