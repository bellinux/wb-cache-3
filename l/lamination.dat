The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy <b>lamination</b> coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale <b>lamination,</b> ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} {{laid down in}} layers called beds or strata. A bed {{is defined as a}} layer of rock that has a uniform {{lithology}} and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure it forms in a rock is called <b>lamination.</b> Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and <b>lamination</b> are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding. Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.|$|E

Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or glass cloth impregnated with synthetic resin.

25|$|The mode of {{formation}} of the cell wall was controversial in the 19th century. Hugo von Mohl (1853, 1858) advocated {{the idea that the}} cell wall grows by apposition. Carl Nägeli (1858, 1862, 1863) believed that the growth of the wall in thickness and in area was due to a process termed intussusception. Each theory was improved in the following decades: the apposition (or <b>lamination)</b> theory by Eduard Strasburger (1882, 1889), and the intussusception theory by Julius Wiesner (1886).|$|E
25|$|The {{parabolic}} form of St Paul's {{was made}} possible by the use of glued laminated timber for the internal arches. Laminated timber arches, constructed by overlapping and bolting together small pieces of timber to make a single, large member, have been in use in Australia since the mid-19th century. Cost-effective and able to span large distances without intermediate posts, laminated timber arches also became an alternative system for roof structures of large buildings such as markets, factories and, from the early 20th century, large auditoria and picture theatres. The process of glue <b>lamination,</b> using casein glue to bond the layers of timber rather than bolts, originated in Germany before being introduced to the United States in the 1920s. Several publications in the 1930s and early 1940s provided the necessary data for constructing glued laminated timber arches, and became a source of inspiration for Australian designers. The earliest experiments in Australia took place in the early 1940s and the arrival of powerful synthetic resin adhesives in the post- World War II period increased the reliability and range of applications of glue <b>lamination.</b> The former Burge Bros Factory in Melbourne (1945–46) is considered to be the oldest known surviving example of this technology in Australia, with semi-circular arches spanning 30 metres, manufactured by Sydney-based company Ralph Symonds Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board <b>lamination</b> and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E

40|$|A {{proof of}} the Ending <b>Laminations</b> Theorem is given which uses Teichmüller geodesics directly, restricted, for {{simplicity}} to the case when the ending <b>laminations</b> data {{is a pair of}} minimal <b>laminations.</b> Minsky’s {{proof of the}} Ending <b>Laminations</b> Conjecture for any Kleinian surface group Γ ([7], [3]) can be considered to consist of three stages: 1. the construction of a geometric model up to quasi-isometry, given the ending <b>laminations</b> of H 3 /Γ; 2. the construction of a map from the geometric model to H 3 /Γ which is Lipschitz, at least onto the thick part of H 3 /Γ; 3. a proof (with Brock and Canary) that this map is, in fact, biLipschitz.

500|$|The skintight suits worn by {{the actors}} were {{reminiscent}} of the outfits {{worn by the}} actors in the original film. Kosinski believed that the costumes {{could be made to}} be practical due to the computerized nature of the film, as physically illuminating each costume would be costly to the budget. Christine Bieselin Clark worked with Michael Wilkinson in designing the lighted costumes, which used electroluminescent lamps derived from a flexible polymer film and featured hexagonal patterns. The lights passed through the suit via Light Tape, a substance composed of Honeywell <b>lamination</b> and Sylvania phosphors. To concoct a color, a transparent 3M Vinyl film was applied onto the phosphor prior to <b>lamination.</b> While most of the suits were made out of foam latex, others derived from spandex, which was sprayed with balloon rubber, ultimately giving the illusion of a lean shape. The actors had to be compressed to compensate for the bulk of the electronics. In addition, Clark and Wilkinson designed over 140 background costumes. The two sought influence from various fashion and shoe designers in building the costumes. On the back of the suit was an illuminated disc, which consisted of 134 LED lights. It was attached to the suit via a magnet, and was radio-controlled. All the costumes had to be sewn {{in such a way that}} the stitches did not appear, as the design team figured that in a virtual environment the clothes would just materialize, with no need for buttons, zippers or enclosures. According to Neville Page, the lead designer for the helmets, [...] "The art departments communicated very well with each other to realise Joe’s [...] vision. We would look over each other’s shoulders to find inspiration from one another. The development of the costumes came from trying to develop the form language which came from within the film." ...|$|E
500|$|In a [...] "complete" [...] spinal injury, all {{functions}} {{below the}} injured area are lost, {{whether or not}} the spinal cord is severed. [...] An [...] "incomplete" [...] spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of injury in the spinal cord. [...] To be classed as incomplete, there must be some preservation of sensation or motion in the areas innervated by S4 to S5, e.g. voluntary external anal sphincter contraction. The nerves in this area are connected to the very lowest region of the spinal cord, and retaining sensation and function in these parts of the body indicates that the spinal cord is only partially damaged. [...] Incomplete injury by definition includes a phenomenon known as sacral sparing: some degree of sensation is preserved in the sacral dermatomes, even though sensation may be more impaired in other, higher dermatomes below the level of the lesion. Sacral sparing has been attributed {{to the fact that the}} sacral spinal pathways are not as likely as the other spinal pathways to become compressed after injury due to the <b>lamination</b> of fibers within the spinal cord.|$|E

40|$|To improve cement {{penetration}} {{into the}} cancellous bone of the acetabulum in hip arthroplasty, sequential cementation of each anchoring hole may be feasible. Since this procedure creates <b>laminations</b> in the cement, we have determined {{the conditions under}} which such <b>laminations</b> affect the strength of the cement. Cement bars made at 2, 3 or 4 minutes after the start of cement mixing and with either dry <b>laminations</b> or <b>laminations</b> including blood or saline were tested for tensile strength. Solid unlaminated bars were used as references. Dry and saline <b>laminations</b> made up to 4 minutes after the start of cement mixing did not reduce the strength of the cement.

In such cases, there was a decrease in strength for <b>laminations</b> made at 4 minutes, at 3 minutes this was less pronounced and at 2 minutes no weakening at all was noted. Our findings indicate that a sequential cementation procedure is permissible as regards cement strength, provided it is performed with 2 - 3 minutes after the start of cement mixing.
