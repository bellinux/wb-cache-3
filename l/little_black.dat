5|$|Potter had {{maintained}} {{contact with her}} last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish. Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
5|$|Levering Road {{continues}} easterly {{leaving town}} south of Sherett Lake. East of the intersection with Ingleside Road, C-66 crosses into Cheboygan County. The roadway curves {{to the northeast}} before returning to a due eastward course north of Munro Lake along the Hebron–Munro township line.. The landscape changes to include more farm fields once road passes the lake. C-66 intersects I-75 at exit326 along the latter. On {{the east side of}} the interchange, Levering Road passes Sea Shell City, a tourist trap, and turns northeastward into Hebron Township. C-66 then turns easterly again before it crosses into Beaugrand Township, taking the additional name Cheboygan Road. The roadway crosses branches of the <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> River and passes to the south of the Cheboygan County Airport. East of the airport, C-66 enters the city of Cheboygan and follows State Street into town; this area is residential in nature. State Street crosses the North Central State Trail, a rail trail, before turning to the southeast. The roadway passes into the northern end of downtown near several smaller businesses.. C-66 terminates at a four-way intersection with Main Street one block west of the Cheboygan River; this intersection also marks the northern terminus of M-27. As a county-designated highway, C-66 is maintained by the Emmet and Cheboygan county road commissions (ECRC, CCRC) in their respective counties.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the wood}} carving {{activities}} {{are related to the}} making of items for religious purposes. These include images and masks, which are used for processions and dances. The use of masks dates back to the pre Hispanic era and today are used for dances such as Moors and Christians, the Devils, the <b>Little</b> <b>Blacks,</b> Los Viejitos, the Ranchers, the Hermits the Maringuias (men in women’s dress) and Cúrpites (which means “eat together”). Utilitarian items include spoons, trays and shallow bowls, some of which are elaborately decorated.|$|R

The Pequods next gam {{is with the}} French whaler Bouton de Rose, whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession. Stubb talks them out of it, but Ahab orders him away. Days later, an encounter with a harpooned whale prompts Pip, a <b>little</b> <b>black</b> cabin-boy from Alabama, {{to jump out of}} his whale boat. The whale must be cut loose, because the line has Pip so entangled in it. Furious, Stubb orders Pip to stay in the whale boat, but Pip later jumps again, and is left alone in the immense sea and has gone insane by the time he is picked up.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} well known in the country for its music and dance. The fandango is a dance brought over from Spanish. Today the state has two varieties: the jarocho and the huasteco. Indigenous and folk dances in the state are most often {{associated}} with rituals and religious festivals. These include one called Los Lisceres also called the Tigres from the Los Tuxtlas region. Participants wear Olmec style masks which represent the rain god Tlalóc. Another is Los Guaguas in which the participants pay homage to the sun, and Los Santiagos, which is related to the veneration of Saint James, patron saint of Hernán Cortés. One last one is called Los Negritos (The <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> Ones) which was created by African slaves. According to tradition, the origin of this dance lies in a story about a boy who was bitten by a snake and the rituals his family held to heal him.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known for}} her short stories, Byatt has been {{influenced}} by Henry James and George Eliot as well as Emily Dickinson, T. S. Eliot, and Robert Browning, in merging realism and naturalism with fantasy. Her story collections include Sugar and Other Stories (1987); The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye (1994), a collection of fairy tales; Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice (1998); and <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> Book of Stories (2003). The Matisse Stories (1993) features three pieces, each describing a painting by Henri Matisse, each the tale of an initially smaller crisis that shows the long-present unravelling in the protagonists' lives. Her books reflect a continuous interest in zoology, entomology, geology, and Darwinism among other repeated themes. Byatt has written for media including the British journal Prospect, The Guardian, The Times and The Times Literary Supplement. She has been a judge on many literary award panels including the Hawthornden Prize, the Booker, David Higham Prize for Fiction, and the Betty Trask Award.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} dances in several parts of Mexico include or feature masks imitating African or black faces. These have their origins with the {{importation}} of African slaves by the Spanish. These slaves had contact with the indigenous peoples, often as intermediaries {{between them and the}} Spanish overlords. This experience was incorporated in indigenous dances, with the dancers called “negritos” (<b>little</b> <b>black</b> ones). Negrito masks vary by region. Those from the Costa Chica region of Oaxaca and Guerrero have realistic or exaggerated Negroid features, and other from the Sierra de Juarez of Oaxaca are more primitive with small tusks protruding from the mouth. Those from Michoacán have fine features and a gentle expression. Sheepskin is often added to suggest hair. The masks are worn as part of a costume which usually has the dancer elegantly dressed, with colorful fabrics and headdresses. In the colonial period, blacks had a wide range of occupations so this was portrayed in dances. Although most of the Africans intermarried {{with the rest of the}} population, the masks remain.|$|E
25|$|Ranma goes {{to school}} with Akane at , where he meets his {{recurring}} opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the conceited kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also {{falls in love with}} Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} <b>little</b> <b>black</b> pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
