40|$|We {{present a}} simple, easy to {{implement}} methodology for pricing microfinance loans and loan guarantees using publicly available data on loan write-offs by Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs).

Our quantitative analysis is consistent with pricing seen in a recent securitization deal.

40|$|Excessive credit {{creation}} by banks {{was at the}} root of the recent financial crisis. Nevertheless, micro-prudential regulation lacks a clear methodology to identify these banks. Combining arguments from banking and auction theory, we show that overoptimism causes excessive lending, subsequently yielding abnormal <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs.</b> We propose a new measure of excessive credit growth known from macroeconomics to identify credit booms and test our model for German bank and bankportfolio level data. Unlike traditional measures of (excessive) loan growth, our new measure identifies banks that are affected by abnormal <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs,</b> need capital support, or default in subsequent years...|$|R
40|$|The European Central Bank's asset {{purchase}} programs, while intended {{to stabilize the}} economy, may have unintended side effects on financial stability. This paper aims at gauging the effects on financial markets, the banking sector, and lending to non-financial firms. Using a structural vector autoregression analysis, we find both in the euro area and in Germany {{a positive effect on}} output, while prices do not respond significantly. Asset purchases reduce financial stress, but this beneficial effect is overturned in the medium run. In Germany, implicit firm default rates rise, while <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> by banks decrease. This could point to an avoidance of balance sheet repair in the financial sector...|$|R
40|$|This article first {{investigates the}} microfinance—principally microinsurance—market {{at the global}} level and the {{business}} structure of over 600 microfinance institutions (MFIs) in 83 countries that were in operation during 1998 – 2007. It then empirically examines the impact of organisational, market and socio-cultural factors on the supply of insurance, lending and savings services by MFIs in developing countries. Findings from a series of probit analyses indicate that a rise in the financial expense ratio, loan repayments in arrears, years of operation, number of borrowers, woman borrower ratio, life insurance penetration ratio and family size positively affect MFIs’ willingness to expand their operations, certainly to microinsurance business. In contrast, they are likely {{to stay away from the}} insurance market when their loan asset ratio, bad <b>loan</b> <b>write-off</b> ratio or average loan size in comparison to GNI per capita is on the rise. It seems MFIs focus on lending service in Muslim populous countries. Finally, we find no evidence that presence of insurance affects availability of savings service, and vice versa, in the microfinance market. ...|$|E
40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), the centerpiece of the United States 700 billion dollar policy response to the global financial crisis of 2008. We frame our analysis of the United States policy response against the backdrop of Japan’s banking crisis and policy response in the late 1990 s. As one of the only advanced economies with a large global presence in international finance, Japan’s banking crisis of 1997 and {{the effectiveness of}} the policy response offered important lessons to U. S. policymakers in 2008. Based on empirical studies of Japan’s bank recapitalization program, we distill the most crucial lessons to be the importance of speed, adequate scale and customized restructuring in forming recapitalization packages. The United States and other economies affected by the 2008 global crisis took this first lesson to heart and reacted with unprecedented speed to events in the Autumn of 2008. But despite the large headline figure of 700 billion dollars, the program was not of adequate scale and was actually smaller than Japan’s recapitalization program of 1997 - 1998 in relative terms. More critically, program implementation in the first year was standardized and there was no investigation into the recipient banks’ business plans or financial condition to allow restructuring to be tailored to each individual recipient bank. These latter two points significantly hampered {{the effectiveness of the}} bank recapitalization program. Our findings demonstrate that the program was successful in achieving at least one policy objective of the program: boosting recipient banks regulatory capital ratios. But we find that the program failed to achieve another important policy objective, to stimulate bank lending. To the contrary, we find evidence that recipient banks reduced lending, presumably because of the pressure to cut highly risk-weighted assets in order to increase their capital adequacy ratios. Although encouraging banks to increase bad <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> was not an explicit policy objective of the CPP according to our reading of statements from the Department of Treasury, we also look at the impact of the program on bad <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> and find no evidence that recapitalization stimulated bad <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> either. The main empirical results here echo the findings of analysis of Japan’s bank recapitalization program in 1997. In Japan’s case, the second round capital injections in 1998 were of significantly larger scale and more tailored {{to meet the needs of}} recipient banks, which increased the effectiveness of the policy intervention. Future research will investigate whether the United States followed a similar pattern and the CPP recapitalizations of 2009 were more effective than those made in the first year of the program. ...|$|R
40|$|Hungary was the � rst {{transition}} economy {{to complete the}} process of privatisating state banks. This article outlines this process {{in the light of}} the economic and � nancial pressures after 1989, which had severely weakened the � nancial condition of these banks. It describes the ways in which bank balance sheets were consolidated by state-underwritten <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> and injections of capital within a new legislative framework. The main privatisations are described in a set of mini-case studies. The process was effectively complete by end- 1997. The EBRD was closely involved as adviser and investor, signi � cant revenue was generated for the state (albeit much lower than the consolidation support required), foreign strategic investors were attracted and no major � nancial institution had to be liquidated. Despite the attendant controversy and scandal, the Hungarian experience offers useful lessons to other transition economies which have yet to seriously address this issue...|$|R
40|$|Treatments of Indonesia's {{financial}} crisis customarily focus on exchange rate collapse, neglecting {{the question of}} why enterprises were so highly leveraged beforehand. This article reviews controlling shareholder-debtor behaviour both before and during the crisis. It then examines Indonesia's emergency bankruptcy legislation effective August 1998 —which enjoys a mixed record in implementation—and articulates bankruptcy policy principles for the replacement legislation now being drafted. Progress on the insolvency front has been limited to {{a relatively small number of}} voluntary debt reorganisations. Early indications are that such restructurings largely take the form of debt rescheduling rather than debt-equity swaps, <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs,</b> or other approaches that would lessen enterprises' heavy leveraging. This outcome reflects problems in creditor as well as debtor preferences. What began as a private sector insolvency problem increasingly overlaps with efforts to address general banking sector difficulties. Further, nationalism questions complicate the resolution of insolvencies. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{approach}} to offering financial {{services to the}} poor has evolved over the past decades. The microfinance schism between the two paradigms, institutionist and welfarist, {{has yet to be}} narrowed by evidence of greater success of the one over the other. The drive for commercialisation of microfinance institutions has spurred many crises across the globe and the validity of the argument that commercial microfinance is more sustainable has come under scrutiny. This research report dissects the sustainability of African Bank and Capitec, two commercial microfinance institutions. Accounting ratios are applied to the audited financial data of both microfinance institutions to measure their sustainability from 2007 up to their most recent audited results. The research has found that both microfinance institutions experienced rapid growth since 2007, primarily driven by larger average loan sizes over longer terms. The research shows that Capitec has more diverse sources of revenue and depends less on its loan portfolio to generate income than African Bank. It also shows that Capitec has a more conservative approach with regard to provisioning for loans, and is consequently better prepared for <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> than African Bank. Overall, Capitec is found to be more sustainable in each period measured...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a compilation}} of three studies that seek to extend the reaches of agency theory. In the first study, data on California banks from 1979 - 1987 were {{used to test the}} effect that board strength has on the acquisition and subsequent <b>write-off</b> of problem <b>loans.</b> As expected stronger boards incurred fewer loan delinquencies and loan losses. Board strength was also associated with smaller increases in <b>loan</b> <b>write-offs</b> when management turned over but larger increases when board members turned over. This suggests that board members are susceptible to escalating their level of commitment {{in the same way that}} managers are, implying that board members are also self-serving. Using the same data set, the second study examined the relationship between management ownership in banks and corporate performance and risk-taking. In support of the agency argument, increased management ownership led to higher levels of ROA and loan losses in the banks. The function was diminishing but monotonic. Using data gathered from private colleges and universities, the third study focused attention on agency in the not-for-profit sector by examining the relationship between board of director and presidential demography and school performance as measured by institutional revenue and gifts. The results provide mixed support and direction for the extension of agency models to the not-for-profit sector. Board strength, as measured by tenure and functional background, and presidential tenure, predicted better performance. These findings suggest that while boards play a significant role in performance of not-for-profits, their focus is on facilitating access to resources from the external environment rather than in monitoring management...|$|R
30|$|Several {{papers have}} {{analyzed}} {{whether or not}} the weakness of lending growth might be related to the demand by the Japanese regulator for a rigorous self-assessment of their assets, which led to a substantial amount of <b>loan</b> loss <b>write-offs</b> and provisions. Focusing on that later development, Woo (2003) and Watanabe (2007) found that Japanese banks significantly reduced their lending in response to a large increase in bank capital requirements resulting from the reinforcement of the prudential policy guidelines by the Japanese regulator. Watanabe’s results suggest a very large role was played by the contraction of capital in business lending: had capital not been squeezed, business lending to sound industries (which indeed fell, depending on the industry, between 3 and 5  % points) would actually have increased. Instead of looking at regulatory changes, we analyze the impact of changes in bank capital associated to changes in house prices at the onset of a (severe) recession.|$|R

To reach this goal, we investigate a competing risks model applied to whole credit risk cycle into a bank loans portfolio. We estimated competing causes related to occurrence of default, thereafter, comparing it with estimated competing causes that lead <b>loans</b> to <b>write-off</b> condition. In context of modeling competing risks, we used a specification of Poisson distribution for numbers from competing causes and Weibull distribution for failures times.

Our empirical results show that the banking aggregates <b>loan</b> loss provisions, <b>write-offs,</b> and total <b>loans</b> can be modelled for this group of banks using a small number of macroeconomics variables. Actually, we conclude that the output gap is a strong factor in the model, and that the model performs well when only this external factor is considered. ...|$|R
