40|$|Volatile compounds, {{physicochemical}} and sensory {{attributes of}} four sweet cherry cultivars (Canada giant, Ferrovia, <b>Lapins</b> and Skeena) grown in Northern Greece were determined. Eighteen volatile compounds {{were identified and}} semi-quantified in cherries using solid phase micro extraction in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). Carbonyl compounds were the most abundant in sweet cherry aroma, followed by alcohols, esters and hydrocarbons/terpenes. Cherry cultivars in order of increasing amounts of volatiles were: <b>Lapins</b> < Canada giant < Ferrovia < Skeena. Physicochemical parameters determined included: titratable acidity (TA), pH, total soluble solids (TSS), maturity index (MI) and total phenolic content (TPC). TA ranged between 0. 21 and 0. 28 g malic acid/ 100 g fresh weight (FW). The pH ranged between 3. 81 and 3. 96. TSS ranged between 13. 00 and 16. 00 °Brix. MI ranged between 51. 8 and 75. 0. TPC ranged between 95. 14 and 170. 35 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) / 100 g FW. Sensory evaluation showed that cherry colour, in order of increasing intensity, was: Canada giant < Ferrovia < <b>Lapins</b> < Skeena. Respective order for cherry firmness was: Canada giant < <b>Lapins</b> ≤ Ferrovia < Skeena and for flavour: <b>Lapins</b> < Canada giant < Skeena ≤ Ferrovia. Correlation of volatiles to physicochemical and sensory attributes showed varying trends...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{method to}} regenerate adventitious shoots and to produce field-ready trees from three commercial cultivars of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) is described. The effects of explant types, pre-treatments, basal media, and phloroglucinol on cultivars Bing, Sweetheart, and <b>Lapins</b> were investigated. Callus developed on four explant types: apical shoot tips isolated from orchard trees; and punctured shoot tips, stem sections, and shoot bases of in vitro shoot cultures. Callus formed on Bing (5 %), Sweetheart (8 %), and <b>Lapins</b> (20 %) shoot tips from orchard trees after 4 months on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) at half-strength with 3 μM benzylaminopurine (BA). In vitro-derived explants formed callus after 3 months on Woody Plant Medium with 3 μM BA (W 3 B) : punctured shoot tips (Sweetheart and <b>Lapins</b> 67 %), stem sections (Sweetheart 31 %, <b>Lapins</b> 27 %), and shoot bases (Sweetheart 10 %, <b>Lapins</b> 17 %). Pre-treatment of shoot cultures on MS with 3 μM BA and 1 mM phloroglucinol increased callus formation three-fold on shoot base explants. Callus {{was separated from}} parental explants and maintained on MS with 3 μM BA. Shooting was induced by transferring callus to W 3 B. At 2 weeks, shoot development approached 100 %. By 4 weeks, 7 – 17 shoots had formed on each explant. Callus was maintained for 1. 5 years with no decrease in shoot production. Shoots were grafted onto Mazzard (P. avium) rootstocks with 54 % (Sweetheart), 57 % (<b>Lapins),</b> and 21 % (Bing) success after 5 weeks...|$|R

Inspired by a picture of a Rio de Janeiro fashion model in an issue of Women's Wear Daily, they had local fashion designer <b>Lapin</b> create a string bikini for the event. Models recruited by talent agent Peter Dasigner presented it by removing fur coats by Alberto Lemon on stage.

25|$|April 10, 2001: Pro-Moscow Grozny mayor Beslan Gantamirov {{announced}} that 17 bodies with gunshot wounds {{had been discovered}} {{in the basement of}} a bombed-out dormitory next to Oktyabrskoye city district police station, manned by the OMON special police troops from Siberia's Khanty-Mansiysk. The next day Gantamirov {{announced that}} his report was false and there were no bodies found. When explaining his change of heart, Gantamirov said that he learned of the discovery from the same source as the Russian envoy to the region Viktor Kazantsev, who also first confirmed the find, but later denied it. The OMON officer in charge of the station claimed the unit had nothing to do with the disappearance of local residents, adding that mass graves in Chechnya are commonplace. In March 2005, one of the unit's officers, Sergey <b>Lapin,</b> was convicted for the torture of a Chechen man who remains missing.

40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of {{phenolic compounds}} from five cultivars of frozen sweet cherries {{was assessed by}} a digestion process involving pepsin-HCl digestion (to simulate gastric digestion) and pancreatin digestion with bile salts (to simulate small intestine conditions) and dialyzed to assess serum- and colon-available fractions. After pepsin digestion, the % recovery of total phenolics, relative to the original starting material, increased, whereas the % anthocyanins did not change. Following pancreatic digestion and dialysis, the total phenolics in the IN (serum-available) fraction was about 26 – 30 % and the OUT (colon-available) fraction was about 77 – 101 %. The anthocyanin content in the IN fraction was 15 – 21 %, and in the OUT fraction, it was 52 – 67 %. Skeena, <b>Lapins,</b> and Sweetheart cultivars contained higher levels of total phenolics and anthocyanins, which resulted in higher concentrations of these compounds in the IN and OUT fractions. The potential bioavailability of phenolic compounds was also assessed in Bing and <b>Lapins</b> cultivars at three ripening stages. Immature cherries had higher % total phenolics in the IN fraction than mature or overmature cherries. However, immature cherries had the lowest concentrations of these compounds, making the actual bioavailable amounts of these compounds lower than for mature and overmature fruit. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of <b>Lapins</b> cherries at three maturity stages confirmed the results obtained using spectrophotometric methods for total phenolics and anthocyanins...|$|R
