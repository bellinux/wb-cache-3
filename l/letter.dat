5|$|A {{photograph}} of the Rhoads' <b>letter</b> was published on January 27, 1932 in La Democracia, the Unionist newspaper of Antonio Rafael Barceló, with a translation in Spanish of the entire <b>letter.</b> It did not support Albizu Campos' theory of a US conspiracy against Puerto Rico. On February 13, El Mundo published the entire <b>letter,</b> in both Spanish and English.|$|E
5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} <b>letter</b> was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the <b>letter.</b> Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the <b>letter</b> down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the <b>letter</b> to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the <b>letter</b> to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the <b>letter,</b> and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} <b>letter</b> earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the <b>letter</b> appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct <b>letter</b> keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a <b>letter</b> that is not in the puzzle, calls a <b>letter</b> that has already been called in that round, fails to call a <b>letter</b> within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect <b>letter</b> or answer.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last <b>letter</b> of Irma's first name and a <b>letter</b> not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate <b>letter</b> from Irma's first name and a <b>letter</b> not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred <b>letter</b> of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E

40|$|Learning <b>letters</b> is {{associated}} with a long-term learning. Two basic models are present in obtaining <b>letters</b> in a systematic literacy in Slovenia and abroad. One represents a separate acquisition of the uppercase and lowercase printed <b>letters</b> (sequentially) and the other deals with <b>letters</b> simultaneously. In practice, teachers often asked themselves, especially in times of reforms in literacy, which model of the acquisition of the <b>letters</b> in initial literacy is more efficient. The research focused on the effect of the two most frequently chosen procedures for acquiring <b>letters</b> of structured literacy in Slovenia, namely the simultaneous treatment of the uppercase and lowercase printed <b>letters</b> (lowercase cursive <b>letters</b> and upper-case cursive <b>letters)</b> and consecutive treatment of <b>letters</b> (uppercase printed <b>letters,</b> lowercase printed <b>letters,</b> lowercase cursive <b>letters,</b> and at last, uppercase printed <b>letters).</b> Furthermore, the focus of the research was on the impact of gender on the ability to write. The incidence of errors was observed in terms of selected procedures for acquiring the <b>letters</b> in groups and gender. At the same time, the effect of consolidation of writing individual <b>letters</b> (uppercase and lowercase printed <b>letters</b> in 2 nd class, and lowercase and uppercase cursive <b>letters</b> in 3 rd class), was examined...|$|R

Local publishers printed over 700copies of the <b>letter.</b> It also appeared in the two main Texas newspapers and was eventually printed throughout the United States and Europe. Partially in response to the <b>letter,</b> men from throughout Texas and the United States began to gather in Gonzales.
