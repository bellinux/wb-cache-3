50|$|A {{traditional}} lock pick uses trial-and-error {{methods to}} find the correct alignment of the locking pins. The snap gun uses a primary law of physics, the transfer of energy, to momentarily burst all of the driver pins out of the lock cylinder without sending the bottom pins up into it. The snap gun strikes all of the bottom pins at once with a strong impact, and then withdraws again. The bottom pins transfer their kinetic energy to the top pins and come to a complete stop without penetrating the <b>lock</b> <b>housing.</b> The driver pins are {{thrown out of the}} cylinder body entirely up into the <b>lock</b> <b>housing.</b> Until the springs force the driver pins back into the cylinder, the lock cylinder is momentarily unobstructed. The physical effect of the impact is similar to the game of billiards, where the cue stick first strikes the cue ball, transferring kinetic energy into the cue ball. The cue ball then strikes a target ball. Since the two balls are very elastic, and since the target ball is free to move, the cue ball (representing a bottom pin) comes to a complete stop at the point of impact and the target ball (representing a driver pin) continues moving with most of the kinetic energy that was formerly in the cue ball.|$|E
50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock {{normally}} contains {{a set of}} bottom pins {{and a set of}} driver pins. The bottom pins move within pin channels inside the cylinder assembly and are cut at different lengths corresponding to the lock keying. The driver pins are installed in the <b>lock</b> <b>housing</b> and spring pressure forces them to penetrate the lock cylinder and prevent it from turning. If the wrong key is inserted, it will variously push the bottom pins either too high or not high enough, and the lock cylinder can not turn. When the bottom pins are correctly aligned by the key, the top pins are exactly aligned with the barrel of the cylinder, and it may freely turn.|$|E

5000|$|The name Day's Lock {{comes from}} the Day family, local Catholic yeomen since the 17th century. During the 16th century, there was a flash lock here. The pound lock was staked out in August 1788. It was judged best to build it on the Oxfordshire bank {{provided}} the existing weir owner would [...] "remove his bucks"(eel traps). In 1865 it {{was reported to be}} in utter ruin and dangerous, but reconstruction did not take place until 1871. In 1882 a bell push to summon the keeper was installed, there being no <b>lock</b> keeper's <b>house</b> at that time.

5000|$|Old Ford Lock was rebuilt {{as a pair}} of {{locks on}} a {{different}} alignment in 1856, and the junction with the old course of the River Lee was reworked to remove an awkward bend. They were known as the small lock and the large lock, one being 15.75 ft wide and the other being 18.25 ft wide. Both were rebuilt with a width of 18.5 ft in 1935, but retained their names, the small lock being shallower than the large lock. Further rebuilding had to take place during the Second World War after they were hit by a bomb on 19 October 1940, which also destroyed the <b>lock</b> <b>houses.</b> New <b>lock</b> <b>houses</b> were built in 1946, and were sold in the 1990s, after which they were used as the location for the television programme [...] "The Big Breakfast".|$|R
