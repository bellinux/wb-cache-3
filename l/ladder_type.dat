40|$|We report {{results of}} a new {{analysis}} for the low-temperature structure of # # -NaV 2 O 5 from synchrotron X-ray di#raction experiments. We confirm the existence of two inequivalent ladder structures in each vanadium layer. Based on our structural data we perform a bond-valence calculation for the vanadium sites in the low temperature state. Due to an asymmetric charge ordering we obtain only two di#erent vanadium valences despite the three inequivalent sites. This explains the V-NMR observation of only two resonant peaks in the charge ordered phase. By use of a Slater-Koster method to obtain hopping matrix elements and cluster calculations we obtain e#ective vanadium-vanadium hoppings which compare well to LDA results. Using these in a cluster calculation we obtain a superexchange of 0. 047 eV between electrons on neighbouring rungs of the same ladder for the undistorted phase.

40|$|Allpass {{filters are}} {{commonly}} employed in many applications to perform group delay equalisation in the passband. They are non-minimum phase by definition and are characterised by poles and zeros in mirror-image symmetry. SI allpass filters of both cascade biquad and bilinear-LDI <b>ladder</b> <b>types</b> {{have been in}} existence. These were implemented using Euler based integrators. Cascade biquads {{are known to have}} highly sensitive amplitude responses and Euler integrators suffer from excess phase. The equalisers that are proposed here are based on bilinear integrators instead of Euler ones. Derivation of these equalisers can proceed from either the s-domain, or directly from the z-domain, where a prototype is synthesised using the respective continued-fractions expansions, and simulated using standard matrix methods. The amplitude response of the bilinear allpass filter is shown to be completely insensitive to deviations in the reactive ladder section. Simulations of sensitivities and non-ideal responses reveal {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various structures. Existing DI multirate filters have to date been implemented as direct-form FIR and IIR polyphase structures, or as simple cascade biquad or ladder structures with non-optimum settling times. FIR structures require a large number of impulse coefficients to realise highly selective responses. Even in the case of linear phase response with symmetric impulse coefficients, when the number of coefficients can be halved, significant overheads can be incurred by additional multiplexing circuitry. Direct-form IIR structures are simple but are known to be sensitive to coefficient deviations and structures with non-optimum settling times operate entirely at the higher clock frequency. The novel SI decimators and interpolators proposed are based on low sensitivity ladder structures coupled with FIR polyphase networks. They operate entirely at the lower clock frequency which maximises the time available for the memory cells to settle. Two different coupling architectures with different advantages and disadvantages are studied...|$|R

50|$|Described as {{track with}} {{longitudinal}} bearers with cross ties, <b>ladder</b> track <b>type</b> was common on early British railways (c.1830/40s), including the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, Dublin and Kingstown Railway, Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, Great Western Railway (see Baulk road), Ulster Railway, Newcastle and North Shields Railway, Slamannan Railway (part of), Hull and Selby Railway (two thirds of), Manchester and Bolton Railway (including lontudinal stone sleepers), and the London and Greenwich Railway (partly). On the Hull and Selby Railway {{it was used}} in part as it was noted to produce smooth running, and low wheel wear. However the contact between rail and sleeper produced hydraulic pumping in wet conditions, which led to rolling stock becoming dirtied very quickly. The longitudinal track was also found cause issue with wheel slip on inclines, and to be noticeably inferior to transverse sleepered track in terms of traction. No longitudinally laid track remained on the line after 1860.|$|R
