Professor Behar read this story as an artistic comment within a workshop entitled ‘Between Art and Research: Rethinking Professional Borderlands’, which dealt with the experiences of people who combine an academic professional career with artistic work. The story is followed by a personal reflection by Bishop Björn Vikström, presented within the context of a session dealing with objectivity and the problem of combining academic research with personal engagement and activism. Finally, two of the organisers of the Aboagora conference, Professor Hannu Salmi and Dr Ruth Illman, reflect on the outcome of the event, evaluating the new insights and perspectives it has facilitated, as well as looking to the future and the potential of Aboagora to develop into a permanent forum for encounters between the arts and sciences...|$|R
40|$|In Spanish Golden Age drama we {{come across}} {{all forms of}} the {{reception}} of ancient writers’ motifs: explicit (direct quotation of an ancient author, where the quotation may {{be more or less}} complete, or a clear allusion to it), implicit (where there is no explicit mentioning of the ancient source, however certain ancient elements are mentioned such as persons, places, historical circumstances), hidden (where there is no clear hint about a literary intervention in Antiquity or an imitation of the <b>literary</b> <b>excerpt</b> or motif), as well as direct imitation (aemulatio) or adaptation (variatio). In the Renaissance and Baroque there are almost no motifs, which could not be taken over from Antiquity without a transformation or innovation. If there is a close correspondence to the ancient motif, it is generally sufficient simply to mention it or employ a side motif as an illustration of a similar situation without elaborating the motif further or weaving it more deeply into the supporting fabric of the dramatic work. The ancient authors who contribute the motifs are numerous and diverse: Vergil, the Roman elegists Propertius in Tibullus, the lyric poet Horace, the comedian Plautus, the stoic philosopher Seneca, the historian Tacitus, the novelist Apuleius, as well as Greek dramatist Aeschylus and stoic philosopher Epictetus. The genres, which are a source for the surviving ancient motifs in the Golden Age in the selected authors, include literary as well as not-literary forms: epic poetry, lyric, dramatics, philosophy and historiography...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} of multimodality in supporting text comprehension of literary texts in language learning of the L 2. While multimodal texts offer multiple ways of meaning making that sometimes go beyond the written text, I have focussed on multimodal expressions that mirror {{the context of a}} given text. I conducted an empirical study with 114 students (grade 9; 13 - 14 years) in two schools in Trondheim, Norway. The material I used consisted of three <b>literary</b> texts (<b>excerpts</b> from Penguin Readers books adapted for the age group) for which the supported by illustrations and audio files was systematically varied in an experimental design. The students carried out a standardized reading test (Hodder reading test) in a first session to establish different levels of reading proficiency, before they took the main reading comprehension test which included the multimodal text expressions in a second session, about 1 - 2 weeks later. In addition, their personal experience of support by the multimodal expressions was measured in a questionnaire. Differences between the different versions of the texts were analysed by chi-square tests, analyses of variance, and analyses of covariance. The reading proficiency test proved to be a good indicator for successful understanding of the literary texts. The different modalities seem to support reading comprehension, but the effects appear to depend partly on the students’ level of reading proficiency and fatigue. The results are interpreted in the light of cognitive theory of multimedia learning and dual coding theory...|$|R

The former piece is first mentioned in her journal on 1 January 1869 as one of the tasks for the coming year. In August she began writing, but progress ceased in the following month amidst a lack of confidence about it and distraction caused by the illness of George Henry Lewes's son Thornie, who was dying of tuberculosis. (Eliot had been living with Lewes since 1854 as part of an open marriage.) Following Thornie's death on 19 October 1869, all work on the novel stopped; it is uncertain at this point whether or not Eliot intended to revive it at a later date. In December she writes of having begun another story, on a subject that she had considered [...] "ever since I began to write fiction". By {{the end of the month}} she had written a hundred pages of this story and entitled it [...] "Miss Brooke". Although a precise date is unknown, the process of incorporating material from [...] "Middlemarch" [...] into the story she had been working on was ongoing by March 1871.

40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} deals with various {{possibilities}} of using <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts</b> from dystopian narrative {{in the classroom}} of English learners from technical institutes. This approach could fit into the traditional and communicative methodology framework for furthering a more informed and deeper understanding of lexical and grammatical formulas, syntactic relations, discursive particulars and extralinguistic concepts. Science fiction texts with a clear dystopian undertone provide a rich material for language-based analysis and in-class discussions inspired by poignant multimodal creative discourse related to the spheres of engineering, robotics, academic research and daily life. Therefore, it could raise students’ motivation, professional curiosity and fascination with the English language that {{is now part of}} the technical university syllabus. Materials and Methods: the author uses the theoretical and practical suggestions put forward by Western teaching ideologists and practicionaries of such literature and language approach as well as attempts to summarize her own experience of working as an English teacher at the technical university. Certain <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts</b> from exemplary science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” (1968) have been chosen for analysis and discussion. Results: the article showcases language uses and discourse messages in the passages of our choice as potential material for developing tasks, activities and discussions that could contribute to expanding students’ linguistic competencies and communicative skills. This could become a way of humanizing technical education and introducing socio-cultural or technological dilemmas. Discussion and Conclusions: the ideas for grammatical or lexical exercises, entertaining tasks or debate topics can be incorporated into the English courses that make an emphasis on general, specific or academic aspects and seek to avoid overloading their syllabus with non-contextualized or condescending English language textual material. These suggestions could be taken into account for preparing regular lessons, reading sessions or home tasks...|$|E

The study sought to determine if the publications portrayed women as political actors (much as the leading party newspapers of that era were doing), how they defined women's role, and if they challenged conventional wisdom on women's place.

40|$|This study {{explored}} reader {{responses to}} different literary depictions of rape. Four <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts</b> were used and divided as aesthetic versus nonaesthetic (style) and allusive versus explicit (detail). The general question was how readers {{would react to}} literary fragments depicting rape and whether the level of aesthetics {{and the level of}} explicitness influenced readers' thoughts and feelings. An open-ended question asked readers to report how the style had influenced their thoughts and feelings, whereas 7 -point scales addressed the following variables: experienced distance, perceptions of realism and of beauty, emotional versus intellectual reaction, empathy, tension, and arousal. In a 2 (detail: explicit vs. allusive) × 2 (style: aesthetic vs. nonaesthetic) within-participant design (N = 34), gender functioned as a between-participants variable. Results indicate that the personal tendency to feel engaged with fiction overrides effects of aesthetics and explicitness. Principal-components factor analysis suggests that readers who are easily engaged with the characters feel unsettled when reading rape scenes they find brutal and intellectualize to handle these feelings. These “high empathizers” {{are not likely to be}} detached or to appreciate the fragment negatively: once absorbed, they will try to take something positive even from an unsettling experience...|$|E

40|$|Noteworthy {{semantic}} {{studies have}} been conducted to explicate anger concepts in different languages. One tool for such crosscultural comparisons is the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), a set of 56 indefinable words or semantic primes developed by Anna Wierzbicka over a period of 35 years. Using this tool in analyzing emotion concepts through linguistic evidence such as <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts,</b> dialogs and interviews reveals the fact that while emotional universals allegedly exist, emotions are experienced and expressed differently. The use of the semantic primes allows the formulation of a detailed statement (otherwise known as explication) of the elements that compose the meaning or definition of a complex word. Semantic explications for anger words in different languages reveal marked differences in their causes, management and expression. It seems that "simple terms for emotion or for particular emotions in one language often do not translate into simple terms in another language " (Goldie 2000 : 90). For instance, the emotion words for anger such as the AngloSaxon anger, the Ifaluk song, the Chinese nu or the Polish gniew were found to be different from the Filipino galit. Using the NSM as a common measure or tertium comparationis, one can correctly and meaningfully compare as many different languages as possible.

I {{have created}} and {{developed}} an interdisciplinary high school curriculum that examines themes of existential thought in selected literature. The literature {{examined in this}} curriculum represents existential thought during the post Enlightenment era, the Czarist Regime of Russia and the war stricken world of twentieth century Europe. This course is designed to engage students in deep analysis of literature in order to extract, examine and discuss the existential themes of the text. The curriculum is divided into several units and two distinct sections. The introductory section provides students with a clear depiction of existential thought as it was first introduced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and affords {{students the opportunity to}} develop the skills necessary to identify and evaluate existential themes in <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts.</b> The second section provide an opportunity for students to read, analyze, evaluate, and critically assess four pieces of literature that contain some of the many existential themes introduced in the first section. Each piece of literature is also introduced with a general and over-arching introduction to the historical social and political context within which each author wrote. Throughout the entire course students will be asked to reflect on the literature and make distinct connections to their own lives and the role of existential thought today. As students analyze literature and the historical context of each author???s life, they will also be identifying more modern manifestations of the existential notions of anxiety, absurdity, alienation, freedom, authenticity and death. This will allow them to understand and identify the manifestation of existential thought in their own lives and assess the relevance of such deep philosophical thought in the world today.

40|$|This {{piece was}} written for a program held by the American Association of Law Schools Section on Law and Humanities, 2 ̆ 2 Excavating and Integrating Law and Humanities in the Core Curriculum, 2 ̆ 2 on January 5, 2012. I began {{teaching}} Contract Law in 1997, and because I wanted my students to benefit from an interdisciplinary approach to the subject, I chose a wonderful casebook edited by Amy Kastely, Deborah Waire Post, and Sharon Hom, called Contracting Law. Rather than the sterile doctrinal analysis of the traditional 1 L classroom, I hoped to have my students gain {{an appreciation of the}} human dimension of legal problems and the encounters between ordinary individuals and legal institutions. My own research at the time explored the intersection of law and local culture to uncover the way people made race in their everyday lives. I hoped that in the classroom we could similarly think about law in its cultural-historical context. Likewise, I thought that only by situating law in its cultural-historical context could students gain enough purchase to be critical of the legal status quo. I think {{it is fair to say}} that Contracting Law was the first (and it may be the only) critical race feminist Contracts casebook. It is also the only Contracts casebook that I know of that attempts to engage the humanities. It is filled with poems and excerpts of novels, in addition to law review articles from a variety of viewpoints. It didn 2 ̆ 7 t even look like other casebooks. It was bigger and heavier and the typeface was large enough to read easily. My students hated it. They hated that it was different.

40|$|Neste trabalho, o nosso foco radica na anÃlise das polÃticas linguÃsticas e da situaÃÃo sociolinguÃstica e sociocultural em MoÃambique decorrente da confluÃncia de vÃrias lÃnguas e culturas para compreender os processos de nativizaÃÃo/ nacionalizaÃÃo da lÃngua portuguesa no paÃs. Ao longo do trabalho usÃmos, com regularidade, o termo nacionalizaÃÃo tendo em vista evidenciar os processos subjacentes Ã apropriaÃÃo do PortuguÃs em MoÃambique, perspectivando o pressuposto polÃtico-ideolÃgico de ser uma lÃngua oficial e de unidade nacional, lÃngua de Estado e da nacionalidade moÃambicana. O interesse em pesquisar a temÃtica prende-se com as ambivalÃncias das bases epistemolÃgicas da polÃtica linguÃstica do paÃs que preconizou a oficializaÃÃo do PortuguÃs sem o nacionalizar e nacionalizou as lÃnguas bantu, tambÃm designadas lÃnguas autÃctones, e que o discurso oficial as tipifica como lÃnguas nacionais, nÃo obstante estarem fragmentadas geograficamente, ou seja, sem extensÃo {{territorial}} nacional, sem as oficializar. Mais ainda, pelo facto de profissionalmente trabalharmos na Ãrea da lÃngua portuguesa e o dia-a-dia demonstrar evidÃncias de que o PortuguÃs em MoÃambique caminha Ã margem do desiderato oficial, isto Ã, a pretensa replicaÃÃo dos traÃos caracterÃsticos da norma europeia adoptada como norma-padrÃo, lÃngua oficial e de unidade nacional em 1975, ano da independÃncia do paÃs, razÃo pela qual estÃ sendo modificado pelo uso e direito costumeiro dos falantes como resultado do cruzamento de diferentes lÃnguas e culturas tendo em conta alguns dos estudos, dos quais destacamos os de GonÃalves (1996 a, 1996 b, 1998, 2010), Firmino (2006) e Mendes (2010). Os dados analisados, decorrentes dos excertos de textos literÃrios, de jornais e de uma revista permitem-nos asseverar que o PortuguÃs Europeu estÃ sendo nacionalizado em decorrÃncia da sua apropriaÃÃo linguÃstico-cultural e simbÃlico-ideolÃgica pelos moÃambicanos, daÃ o surgimento de outra lÃngua portuguesa no paÃs. Esta perspectiva Ã de CÃsar e Cavalcanti (2007), na medida em que se referem aos diferentes falares do PortuguÃs nÃo como variedades ou dialectos, mas outras lÃnguas legitimadas pelos usos socioculturais e contextuais da lÃngua. Por isso, o PortuguÃs de MoÃambique deve ser normatizado. Igualmente, os resultados da pesquisa mostraram, por exemplo, que as polÃticas linguÃsticas estÃo desarticuladas com o actual contexto sociolinguÃstico do paÃs, por conseguinte urge a necessidade de serem revistas para darem cobertura Ã diversidade linguÃstico-cultural e enquadrar no sistema polÃtico-administrativo do Estado muitas pessoas que se sentem Ã margem da sociedade homogeneizada, tendo em conta que a cultura que une Ã tambÃm a cultura que separa. E para compreendermos os contornos sociolinguÃsticos que estÃo a ocorrer no paÃs recorremos a diversos procedimentos metodolÃgicos, tais como a pesquisa qualitativa, auxiliada pelos paradigmas interpretativista de Bortoni-Ricardo (2008) e indiciÃrio de Ginzburg (1989). In this paper, {{our focus}} {{lies on the}} analysis of linguistics politics and the sociolinguistics situation in Mozambique, due to the confluence of several languages and cultures, to understand the processes of nativization and nationalization of Portuguese language in that country. Throughout the work, we have used, on a regular basis, the term ânationalizationâ in order to highlight the underlying processes to the ownership of Portuguese in Mozambique, viewing the ideological and political basis of being a n official language and a national unity, State and Mozambican language. The interest in studying the topic {{is related to the}} ambivalence in the epistemological foundations of the countryâs linguistics politics, which called for formalizing the Portuguese language without nationalizing it, and nationalized Bantu languages, also known as indigenous languages. The official discourse typifies them as national languages, despite being geographically fragmented, i. e. without national territorial extension, without officializing them. Moreover, for the fact that we work professionally with Portuguese language, and that day by day there is evidence that the Portuguese in Mozambique walks on the sidelines of the official goal, i. e., the alleged replication of the Eu ropean standard characteristics, adopted as standard and official language and as a national unity in 1975, the nationâs independence day, reason for which it is being modified by customary law and thespeakersâ usage as a result of crossing different languages and cultures, taking into account some of the studies, which include Goncalves (1996 a, 1996 b, 1998, 2010), Firmino (2006) and Mendes (2010). The analyzed data, arising from <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts,</b> newspapers and magazines, allowed us to assert that the European Portuguese is being nationalized {{as a result of its}} culturallinguistics and ideological-symbolic appropriation by Mozambicans, hence the rising of a different Portuguese in that country, under the perspective of Caesar and Cavalcanti (2007), who refer to different dialects of Portuguese not as variation or dialects, but as other languages, legitimated by socio-cultural and contextual use of language. Therefore, Mozambiqueâs Portuguese should be regulated similarly to different treatments that the also called Camoesâs language is assumed around the world. Also, the results showed, for example, that language politics are disjointed with the current sociolinguistic context of that country. Therefore, there is an urgent need of revising it in order t o cover linguistic and cultural diversity and frame many people, who are on the margins of a homogenized society, in the Stateâs political and administrative system, taking into account that the culture that unites is also the culture that segregates. In order to understand the sociolinguistic contours that are taking place in that country, we resorted to various methodological procedures, such as a qualitative research, aided by Bortoni-Ricardoâs interpretivist (2008) and Ginzburgâs (1989) evidentiary paradigms...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{consider}} the ethical difficulties faced by a teacher of English and American literature in secondary schools when the classes consist of pupils of widely divergent religious training and backgrounds. The problems at first {{would seem to be}} confined only to those schools where such religious disagreements make themselves felt strongly through the fact that a relatively large percent of Jewish pupils {{is to be found in}} an enrolment that is in general overwhelmingly Christian. Under such circumstances a teacher suddenly becomes aware of several elements of dissension: (1) how strongly pro-Christian much literature is; (2) how logical it is to have non-Christians feel that whatever is pro-Christian must automatically be anti-Semitic; and (3) how the presence of many devout members of Christianity and of Judaism together in the same class can raise harassing ethical problems that might never come to light in a class that was religiously homogeneous. In recent years the problem has attained national significance by being discussed in educational journals and in the general press. Improvement of public relations, attempts to attain mutual understanding through inter-faith groups, and conferences of leaders of Christians and Jews have gone far toward religious harmony. Still, frequent protests are heard that one group is usurping another's prerogatives, and the struggle goes on, daily becoming one of widening national concern to conscientious educators. The method of treatment here is to present the problem first in its broad ethical setting, showing how the study of professional codes of ethics influences the outlook and how moral issues, in general, apply to the problem of this thesis in particular. Next are presented the Christian assumptions that are to be found in literature, and later come the Jewish refutations of those assumptions. It is these refutations that cause the difficulties whenever Jewish pupils find themselves assigned to read their high-school literature. Each question that they ask poses a new ethical puzzle to the teacher. Sometimes he can solve it immediately; more often, not. Two of his great disadvantages are the swiftness of time and the need for an immediate reply. He realizes that adolescents will not [...] perhaps because they are so constituted that they cannot [...] suspend judgment. He sees the long view. He tries to make them see it, but it does not appeal to them because they live in the present. The future, from their point of view, is something to worry only older people. The next four chapters, (IV, V, VI, and VII), consider many examples from a typical secondary-school curriculum in literature. The material included for discussion by types consists of novels, short stories, poems, plays, essays, and a special text. Each is minutely scrutinized to present the individual problems as they occur in regular classroom recitations. No unnecessary duplications are included, and the writer has tried to be careful to avoid the kind of distortion that can come from quotations set down out of their proper contexts. Such novels are investigated as Ivanhoe, Men of Iron, Silas Marner, The Pearl, Start of the Trail, A Tale of Two Cities, and Mutiny on the Bounty. The short stories wherein problems occur are comparatively few, in fact, two only. Next come discussions of many poems. Poets, somehow, seem to offer more frequent cause for heated argument; consequently, there is a larger amount of poetry under discussion than of any other kind of literature. Plays are examined, too, among them being She Stoops to Conquer, The Rivals, Macbeth, and Hamlet. They offer fewer, but no less pointed, ethical dile 1 nmas for the teacher. Finally, essays come up for consideration, and in them, also, are to be found ethically painful lines. Sometimes one wonders whether all the lines that evoke classroom controversy are included in the material deliberately or unconsciously. It hardly seems that so many as are presented could have been deliberate; yet if the offenses are unconscious, some pupils consider them all the worse for the author's ingrained prejudices, which are thus proved so deep and so much a part of his very self that he is culpably not even aware of them. From consideration of all the <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts</b> presented as controversial in this thesis, one can draw five important conclusions: (1) There is much more material than one would casually suppose which can excite young people of diversified religious beliefs. (2) Every one of the controversial items poses an embarrassing ethical problem for the teacher who tries to be fair. (3) No one automatic formula for handling a problem is necessarily effective for another problem or even for handling the same problem a second time, human nature being what it is. (4) Perhaps a suggestion one can properly make is that every teacher of literature needs first to study ethics in general; then if it does not meet all his needs, he must evolve his own well-formulated principles which will serve as a guide. His personal ability to adapt them to each new situation as it confronts him will be the measure of his success in performing his teaching effectively, for he does not belong in the teaching profession if he does not recognize its potential opportunity to implant in young people a realization of worthwhile values of life. (5) Lastly, the teacher of literature must always remember, no matter what religious groups constitute the class, that pieces of literature are being studied as works of art, not as exemplifications of religious beliefs. The aesthetic and socio-cultural values, when presented and accepted as paramount, may pave a way to harmonious religious understanding...|$|E
40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityCritical historians generally contend that Scanderbeg's victories have been exaggerated by his biographers {{and then they}} jump {{to the conclusion that}} the whole story of the Albanian hero is an inflated balloon. They seem to forget that no reasonable doubt can be entertained about the central fact of the story, which is the following: In 1443, Scanderbeg seized the fortress of Croya and defended it against Murad II and Mehmed II successively for a quarter of a century, and Croya fell to the Turks ten years after Scanderbeg's death, in 1478. Consequently the exaggerations of his biographers deal only with minor details, which do not weaken the central fact at all, namely that the two great Sultans failed to defeat Scanderbeg and capture his stronghold. The problem then is only to explain the factors which enabled Scanderbeg to put up such a long and heroic resistance. Two Albanian historians, Antivarino, or the Anonymous of Antivari, and Marinus Barletius of Scutari, wrote extensive biographies of Scanderbeg. Both of them are panegyrists but their story can be checked, corrected and supplemented by archival sources now made available as well as by the writings of contemporary Albanian, Italian, Ragusan, Byzantine and Turkish historians. All these sources are enumerated and critically analyzed. The work done by sixty-two other investigators in the field is reviewed for the first time in Scanderbeg's historiography. Other important features of this dissertation are the following: Various neglected documents and literary sources, especially Fontano, Cribotoulos of Imbros and some Turkish annalists are used extensively; the legends of the early career of Scanderbeg (1405 - 1443) are eliminated, and this period is reconstructed on the basis of hitherto ignored literary and archival sources; the social and economic factors are duly emphasized. The Albania crusade against the Turks was financed in the first place by the Popes of Rome, because Albania was predominantly Roman catholic. The Kingdom of Naples, the Venetian Republic, the City of Ragusa and the Kingdom of Hungary did their share also in backing the Albanians for reasons of self-preservation. Their support proved to be inadequate. Nevertheless, it was substantial enough to make the Albanian resistance reach epic proportions. The principal reason why the Albanians were still fighting when everybody around them had fallen flat before the Turks is that they were the only free peasants left in the Balkans. They were defending their liberties while their Serbian, Bulgarian and Greek neighbors were serfs, who had no interest whatever in defending their feudal lords. The Albanian crusade was a people's war. Moreover, the mountainous terrain was an ideal ground for guerrilla warfare, in which the Albanians were past masters. Scanderbag spent his youth, not in the Sultan's palace, as the legend has it, but in the Albanian mountains, which explains why he became the greatest guerrilla leader of all times. This contention, which was first advanced by the Czech scholar, Jireček, is confirmed by both literary and archival successes. On this basis the early career of Scanderbeg can be summarized as follows: Born in 1405, he became nominally a Moslem under the influence of his father in 1430, served occasionally with Albanian contingents in the feudal army of Murad II, and obtained a military fief in the region of Dibra in 1463 as a reward for his services. In 1443, after the death of his father, he was allowed to inherit the paternal state as the Sultan's vassal with the exception of the key fortresses which were held by Turkish garrisons since 1430. At the invitation of Pope Eugene IV and immediately after Hunyadi's victory at Nich in 1443, Scanderbeg revolted, seized the fortress of Croya with forged documents, abjured Islam, and initiated his crusade which made him the most famous general of his time in Europe. In 1444, he was elected commander-in-chief by the League of Albanian Chieftains at Alessio and defeated a Turkish army in Torviolli. He soon came into conflict with the Venetians, who were afraid of losing their coastal possessions in Albania. In 1448 he defeated both the Venetians and the Turks in a war of two fronts. The Venetians had to sue for peace and promised to pay him an annual pension to carry on his crusade. Murad II, alarmed by this alliance, led an expedition personally in 1449 but succeeded only in ensuring the frontier fortress of Sfetigrad. He returned in 1450 and besieged Croya for five months but was compelled by Scanderbeg to raise the siege and withdraw from Albania. In 1451, Scanderbeg placed himself under the protection of Alphonse V of Naples and reorganized the League of Albanian Chieftains, who had deserted him under Turkish pressure and Venetian instigation during the siege of Croya. With Neapolitan assistance Scanderbeg took the offensive. In 1455 he besieged Berst in an effort to eliminate the Turkish salient of Valona on the Adriatic Sea. His army was annihilated by Issa Beg Evranos. The Venetians incited Scanderbeg's allies to revolt and crush him after this disaster. The rebels, Moses Araniti and Hamza Castrioti, Scanderbeg's own nephew, invaded Albania with Turkish armies but were defeated one after the other in 1456 and 1457. After the loss of his two best friends, Alphonse V and Pope Calixtus III, who died in 1458, Scanderbeg patched up his differences with the Venetians, with whom he had been in a state of undeclared war ever since 1450. In 1460 Scanderbeg concluded an armistice with Mehmed II and in 1461 he went to Italy to help King Ferdinand of Naples against the French pretender René d'Anjou. His expedition was financed by Pope Pius II with crusade money raised in Ragusa and in Dalmatia. According to Pontano, whose testimony is confirmed by other literary and archival sources, Scanderbeg saved Ferdinand from disaster. Hs broke the siege of Barleta, where Ferdinand was encircled by Piccinino, Jean d'Anjou and the rebellious Neapolitan barons; he captured the fortress of Trani by a ruse de guerre; he outmaneuvered the enemy with his blitz cavalry raids; and enabled Ferdinand to take the offensive which led him to final victory. Ferdinand rewarded Scanderbeg with fiefs in Apulia, granted him a hereditary annual pension, helped him with soldiers, ammunition, money and supplies; gave his widow and son a refuge and protection after his death. Albanian light cavalry became famous in Italy and in Europe as a result of this expedition. In 1462 Scanderbeg returned to Albania and defeated three Turkish armies one after the other, in the same year. Threatened by the Venetians in the roar, he had to conclude peace with the Turks but six months later, at the invitation of Pope Pius II, he joined the Venetians and the Hungarians and declared war against Turkey in 1463. After the successive defeats of Balaban Pasha in 1464 - 1465, Mehmed II led in person two expeditions and besieged Croya twice In 1465 and 1467. Each time the siege was broken by Scanderbeg with the assistance of Pope Paul II and the Venetians. Scanderbeg died on Jan. 17, 1468, at Alessio, where he had gone to organize an expedition against the fortress of Elbassan. The contention of Saad-ed-Din, Gibbon and Jorga that Scanderbeg died there as a refugee is contradicted by archival sources published by Ljubić. In 1479, eleven years after Scanderbeg's death, Albania was ceded by the Venetians to the Turks. It was a cession on paper. Turkish rule remained nominal until Albania regained her independence in 1912. Scanderbeg was great in three different respects and won a place in history as peasant leader, strategist and crusader: The social class to which he belonged was that of the petty, or rather patriarchal aristocracy, but he identified himself with the Albanian free peasant clans, and became their greatest and most typical national leader in their long war on two fronts against the Turkish feudal lords and the Venetian merchant princes. According to General Wolfe of Quebec, "he excels all the officers, ancient and modern, in the conduct of a small defensive army", and according to Fallmerayer, he is "one of the greatest masters of all times in the art of war. " The title of Champion of Christendom, given to him by Pope Nicholas V and confirmed by three succeeding Popes, can be left to him safely, as he deserved it, according to Calixtus III, "more than any other Christian Prince with his memorable achievements. " He stopped Murad II and Mehmed II long enough to make them miss the boat for Rome. His long delaying action, coming at a critical period, did much to save Italy and Europe from the greatest calamity that could have befallen them, Turkish conquest. His share in this highly important service can hardly be overestimated. A bibliography of 169 items and an appendix containing 28 archival and <b>literary</b> <b>excerpts,</b> mostly neglected, has been added at the end of the dissertation as supporting evidence.
