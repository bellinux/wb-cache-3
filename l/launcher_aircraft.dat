5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo <b>launchers,</b> <b>aircraft</b> equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about {{half the cost of}} a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|R

The {{presence of the}} <b>launcher</b> forced British <b>aircraft</b> to operate above its envelope - typically at 18,000 feet (5,500 m) which severely reduced the accuracy of bombs dropped on the airport.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} use of NASTRAN is in {{the area}} of structural loads analysis on weapon systems carried aboard aircraft. The program is used to predict bending moments and shears in missile bodies, when subjected to aircraft induced accelerations. The missile, <b>launcher</b> and <b>aircraft</b> wing are idealized, using rod and beam type elements for solution economy. Using the inertia relief capability of NASTRAN, the model is subjected to various acceleration combinations. It is found to be difficult to model the launcher sway braces and hooks which transmit compression only or tension only type forces respectively. A simple, iterative process was developed to overcome this modeling difficulty. A proposed code modification would help model compression or tension only contact type problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the TAU-Code, DLR's system for complex flow simulations on unstructured hybrid grids. Starting from a short description of the system and its components, e. g. mesh adaptation or grid deformation, its basic capabilities are discussed. Thereafter recent and on-going developments are presented, such as the adjoint approach or a pilot installation exploiting structured grids. The remainder of the paper discusses a number of recent applications of varying complexity, both from DLR and aircraft industry, such as simulation of half-model effects in wind tunnels, effects of trailing edge devices on full aircraft configuration, flow about a helicopter fuselage and generic Arianne-type <b>launcher,</b> full <b>aircraft</b> simulations such as A 380 -type airplane with undercarriage or complete EF 2000. ...|$|R
50|$|The GSN-19 silent (flash and noiseless) grenade {{launcher}} {{is unusual in}} {{the fact that it is}} both muzzle- and breech-loaded. The standard projectile is a specially designed AP-I (Armour Piercing - Incendiary) grenade with pre-engraved rifling. The warhead is designed to penetrate hulls of tactical ballistic missile <b>launchers,</b> <b>aircraft,</b> C&C equipment, and then cause enough damage to render the target inoperative. The grenade has no propelling system in itself. The launch is performed by special blank cartridges, which are loaded into a detachable box magazine (holding 8 cartridges in the 7.62mm based version or 10 cartridges in the 5.45mm based version). Cartridges are fed into the chamber by a manually operated rifle-type rotary bolt action mechanism. To achieve the noise- and flash-less launch, blank cartridges are discharged into the limited volume breech, which is fitted with a movable telescopic piston at the front. Upon discharge, this piston violently pushes the grenade, loaded into the muzzle part of the launcher, out of the barrel, and then stops and seals the expanding powder gases inside the rear part of the launcher's barrel. After a short while the pressure inside drops to a safe level and the gun can be reloaded by operating the bolt (to extract the spent blank and load a fresh launching cartridge) and then loading the new grenade from the muzzle. Loaded grenade is held in the barrel by special springs. The muzzle velocity of the 30mm grenade for 7.62mm version is quoted as"above 100 m/s", for 5.45mm version it is listed as 175 m/s. Grenade launcher is attached to special brackets, welded to the host assault rifle. To fire GSN-19 accurately and comfortably, host rifle is equipped with special folding grenade launching sight (attached to the base of standard rear sight) and with removable rubber recoil-absorbing butt pad.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, the PAC-3 MSE missile is {{expected}} to be supplemented by IRIS-T SLS as secondary missile for ground-based medium range air defense. It is based on the IRIS-T air-to-air missile. The shorter range IRIS-T SLS system uses unmodified IRIS-T air-to-air missiles launched from standard LAU-7 <b>aircraft</b> <b>launchers,</b> four of which are mounted onto an all-terrain launch vehicle, while the medium-range IRIS-T SL missile is equipped with an enlarged rocket motor, datalink, and jettisonable drag-reducing nose cone.|$|R
2500|$|Kuma was refit in late 1934 with {{a tripod}} mast, two {{rotatable}} quadruple torpedo <b>launchers,</b> and an <b>aircraft</b> catapult for launching a reconnaissance floatplane, typically a Kawanishi E7K1 [...] "Alf". As the Second Sino-Japanese War began to escalate, Kuma patrolled the China coast, {{and covered the}} landings of Japanese forces in central China. She was captained by Captain Tadashige Daigo from November 1935 to December 1936.

5|$|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was {{composed}} of six constituent republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1991, Croatia, and Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina—a republic with a mixed population consisting of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats—followed suit in March 1992 in a highly controversial referendum, creating tension in the ethnic communities. Bosnian Serb militias, whose strategic goal was to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Serbia, encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, rocket <b>launchers,</b> and <b>aircraft</b> bombs. From 2May 1992 {{until the end of}} the war in 1996, the city was blockaded. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbering roughly 40,000 inside the besieged city, was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege. Meanwhile, throughout the country, thousands of predominantly Bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of ethnic cleansing. In Sarajevo, women and children attempting to buy food were frequently terrorized by Bosnian Serb sniper fire.|$|R

50|$|The Nagara-class vessels were {{essentially}} {{identical to the}} previous Kuma-class cruisers, retaining the same hull design, engines and main weaponry, {{with the addition of}} the new 610 mm Type 93 Long Lance Torpedoes, which required a larger launcher. However, in silhouette, a major difference from the Kuma class was in the configuration of the bridge, which incorporated an aircraft hangar. Initially, a 33 ft platform was mounted above the No.2 turret, extending over the forward superstructure below the bridge. This was later replaced by an aircraft catapult. Even so, the arrangement proved unwieldy, and the catapult was moved to the rear of each ship in the class, between the No.5 and No.6 turrets during retrofits in 1929-1934.Isuzu underwent a number of wartime modifications to increase her number of anti-aircraft guns, and to replace her twin torpedo launchers with a single quadruple aft mount. From May - September 1944, she was converted into a dedicated anti-aircraft cruiser, during which her entire main battery, torpedo <b>launchers</b> and <b>aircraft</b> catapults were removed, and replaced by three twin-mount 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns, and a Type 94 high angle fire control system and Type 13 and Type 22 radars were added.|$|R
5000|$|Aviation ordnancemen {{operate and}} handle {{aviation}} ordnance equipment. They {{are responsible for}} the maintenance of guns, bombs, torpedoes, rockets, and missiles. Their duties include the stowing, issuing, and loading of munitions and small arms. There are three different types of ordnanceman; [...] "O" [...] (organizational) level, [...] "I" [...] (intermediate) level, and [...] "D" [...] (depot) level. O-level ordnanceman are attached to squadrons ashore and afloat. They perform loading/downloading operations on aircraft as well as maintenance on bomb racks, missile <b>launchers,</b> and other <b>aircraft</b> components. Aviation ordnanceman [...] "A" [...] School is currently held at Pensacola Naval Air Station, in Florida, by the Naval Air Technical Training Center. Aviation ordnanceman training is approximately 5 weeks long. At aviation ordnanceman [...] "A" [...] School, subjects are taught basic aviation theory and skills, along with electronic troubleshooting. To become an aviation ordnanceman, one must have color perception and 20/20 vision or have their vision correctable to 20/20. One must also have an ASVAB score of VE+AR+MK+AS=185 or MK+AS+AO=140. While some aviation ordnanceman tasks require a secret security clearance, all ordnancemen must be eligible for the clearance. Ship's company, who are stationed on board ship and are also [...] "O" [...] level AOs, work in the magazines below decks or on the flight deck of aircraft carriers. They perform the assembly of bombs in large magazines below decks and are in charge of inventory of the weapons on the flight deck whether they are loaded on aircraft or stored behind the island. They also operate, maintain and repair weapons elevators and ordnance handling equipment. [...] "I" [...] level ordnancemen work in the aviation intermediate maintenance departments on ships at sea or in facilities ashore. They perform such tasks as preventive maintenance, repair, and testing of bomb racks, missile <b>launchers,</b> and <b>aircraft</b> guns for issue to squadrons. Depot [...] "D" [...] level is for equipment that needs to be completely overhauled and is beyond the capabilities of [...] "I" [...] level maintenance. In a 20-year period, an average aviation ordnanceman spends about 60 percent assigned to fleet units and 40 percent to shore stations.|$|R
