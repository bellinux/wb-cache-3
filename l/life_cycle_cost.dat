500|$|The USAF {{announced}} the CFM56 {{as the winner}} of the re-engine contract in January 1980. Officials indicated that they were excited at the prospect of replacing the Pratt & Whitney J57 engines currently flying on the KC-135A aircraft, calling them [...] "...the noisiest, dirtiest, [...] most fuel inefficient powerplant still flying" [...] at the time. The re-engined aircraft was designated the KC-135R. The CFM56 brought many benefits to the KC-135, decreasing takeoff distance by as much as 3,500ft (1,100m), decreasing overall fuel usage by 25%, greatly reducing noise (24dB lower) and lowering total <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>cost.</b> With those benefits in mind, the United States Navy selected the CFM56-2 to power their variant of the Boeing707, the E-6 Mercury, in 1982. In 1984 the Royal Saudi Air Force selected the CFM56-2 to power their E-3 Sentry aircraft (also related to the 707 airframe). The CFM56-2-powered E-3 also became the standard configuration for aircraft purchased by the British and French.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Yucca Mountain {{was one of}} {{the most}} studied pieces of geology in the world; between {{geologic}} studies and materials science the United States had invested US$9 billion on the project. This site studied by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) differs substantially from other potential repositories due to the finding of natural analogues of nuclear material that are currently being studied. The DOE estimates that it has over 100 million U.S. gallons of highly radioactive waste and [...] of spent fuel from the production of nuclear weapons and from research activities in temporary storage. The cost of the facility is being paid for by a combination of a tax on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power and by the taxpayers for disposal of weapons and naval nuclear waste. Based on the 2001 cost estimate, approximately 73 percent is funded from consumers of nuclear-powered electricity and 27 percent by the taxpayers. The Total System <b>Life</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Cost</b> presented to Congress on July 15, 2008 by Director Sproat was $90 billion. This cost, could not be compared to previous estimates since it included a repository capacity about twice as large as previously estimated over a much longer period of time (100 years vs 30 years). Additionally, the cost of the project continued to escalate because of insufficient funding to most efficiently move forward and complete the project. By 2007, the DOE announced it was seeking to double the size of the Yucca Mountain repository to a capacity of , or 300 million pounds.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that building processes with characteristics of integrated procurement can {{have a positive effect}} on the investment costs of a building. However, the relation between these characteristics and operational costs has not often been studied (operational costs include maintenance, cleaning and energy-related costs, e. g. heating, electricity and water). This is a missed opportunity since research indicates that not the investment costs but the operational costs are the majority of the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs</b> of a building. But even if both types of costs would be foreseeable, building projects still have very different characteristics and are difficult to compare, although this is required in order to find out which building process characteristics influence the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs.</b> Therefore in this study the main problem to be answered is how to design a method to compare various projects. In this report a method to compare different building projects in the school housing sector will be presented. This comparison is focused on <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs</b> and their relation to building process characteristics.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} the extent to which <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costing</b> is used as an early stage project evaluation tool by practitioners in the UK construction industry. The use of this evaluation tool has long been advocated by academics as a means of ensuring best value rather than lowest cost is a driver for business decisions related to potential built environment projects. Therefore there is a need to appraise its current uptake levels amongst built environment professionals and assess whether there are any barriers affecting its use in UK practice. Design/methodology/approach – Using a mixed methods approach, the authors present the findings from a survey of construction professionals located in the UK and the results from a series of follow up semi structured interviews designed to further explore the factors found to affect the use of <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costing</b> in practice. Findings - The study shows that <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costing</b> is still not widely used by built environment professionals in the UK. The greatest inhibitor on the take up of the tool is the need of clients to budget on short term horizons. Other factors such as a lack awareness of the tool by practitioners and clients, unreliability of data into the long term and the overriding need for commercially driven projects to achieve maximum return on investment continue to inhibit the widespread adoption of <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costing</b> as an early stage project evaluation tool. These findings have implications for the capability of the UK construction industry to deliver on its commitment to enhance the sustainability of the built environment.

This paper focuses on the economic aspects to estimate the <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs,</b> value added and consumer costs of {{ready-made meals}}, in comparison with the equivalent meals prepared at home. Their <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> environmental impacts are also considered. A typical roast dinner is considered, consisting of chicken, vegetables and tomato sauce. Different production and consumption choices are evaluated, including sourcing of ingredients, chilled or frozen supply chains and types of appliance used by the consumer to prepare the meal. The estimated <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs</b> of the ready-made meal range from £ 0. 61 –£ 0. 92 per meal and for the home-made from £ 0. 68 –£ 1. 12. The lowest <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs</b> are found for the chilled ready-made meal heated in a microwave, 11 % below the costs of the best home-made option. The <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>costs</b> of the frozen meal are similar to the best home-made option. The chilled ready-made meal has the highest value added (£ 2. 01) compared to the frozen (£ 1. 22) and the home-made meal (£ 0. 44).
