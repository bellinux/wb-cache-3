5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 2005, MRO was {{launched}} aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket from Space <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Centaur upper {{stage of the}} rocket completed its burns over a fifty-six-minute period and placed MRO into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars.|$|E
5|$|The manned flight hiatus allowed work {{to catch}} up on the Saturn V and Lunar Module, which were encountering their own delays. Apollo 4 flew in November 1967. Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 34, later {{reassembled}} at <b>Launch</b> <b>complex</b> 37B and used to launch Apollo 5, an unmanned Earth orbital test flight of the first Lunar Module LM-1, in January 1968. A second unmanned Saturn V AS-502 flew as Apollo 6 in April 1968, and Grissom's backup crew of Wally Schirra, Don Eisele, and Walter Cunningham, finally flew the orbital test mission as Apollo 7 (AS-205), in a Block II CSM in October 1968.|$|E

5|$|The Voyager 1 probe was {{launched}} on September 5, 1977, from <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle. The Voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, Voyager 1 reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.|$|E
5|$|The launch {{facilities}} at Woomera were demolished {{within a year}} of the final flight, and half of the engineers who had worked on the programme were laid off. The X-4 satellite, which had been manifested for launch by Black Arrow R4, was eventually launched on 9 March 1974, by an American Scout D-1 rocket flying from Space <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 5 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{thirteen}} other pilots, Chaffee {{was selected}} {{to be an astronaut}} as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in 1963.

5|$|The Gemini spacecraft, {{which was}} built by McDonnell Aircraft, {{was derived from the}} earlier Mercury spacecraft, but {{modified}} to accommodate two astronauts. It was also equipped with a larger equipment module, allowing it to support longer missions, and maneuver in orbit. It was launched by the Titan II rocket flying from <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 19 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. In total, twelve missions were launched, ten of which were manned. Following two unmanned test flights, the first manned flight, Gemini 3, was launched on 23 March 1965. The program concluded on 15 November 1966, with the successful recovery of Gemini 12.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E

5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5|$|The LOC {{included}} <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 39, a Launch Control Center, and a 130 {{million cubic}} foot (3.7 million cubic meter) Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) {{in which the}} space vehicle (launch vehicle and spacecraft) would be assembled on a Mobile Launcher Platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads. Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated A and B, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building (OCB) to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles. The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to , which is nearly a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|When {{tropical}} cyclones {{move over}} land, they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability {{required for the}} development of weak, embedded supercell thunderstorms, which can produce tornadoes. These tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived, but still capable of producing significant damage. While centered over the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern side of Hurricane Elena's circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central Florida. A tornado struck just east of Leesburg on September 1, destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes, and damaging another 118; seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Later that same day, another tornado touched down over downtown Leesburg, with much less damage. In nearby Marion County, tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes, compromised another 50 residences, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in total losses, though only minor injuries were reported. At Kennedy Space Center <b>Launch</b> <b>Complex</b> 39 in Cape Canaveral, a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where Space Shuttle Atlantis was being prepared for its first flight. A tornado in New Port Richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees, and tornadic activity was also identified in Sumter County.|$|E

40|$|Launches of Delta, Atlas, and Titan rockets from Cape Canaveral Air Station (CCAS) have {{potential}} environmental effects. These could occur from direct impacts of launches or indirectly from habitat alterations. This report summarizes a three-year study (1 995 - 1 998) characterizing the environment, with {{particular attention to}} threatened and endangered species, near Delta, Atlas, and Titan launch facilities. Cape Canaveral has been modified by Air Force development and by 50 years of fire suppression. The dominant vegetation type around the Delta and Atlas <b>launch</b> <b>complexes</b> is coastal oak hammock forest. Oak scrub is the predominant upland vegetation type near the Titan <b>launch</b> <b>complexes.</b> Compositionally, these are coastal scrub communities that has been unburned for > 40 years and have developed into closed canopy, low-stature forests. Herbaceous vegetation around active and inactive facilities, coastal strand and dune vegetation near the Atlantic Ocean, and exotic vegetation in disturbed areas are common. Marsh and estuarine vegetation is most common west of the Titan <b>complexes.</b> <b>Launch</b> effects to vegetation include scorch, acid, and particulate deposition. Discernable, cumulative effects are limited to small areas near the <b>launch</b> <b>complexes.</b> Water quality samples were collected at the Titan, Atlas, and Delta <b>launch</b> <b>complexes</b> in September 1995 (wet season) and January 1996 (dry season). Samples were analyzed for heavy metals, chloride, total organic carbon, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, total alkalinity, pH, and conductivity. Differences between fresh, brackish, and saline surface waters were evident. The natural buffering capacity of the environment surrounding the CCAS <b>launch</b> <b>complexes</b> is adequate for neutralizing acid deposition in rainfall and launch deposition. Populations of the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a Federally-listed, threatened species, reside near the <b>launch</b> <b>complexes.</b> Thirty-seven to forty-one scrub-jay territories were located at Titan, Atlas, and Delta <b>launch</b> <b>complexes</b> between 1995 and 1997. No direct impacts to scrub-jays were observed {{as a result of}} normal launches. The explosion of the Delta rocket in January 1997 caused direct impacts to the habitat of several scrub-jays families, from fire and debris; however, no scrub-jay mortality was observed. Mortality exceeded reproductive output at all areas {{over the course of the}} study. Populations of the southeastern beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris) populations, a Federally listed, threatened species, reside near all the <b>launch</b> <b>complexes.</b> Hurricane Erin and several other tropical storms impacted several areas at the inception of the study in 1995 causing coastal habitat alterations as a result of salt-water intrusion. Both the habitat and the beach mice populations recovered during the course of the study. No direct impacts to southeastern beach mice were observed as a result of normal launch operations. Direct impacts were observed to the habitat as a result of the explosion of the Delta rocket in January 1997. This alteration of the habitat resulted in a shift in use with the mice moving on to the newly burned part of the site. Waterbirds use wetlands and aquatic systems near the <b>launch</b> <b>complexes.</b> Species include the Federally-listed, endangered Wood Stork (Mycferia americana) and several state-listed species of special concern including the Snowy Egret (Egretfa thula fhula), Reddish Egret (Egreffa rufescens rufescens), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), Roseate Spoonbill (Ajaia ajaja), Tricolored Heron (Egreffa tricolor ruficolis), and Little Blue Heron (Egreffa caerulea). No impacts to these populations resulting from any launch operations were observed. Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) also occur around the <b>launch</b> <b>complexes.</b> Most of those observed appeared to be in good condition; however, upper respiratory tract disease is known to occur in the population. Cape Canaveral Air Station, including areas near active launch colexes, remains important habitat for a variety of native plants and animals including threatened and endangered species. Direct negative effects of current launch systems appear limited. Additional monitoring of these populations and habitats is required to determine if subtle, long-term changes are occurring, to determine if new launch systems and facilities cause other effects, and to determine the effects of habitat restoration and management...|$|R
