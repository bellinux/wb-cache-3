50|$|In 1965 Tideland {{introduced}} the world first transistorized automatic <b>lamp</b> <b>changer.</b> In 1967 Tideland introduced a 300 mm acrylic Fresnel lens lantern, the ML-300, {{which is still}} widely used.|$|E
5000|$|The Tideland ML-300 (ML for MaxLumina) is a {{multi-purpose}} marine lantern, with a {{focal length}} of 300 mm. It {{consists of a}} single piece injection molding acrylic 300mm Fresnel lens and a base assembly, where a flasher or <b>lamp</b> <b>changer</b> can be installed. The light produced is a 360Â° omnidirectional beam and colored signatures are achieved by colored inserts. It has a range of more than [...]|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lamp</b> <b>changers</b> {{in current}} use may have two, four, or six lamps and use either a {{spring-loaded}} mechanism or {{an electric motor}} to change lamps when required. They are used in aerodrome beacons and marine navigational aids.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} electrification, and {{automatic}} <b>lamp</b> <b>changers</b> {{began to make}} lighthouse keepers obsolete. For many years, lighthouses still had keepers, partly because lighthouse keepers {{could serve as a}} rescue service if necessary. Improvements in maritime navigation and safety such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) have led to the phasing out of non-automated lighthouses across the world. In Canada, this trend has been stopped and there are still 50 staffed light stations, with 27 on the west coast alone.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} <b>lamp</b> <b>changer</b> (or lampchanger) is {{a device}} used {{to ensure that}} a navigational light such as a marine lighthouse or aero beacon stays lit even if a bulb burns out. Numerous types exist. The common design elements are an array of two or more lamps (or bulbs), installed on a mounting which can rotate to various positions. Each position brings a different lamp into the focal point of an optical assembly. Since signal and navigational lights use sophisticated optics to focus the beam, lampchangers are designed to position the new bulb at the focal point with high precision. The device automatically detects when the currently active lamp has ceased to function and moves the next lamp into place.|$|E
