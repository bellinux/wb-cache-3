5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, {{started to feel}} his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble he {{could not afford to}} take on his own and began to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
25|$|Some salticid {{species are}} {{continually}} on the move, stopping periodically to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> prey, which they then stalk immediately. Others {{spend more time}} scanning their surroundings from one position, actively stalking any prey they detect. Members of the genus Phaeacius take that strategy to extremes; they sit on a tree trunk, facing downwards and rarely do any stalking, but simply lunge down on any prey items that pass close before them.|$|E
500|$|Animals {{that live}} in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give {{different}} calls depending {{on the nature of}} the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a [...] "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for a new}} opera, Bellini began to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a suitable subject and, {{in a letter to}} Florimo of 11 March 1834, he alludes to the opera which was to become I puritani, noting: [...] "I am about to lose my mind over the plot of the opera for Paris, as it has been impossible to find a suitable subject for my purpose and adaptable to the company".|$|E
2500|$|For a plot {{point in}} Dimitri and Erica's relationship, All My Children went on {{location}} in Budapest, Hungary. [...] The show advertised the story in a campaign called [...] "Destiny on the Danube". This campaign involved full page ads in magazines. Plans for the shoot began in January 1992 and the desired location was Russia. Former executive producer Felicia Minei Behr said, she [...] "sent a crew in to Russia {{to see what kind}} of problems there would be. When it became apparent that it was not going to be able to be done because of a lot of recent problems getting shoots done in Russia, we started to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> different locales. We had this grand story that Megan (McTavish, head writer) and Agnes (Nixon, executive head writer) had written, and we wanted to do it justice." [...] Nixon suggested Budapest as the new location after hearing good things about the city from George Lang, the owner of Café des Artistes, who just opened a restaurant there.|$|E
2500|$|Although Tormented {{received}} {{very little}} critical attention, reviews were positive, with critics finding fault in the album's production but praising its heaviness and aggression. AllMusic gave the album {{a very positive}} review, writing: [...] " [...] shows a band with its alternative metal heart {{in the right place}} [...] Despite some spotty production, this impressive debut unleashes a band whose amps are overloaded, and whose aim is deadly. The original version of [...] "Mudshuvel" [...] (which later appeared on Dysfunction) is one of several highlights." [...] In 1997, Steven Woltasek of CMJ New Music Report wrote: [...] "For those of you that don't know, wake up and <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the debut release from Staind entitled [...] In the book Brave Nu World, author Tommy Udo wrote: [...] "To go back now and listen to Staind's 1996 debut, Tormented, back to back with Break The Cycle is like listening to another band". Scott Hefflon of the Lollipop wrote: [...] "Staind are savvy, street-smart, and dammit, they rock. Their studio debut, tOrmenteD, shows either a natural knack for milking the most out of a crunchy guitar, or they had some good coaching." [...] The Northeast Performer wrote: [...] "Staind's musicianship is striking, and their live performance takes their recorded material one step further: pushing the envelope, ripping up the envelope, then jumping up and down all over the envelope til there ain't a damn thing left".|$|E
