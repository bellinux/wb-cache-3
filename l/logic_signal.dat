40|$|Estimating {{the power}} {{dissipation}} and {{the reliability of}} integrated circuits {{is a major concern}} of the semiconductor industry. Previously [1], we showed that a good measure of power dissipation and reliability is the extent of circuit switching activity, called the transition density. However, the algorithm for computing the density in [1] is very basic and {{does not take into account}} the effect of inertial delays of logic gates. Thus, as we will show in this paper, the transition density may be severely overestimated in high frequency applications. To overcome this problem, we model the effect of gate delay on <b>logic</b> <b>signals</b> in the form of a conceptual low-pass filter module that does not allow unacceptably short logic pulses to propagate.

If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful.

5000|$|Some {{programs}} predating the 80286 {{were designed}} {{to take advantage of}} the wrap-around (modulo) memory addressing behavior, so the 80286 presented a problem for backward compatibility. Forcing the 21st address line (the actual <b>logic</b> <b>signal</b> wire coming out of the chip) to a logic low, representing a zero, results in a modulo-2^20 effect to match the earlier processors' address arithmetic, but the 80286 has no internal capability to perform this function. When IBM used the 80286 in their IBM Personal Computer AT, they solved this problem by including a software-settable gate to enable or disable (force to zero) the A20 address line, between the A20 pin on the 80286 and the system bus; this is known as Gate-A20 (the A20 gate), and it is still implemented in PC chipsets to this day. Most versions of the HIMEM.SYS extended memory driver for IBM-/MS-DOS famously displayed upon loading a message that they had installed an [...] "A20 handler", a piece of software to control Gate-A20 and coordinate it to the needs of programs. In protected mode the A20 line needs to be enabled, or else physical addressing errors will occur, likely leading to a system crash.|$|E

40|$|Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is {{non-invasive}} technique {{that has the}} potential to be used in clinical environments for lung ventilation monitoring, cardiac and brain imaging applications. EIT has many advantages in terms of simplicity, cost and the absence of ionising radiations compared to the traditional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-rays. EIT systems usually consist of a ring of equally spaced electrodes placed around the part of the body of interest. A sinusoidal current source with a typical frequency of 50 kHz is used to inject current between an adjacent pair of electrodes. Then the imposed voltages on the remaining electrodes are measured sequentially. After that the current source is routed to the next pair and the cycle is repeated until one frame of data is collected. For eight electrodes 8 x 5 measurements per frame are collected. Mathematical algorithms are used to construct an image of the impedance distribution inside the closed volume. In order to apply the current source and measure the imposed voltages on the electrodes a switch matrix is needed. In this work, a circuit implementation of the switch matrix for eight electrodes is presented.
