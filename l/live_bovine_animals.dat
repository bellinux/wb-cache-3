40|$|In {{the period}} 2003 - 2014, Romania became an {{important}} source for the export of <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> (<b>bovines</b> and sheep), both for the intra-Community trade and for third countries. Although {{in the same period}} the imports consisted mainly of breeding animals, the balance of trade was constantly positive. The method used in the paper was the comparative analysis of trade-specific set of indicators, the main information sources being international information, reports and studies, FAOSTAT and EUROSTAT statistics. From our analysis, it results that that Romania practiced a conjuncture export, as the herds specialized in meat production, both in the case of bovines and sheep, have a significant share in total livestock herds. The reason why Romania is agreed as supplier of live animals is rather represented by the raising of animals under extensive system, where feeding is mainly based on grazing...|$|R

These mainly include (<b>bovine)</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> and meat products, sugar, and cereal grains. Agro-food trade with EU intensifies in particular for those commodities for which trade restrictions are still substantial prior to accession. However, the magnitude of changes is relatively small due to the weak integration of domestic agro-food sectors into international trade structures. The AGE model also predicts static welfare gains of 0. 65 percent of GDP equivalent variation. These seem to be more associated with better access to EU markets and increased export prices, and less with the preferential unilateral elimination of tariffs or their adjustment to EU’s external levels.

The insect is relatively large for a horse-fly, adults usually being 25-30 mm long. Like most other horseflies, its compound eyes are very colorful with stripe-like patterns. Its body and wings are mostly colored brownish gray. It is quite fast and an able flier, being capable of evading most attempts to swat it with ease. It bites humans infrequently, because of its preference of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> This loud-buzzing horse-fly can be a nuisance, as it circles around its target and occasionally lands to deliver a bite (in the case of humans, the fly usually takes off again instead). However, to humans it is considerably less harmful than deer flies (Chrysops), which bite much more vigorously.|$|R

Similar parameters were also measured in the interfascicular adipose tissue dissected from four muscles. Adipose tissue from animals of the leaner Holstein breed contained smaller cells than the respective tissues from the fatter Hereford X Angus animals. The small subcutaneous deposit in the Holstein animals was due to a small number of adipose cells that were small in size. During growth of the <b>bovine</b> <b>animal,</b> an increase in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. However, by 14 months of life hyperplasia was complete in all but the interfascicular adipose tissue. In the 14 -month-old Hereford X Angus steers, interfascicular adipose tissue had an appreciable number of small cells and a bimodal distribution for cell diameter. The {{results of this study suggest}} that interfascicular adipose tissue is a late developing depot and that hyperplasia is still an active process in this depot at 14 months of life, whereas hyperplasia appears to be nearly complete in the subcutaneous and perirenal depots of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> by about 8 months of life or shortly thereafter. Correlation coefficients indicated that intramuscular lipid content was positively related to the number of interfascicular adipose cells per 100 g of muscle in four different muscles.
