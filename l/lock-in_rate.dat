40|$|The paper {{concerns}} with vendor lock-in in public procurements on {{information and communication}} technologies (ICT), examined it in general and theoreti- cally handle how it could be prevented. The primary aim of the study is to find out if some criterions of public procurements lead to higher <b>lock-in</b> <b>rate</b> or not and if higher vendor <b>lock-in</b> <b>rate</b> leads to the higher profit of the suppliers. The results showed that higher number of bids in the initial procurements leads to lower <b>lock-in</b> <b>rate.</b> On the other hand, the hypotheses about the European Union (EU) funds and the price criterion were not proved. Also, we have not proved the hypothesis that higher <b>lock-in</b> <b>rate</b> leads to the higher profit of the suppliers. Another finding of the paper is that public sector suffers from the oldness of the information systems. Plenty of the information systems is older than 11 years old. That is also the reason that many initial procurements for the information systems are not available in the dataset (it is related to at least 148 information systems). That is the reason for our quite small sample and could be the reason for the results we got. The recommended steps, to lower the level of lock-in, include the creation of the ICT strategy, guidance to contract documentation and a request to suppliers to use open standards [...] ...|$|E
40|$|I study {{repayment}} {{behavior for}} college graduates who borrow under the U. S. Federal Student Loan Program to finance higher education. I develop a dynamic model with uninsurable shocks to earnings and student loan rates {{that explains the}} repayment pattern in U. S. data: college graduates with lower debt will <b>lock-in</b> interest <b>rates,</b> while those with higher debt will switch to an income-contingent plan. Default does not occur among the most financially constrained group of college graduates. I use the model to quantify {{the effects of a}} reform introduced in 2006 that eliminates the possibility to <b>lock-in</b> interest <b>rates</b> for student loans. The reform induces a significant increase in default rates, which is largely accounted for by low-income borrowers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between household mobility and financial frictions, especially {{those associated with}} negative home equity, has attracted greater attention following the recent volatility in the U. S. housing markets. • The decline in mortgage rates, along with policy interventions to encourage historically low-rate refinancing, likewise recommend {{a closer look at}} mortgage interest <b>rate</b> <b>lock-in</b> effects, which are apt to become important once Federal Reserve interest rate policy normalizes. • This article updates estimates in a 2010 study by the authors of the impact of three financial frictions—negative equity, mortgage interest <b>rate</b> <b>lock-in,</b> and property tax lock-in—on household mobility. The addition of 2009 American Housing Survey data to their sample allows the authors to incorporate the effect of more recent house price declines. • The new study’s findings corroborate the 2010 results: Negative home equity reduces household mobility by 30 percent, and $ 1, 000 of additional mortgage or property tax costs lowers it by 10 to 16 percent.

50|$|Forced {{dithering}} can largely {{overcome this}} problem. The ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise about its axis using a mechanical spring driven at its resonance frequency. This {{ensures that the}} angular velocity {{of the system is}} usually far from the <b>lock-in</b> threshold. Typical <b>rates</b> are 400 Hz, with a peak dither velocity of 1 arc-second per second. Dither does not fix the lock-in problem completely, as each time the direction of rotation is reversed, a short time interval exists in which the rotation rate is near zero and lock-in can briefly occur. If a pure frequency oscillation is maintained, these small lock-in intervals can accumulate. This was remedied by introducing noise to the 400 Hz vibration.|$|R
