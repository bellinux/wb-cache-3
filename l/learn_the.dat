In mobile <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> is not depended to any designated time and place. Learning through mobile device requires extensive design and pedagogical considerations. The traditional teaching pedagogy theories are {{not suitable for}} mobile <b>learning</b> since <b>the</b> main assumptions on teaching are in the classroom. There have already been some initiatives for defining distinct pedagogical theories for mobile <b>learning.</b> <b>The</b> main focuses of <b>the</b> mobile <b>learning</b> pedagogical consideration must be directed to content of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> materials and <b>the</b> context where <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> occurs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens core (NAc-co), dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rats on <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> and extinction of Pavlovian and instrumental components of conditioned avoidance responses (CARs). None of the lesions caused sensorimotor deficits that could affect locomotion. Lesions of the NAc-co, but not DMS or DLS, decreased unconditioned and conditioned freezing. The NAc-co and DLS lesioned rats <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> 2 -way active avoidance task more slowly. These results suggest: (i) CARs depend on both Pavlovian and instrumental learning; (ii) <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> Pavlovian component of CARs depends on <b>the</b> NAc-co; <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> instrumental component of CARs depends on the DLS, NAc and DMS; (iii) although the NAc-co is also needed for <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> instrumental component, {{it is not clear whether}} it plays a role in <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> instrumental component per se or if it simply allows <b>learning</b> of <b>the</b> Pavlovian component which is a pre-condition for <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> instrumental component; (iv) we did not find evidence that the DMS and DLS play the same roles in habit and goal-directed aspects of the instrumental component of CARs as observed in appetitive motivated instrumental responding...|$|R
