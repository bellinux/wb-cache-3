50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the texts for grades seven and eight were re-packaged into a Basic Reading and Literature series {{consisting}} of Book 1 (for seventh grade) and Book 2 (for eighth grade) {{without any of}} the contents changing from the original late 1940s versions. As an alternative to this more literary approach for these two grades, entirely new texts were published with shorter, simpler readings with the titles of Parades and More Parades for the seventh grade and Panoramas and More Panoramas for the eighth grade. Focusing on targeted reading and word attack techniques, a soft-cover workbook Basic Reading Skills was published for the junior high (seventh and/or eighth grade) to be used independently much as the Think And Do books were used in conjunction with the graded texts at the elementary school level. In 1960, Wide Wide World was published for the seventh grade and held a wide range of longer <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> from authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Emily Dickinson and Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

5000|$|Zibaldone {{were always}} paper codices of small or medium format - never the large desk copies of {{registry}} books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, zibaldone often incorporate the author's sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first chancery minuscule and later mercantile minuscule) and contained what palaeographer Armando Petrucci describes as [...] "an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts." [...] Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of gabelle taxes paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes and favourite quotations from Augustine and Virgil portrays a developing secular, literate culture. By {{far the most}} popular of <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> were the works of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca and Giovanni Boccaccio: the [...] "Three Crowns" [...] of the Florentine vernacular traditions.

5000|$|Life in the Iron Mills must be {{considered}} a central text in the origins of American realism, American proletarian literature, and American feminism, according to Jean Pfaelzer. The story was revolutionary in its compelling portrait of the working class's powerlessness to break the oppressive chains of industrial capitalism. Author of The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896 (1984) and many articles on Davis, Pfaelzer edits the volume's <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> and supplies the substantial critical introduction, which maintains that Davis inherited the sentimental literary tradition but nonetheless wrote [...] "common stories" [...] that [...] "exposed the tension between sentimentalism, a genre predicated on the repression of the self, and realism, a genre predicated on the search for individual identity." [...] Davis's realistic depiction of the gritty, hellish mills and the impoverished workers' lives is {{far removed from the}} material advantages of the upper classes often portrayed in domestic fiction. She also uses the vernacular and dialect skillfully to depict realistically her uneducated immigrant characters and to emphasize their lower-class status. Davis counteracts positive images of healthy, wholesome mill girls and mills as ideal places of work. Life in the Iron Mills challenges the optimism of transcendentalism by showing how industrialism fueled by greedy capitalists destroys the natural environment and the human spirit.|$|E
5000|$|Bocock and R. L. McWhorter taught, in 1910, a major {{graduate}} {{course in}} Greek {{which consisted of}} <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> and exercises in grammar, written and spoken Greek, history, and poetry. The course description points out a problem with early graduate education at the University of Georgia that was common with many other institutions: “studied from sources {{so far as the}} library resources of the University permit.” Bocock also taught, by himself, “An Introduction to New Testament Greek.” These classes were in addition to undergraduate teaching and his duties as Dean. The New Testament Greek class was not offered after 1913 and after 1923, Bocock taught the major Greek class by himself. Bocock often decried the declining interest by students in Greek, symptomatic of this {{is the fact that the}} 1931-32 Graduate Bulletin notes: “For courses in Greek Literature, consult the professor.”207 After 1931, the Greek Literature class would be transformed into “Introduction of European Literature” which had a prerequisite of three years of college-level Latin. Greek literature was no longer studied in the original language but was now “Greek Literature in Translations.” In a memorial to Bocock in 1948, Robert Preston Brooks wrote:"Mr. Bocock was an altogether charming companion. Few men were so perennially delightful. The depth and variety of his knowledge of literature, ancient and modern, and of world history and contemporary affairs was impressive; and he invariably expressed his views in perfect English. No one was ever bored in his presence." [...] Bocock continued to serve the Graduate School after leaving the deanship. He served as a member of and advisor to the Graduate Council into the 1940s. He retired from the University of Georgia in 1945. Bocock married Bessie Perry Friend of Petersburg, Virginia in 1885. The Bococks had two children: John Holmes Bocock and Natalie Friend Bocock. Bocock died October 31, 1947 in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the content of}} United States and American Literature textbooks adopted in Florida in 1991 and 2003 to determine {{any change in the}} inclusion of multiculturalism, as a response to public policy. Since Florida is a key adoption state, textbooks adopted would probably be reflective of national developments. To determine effects of public policy on <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> appearing in high school United States and American literature textbooks, a variety of strategies was employed. <b>Literary</b> <b>selections</b> for each textbook and each adoption year were categorized by race and/or ethnicity and gender of the author, and genre of selections. In addition, content checklists based on character demographics and scholarship about multicultural literature were applied to all <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> written by non-White authors appearing in both adoption years. Intra-rater reliability of the recorder was found to be. 92. The most frequently anthologized <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> writte n by non-White authors were analyzed for emergent themes. Findings indicate that change in content of high school United States and American literature textbooks with respect to multiculturalism: a greater percentage of non-White authors and female authors appear in the 2003 adoption year. However, when genre of selections is considered, in both adoption years non-White authors and female authors were under-represented in the genres of short stories and plays, which are the longer selections. When non-White authors were added to the canon in 2003 it was most often in the genre of nonfiction where they were over-represented. In addition, with respect to character demographics and multicultural content, selections by non-White authors showed little change from 1991 to 2003. Finally, little change has occurred in themes of most frequently anthologized <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> written by non-White authors from 1991 to 2003. Recommendations include improving content of United States and American literature anthologies to include non-White and female authors in longer selections and a better range of genres. An implication {{of this study is that}} the high school United States and American literature canon remains traditional and largely unaffected by multiculturalism in spite of public policy...|$|E

Selection criteria for the literature include: produce a vicarious experience in the adolescents; change the adolescents ' self-concepts, their future aspirations, or their attitudes; provide a story relevant to the adolescents ' lives; and allow the adolescents to identify with and learn from the heroine. The <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> are read orally by the teacher and students as a group.

40|$|This paper aims {{to survey}} the {{research}} done on which factors affect the literature selection process in the Swedish upper secondary school today. It also aims to understand {{if there is a}} specific literature canon in the Swedish upper secondary school. We ask ourselves three questions; which factors affect the literary selection process in the Swedish education? Does the <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> lead to a so called school canon? And Is there a link between the literary selection and the western literary canon? In the paper we make a distinction between the western literary canon and a school canon as the latter is the theoretical compilation of literature emerged from the choices of teachers and the limitations they are under. The material gathered takes different positions on the field. One dissertation presents a postmodern analysis of the literary selection processes, another one questions the esthetical values in western canon presented by Harold Bloom and one article presents a Foucauldian analysis of <b>literary</b> <b>selections.</b> The research done on the field shows indications of a wide array of factors that may impact the selection process, such as the curriculum, availability, influence by colleagues, the teachers preferences and the pupils, amongst others. In the survey we categorize the factors as inner and outer factors, depending on if they take place outside or within the teacher. We are able to find a total of thirteen factors and therefore conclude that the literary selection in the Swedish upper secondary school is a very complex process. It is essential to understand this as a teacher, as you then can make conscious justified choices. The material shows no indications of a so called school canon, with a few exceptions of some Swedish authors such as August Strindberg. We also {{come to the conclusion that}} more research is needed in this field to reach a more certain answer to what impacts the literature selection process and if there is a literature canon,...|$|E
40|$|Enhancing STEM {{competence}} (e. g., interests, knowledge, skills, and dispositions) among urban, high poverty, {{elementary school}} {{populations in the}} United States (U. S.) is and remains a growing national concern, especially since Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) competence is {{and will continue to}} be a necessary requisite for gainful employment in the future, according to workforce development experts. In an attempt to address this gap, many urban elementary schools have begun to offer STEM-related programs to increase STEM learning at an early age. STEM competence (interest, knowledge, skills, and dispositions), however, remains low. This paper results in a matrix used to analyze children's fictional <b>literary</b> <b>selections</b> and a model that argues that elementary teachers, as the first point of contact with young students, can affect STEM competence. By adopting a more culturally responsive pedagogy that attends to the 21 st Century Learning Skills and the Next Generation Science Standards, teachers can choose literature that serves to excite and reinforce STEM learning...|$|E
