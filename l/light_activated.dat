Rep. 6, 24770; [...] (2016) states that [...] "a novel transparent, immobilised and superhydrophilic coating of titanium dioxide, co-doped with fluorine and copper has been prepared on float glass substrates. Antibacterial activity has demonstrated (by using Staphylococcus aureus), {{resulting from a}} combination of visible <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> (VLA) photocatalysis and copper ion toxicity. Co-doping with copper and fluorine has been shown to improve the performance of the coating, relative to a purely fluorine-doped VLA photocatalyst. Reductions in bacterial population of log10 = 4.2 under visible light irradiation and log10 = 1.8 in darkness have been achieved, compared with log10 = 1.8 under visible light irradiation and no activity, for a purely fluorine-doped titania. Generation of reactive oxygen species from the photocatalytic coatings is the major factor that significantly reduces the bacterial growth on the glass surfaces."

5000|$|Dr. Hugenholtz {{and colleagues}} from the University of Queensland in Australia, have {{completed}} shotgun sequencing of lyophilized cells of V. chlorellavourus strain [...] in culture with Chlorella vulgaris. Subsequently, Soo and Hugenholtz's team performed a genomic reconstruction in 2014 from a culture previously deposited into the NCIB collection in 1978 {{and were able}} to make a general metabolic reconstruction of the genome [...] They found that V. chlorellavorus uses a type IV secretion system (T4SS), similar to that of Agrobacterium tumefaciens for host invasion, which is conserved in all three copies of the V. chlorellavorus genome. To locate its prey, V. chlorellavorus seems to be equipped with possible genes for aerotaxis and <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> kinase (moving towards light), suggesting that it might be motile as was originally thought. To digest its algal prey, V. chlorellavorus has over 100 hydrolytic enzymes including proteases and peptidases. From the results of Soo and her team's genomic analysis, V. chlorellavorus has approximately 26 contigs, 2.91 Mbp, an average GC content of 51.4%, and 2 circular plasmids. In keeping with its description as non-photosynthetic and parasitic microorganism, V. chlorellavorus does not have its own genes for photosynthesis or carbon fixation. V. chlorellavorus is however capable of synthesizing its own nucleotides, certain cofactors and vitamins, and 15 different amino acids. Its bacterial genome also includes coding for a complete glycolysis pathway as well as an electron transport chain.|$|E
5000|$|Today's {{composite}} resins {{have low}} polymerization shrinkage and low coefficients of thermal shrinkage, which {{allows them to}} be placed in bulk while maintaining good adaptation to cavity walls. The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely. The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth. Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470 nm), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see <b>Light</b> <b>activated</b> resin). It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2-3 mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2-3 mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more. (By most North American insurance companies 2 years minimum) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} control posttranslational {{assembly}} of proteins would be a powerful research tool that would allow researchers to selectively control and induce the function of a targeted protein. Several approaches have utilized inteins, protein domains that when inserted into a given protein sequence, excise themselves from the host protein, ligating the host protein fragments together to leave the excised intein and a mature protein. This process, known as protein splicing, would be {{a useful tool for}} studying protein function if it was selectively inducible. Herein we detail our efforts towards the development of a <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> intein that preferentially undergoes protein splicing in the presence of blue light. Our design combines the LOV 2 domain from Avena sativa and the Npu DnaE trans intein from Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 to yield a <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> intein. It was observed by western blot that this <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> intein demonstrated a 1. 74 fold increase in intein mediated protein splicing when exposed to blue light. Mutations to eliminate the protein splicing ability of the <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> intein demonstrated that the extein products observed were the result of intein mediated protein splicing. Mutations to render the LOV 2 domain insensitive to light indicated that the LOV 2 domain influenced the protein splicing ability of the <b>light</b> <b>activated</b> intein, allowing it to progress at a higher rate in the presence of blue light...|$|E
