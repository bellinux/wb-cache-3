5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began to lose its serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

40|$|Globalization causes {{convergence}} of <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> Or {{so it is}} argued. Law and economics scholars predict that <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> will move towards the same efficient end state. They argue that the requirements of globalization will pressure <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> to converge {{on the level of}} economic efficiency, because regulatory competition between <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> makes it impossible for individual legal systems to maintain suboptimal solutions. Many comparative lawyers predict a similar convergence. In particular traditional functionalist comparatists have long held that unification of law was both desirable and unavoidable. Their basic argument is based on functional equivalence and can be summarized as follows: legal systems may look different because they have different doctrines and institutions; these differences, however, are only superficial, because the institutions fulfill the same functions and are therefore actually similar. Realizing that <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> are already similar in substance should make it easy to unify the law formally as well...|$|R

40|$|This article categorizes three {{approaches}} to theorizing transnational <b>legal</b> <b>ordering</b> that respectively address private <b>legal</b> <b>ordering,</b> reconfigure {{the concept of}} law, and {{provide a framework for}} the study of the interaction of norm-making and practice at the transnational, national, and local levels. The first approach develops theory based on the nature of the actors (private actors) and the form of <b>legal</b> <b>ordering</b> (private <b>legal</b> <b>ordering),</b> examining lawmaking, adjudication, and enforcement though non-state institutions. The second approach is conceptual and critical, developing transnational legal theory to critique and reformulate the concept of law to include non-state processes. The third approach provides a framework for orienting socio-legal study of the transnational processes through which legal norms are constructed, flow, and settle across national borders. The processes can be top-down, bottom-up, horizontal, and transversal, involving interaction among different public and private organizations and networks at different levels of social organization, from the transnational to the local, potentially giving rise to distinct transnational <b>legal</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{interaction}} of <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> beyond {{the state has}} precipitated considerable interest among scholars and practitioners.

In recent years, the importance of these transnational questions has grown concurrently with the expansive creation and heightened activity of supranational and global organizations. 2 ̆ 7 Some have {{gone so far as to}} herald a new global law, and others have elaborated upon its contours. 2 Sabino Cassese begins his latest book, When <b>Legal</b> <b>Orders</b> Collide: The Role of Courts, by tackling a fundamental question underlying these active dialogues: Who holds together the <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> of the world?

The principle of direct effect would have had little impact if Union law did not supersede national law. Without supremacy the Member States could simply ignore EU rules.

40|$|While some theorize the {{autonomy}} of transnational <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> from nation-state law, we develop theory regarding the transnational interaction of lawmaking and practice among different levels of social organization that is intricately tied to state law. Our theoretical framework provides a way to assess empirically how legal norms interact at the transnational, national, and local levels {{in terms of their}} construction, conveyance, and practice. For us, the term “transnational” thus does not suggest the disappearance of the state, the withdrawal of the state as a major actor, or processes autonomous of state law, as contended by others. Rather, the term “transnational” has three core attributes. First, it highlights that states (through state officials) are just one among many actors engaged in transnational <b>legal</b> <b>ordering.</b> Second, it points to the ways transnational <b>legal</b> <b>ordering</b> transcends and often transforms states through their participation in transnational legal processes. Third, it underscores that one needs to assess the interaction of state and non-state actors at different levels of social organization, including international organizations and transnational networks, national institutions, and local practice, to understand transnational <b>legal</b> <b>ordering.</b> This interaction determines the extent to which legal norms settle across levels of social organization and give rise to transnational <b>legal</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

25|$|Unger's work on law {{has sought}} to denaturalize the concept of law {{and how it is}} {{represented}} through particular institutions. He begins by inquiring into why modern societies have legal systems with distinctions between institutions, such as legislature and court, as well as a special caste of lawyers possessing a method of reasoning about social problems. Whereas thinkers such as Marx and Weber had argued that such legal arrangements were a product of economic necessity to secure property rights and the autonomy of the individual, Unger shows that this liberal <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> emerged in Europe {{as a result of the}} indeterminate relations between monarchy, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie.

25|$|During the 20th century, {{a belief}} arose that some extra {{protection}} of human rights above and beyond parliamentary scrutiny was necessary. Doubts grew about the capacity of parliamentary controls, partly because of scepticism about Parliament's will to control the growing executive and the control by political parties of their MPs which allowed weak governments to avoid effective challenges. This scepticism went {{hand in hand with}} criticisms of the United Kingdom's political system and whether it is sufficiently representative of the range of opinion in the country. The doubts intensified with the experiences with terrorism in the 1970s and accession to the European Community in 1973 where Britain was exposed to other legal systems which did not share the same concept of parliamentary sovereignty and which gave stronger protection to human rights. In particular, European entry led to the notion that the Parliament of the United Kingdom could be subject to the decisions of a higher <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> {{in the form of the}} European Court of Justice. This was highlighted in the Factortame litigation where the House of Lords was required to 'disapply' provisions of an Act of Parliament which were contrary to European Community law, effectively ruling them invalid. In addition, increasingly influenced by international human rights law, comparative constitutional law and European law, English courts became more sympathetic towards the concept of popular sovereignty and fundamental rights and liberties.|$|E
