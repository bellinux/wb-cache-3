50|$|Situated {{on top of}} {{the rear}} {{differential}} is a high pressure, low volume electric pump. This pump pressurizes Normal ATF (0-288 psi) into the transfer case to engage the clutch pack. This fluid only engages the clutch pack and does not mix with the NS-ATF lubricating the tranfercase. The higher the fluid pressure the transfer case is supplied with from the pump, the more the clutch pack engages, enabling the torque to the front wheels to be varied. Exiting the transfer case, the front drive shaft runs along {{the right side of the}} transmission, into a differential located on the right of the engines sump. This is a cast aluminum unit, with the sump and front differential made as a single unit that cannot be separated. The front right axle is shorter than the left, because the differential is closer to the right wheel. The front <b>left</b> <b>axle</b> runs through the engine's sump to the left wheel.|$|E
50|$|Thus, Vettel {{regained the}} first {{position}} {{as he began}} to slowly pull away from Button who was 1.7 seconds behind Vettel on lap 13 with Kubica a further two seconds adrift in third. Alonso had moved into tenth position by lap 13 and gained a further after he overtook de la Rosa at turn nine on the same lap. Alonso passed Barrichello for eighth on the 14th lap and set a new fastest lap on the following lap, a 1:31.573. Hamilton and Webber passed Alonso for fifth and sixth positions at the start of lap 16. Webber attempted to defend fifth place from Hamilton but went wide into the gravel trap at turn three and fell down to eighth. Massa immediately overtook Hamilton around the outside on the same lap. Hamilton started to battle Massa (who had graining on his right-rear tyre) for fifth position with Webber and Alonso starting to close the gap to the two drivers. Massa slid his car at turn 16 at the end of lap 21 which allowed Hamilton to pass Massa on the inside at Brabham corner although Hamilton sustained minor damage to his front wing. Hamilton defended Massa's attempt to pass him at Whiteford corner, while Alonso slowed which allowed Webber to pass him. Hamilton overtook Rosberg on the outside of turn eleven. Vettel had sparks coming from his left-front wheel and a large amount of vibrations built up in his car. This caused Vettel to lose torque drive between the front <b>left</b> <b>axle</b> and wheel, and spun into the gravel trap at Ascari corner on lap 26. Vettel's retirement promoted Button into the lead. Rosberg attempted to retake fourth from Hamilton at Ascari corner but was unable to {{because of the presence of}} yellow-flags. Webber passed Massa for fifth position at Whiteford corner two laps later. di Grassi drove to his garage to retire with an issue with his car's hydraulics on lap 29.Hamilton closed up on Kubica by the same lap; Hamilton attempted to overtake Kubica while in traffic but Kubica fended off Hamilton's attempt. Hamilton feigned passing manoeuvres at the Brabham and Whiteford corners with the latter attempt resulting in Hamilton losing time to Kubica and fell back in front of Rosberg. Webber made a pit stop for soft compound tyres on lap 33, while Hamilton tried another pass on Kubica on the back straight but Kubica closed the door on Hamilton. Rosberg made his pit stop for tyres one lap later and came out level with Webber as Rosberg exited the pit lane, but Webber's extra momentum allowed him to move ahead of Rosberg. Despite going fastest overall in the first and second sectors of the track after making a pit stop on lap 35, Hamilton went wide at Ascari corner on lap 37 which allowed Webber to briefly move ahead of Hamilton before the McLaren driver regained the position. Hamilton and Webber began to close on Alonso at the rate of two seconds a lap after setting a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:28.591 on lap 40 while Massa started to close the gap to Kubica. di Grassi rejoined the race on lap 39 but returned to the pit lane two laps later. Glock made a pit stop and his mechanics retired him from the race on the 45th lap because a camber shim on his car was loose and it caused the left rear suspension to move around. Hamilton caught Alonso on lap 49 but was unable to pass the Ferrari driver because Hamilton struggled with tyre degradation. Schumacher dived up the inside to attempt an overtake Alguersuari for eleventh place at Ascari corner on lap 56 and the two drivers wheels made contact before Schumacher got ahead at the Stewart corner.|$|E

50|$|The car changed {{very little}} during its {{production}} life. The name change to Mercedes-Benz Typ 400 which followed the Daimler/Benz fusion was not accompanied by any {{changes to the}} car. However, in 1927 the centre of gravity was lowered {{as a result of}} a switch to an “underslung” chassis which <b>left</b> the <b>axles</b> directly above the longitudinal chassis members, whereas earlier car had applied the “Hochbett” overslung chassis layout whereby the longitudinal chassis members were attached directly above the axles.|$|R

5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the <b>left</b> on stub <b>axles</b> attached to the suspension on the right.|$|R
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered wheels {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' stub axle assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects the <b>left</b> and right <b>axle</b> assemblies.|$|R
40|$|Reliable axlebox based {{measurement}} of rail roughness {{has been a}} fervent topic of research recently, due to its potential low-cost convenience and network coverage. Present research results for model-based estimation of rail roughness, based on axle-box accelerometers, are presented. A mechanics based model is developed, {{taking into account the}} dynamic characteristics of the track and bogie for estimation of rail profile, based on multiple accelerometer measurements {{on both sides of the}} track. The model is tested and validated against field measurements of rail profile data. In particular, impact response testing of the vehicle (AK car) is first performed to determine the dynamic characteristics of the axlebox in response to various force inputs. This understanding is used to tune the model that is then applied to field accelerometer measurements from <b>left</b> and right <b>axle</b> boxes to predict the rail profiles. The comparison of these measurements with the field profile measurements is performed to reveal the importance of various aspects of the model. The results highlight the importance of considering vibrational input from both sides of the track as well as the effects of speed and track and vehicle dynamic characteristics. The danger of using simplified double integration models, such as substantial speed dependent errors, is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to use {{temperature}} measurements derived from infrared cameras to identify trucks with potential brake, tire, or hub defects. Data were collected at inspection sites on six different days and vehicles were subjected to CVSA inspections. Based on the inspections, axle ends were classified into three brake problem categories: yes, no, maybe. Subsequently, the data were analyzed in order to find associations between the temperature measurements and the brake problem classifications. Metrics were developed to identify outliers or large variation in temperatures within or between trucks. Many of the measures focus on differences between <b>axles,</b> <b>left</b> side and right side, and single outlying temperatures. The analysis is restricted to trucks with five axles. Various truck and environment variables were recorded. The maximum brake temperature was most closely associated with the brake problem variable. The coefficient of variation and standard deviation identified ten of the fourteen trucks classified with at least one brake problem correctly. In conjunction with other metrics, additional trucks with brake problems were also identified. Associations between trucks with single outlying temperatures on axle ends and brake problem classifications were not strong. However, it is possible that these outliers could be indicative of brake problems not captured by results produced from inspections...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo trata sobre as marcas da experiência escolar no processo de individuação do sujeito e tem como objetivo geral conhecer de que forma essas experiências, a despeito das questões curriculares e pedagógicas, influenciam esse processo. Buscou-se interpretar as experiências reforçadas durante a escolarização e as trajetórias de enfrentamento das diversas situações vividas na escola. Tentou-se, também, compreender o sentido dos acontecimentos escolares críticos e igualmente como o meio {{familiar}} pode influenciar nas escolhas e formação dos sujeitos através do investimento pedagógico. Ademais, refletiu-se sobre os motivos que levaram alguns a permanecerem no ambiente escolar seja como estudante ou, mais tarde, do lado de lá, como professor. Para tanto, foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa de inspiração enomenológica utilizando-se de entrevistas narrativas com quatro sujeitos, a partir das quais se identificou as principais características, estrutura, condições de origem, o contexto social, as estratégias escolares, as formas como foram manejadas e suas conseqüências. A análise dos relatos deixou claro dois eixos fundamentais da experiência escolar que se destacam na constituição dos sujeitos: de um lado a dinâmica do ambiente escolar vivido deixou marcas indeléveis na memória que foram determinantes para as escolhas pessoais; por outro lado, a referência familiar, através das suas várias formas de investimento pedagógico, teve uma influência decisiva. As marcas combinadas da escola e da família deixaram um legado importante para formação dos sujeitos e para as escolhas que fizeram durante as suas vidas, especialmente no direcionamento da suas carreiras profissionais. Invariavelmente, percebeu-se na investigação, que muito do aluno que se foi persiste no adulto e profissional de hoje. Assim, o Eu escolar é parte do Eu profissional que existe em cada um. O cidadão, a pessoa e o profissional são derivados dos processos de socialização e individuação, os quais em grande parte se definem durante a vida escolar. E é com o uso desse capital escolar, adquirido nos tempos de escola, que temos condições de desenvolver os muitos papéis sociais nos dias atuaisThis {{study it}} treats on {{the marks of}} the school experience in the individuation process of the subject and has as general aim to know of that it forms these experiences, the spite of the curricular and pedagogical questions, influences this process. It searched to interpret the experiences strengthened during the school education and the trajectories of confrontation of the diverse situations lived in the school. It was tried,also,to understand {{the direction of the}} critical school events and equally as the familiar way can influence in the choices and formation of the citizens through the pedagogical investment. Furthermore, it was reflected on the reasons that had taken some to remain in the school environment are as student or, later, of the side of there,as teacher. For in such a way, it realized a qualitative research with a phenomenological inspiration using narratives interviews carried with four subjects, from which if it identified the main characteristics, structure, conditions of origin, the social context, the school strategies, the forms as they had been managed and its consequences. The analysis of the stories clearly <b>left</b> two basic <b>axles</b> about the school experience that if detach in the constitution of the subjects: in a hand, the dynamics of the lived school environment left undeleted marks in the memory that had been determinative for the personal choices; on the other hand,the familiar reference, through its different forms of pedagogical investment,had a decisive influence. The agreed marks of the school and the family had left an important legacy for formation of the subjects and the choices that had made during their lives, especially in the aiming of its professional careers. Invariably, it was perceived in the inquiry, that much of the pupil who if was persists in the adult and professional of today. Thus, the school I it s part of professional I that it exists in each one. The citizen, the person and the professional are derived from the processes of socialization and individuation, which to a large extent are defined during the school life. And it s with the use of this school capital, acquired in the school times, that we have conditions to develop the many social roles in the current day...|$|R
