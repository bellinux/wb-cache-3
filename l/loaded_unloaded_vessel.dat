5000|$|Ship-to-shore {{gantry cranes}} {{are often used}} in pairs or teams of cranes in order to {{minimize}} the time required to <b>load</b> and <b>unload</b> <b>vessels.</b> As container ship sizes and widths have increased throughout the 20th Century, ship-to-shore gantry cranes and the implementation of ship-to-shore gantry cranes has become more unique in order to effectively <b>load</b> and <b>unload</b> <b>vessels</b> while maximizing profitability and minimizing time in port. One example are systems where specialized berths built that accommodate one vessel at a time with ship-to-shore gantry cranes {{on both sides of the}} vessel. This allows for more cranes and double the workspace under the cranes to be used for transporting cargo off dock.|$|R

5000|$|A harbor or harbour (see {{spelling}} differences), or haven, {{is a body}} {{of water}} where ships, boats and barges seek shelter from stormy weather, or are stored for future use. The term [...] "harbor", referring primarily to a sheltered body of water, is often used interchangeably with [...] "port", which is a man-made facility built for <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> <b>vessels</b> and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports usually include one or more harbors. Alexandria Port {{is an example of a}} port with two harbors.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} allocating berth positions for vessels in tidal bulk port terminals. A berth {{is defined as a}} specific location alongside a quay where a ship loader is available for <b>loading</b> or <b>unloading</b> <b>vessels,</b> accommodating only one vessel at a time. In tidal ports, draft conditions depend on high tide conditions, since available depth at low tide is not adequate for the movement of ships. Some port terminals are associated with important transnational enterprises which maintain strong control over the stock level of their goods. Since the stock level sometimes depends on a continuous process of consumption or production of minerals, the decision to <b>load</b> or <b>unload</b> <b>vessels</b> must {{consider the}} amount of the bulk cargo stored in the port yards. Therefore, a basic criterion for decision making is to give priority to the vessels related to the most critical mineral stock level. A second basic criterion is to decide what sequence of vessels reduces the overall demurrage within a given planning horizon. This paper presents an integer linear programming model based on the transportation problem to represent the Berth Allocation Problem in Tidal Bulk ports with Stock level conditions (BAPTBS). Problem instances are solved by a commercial solver and by a Simulated Annealing-based algorithm (SA). The SA employs a problem-specific heuristic, becoming a valid alternative for finding out good solutions for difficult instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Pages: 606 - 61...|$|R

5000|$|The Archer {{brothers}} made {{a private}} {{expedition to the}} Rockhampton district in 1853, and were the first Europeans to record and chart the Fitzroy River. They built a small wharf {{to allow for the}} transport of wool bales from their property, Gracemere station. West of the place chosen as the wharf a large bar of rocks prevented further movement upstream for sailing vessels, thereby dictating the siting of the eventual Port of Rockhampton.

60|$|It {{was curious}} {{to observe the}} process of <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> these <b>vessels,</b> {{opposite}} to the houses where the merchants who owned them lived.

50|$|As {{container}} ships {{usually have}} no on-board cranes or other mechanism to <b>load</b> or <b>unload</b> their cargo, they are therefore dependent on dockside container cranes to <b>load</b> and <b>unload.</b> However lift-on/lift-off <b>vessels</b> can <b>load</b> and <b>unload</b> their own cargo unassisted.

5000|$|An Ordnance Yard (Gun Wharf) {{began to}} be {{established}} on the present site in the late 17th century (replacing an earlier Wharf on the Point). Built to serve the ordnance needs of the Fleet, the Dockyard and the town fortifications, it was constructed on reclaimed marshland between Old Portsmouth and Portsea, {{just north of the}} body of water known as the Mill Pond (a vestige of which survives today as the Canal within Gunwharf Quays). In the 1770s a decision was taken to extend the Yard to the south, so further land was reclaimed, extending the Yard and doubling its size. The original Yard and its extension (known respectively as [...] "Old Gun Wharf" [...] and [...] "New Gun Wharf") functioned as two halves of a single operation. They were linked, by way of a swing bridge, across a short Canal, which guaranteed a flow of water {{in and out of the}} Mill Pond; it later formed the entrance to a triangular Basin where <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> of <b>vessels</b> could take place.|$|R
5000|$|In the Middle Ages Covehithe prospered as a {{small town}} and {{during the reign of}} Edward I was granted a fair on the feast day of St Andrew. It takes its modern name from the de Cove family who held land there at that time, {{and the fact that it}} had a hithe, or quay, for <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> small <b>vessels.</b> By the 17th century however it had fallen victim, like nearby Dunwich, to coastal erosion. The large church of St Andrew, which had been built on the back of its wealth, was largely pulled down, {{although}} its tall tower remains, and a smaller church was erected amongst the ruins in 1672. There is archaeological evidence of the linen industry having been carried out at Covehithe until the 18th century.In 1910 Peter Ditchfield wrote: At Covehithe, on the Suffolk coast, there has been the greatest loss of land. In 1887 sixty feet was claimed by the sea, and in ten years (1878-87) the loss was at the rate of over eighteen feet a year. In 1895 another heavy loss occurred between Southwold and Covehithe and a new cove formed. Peter Ditchfield ...|$|R

40|$|The Flanders Institute for Logistics (VIL) is {{continuously}} {{searching for}} opportunities to bring together the various logistics actors. The main role of the VIL is often the one of match-maker. A match should be made between transport demand and supply, between users and providers of transport. Knowledge and experience about the different transport modes has to be distributed towards potential users. Transport providers, on their side, should be given insight in the shippers’ requirements. Through best practices and a manual elaborated {{in the field of}} multimodal transport one supports this matching goal. A match should also be looked for between on one hand the ports with their maritime activities (i. e. <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> sea <b>vessels)</b> and connections with the ports. Several improvements can be worked on. Often {{one of the most critical}} success factors seems to be the ability to bring together the right players. The VIL, as a neutral party, has often a facilitating or coordinating role in collaboration projects. Finally one should match the academicians with the practitioners.

40|$|The {{two main}} {{features}} of plant hyper-accumulator species are the massive translocation of heavy metal ions to the aerial parts and their tolerance to such high metal concentrations. Recently, several lines of evidence have indicated {{a role for}} nicotianamine (NA) in metal homeostasis, through the chelation and transport of NA-metal complexes. The function of transport of NA-metal chelates, required for the <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> of <b>vessels,</b> has been assigned to the Yellow Stripe 1 (YSL) -Like family of proteins. We have characterized three YSL genes in Thlaspi caerulescens {{in the context of}} hyper-accumulation. The three YSL genes are expressed at high rates compared with their Arabidopsis thaliana homologs but with distinct patterns. While TcYSL 7 was highly expressed in the flowers, TcYSL 5 was more highly expressed in the shoots, and the expression of TcYSL 3 was equivalent in all the organs tested. In situ hybridizations have shown that TcYSL 7 and TcYSL 5 are expressed around the vasculature of the shoots and in the central cylinder in the roots. The exposure to heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Ni) does not affect the high and constitutive expression of the TcYSL genes. Finally, we have demonstrated by mutant yeast complementation and uptake measurements that TcYSL 3 is an Fe/Ni-NA influx transporter. This work provides therefore molecular, histological and biochemical evidence supporting a role for YSL transporters in the overall scheme of NA and NA-metal, particularly NA-Ni, circulation in a metal hyper-accumulator plant...|$|R
