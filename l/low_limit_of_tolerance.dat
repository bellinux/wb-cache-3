40|$|International audienceAbstractSoil loss {{tolerance}} (T) is {{a widely}} used concept for assessing potential risks of soil erosion and is a criterion for assessing the effectiveness of {{soil and water conservation}} projects. However, current approaches for calculating T values lack a strong scientific basis, and few practicable methods are available. Many questions remain regarding which parameters, such as planning periods and offset damages, should be included in calculating T values. Here, we developed a new method to calculate soil loss tolerance {{as a function of the}} soil productivity index (SPI) for farmland. To achieve sustainable soil productivity in farmland, erosion rates leading to SPI values lower than the lower boundary of soil productivity (SPI 0) are not tolerable and must be controlled by soil conservation measures. We applied this method in the Red River Basin of China based on the investigation of typical soil profiles and crop yields. Our results show that the T values in the Red River Basin ranged from 0. 91 to 10. 24  t ha− 1  a− 1. The SPI 0 and the <b>lowest</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> soil loss <b>tolerance</b> (T 1) were 0. 4 and 0. 91  t ha− 1  a− 1, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that, when determining T values in farmland, (1) the soil formation rate and offset damage should not be core items, (2) the “planning period” concept should be replaced by “sustainability”, (3) the management objective of T should be the sustainability of the soil resource, and (4) the T values of farmland should be determined according to soil productivity. We provide a reasonable and feasible method to determine T for farmland, which will help maintain the sustainability of soil productivity...|$|R

40|$|Livestock is {{the most}} {{important}} source of income for pastoral livelihoods in drylands. Pastoralists have developed flexible resource utilization strategies that enable them to cope with the high spatio-temporal resource variability typical to these areas. However, climate change in the form of decreasing mean annual precipitation accompanied by increasing variability has important consequences for rangeland productivity and thus pastoral livelihood security. Here, we use a spatial simulation model to assess impacts of changing precipitation regimes, and to identify <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> for these changes beyond which pastoral livelihoods cannot be secured. We also examine strategies to control these limits. Our results indicate that: (i) While reduced mean annual precipitation always had negative effects, increased precipitation variability can have negative, none or even positive effects, depending on the vegetation’s recovery potential. (ii) Depending on income requirements there are <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to decreases in mean annual precipitation beyond which precipitation regimes overcharge the coping capac-ity of the pastoral household and threaten its livelihood. (iii) There are certain strategies, in particular “Increasing mobility ” and “Diversifying income for coping with income risks from pastoralism”, that al-low the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to be shifted to a certain extent.

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SAPS is also the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure). Therefore, we can say that the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SAPS is not the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SuperDARN observation.|$|R
40|$|The {{commonly}} accepted hypothesis {{explaining the}} mechanism of action of pyrazinamide (PZA) {{is based on the}} assumption that PZA-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains produce pyrazinamidase, which hydrolyzes PZA to the antibacterial moiety pyrazinoic acid (POA). It is not clear whether POA has specific antimicrobial activity or the inhibition of growth caused by POA is due to its ability to lower the pH of the environment below the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis growth. We confirmed in this study that POA, depending on the concentration, lowered the pH of 7 H 12 broth (pH 6. 0), which ranged from 5. 8 at 120. 0 micrograms/ml to 4. 6 at 960. 0 micrograms/ml. Therefore, we tested the inhibitory effects of different concentrations of POA in broth in which the final pH was adjusted to 5. 6 by adding appropriate amounts of phosphoric acid or dipotassium phosphate. Under these conditions, we found a clear dose-response correlation, proving that POA does have specific antimicrobial activity. The MIC of POA at pH 5. 6 was 240 to 480 micrograms/ml, 8 - to 16 -fold higher than the MIC of PZA under the same conditions and much higher than the concentrations achievable in humans. This suggests that the action of POA in an acid environment is a combined effect of its specific activity and its ability to lower the pH below the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the target organism...|$|R

The asexual process {{is where a}} new polyp develops from {{a portion of the}} original polyp after pulling away (anemone splits in half). In many localities, {{there is little or no}} genetic variability between individual polyps as they are all clones of each other. This leads to a situation where apparently thriving populations can suddenly vanish from a locality. This happens because there is a lack of genetic variability among the population, and as the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> some parameter is approached, there is a sudden incidence of mortality among the whole population.|$|R

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the {{addition of}} TIO to FOR may improve respiratory muscle performance and oxygen uptake kinetics after exercise in patients with COPD. MethodsThirty eight patients with COPD were randomized to a 2 week treatment with FOR 12  μg twice a day plus TIO 18  μg once a day (FOR + TIO) or FOR 12  μg twice a day plus placebo (FOR + PLA) once a day, using a double-blind crossover design. Inspiratory muscle. Strength was measured before, immediately after, as well as 2, 5, and 10  min during recovery of exercise. Time to <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> on a constant work load exercise test and oxygen uptake kinetics during recovery were evaluated before and after intervention. ResultsOnly FOR + TIO improved resting (63  ±  10  cm to 84  ±  11 cmH 2 O) and post-exercise (49  ±  7  cm to 84  ±  11 cmH 2 O) maximal inspiratory pressure. Time to <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> on the constant work load test was increased by FOR + PLA and by FOR + TIO, but the size of the increment was significantly larger with FOR + TIO (40. 7  ±  7. 6 % vs. 84. 5  ±  8. 2 %; p <  0. 05). Only FOR + TIO improved oxygen uptake kinetics during recovery (69  ±  21 to 60  ±  18  s). The improvement in maximal inspiratory pressure (0. 78, p <  0. 001) and in oxygen uptake kinetics (− 0. 91, p <  0. 001) correlated with the change in time to the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> ConclusionsThe addition <b>of</b> TIO to FOR improves inspiratory muscle strength and oxygen uptake kinetics after exercise in COPD patients...|$|R
