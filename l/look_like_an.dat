5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|Located on Southwest Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in {{downtown}} Hillsboro, {{the station is}} decorated with dark red bricks. Overhead is a steep-pitched roof, with the station's floor in the vestibule built of concrete planks in homage to the cedar-planked roads that formerly existed in the town. Designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc., the station is {{the largest of the}} MAX stations on the westside line as it extends most of the length of the block between Third and Fourth avenues. Hillsboro Central sits on the same site of the old Oregon Electric Railway station for the Hillsboro area and has a station building that is designed to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old railroad station with features similar to those at a Grand Central Station type of facility.|$|E

5|$|Nani is a {{young man}} who specialises in {{preparing}} fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was not}} {{immediately}} obvious to the men on Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's Powerful, which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected {{to remain in the}} Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> East Indiaman. Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, Powerful was further out to sea and appeared becalmed. Realising that his only option was to sail between Powerful and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, but the wind gradually strengthened for Powerful and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E
