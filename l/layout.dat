5|$|Smallpeice, {{once the}} new Cunard board had been constituted, turned his {{attention}} to the new cruise ship being built for the company. The ship, codenamed Q4, had been proposed and planned under the auspices of his predecessor, John Brocklebank. However, with the ship now approaching completion and requiring fitting out, it would fall to Smallpeice and his board to appoint interior and exterior designers and approve design schemes for the new ship. Smallpeice, having assessed a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, decided on significant alterations to the interior <b>layout,</b> abolishing the old three class <b>layout</b> and replacing it with a flexible <b>layout</b> which could be split into two classes for North Atlantic crossings and combined into a single class <b>layout</b> for cruising in the Caribbean. This new <b>layout</b> was expected to suit the tastes of American passengers, predicted to be the largest passenger group on the new liner.|$|E

40|$|Hierarchical graphs {{are widely}} used as models of the {{structure}} of software systems. A central problem in the visualization of hierarchical graphs is the computation of <b>layouts,</b> i. e. of positions of the nodes in two- or three-dimensional space. We derive requirements for graph <b>layouts</b> from various software analysis questions, and classify the required <b>layouts</b> along three dimensions: <b>layouts</b> with meaningful distances between single nodes vs. <b>layouts</b> with meaningful distances between groups of nodes, <b>layouts</b> reflecting adjacency vs. <b>layouts</b> reflecting hierarchy, and <b>layouts</b> that faithfully reflect the size of subgraphs vs. <b>layouts</b> where certain subgraphs are magnified. We present a fairly simple and theoretically validated energy model for computing such <b>layouts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Parity-declustered data <b>layouts</b> were {{developed}} to reduce the time for on-line failure recovery in disk arrays. They generally require perfect balancing of reconstruction workload among the disks; this restrictive balance condition makes such data <b>layouts</b> difficult to construct. In this paper, we consider approximately balanced data <b>layouts,</b> where some variation in the reconstruction workload over the disks is permitted. Such <b>layouts</b> are considerably easier to construct than perfectly balanced <b>layouts.</b> We consider three methods for constructing approximately balanced data <b>layouts,</b> and analyze their performance both theoretically and experimentally. We conclude that on uniform workloads, approximately balanced <b>layouts</b> have performance nearly identical to that of perfectly balanced <b>layouts.</b> A preliminary {{version of this paper}} appears in the Proceedings of the Fourth Annual Workshop on I/O in Parallel and Distributed Systems, pp. 41 [...] 54, May 1996. y schwabe@eecs. nwu. edu.

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the <b>layout</b> of the orchestra. His preferred <b>layout</b> was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a <b>layout</b> that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} <b>layout</b> of the Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road <b>layout</b> followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for {{out of work}} miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E

40|$|The graph <b>layouts</b> {{used for}} complex network {{studies have been}} mainly been {{developed}} to improve visualization. If we interpret the <b>layouts</b> in metric spaces such as Euclidean ones, however, the embedded spatial information can be a valuable cue for various purposes. In this work, {{we focus on the}} navigational properties of spatial graphs. We use an recently user-centric navigation protocol to explore spatial <b>layouts</b> of complex networks that are optimal for navigation. These <b>layouts</b> are generated with a simple simulated annealing optimization technique. We compared these <b>layouts</b> to others targeted at better visualization. We discuss the spatial statistical properties of the optimized <b>layouts</b> for better navigability and its implication...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, parity-declustered <b>layouts</b> {{have been}} studied {{as a tool for}} {{reducing}} the time needed to reconstruct a failed disk in a disk array. Construction of such <b>layouts</b> for large disk arrays generally involves the use of a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), a type of subset system over the set of disks. This research has been somewhat hampered by the dearth of effective, easily implemented constructions of BIBDs on large sets and by inefficiencies in some parity-distribution methods that create <b>layouts</b> that are larger than necessary. We make progress on these problems in several ways. In particular, we•demonstrate new BIBD constructions that generalize some previous constructions and yield simpler BIBDs that are optimally small in some cases,•show how relaxing some of the balance constraints on data <b>layouts</b> leads to constructions of approximately-balanced <b>layouts</b> that greatly increase the number of feasible <b>layouts</b> for large arrays, and•give a new method for distributing parity that produces smaller data <b>layouts,</b> resulting in tight bounds on the size of data <b>layouts</b> derived from BIBDs. Our results use a variety of algebraic, combinatorial, and graph-theoretic techniques, and together greatly increase the number of parity-declustered data <b>layouts</b> that are appropriate for use in large disk arrays...|$|R
