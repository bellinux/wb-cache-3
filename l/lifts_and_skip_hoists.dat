50|$|In 1904, Heyl & Patterson {{pioneered the}} first cranes to lift entire {{railroad}} cars, {{as well as}} towers to unload barges filled with ore, coal, sand, and slag. 1905 saw the introduction of coal crushers, coke preparation plants, coal handling bridges and mine car dumpers. 1908 saw the first <b>skip</b> <b>hoists</b> <b>and</b> ore bridges to transfer material at steel mills.|$|R
50|$|The second {{compartment}} is {{used for}} one or more <b>skips,</b> used to <b>hoist</b> ore to the surface. Smaller mining operations use a skip mounted underneath the cage, rather than a separate device, while some large mines have separate shafts for the cage <b>and</b> <b>skips.</b> The third compartment {{is used for}} an emergency exit; it may house an auxiliary cage or a system of ladders. An additional compartment houses mine services such as high voltage cables and pipes for transfer of water, compressed air or diesel fuel.|$|R

For instance, if a single 4 is played and the next player has the other three 4s in the deck, he/she may play two of them <b>and</b> <b>skip</b> the next two people, or play all three <b>and</b> <b>skip</b> the next three people. If two 4s are played and the next player has a 4 and two wild cards, he/she may play all three cards <b>and</b> <b>skip</b> the next two people (two cards required to play <b>and</b> <b>skip,</b> plus one extra).|$|R
