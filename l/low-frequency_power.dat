In general, good {{mental and physical health}} are correlated with positive emotions and high heart rate variability (HRV) modulated by mostly high frequencies. High HRV has been correlated with increased executive functioning skills such as memory and reaction time. [...] Biofeedback that increased HRV and shifted power toward HF (high-frequencies) has been shown to lower blood pressure On the other hand, LF (<b>low-frequency)</b> <b>power</b> in the heart is associated with sympathetic vagal activity, which is known to increase the risk of heart attack.LF-dominated HRV power spectra are also directly associated with higher mortality rates in healthy individuals, and among individuals with mood disorders.Anger and frustration increase the LF range of HRV. Other studies have shown anger to increase the risk of heart attack, so researchers at the Heartmath Institute have made the connection between emotions and physical health via HRV.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the shield}} effect in coax results from {{opposing}} currents {{in the center}} conductor and shield creating opposite magnetic fields that cancel, and thus do not radiate. The same effect helps ladder line. However, ladder line is extremely sensitive to surrounding metal objects, which can enter the fields before they completely cancel. Coax does not have this problem, since the field is enclosed in the shield. However, {{it is still possible}} for a field to form between the shield and other connected objects, such as the antenna the coax feeds. The current formed by the field between the antenna and the coax shield would flow {{in the same direction as}} the current in the center conductor, and thus not be canceled. Energy would radiate from the coax itself, affecting the radiation pattern of the antenna. With sufficient power this could be a hazard to people near the cable. A properly placed and properly sized balun can prevent common mode radiation in coax. An isolating transformer or blocking capacitor can be used to couple a coaxial cable to equipment, where it is desirable to pass radio-frequency signals but to block direct current or <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

40|$|Vigilance state-related {{topographic}} {{variations of}} electroencephalographic (EEG) activity {{have been reported}} in humans and animals. To investigate their possible functional significance, the cortical EEG of the rat was recorded from frontal and parietal derivations in both hemispheres. Records were obtained for a 24 -h baseline day, 6 -h sleep deprivation (SD), and subsequent 18 -h recovery. During the baseline 12 -h light period, the main sleep period of the rat, low-frequency (< 7. 0 Hz) power in the non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep EEG declined progressively. Left-hemispheric predominance of <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> at the parietal derivations was observed {{at the beginning of the}} light period when sleep pressure is high due to preceding spontaneous waking. The left-hemispheric dominance changed to a right-hemispheric dominance in the course of the 12 -h rest-phase when sleep pressure dissipated. During recovery from SD, both <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> and parietal left-hemispheric predominance were enhanced. The increase in <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> in NREM sleep observed after SD at the frontal site was larger than at the parietal site. However, frontally no interhemispheric differences were present. In REM sleep, power in the theta band (5. 25 - 8. 0 Hz) exhibited a right-hemispheric predominance. In contrast to NREM sleep, the hemispheric asymmetry showed no trend during baseline and was not affected by SD. Use-dependent local changes may underlie the regional differences in the low-frequency NREM sleep EEG within and between hemispheres. The different interhemispheric asymmetries in NREM and REM sleep suggest that the two sleep states may subserve different functions in the brain...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Analysis {{of heart}} rate {{variability}} (HRV) is a valuable noninvasive method for quantifying autonomic cardiac control in humans and has been utilized during dipyridamole echocardiographic test to differentiate positive from negative test results. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to evaluate, by means of HRV analysis, {{the influence of the}} angiographic severity of coronary artery disease on cardiac autonomic control during dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia. METHODS: We analyzed RR interval variability changes during dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia in 31 selected patients (mean age 54 +/- 9 years) with available coronary angiography and positive dipyridamole echocardiographic test. Spectral components of HRV were assessed by means of wavelet transform analysis for the last 5 min before the beginning of the test (baseline) and for 5 min after the onset of ischemia-related events (peak dipyridamole effect). RESULTS: Patients were divided into three groups according to the number of coronary diseased vessels (Group A, single-vessel disease; Group B, double-vessel disease; Group C, triple-vessel disease). No difference was detectable at baseline among the three groups. After dipyridamole, <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power,</b> a measure of sympathetic modulation of heart rate, increased and echocardiographic wall motion score index worsened in all groups (p < 0. 001). The increase in <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> was more evident in Group C patients than in the other two groups (p < 0. 005). Furthermore, after dipyridamole, a direct correlation was found between <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> and wall motion score index (r = 0. 59; p < 0. 001).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{activity}} of intracortical EEG sources in patients with OCD. METHODS: We compared resting state EEG from 50 OCD patients and 50 matched controls using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) and normative independent component analysis (NICA). Data were analyzed with 1 Hz frequency resolution. Group ICA was used to separate 7 independent components from the control group data. The resulting weights and norms served to derive the same components from the OCD group and to compare their power with controls. RESULTS: In OCD, sLORETA indicated <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> excess (2 - 6 Hz) in the medial frontal cortex, whereas group ICA showed increased <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> in a component reflecting the activity of subgenual anterior cingulate, adjacent limbic structures and to a lesser extent also of lateral frontal cortex.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to determine the capacity of a supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in a microgrid is presented. The microgrid contains significant wind power generation and the HESS is to smooth out the fluctuations in the delivered power to load. Using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique, historical wind power data is firstly analyzed to yield the intrinsic mode functions (IMF) of the wind power. From the instantaneous frequency-time profiles of the IMF, the gap frequency is identified and utilized {{in the design of}} filters which decompose the wind power into the high- and <b>low-frequency</b> components. <b>Power</b> smoothing is then achieved by regulating the output powers of the supercapacitors and batteries to negate the high- and <b>low-frequency</b> fluctuating <b>power</b> components, respectively. The degree of smoothness of the resulting power delivered to load is assessed in terms of a newly developed level of smoothness (LOS) criteria. A neural network model is then utilized to determine the storage capacity of the HESS through the minimization of an objective function which contains the costs of the HESS and that associated with the achieved LOS. Example of the design of a supercapacitor-lead acid battery HESS for an existing wind farm demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach...|$|R

To investigate the mechanisms involved, we analyzed changes in local field potentials from the subthalamic area (STN-LFPs) recorded through the deep brain macroelectrode during monopolar DBS of the subthalamic nucleus area (STN-DBS) {{in a group of}} eight patients (16 nuclei) with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Monopolar STN-DBS was delivered through contact 1 and differential LFP recordings were acquired between contacts 0 and 2. The stimulating contact was 0. 5 mm away from each recording contact. The power spectral analysis of STN-LFPs showed that during ongoing STN-DBS whereas the power of beta oscillations (8 - 20 Hz) and high beta oscillations (21 - 40 Hz) remained unchanged, the power of low-frequency oscillations (1 - 7 Hz) significantly increased (baseline= 0. 37 +/- 0. 22; during DBS= 7. 07 +/- 15. 10, p= 0. 0003). Despite comparable low-frequency baseline power with and without levodopa, the increase in low-frequency oscillations during STN-DBS was over boosted by pretreatment with levodopa. The <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> increase in STN-LFPs during ongoing STN-DBS could reflect changes induced at basal ganglia network level similar to those elicited by levodopa. In addition, the correlation between the heart beat and the low-frequency oscillations suggests that part of the <b>low-frequency</b> <b>power</b> increase during STN-DBS arises from polarization phenomena around the stimulating electrode. Local polarization might in turn also help to normalize STN hyperactivity in Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that cognitive control processes are impaired in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI); however {{the nature of these}} alterations needs further examination. The current study examined differences in electroencephalographic theta and alpha power related to cognitive control processes involving response execution and response inhibition in 22 individuals with aMCI and 22 age-, sex-, and education-matched cognitively normal controls. Two Go/NoGo tasks involving semantic categorization were used. In the basic categorization task, Go/NoGo responses were made based on exemplars of a single car (Go) and a single dog (NoGo). In the superordinate categorization task, responses were made based on multiple exemplars of objects (Go) and animals (NoGo). Behavioral data showed that the aMCI group had more false alarms during the NoGo trials compared to controls. The EEG data revealed between group differences related to response type in theta (4 – 7 Hz) and low-frequency alpha (8 – 10 Hz) power. In particular, the aMCI group differed from controls in theta power during the NoGo trials at frontal and parietal electrodes, and in <b>low-frequency</b> alpha <b>power</b> during Go trials at parietal electrodes.

It is demonstrated here that HRV, including normalized LF, correlated inversely with MIBG washout and positively with the ratio of heart-to-mediastinum MIBG activity in controls and CHF patients, whereas these correlations were not observed within CHF patients. Thus MIBG washout may increase and HRV including normalized LF may decrease with CHF, although the HRV and MIBG measures may not similarly change in proportion to the severity of the cardiac autonomic dysfunction in CHF. rights:社団法人日本循環器学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであるrelation：isVersionOf:[URL]...|$|E
