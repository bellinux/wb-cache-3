5000|$|Secondly, most jurisdictions require {{companies}} to provide {{proof of export}} for <b>tax</b> purposes. In <b>an</b> EXW shipment, the buyer is {{under no obligation to}} provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sales <b>tax</b> bill as if the goods were sold <b>to</b> <b>a</b> domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA seller's premises, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process. 228 ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to assess the acceptability of the ambient tax. Concretely, we ask subjects <b>to</b> choose between (<b>A)</b> <b>an</b> ambient <b>tax</b> and (B) <b>an</b> individual <b>tax</b> system. In case (A), they actually participate in a game in which their payo depends on all participants' decisions and on natural variability as would be the case in the real world if <b>an</b> ambient <b>tax</b> was implemented. In case (B) they simply earn a sure payo; which is supposed to re ect their maximal pro t under the individual tax system. We take the percentage of agents preferring the ambient <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> given sure payo level as an indicator of the acceptability of the ambient tax given this sure payo level. Our experimental results mitigate the common belief that am- bient taxes are totally unacceptable. If the sure alternative to the ambient tax policy is very costly for the polluters, for example because it involves high inspection costs, polluters might eventually prefer being <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ambient <b>tax...</b>|$|R
50|$|If you’ve {{borrowed}} money and your lender cancels/terminates or forgives the outstanding loan balance owed <b>to</b> you at <b>a</b> later stage, then you, as per the Internal Revenue Service will be <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> file <b>an</b> income <b>tax</b> {{return on the}} forgiven debt amount {{with respect to the}} corresponding situations. At the time of loan origination, the loan money that you received weren’t considered as an income because you made <b>an</b> agreement <b>to</b> pay back the borrowed sum to the lender, i.e., it was your obligation to repay the loan amount as per the signed contract’s terms and conditions. However, when your obligation to pay back the borrowed sum has been ‘cancelled’ or forgiven, then the payable debt amount becomes reportable as income. The simple reason for it is that you are no longer obligated to repay the loan to the lender. Meanwhile, it is the lender who has to report the cancelled debt to the IRS as well as to you using Form 1099-C, better known as “Cancellation of Debt”.|$|R
40|$|Graduate <b>tax</b> is <b>a</b> {{concept that}} was only {{recently}} introduced into the public discourse in South Africa. Little is known about {{how it will be}} implemented and who will be <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> pay such <b>a</b> <b>tax.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the proposed introduction of graduate tax for South African tertiary education graduates and the public perception of such <b>a</b> <b>tax.</b> <b>To</b> achieve the objectives of the study, relevant literature was reviewed that explained the concept of <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> and the possible advantages and disadvantages of its imposition. Data collected by means of a questionnaire was analysed, which revealed the public perception of <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> as well as its possible consequences. The analysis of the data collected indicated that graduate tax is perceived as <b>an</b> additional <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> be paid by graduates from tertiary institutions, whereas the literature defined it as <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> paid by tertiary institution graduates who received their tertiary education at no cost. Furthermore, it was found that the imposition of <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> may deter some from pursuing a tertiary degree in order to avoid liability for such tax. The imposition of <b>a</b> graduate <b>tax</b> could also lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> outflow of skills, as graduates would be likely to seek employment outside South Africa in order to avoid paying graduate tax. It is recommended in this study that more clarity should be given to the public as to what this proposed graduate tax would entail and who would be affected by it.
