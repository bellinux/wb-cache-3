25|$|Teriflunomide is {{the main}} active in vivo {{metabolite}} of <b>leflunomide.</b> Upon administration of <b>leflunomide,</b> 70% of the drug administered converts into teriflunomide.

25|$|<b>Leflunomide</b> is an {{immunomodulatory}} {{drug that}} achieves its effects by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which {{plays a key}} role in the de novo synthesis of uridine monophosphate (rUMP), which is required for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Hence, <b>leflunomide</b> inhibits the reproduction of rapidly dividing cells, especially lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} use of methotrexate, in particular, {{may lead}} to severe or even fatal liver-damage or hepatotoxicity. Seventy-five percent of all cases of severe liver damage reported until early 2001 were seen under combined drug therapy <b>leflunomide</b> plus methotrexate. However, some {{studies have shown that}} the combination of methotrexate and <b>leflunomide</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis gave better results than either drug alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, <b>leflunomide,</b> TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leflunomide</b> (original {{brand name}} Arava) is an {{immunosuppressive}} disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), used in active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. It is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that works by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like azathioprine, <b>leflunomide,</b> methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{may also help}} prevent relapse. Rituximab may be substituted for cyclophosphamide in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|Lung {{fibrosis}} is {{a recognized}} complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It {{is also a}} rare but well-recognized consequence of therapy (for example with methotrexate and <b>leflunomide).</b> Caplan's syndrome describes lung nodules in individuals with RA and additional exposure to coal dust. Exudative pleural effusions are also associated with RA.|$|E
25|$|More than 75% {{of women}} with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis have symptoms improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and <b>leflunomide</b> are teratogenic (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended {{women of childbearing age}} should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant persons with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of human DHODH by teriflunomide, the active metabolite of <b>leflunomide,</b> occurs at levels (approximately 600 nM) that are achieved during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Teriflunomide also inhibits several tyrosine kinases. Teriflunomide prevents {{the expansion of}} activated and autoimmune lymphocytes by interfering with their cell cycle progression while nonlymphoid cells are able to use another pathway to make their ribonucleotides by use of salvage pyrimidine pathway, which makes them less dependent on de novo synthesis. Teriflunomide also has antiviral effects against numerous viruses including CMV, HSV1 and the BK virus, which it achieves by inhibiting viral replication by interfering with nucleocapsid tegumentation and hence virion assembly.|$|E
2500|$|There are no dosing {{guidelines}} for <b>leflunomide</b> in BKVAN. [...] Patient to patient variability has made dosing and monitoring of <b>leflunomide</b> extremely difficult.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rationale}} behind using <b>leflunomide</b> in BKVAN comes from its combined immunosuppressive and antiviral properties. [...] Two studies consisting of 26 and 17 patients who developed BKVAN on a three-drug regimen of tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids had their MMF replaced with <b>leflunomide</b> 20–60mg daily. [...] 84 and 88% of patients, respectively had clearance or a progressive reduction in viral load and a stabilization or improvement of graft function (7). [...] In {{a study conducted}} by Teschner et al. in 2009, 12/13 patients who had their MMF exchanged with <b>leflunomide</b> cleared the virus by 109 days.

2500|$|... "Regardless of the {{substance}} administered (<b>leflunomide</b> or teriflunomide), {{it is the same}} molecule (teriflunomide)—the one exerting the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action in view of restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions, and does not present, in clinical use, a new chemical entity to patients." [...] Because of this, EMA initially had not considered teriflunomide being a new active substance.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used agent is methotrexate with other frequently used agents including sulfasalazine and <b>leflunomide.</b> Sodium aurothiomalate (gold) and cyclosporin are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects. Agents {{may be used in}} combinations. [...] Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment. [...] Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Biological agents should {{generally}} {{only be used}} if methotrexate {{and other}} conventional agents are not effective after a trial of three months. [...] They {{are associated with a}} higher rate of serious infections as compared to other DMARDs. [...] Biological DMARD agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) blockers such as infliximab; interleukin 1 blockers such as anakinra, monoclonal antibodies against B cells such as rituximab, and tocilizumab T cell co-stimulation blocker such as abatacept. They are often used in combination with either methotrexate or <b>leflunomide.</b> Abatacept should not be used {{at the same time as}} other biologics. In those who are well controlled on TNF blockers decreasing the dose does not appear to affect overall function. Persons should be screened for latent tuberculosis before starting any TNF blockers therapy to avoid reactivation.|$|E
