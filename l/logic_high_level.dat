50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low logic level), the transistor turns off and the collector floats (<b>high</b> <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (<b>high</b> <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to sink current (low logic level). Because the output of the inverter can sink current but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how combining {{two types of}} modelling languages will increase their expressive power. The Behavior Tree method and non-monotonic logic will be integrated. As a general purpose <b>high</b> <b>level</b> graphical modelling language, the Behavior Tree (BT) method {{has the advantage of}} being easy to learn and has been successfully used to model industrial large-scale software intensive systems. Its strength is modelling <b>high</b> <b>level</b> business requirements. The BT method is not good at modelling complex logic. Non-monotonic reasoning represents logic in a human intuitive way. We propose that the logical representation in BTs be replaced with non-monotonic reasoning. We implement the integration using BECIE (Behavior Engineering Component Integration Environment) and Clausal Defeasible Logic. We finish two executable case studies to validate the approach and the implementation. The case studies show how the expressive power of non-monotonic logic assists the formal representation of functional requirements in the BT method. The result is an effective mechanism for formally specifying and simulating logical requirements in BTs. Our approach allows users of BTs to declare what they want in human readable rules instead of composing complex behaviour to represent how their rules are achieved. This raises the level of abstraction regarding logic representation in BTs. It hides low-level <b>logics</b> from <b>high</b> <b>level</b> components, enabling stakeholders of the system to easily conceptualise the main flow.
