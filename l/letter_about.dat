Robb also informs Jaime {{that he intends to}} send Jaime's cousin, Alton Lannister, who also has been captured by the Northern army, to King's Landing with terms for peace. His demands include the release of his sisters Sansa and Arya, the return of the remains of Eddard and his household for proper burial, and the acknowledgement of the Northern independence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he came to}} Hamburg to {{work with}} Pauli, Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English-speaking {{postdoctoral}} fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their molecular beam experiments, for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi {{came up with the}} idea of using a uniform field instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This would be easier to use, and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern's advice, Rabi wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> his results to Nature, which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen ("On the method of deflection of molecular beams") to Zeitschrift für Physik, where it was published in April.|$|E

25|$|These synods {{were held}} in Palestine, Pontus and Osrhoene in the east, and in Rome and Gaul in the west. The council in Rome, presided over by its bishop Victor, took place in 193 and sent a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> the matter to Polycrates of Ephesus and the churches of the Roman {{province}} of Asia. Within the same year, Polycrates presided over a council at Ephesus attended by several bishops throughout that province, which rejected Victor's authority and kept the province's paschal tradition.|$|E
25|$|Stephens {{claimed he}} had been the victim of a {{negative}} campaign, citing mailings that were distributed calling him a 'country-club liberal' and highlighting his close relationship with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. However, Stephens himself drew criticism when he refused to repudiate a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> challenger Greg Ball which falsely claimed Mr. Ball had received a dishonorable discharge from the United States Air Force. Stephens was also criticized heavily for not returning campaign contributions from indicted Connecticut trash magnate James Galante.|$|E

25|$|From Malta, d'Aramon wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> his {{intervention}} to Henry II. The role of d'Aramon was widely criticized by Charles V and Julius III on suspicion {{that he had}} encouraged the Ottomans to take the city. It appeared that d'Aramon {{had participated in the}} victory banquet of the Ottomans, raising further suspicions about his role in the siege, and leading to claims by Charles V that France participated in the siege. In any instance, d'Aramon had a special relationship with the Ottomans, and was clearly aware that the fall of Tripoli represented a major setback for Charles V.|$|E
25|$|In 155, Anicetus, {{bishop of}} Rome, {{presided over a}} church council at Rome that was {{attended}} {{by a number of}} bishops including Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna. Although the council failed to reach agreement on the issue, ecclesiastical communion was preserved. A generation later, synods of bishops in Palestine, Pontus and Osrhoene in the east, and in Rome and Gaul in the west, unanimously declared that the celebration should be exclusively on Sunday. In 193, Victor, bishop of Rome, presided over a council at Rome and subsequently sent a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> the matter to Polycrates of Ephesus and the churches of the Roman province of Asia.|$|E

25|$|Farey {{sequences}} {{are named}} after the British geologist John Farey, Sr., whose <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> these sequences {{was published in the}} Philosophical Magazine in 1816. Farey conjectured, without offering proof, that each new term in a Farey sequence expansion is the mediant of its neighbours. Farey's letter was read by Cauchy, who provided a proof in his Exercices de mathématique, and attributed this result to Farey. In fact, another mathematician, Charles Haros, had published similar results in 1802 which were not known either to Farey or to Cauchy. Thus it was a historical accident that linked Farey's name with these sequences. This is an example of Stigler's law of eponymy.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the Transylvanian noblemen who had fled to the Ottoman Empire, Gabriel Bethlen, {{sent a letter to}} Bocskai urging him to rise up against Rudolph, but Bocskai refused. To award Bocskai for his loyalty, Rudolph {{restored}} to him almost all his estates in Transylvania proper on 2July 1604. Bocskai visited Transylvania and realized that the towns and villages had almost completely been destroyed during the previous years. On his way back from Transylvania, on 20September he learnt that Hajdús had seized a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> his alleged correspondence with the Grand Vizier, Lala Mehmed Pasha, from Gabriel Bethlen. Fearing reprisals, Bocskai hurried to Sólyomkő and pretended that gout had paralysed him. Actually, he ordered his castellans to make preparations for resistance, but one of them revealed Bocskai's plans to Cipriano Concini, the deputy captain of Várad.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the armies}} camped for winter, Jackson's Second Corps held off a strong Union assault against the right {{flank of the}} Confederate line at the Battle of Fredericksburg, in what became a Confederate victory. Just before the battle, Jackson was delighted to receive a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> {{the birth of his}} daughter, Julia Laura Jackson, on November 23. Also before the battle, Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, Lee's dashing and well-dressed cavalry commander, {{presented}} to Jackson a fine general's frock coat that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in Richmond. Jackson's previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements, its buttons removed by admiring ladies. Jackson asked his staff to thank Stuart, saying that although the coat was too handsome for him, he would cherish it as a souvenir. His staff insisted that he wear it to dinner, which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb. Jackson was so embarrassed with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for months.|$|E

25|$|Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean {{has assumed}} a new {{identity}} as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labors in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes {{it out on the}} other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a <b>letter</b> <b>about</b> Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers uses the incident as a pretense to fire Fantine ("At the End of the Day"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both ("I Dreamed a Dream"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and take her to a hospital ("Fantine's Arrest").|$|E
