40|$|Benthic invertebrate-based indexes are {{commonly}} used as proxies for river health, especially river water quality. Scores of BMWP-PL index (a Polish equivalent of the British Biological Monitoring Working Party score system) were determined for 20 unmanaged and channelized cross-sections of the Biała River and compared with water quality and physical habitat parameters in the cross-sections. The two types of cross-sections clearly differed in the physical habitat conditions, whereas physico-chemical parameters of the river water mostly varied in the downstream direction. The number of recorded taxa ranged from 3 to 26 and the respective scores of the BMWP-PL index indicated the water to vary between high and poor quality. Since the analysed water quality was consistently high, the BMWP-PL scores were not related to physico-chemical parameters of the water but to physical habitat parameters, {{with the number of}} <b>low-flow</b> <b>channels</b> explaining the largest proportion {{of the variance in the}} index values. The lacking dependence on physico-chemical water parameters renders the BMWP-PL as indicator of the ecological integrity of rivers, related to their hydromorphological and physico-chemical characteristics, rather than of water quality...|$|R

The downstream alluvial portions of these two rivers {{can be divided into}} three reaches of different slope, flow, sediment, and wood regimes: (i) the upper Quinault River is aggrading behind Lake Quinault, a natural lake that traps most sediment and wood transported from the Olympic Mountain headwaters. (ii) The lower Quinault River, downstream of Lake Quinault, transports only sediment and wood derived from reworking of flood-plain deposits and contributed from valley margins. (iii) The Queets River has unimpeded movement of sediment and water from the mountainous headwaters to the Pacific Ocean. Measurements of channel planform characteristics and historic migration rates and patterns show that these three reaches have correspondingly distinct channel and flood-plain morphologies and dynamics. The aggrading and sediment-rich upper Quinault River has the widest flood plain, widest active channel, greatest number of <b>low-flow</b> <b>channels</b> and flanking gravel bars, and an average channel migration rate of 12. 7 F 3. 3 m/year between 1900 and 1994. The comparatively sedimentpoor lower Quinault River has the narrowest flood plain, narrowest active channel, and lowest channel migration rate (4. 0 F 1. 2 m/year); and most flow is through a single channel with few adjacent gravel bars.

40|$|Freely {{adjusting}} gravel-bed rivers {{are subject}} to recurrent input of material and frequent, but irregular, reworking of bedload materials. In contrast, many Australian rivers are characterised by low-bedload input and infrequent mobilisation of bedload materials. In this study, the influence of these boundary conditions upon surface bedmaterial organisation are analysed through application of extensive field sampling and multivariate statistics based {{on a range of}} bed-material parameters along an 8 km reach of the Upper Hunter River in New South Wales. The Hunter River is a mixedload, gravel-bed river that has been subjected to significant disturbance since European settlement. Since European settlement, the channel in the study reach has been transformed from a passive meandering river to a configuration in which the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> locally adjusts around various bar and bench features. Channel capacity has enlarged locally by a factor of 3, channel alignment has changed via cut-offs (both natural and human-induced), and channel-floodplain relationships have been altered. The multivariate statistical analyses performed in this study provided a very useful tool for identifying surface facies {{and the way in which}} sediment is organised. Bedload surface facies do not demonstrate an equivalent degree of organisation to that documented for fully self-adjusting rivers. A conceptual model is developed that relates the variability and spatial arrangement of differing classes of bed material to the type of geomorphic unit, elevation above the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> and ease of reworking (i. e., frequency of potential mobilisation). Spatial variability in the sediment mix of the study reach, appraised in light of long-term changes to sediment flux, prompts the need for refinement of bedload transport models for this kind of river.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{document}} {{describes a}} plan to reduce erosion and sediment damage, restore riparian vegetation, and improve water quality and aquatic habitat along Indian Creek in Indian and Genesee Valleys. The plan proposes long-term land treatment contracts with individual land users for a grazing management program along 13. 7 miles of the creek, and structural measures for stream stabilization and restoration along 2. 8 of the 13. 7 miles. The principal land treatment measures include fencing, access to water for livestock, grazing management, revegetation, and stream bank protection. Structural measures include geomorphically designed reconstruction of a <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel,</b> intermittent bank protection, and boulders for aquatic habitat. Where construction {{is done in the}} creek, there will be a short-term loss of riparian and aquatic habitat value, followed by a long-term improvement. Alternatives presented include no action and two other combinations of components of the recommended plan...|$|E
40|$|Following {{settlement}} in the 1940 ’s along the Wildcat Creek floodplain, reoccurring flooding {{drew attention to the}} need for flood control in the area. Four decades later, a flood control and riparian restoration project was completed in 1989; however, the project design proved to be a failure, and lateral migration of the creek caused continued flooding within the community. Approximately twelve years later, an improved channel design and restoration project, including a defined <b>low-flow</b> meandering <b>channel,</b> was completed. Since this time, flooding within the community has not occurred, and the channel geometry has been reasonably stable. We surveyed two cross-sections along the channel floodplain and compared channel geometry to recent and baseline surveys conducted following the original construction. Our results indicate a gradual buildup of sediment on the floodplain since the 2000 restoration project. Within the main channel, however, deepening has occurred, indicating a reversal from sediment accumulation to sediment removal and transport. We draw conclusions about the natural sustainability of the channel and discuss the implications for management and maintenance strategies...|$|R
40|$|The Pawtuxet River is {{the third-largest}} {{tributary}} of Narragansett Bay, with a watershed area of approximately 230 square miles. As with most urban rivers, the Pawtuxet {{and its tributaries}} have been extensively modified for industry, transportation, and development. Today, {{there are more than}} 140 dams on the Pawtuxet system, most of which are less than 20 ft. in height. Small dams degrade riverine habitat, water quality, and biodiversity; on the Pawtuxet, they have caused extirpation of native anadromous fish runs. Large areas of the Pawtuxet’s natural floodplains have beenfilled or modified, creating flooding problems for communities along the river corridor. The Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, R. I. Dept. of Environmental Management, EA Engineering, Science and Technology, and other partners are restoring ecological functions to the lower Pawtuxet River and Narragansett Bay watersheds by removing {{a large portion of the}} Pawtuxet Falls Dam, the first downstream dam on the system (located at the head of tide), and creating a <b>low-flow</b> fish passage <b>channel</b> by using the natural pool and bedrock formations. The project will restore migratory fish habitats, reestablish ecological connections between the lower Pawtuxet River and Narragansett Bay, and enhance natural riverine functions and values. River restoration in such an urbanized setting presents many social and technical challenges. The dam is a prized historic and aesthetic feature of one of the most historic communities in Rhode Island. Its impoundment or backwater effect impacts approximately 5 linear river miles; HEC-RAS modeling is being used to design the restoration and predict post-removal changes in water surface elevation and flow. The Pawtuxet’s industrial legacy also presents challenges, requiring evaluation of potential risks to human health, with mitigation measures incorporated as necessary into restoration plans. We will discuss the social, ecological, and technical aspects of the projects to inform other urban river restorations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 Field {{data were}} {{collected}} from 150 stream sites with a diverse array of channel types and disturbance patterns within basins relatively unaffected by anthropogenic disturbance to assess the characteristics of natural large woody debris (LWD) organization, size, and riparian areas across forested regions of Washington State. Bankfull channel width was found to be the dominant factor influencing the grouping of LWD pieces. LWD group size as well as stability increased with channel size. Jams (groups ≥ 10 pieces) contained proportionately similar diameter distributions regardless of size. As bankfull channel width increased the percent of LWD volume decreased in the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> but increased in the high-flow channel. Both the median LWD lengths and diameters increased with bankfull width and proximity to the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel,</b> as well as with increasing LWD group size. As channel width increased, the proportion of pieces oriented parallel to the high-flow channel increased while the frequency of perpendicular pieces decreased, especially if rootwads were attached. Forest zones, as defined by climatic influence and fire history, are the best regional predictors of riparian stand attributes such as tree height, basal area, stem diameter and density. Observed riparian stand composition ranged from 8 to 17 tree species within each of six forest zones. Species richness was greater in milder climates and lower in more extreme climates. The greatest observed tree species diversity was within 35 m of the stream channel; however, stream influences on riparian characteristics were observed out to 65 m, the extent of the sample transect. Large streams with active flood plains had a significantly greater deciduous riparian component than channels less prone to fluvial disturbances. LWD volumes did not peak or plateau until adjacent riparian stands reached 550 years in age; however, LWD quantities were also high during the first 150 years of stand origin. The percent of instream wood quantities that could be attributed to an adjacent riparian source decreased with increasing channel size. Where restoration of instream wood and/or riparian areas are warranted, these characteristics offer guidance to the range of conditions found in natural systems to which aquatic and riparian species have adapted...|$|E
40|$|The interannual {{variability}} of streamflow affects {{the composition and}} species richness of vegetation in low-flow channels and alluvial plains. Although climate conditions in 2003 and 2004 were nearly identical, large differences in streamflow were observed downstream from the Matawin dam. These differences resulted in numerous days without flow (no water release) during the growing period (May to August) in 2003, leading to man-made hydrological drought. While this drought {{had no effect on}} abiotic variables (grain-size distribution and nutrient concentrations in sediments), a significant {{decrease in the number of}} terrestrial species was observed in 2004 (year without drought) relative to 2003 (drought year) on three sand bars studied. This decrease is interpreted to result from prolonged submergence of the sites in 2004. Principal component analysis highlighted the effect of individual sites (first principal component) and of the interannual {{variability of}} streamflow (second component) on the number of species. The study suggests that, from a flow management standpoint, it is advisable to release enough water downstream from the dam during the growing season to prevent <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> colonization by invasive terrestrial species...|$|E

Agricultural drainage is a double-edged sword: helping farmers achieve everincreasing crop yields to meet consumers’ demands, while providing a short-circuit through the soil profile for excess water and nutrients. Drainage ditches {{are an important}} pathway as water moves downstream in headwater landscapes. As low order streams, ditches {{have the potential to}} remove and assimilate nutrients. In order to operate at their maximum nutrient removal potential, ditches should be healthy, self-sustaining ecosystems that function similarly to natural streams. The two-stage agricultural drainage ditch is an innovative solution for creating drainage ditches that behave more like natural streams. A <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> provides sediment transport during low-flow periods, while benches within the ditch allow for overbank flow and energy dissipation during high-flow periods. The larger crosssectional area increases surface contact between water and the ditch at certain flow depths, which likely enhances nutrient removal. In this study, a two-stage agricultural drainage ditch was designed and then constructed in southern Minnesota, USA in the autumn of 2009. Extensive monitoring of the ditch has been conducted following construction; efforts have focused on establishing an understanding of the geomorphic, water source, and water quality aspects of the ditch. Analysis of field measurements from August 2010 show that between 10 and 15 percent of nitrate N entering the ditch was removed within the ditch reach. A slight increase in average channel thalweg elevation has been measured, while increased pool-riffle sequencing has also been observed. Channel cross-sectional surveys have showed slight changes in <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> dimensions. Economic analyses have been performed to measure the feasibility of two-stage ditch construction. There are situations where predicted cost reductions in periodic ditch maintenance provide enough savings to offset two-stage channel construction costs. In other cases, subsidies may be required to economically justify a two-stage system. An analysis was performed to estimate the cost of additional nitrogen (N) removal ($/kg N removed) in two-stage ditches, using increased N removal as a basis for subsidies. Results show situations where N removal costs is less than $ 3 to $ 4 kg- 1 of N removed, which is competitive with other Best Management Practices...|$|E
40|$|National {{audience}} 1. Based on {{a literature}} search {{and the study}} of 300 samples of saxicolous calcifuge lichen communities obtained with the "total sampling" method along several watercourses in continental France, the authors propose the nomenclature of "ekreophilic" for lichens developing on rocks subjected to prolonged water flows and "hydrophilic" when they colonise supports subjected to periodic immersion by watercourses. 2. Statistical analyses of the 300 samples show the existence of three groups defined by their contact times with water. The authors propose the names "subhydrophilic", "mesohydropilic" and "hyperhydrophilic" for lichens in {{the upper part of the}} minor bed, the lower part of the minor bed and in the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel,</b> respectively. 3. A new classification for phytosociology, or plant communities, is proposed. It is defined by the existence of one class of hydrophilic lichens, three orders corresponding to the different times of contact with water, six alliances that depend on bioclimatic stage and finally several associations whose flora compositions should be defined by further work. Research perspectives resulting from this new ecological concept, and the role of symbiotic organisms in phanerogam colonisation of land exposed by receding water are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> {{morphology}} at Boulder Creek {{is characterized}} by a well-developed pool-and-riffle pattern. The riffles consist of accumulations of basaltic boulders deposited from upstream source areas during extremely large flows. Paleoflood water-surface profiles defined by highwater indicators such as slackwater sediments and silt lines indicate that discharges of up to 400 ± 50 cms have affected the lower reaches of this stream system. Stratigraphic relationships and archaeologic and radiometric age constraints indicate that at least four large-magnitude, low-frequency flow events have occurred within the last 500 to 1000 radiocarbon years B. P. Step-backwater hydraulic reconstructions of these large flows suggest that the positions of the boulder-comprised riffles are controlled by spatial variations in large-flow stream power. Boulder deposition occurs where channel stream power drops below thresholds necessary for boulder transport. Reaches immediately upstream of canyun bends and constrictions, and downstream of canyon expansions are sites of large-flow stream-power minima. It is in the vicinity of these types of canyon geometries that the low-flow riffles are observed. Comparison of calculated stream power values and measured boulder sizes with established coarse-particle transport relationships indicates that a 400 ans flaw is approximately the minimum discharge that has the competence to affect this pool-and-riffle pattern...|$|E
40|$|Almost 90 % of {{the treated}} sewage {{effluent}} processed {{by the two}} treatment plants serving the greater Tucson area is available for passive recharge through the Santa Cruz River streambed north of Tucson. In {{the absence of any}} major disturbance of the effluent channel, the recharge capacity of the streambed materials decreases over time as microbial activity, and possibly suspended sediments settling out of solution, act to clog the surficial sediments under the effluent stream. Effluent stream transmission-loss measurements made over the period from November 1994 to August 1995 provided data used to determine the average vertical hydraulic conductivity of the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> in the study reach through simulations using the computer model known as KINEROS 2. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT) served as the calibration parameter in the model. The appropriate KSAT value was chosen for each set of field data by matching the observed and simulated downstream hydrographs for the study reach. KSAT values were corrected for viscosity changes resulting from changing average daily surface water temperatures over the study period. Saturated hydraulic conductivity values for the effluent stream channel ranged from a maximum of 37 mm/hr in January, 1995, following several major winter storms, to a minimum of 11 mm/hr in August, 1995, after a nearly six-month interstorm period. The saturated hydraulic conductivity values decay exponentially with time after the last major winter storm. The mathematical model describing this decay may be used to estimate effluent recharge rates under similar future meteorological and climatological conditions...|$|E

The study site is the Bouinenc Torrent, a tributary to the Bléone River in southeast France that drains a 38. 9 -km² degraded catchment. In spring 2008, we deployed 451 tracers with b-axis ranging from 23 to 520 mm. Tracers were seeded along eight cross-sections {{located in the}} upstream part of the lowest 2. 3 km of the stream. Three tracer inventories were implemented in July 2008, 2009 and 2010. Recovery rates calculated for mobile tracers declined from 78 % in 2008 to 45 % in 2009 and 25 % in 2010. Observations of tracer displacement revealed very high sediment dispersion, with frontrunners having travelled more than 2 km only three months after their deployment. The declining recovery rate over time was interpreted as resulting from rapid dispersion rather than deep burial. We evaluated that 64 % of the tracers deployed in the active channel were exported from the 2. 3 -km study reach {{three years after the}} onset of the tracing experiment. Travel distances were characterized by right-skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, correctly fitted by a power-law function. This supports the idea that in gravel-bed rivers with abundant sediment supply relative to transport capacity, bedload transport {{can be viewed as a}} superdiffusive sediment dispersion process. It is also shown that tracers initially deployed in the <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> were characterized by a 15 - to 30 -fold increase of mobility compared to tracers deployed in gravel bars...|$|E

The project created a compound channel with a <b>low-flow</b> <b>channel</b> capacity of Q 5 in the upper and middle reaches, Q 2 in the lower reach, and a natural floodplain terrace along all reaches to accommodate the design-estimated 100 - year flood of 5, 200 cfs. Downstream of the restoration reach is a trapezoidal concrete channel. On December 30 th and 31 st of 2005, a 20 -year storm with a cumulative rainfall of 3. 56 inches passed over the Tassajara Creek watershed, generating flows that overtopped the low-flow banks of Tassajara Creek, providing an opportunity to assess flow capacity of the compound channel configuration. We conducted long profile and cross-section surveys along the entire restoration reach, and the first 100 feet of the concrete channel. Using the Manning Equation in a HEC-RAS steady flow model, we used the geometry of the concrete channel and the elevation of the high water marks to estimate the peak flow from the storm as 1, 500 cfs. We then back-calculated the roughness coefficient (Manning’s "n") for each compound channel cross-section by matching model water surface elevations to observed elevations. We also compared the design 2 -year and 5 -year low flow channel water surface elevations to modeled water surface elevations using our calibrated roughness values. Finally, we compared the calculated flow capacity to the original design estimations, and we determined that the compound channel successfully accommodates the 100 -year flood, although at one cross section with only 1 foot of freeboard...|$|E
