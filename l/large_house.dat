5|$|In about 1879–81 Douglas built {{a terrace}} of houses {{on his own}} land in Chester, 6–11 Grosvenor Park Road, the road leading to the main {{entrance}} to Grosvenor Park, in High Victorian style. About 1883 he designed Barrowmore Hall (or Barrow Court) at Great Barrow (since demolished) {{which was one of}} his largest houses. Also around this time he designed buildings on the Eaton Hall estate, including Eccleston Hill (1881–82), a <b>large</b> <b>house</b> for the Duke's secretary, the Stud Lodge, a smaller building of the same dates, Eccleston Hill Lodge (1881), a three-storey gatehouse at the main entrance to the park, with a high hipped roof and turrets, and The Paddocks (1882–83), another <b>large</b> <b>house,</b> this time for the Duke's land agent.

40|$|International audienceSince the 1960 s, <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> estates {{have shaped}} the {{geography}} of suburbia in many Western and Eastern European cities. This paper examines {{the constitution of the}} social and spatial meanings of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> estates within three different national contexts: in Germany, Poland, and France. Employing discourse theory and an empirical analysis of the coverage of major national newspapers, we identify cross-national and specific national patterns of discourses that (re) produce particular social spaces and distinct social orders. Quantitative discourse analysis reveals differences, similarities, and ruptures in various constructions of the meaning of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> estates. We find that <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> estates in France and Germany are constituted in print media as threatening places and as places of foreignness located "outside" the "proper society. " In contrast, Polish <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> estates are framed discursively as threatened places located in the social "inside. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>housing</b> is {{an issue}} of growing concern across popular culture, {{academic}} and policy domains, yet little is known about how and why people live in <b>large</b> <b>houses.</b> This paper addresses this gap, investigating the cultural underpinnings and social practices of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> through a qualitative study carried out in Sydney, Australia. In these suburban, detached dwellings, <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> is valued for the affordances it provides for enacting visions of home and family. Specifically, it is a strategy for managing the aural and material excesses of family life; it mediates familial relations and supports the production of middle-class identities. These findings demonstrate the myriad connections between familial practices and housing dynamics and adds to a growing confirmation of the cultural inflections of (un) sustainable practice. 15 page(s...|$|R

5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden.

5|$|In 1826, Wilberforce {{moved from}} his <b>large</b> <b>house</b> in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill, {{a more modest}} {{property}} in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E

After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized when George Withers, who owned a rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him {{the use of a}} <b>large</b> <b>house</b> on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.|$|E

5|$|The risk {{of civil}} {{conflict}} continued, however, and Parliament {{decided that it}} was necessary to slight, or damage so as to put beyond military use, the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur. The castle was virtually razed to the ground in the operation, although a brick building continued {{to be used as a}} prison into the 18th century. A <b>large</b> <b>house</b> was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 18th century a complex of {{building}} had grown up around the original blockhouse, which now had a pier, a dock and two wharfs alongside it, and a <b>large</b> <b>house</b> built by the King's brother, James the Duke of York, after his return to England, as well as the two lines of approximately 20 guns stretching on either side along the river; it had a garrison of a sergeant, 20 soldiers and a gunner on loan from Tilbury Fort. The blockhouse itself was no longer used to mount guns but instead acted as the magazine for the wider fortification, being able to store 2,500 barrels of gunpowder. Under the terms of the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, the number of artillery pieces was reduced to ten, and a survey in 1766 reported that Gravesend was in good condition and equipped with ten 9 lb guns.|$|E
