5000|$|The <b>Lift</b> Reserve <b>Indicator</b> (LRI) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative or backup to the Airspeed Indicator (ASI) during critical stages of flight. This is an elegant device but is rarely found in light aircraft or even transport jets. The conventional Airspeed Indicator is less sensitive and less accurate as airspeed diminishes, thus providing less reliable information to the pilot as the aircraft slows towards the stall. The actual stall speed of an aircraft also varies with flight conditions, particularly changes in gross weight and wing loading during maneuvers. The ASI does not show the pilot directly how the stall is being approached during these maneuvers, whereas the LRI does.|$|R
50|$|In takeoff {{and landing}} {{operations}} from short runways, such as Naval Aircraft Carrier operations and STOL back country flying, aircraft may {{be equipped with}} angle of attack or <b>Lift</b> Reserve <b>Indicators.</b> These indicators measure the angle of attack (AOA) or the Potential of Wing Lift (POWL, or Lift Reserve) directly and help the pilot fly close to the stalling point with greater precision. STOL operations require the aircraft {{to be able to}} operate close to the critical angle of attack during landings and at the best angle of climb during takeoffs. Angle of attack indicators are used by pilots for maximum performance during these maneuvers since airspeed information is only indirectly related to stall behaviour.|$|R

More modern paints do not suffer such problems, so {{whenever}} a coupe is repainted it is viable to remove the vinyl. Today many XJ-Cs no longer have their vinyl roof, also removing the threat of roof rust. Some owners also modified their XJ-C by changing to Series III bumpers. This <b>lifted</b> the front <b>indicators</b> from under the bumper and provided built in rear fog lights.|$|R

The essential idea of the Power-ENO scheme is to use {{a class of}} extended limiters to replace the minmod type limiters in the classical third-order ENO schemes so as to improve resolution near kinks where the solution has discontinuous gradients. Then a weighting strategy based on appropriate smoothness <b>indicators</b> <b>lifts</b> the scheme to be fifth-order accurate. In particular, numerical examples indicate that the Weighted Power 3 ENO 5 works for general HJ equations while the Weighted Power∞ENO 5 works for non-linear convex HJ equations. Numerical experiments also demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the new schemes. KEY WORDS: Hamilton-Jacobi; ENO; Weighted Power-ENO; level set; monotone schemes...|$|R
40|$|Desertification {{has been}} defined as "the {{degradation}} of land in arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid zones resulting from various factors such as climatic variations and human activities," United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (1994). They are characteristic of the areas susceptible to desertification in Brazil, long periods of drought, followed by others of intense rains. Both processes, drought or heavy rain, often cause significant economic, social and environmental losses, which tend to achieve greater accuracy with the portion of the population less favored. The arid and semi-arid spread to all continents of the globe, occupying 1 / 3 of the entire surface of the land and housing about 1 / 6 of the entire population. Data population, particularly the Human Development Index (HDI), are key to understanding the regional dynamics. In this context, it is necessary to <b>lift</b> the socioeconomic <b>indicators</b> of some municipalities in north and northeastern state of Bahia, addressed in this work, with the resulting space of these data, using graphs, charts and maps, showing the evolution of these indices. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to applied research to map and analyze these risk areas susceptible to desertification in the Brazilian semi-arid, using technology provided by the Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems, identifying the possible interactions between socioeconomic status and physical means.

5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used source of lift is created by the sun's energy heating the ground which in turn heats the air above it. This warm air rises in columns known as thermals. Soaring pilots quickly become aware of land features which can generate thermals and their trigger points downwind, because thermals have a surface tension with the ground and roll until hitting a trigger point. When the thermal <b>lifts,</b> the first <b>indicator</b> are the swooping birds feeding on the insects being carried aloft, or dust devils or a change in wind direction as the air is pulled in below the thermal. As the thermal climbs, bigger soaring birds indicate the thermal. The thermal rises until it either forms into a cumulus cloud or hits an inversion layer, {{which is where the}} surrounding air is becoming warmer with height, and stops the thermal developing into a cloud. Also, nearly every glider contains an instrument known as a variometer (a very sensitive vertical speed indicator) which shows visually (and often audibly) the presence of lift and sink. Having located a thermal, a glider pilot will circle within the area of rising air to gain height. In the case of a cloud street, thermals can line up with the wind, creating rows of thermals and sinking air. A pilot can use a cloud street to fly long straight-line distances by remaining in the row of rising air.|$|R

Assessment of quality of life after the DIAMTM spinal stabilization system Purpose. The Device for Intervertebral Assisted Motion (DIAM™) is a method that has been recently applied for the operative treatment of low back pain. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life in patients with low back pain during the course of a single-level discopathy performed using the DIAM™ system, who previously had not undergone any surgical procedure within the lumbar spine. Methods. The study group consisted of 23 selected patients (15 women and 8 men) with a mean age of 47 years. All subjects underwent single-level fenestration with discectomy and DIAM™ system implantation. The level of pain and disability at rest and movement were evaluated at baseline (pre-surgery) and at 6 months after surgery. All patients underwent a post-operative rehabilitation programme. Patients were evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) –pain’s level at rest and movement, a modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Melzack Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Results. Pain’s level reduction was observed in 78 % of patients at rest and in 88 % of patients at movement. 79 % of patients presented an improvement in their ODI score, but disability still persisted in pain intensity and during <b>lifting.</b> All MPQ <b>indicators</b> also improved, but mostly in the psychological dimensions of pain. Conclusions. It was found that during the 6 months following a single-level DIAM™ implantation a greater decrease in pain at rest than at movement was recorded.
