From 1970s to 1990s, having sponsorship from U.S. military and other utility companies, the company extended to <b>low-temperature</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> area and high-temperature carbonate fuel systems, which {{proved to be more}} potential in commercial applications. It completed its IPO in 1992 and was renamed as FuelCell Energy, Inc. & spins off battery division, Evercel in 1999. FuelCell Energy began expanding globally in 2007 through its partnership with POSCO Energy, targeting markets in Southeast Asia, particularly South Korea. In 2012, the company’s European facility was established with German-based FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH. In the same year, it completed joint venture with Fraunhofer IKTS and acquired Versa Power Systems, Inc.|$|E
50|$|The EPOC {{effect can}} be {{observed}} {{in a wide range of}} catalytic reactions with several kinds of metal or metal oxide catalysts mostly coupled with solid electrolytes. Versatile catalytic reactions including hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, oxidations, reductions, isomerizations, and chemical decompositions have been known to be promoted electrochemically on various transition metal and oxide catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh, Ag, Au, Ni, Cu, Fe, IrO2, RuO2) deposited on O2- (YSZ), Na+ or K+, H+, F-, aqueous, CeO2 conductors, and molten salts. The main focus and purpose of numerous studies regarding the EPOC effect have been reported so far can be classified as follows: 1) the elucidation of examples for the EPOC effects on specific catalytic reactions with environmental or industrial interest (ex. NOx reduction and hydrocarbons oxidations), 2) the mechanistic investigation of the origin of the EPOC effects (mainly focusing on the system with oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes), 3) the large-scale application and commercialization of the chemical reactions promoted by the EPOC effects along with development of novel compact monolithic reactors and 4) the utilization and incorporation of the EPOC effect in high or <b>low-temperature</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{operating}} temperatures, PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> may {{be divided}} into two categories: <b>low-temperature</b> PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Low-temperature</b> PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have a low operating temperature below 100  °C, whereas high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> work at temperatures above 100  °C, typically in the range from 120 to 180  °C [2]. The heat and mass transport phenomena and material properties of low-temperature and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have some significant differences.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} synthesizing Au@Pd {{core-shell}} nanoparticles was proposed based on photochemistry. By irradiating {{the mixture of}} Au (III) and Pd (II) ions using ultraviolet light, the Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles were prepared. The size of the nanoparticles and {{the thickness of the}} Pd shell could be efficiently adjusted by changing the molar ratio of Au (III) to Pd (II) ion.

The paper investigated the electrocatalysis performance of Au@Pd nanoparticles in the methanol catalytic oxidation reaction, as well as the electron donating effect of Au core to Pd shell and the promotion of this effect on the catalytic activity of Pd shell.

40|$|Core-shell {{materials}} {{can be employed}} in <b>low-temperature</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology as an active electrocatalyst to enable a decreased loading of Pt while still providing sufficient current density. Traditional synthesis of a core-shell material, however, is very sensitive to batch size, with larger batches often exhibiting much lower activity than small-scale batches. To understand this phenomenon for a Pt monolayer deposited on a carbon-supported Pd material, a synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction technique that utilized the ability of Pd to absorb hydrogen to form a Pd hydride structure was developed. The formation of an interstitial hydride causes a large increase in the Pd lattice constant, while the Pt lattice remains unchanged. This can allow deconvolution of the X-ray diffraction reflections of Pt ML/Pd/C into contributions from Pd and Pt. Results of this technique along with synthesis conditions that result in improved electrocatalytic materials for larger batch sizes are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

Frequently, spherical Pt nanoparticles are used as the electrocatalysts [1 – 3]. On the basis of the catalytic model, increasing the number of active sites on the surface of an electrocatalyst is an option for improving its electrochemical activity. Recently, nonspherical nanoparticles have also been found to be promising catalysts [4 – 8]. These nanoparticles promote catalytic reactions because higher atomic fractions are located at the corners and edges of the nanoparticles [8]. Additionally, hollow metallic nanoparticles have attracted interest in the field of optics [9] and catalysis [4] due to their unique properties. We have recently found that triangular Ag/Pd nanocatalysts in an electroless copper bath exhibit high activity [4].

Previous work by McKay et al [1] shows that the fuel cell anode, cathode, and membrane water dynamics and gaseous species concentrations can be accurately modeled by discretizing the partial differential equations that de-scribe mass transport into three segments. Avoiding sensitivities associated with over-parameterization, and allowing for the real-time computations necessary for embedded controllers, requires in-depth investigation of the model order. In this paper the model from [1] is formulated into a bond graph representation. The objective is to establish the necessary model order for the fuel cell model using the Model Order Re-duction Algorithm (MORA) [2], where an energy-based metric termed the Activity is used to quantify the contribution of each element of the model.

To enhance the hydrogen-rich syngas production from residual biomass mixed with polymeric waste, a dual stage process involving catalytic steam gasification and tar cracking was integrated as a promising alternative technology for clean fuel production. The presence of tar causes syngas degradation and has been identified as one of the major impurities from the gasification process. This study shows the results obtained from an integrated process with optimization process conditions to enhance hydrogen-rich syngas yield. Nickel and dolomite were used as cheap and effective catalysts in fluidized and fixed bed gasifiers respectively, which resulted in high-quality syngas production with a maximum hydrogen yield of 284. 1 g_(H_ 2) kg_feedstock^(- 1) and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) of 92. 4 wt. %.

Ten advanced electric powerplant systems for central-station baseload generation using coal were studied by NASA in ECAS. Three types of low-temperature fuel cells (solid polymer electrolyte, SPE, aqueous alkaline, and phosphoric acid) and two types of high-temperature fuel cells (molten carbonate, MC, and zirconia solid electrolyte, SE) were studied. The results indicate that (1) overall efficiency increases with fuel cell temperature, and (2) scale-up in powerplant size can produce {{a significant reduction in}} cost of electricity (COE) only when it is accompanied by utilization of waste fuel cell heat through a steam bottoming cycle and/or integration with a gasifier. For <b>low-temperature</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems, the use of hydrogen results in the highest efficiency and lowest COE. In spite of higher efficiencies, because of higher fuel cell replacement costs integrated SE systems have higher projected COEs than do integrated MC systems.
