40|$|Parasitoids {{represent}} a diverse and little studied group of insects, employing variety of adaptations to utilize and kill their hosts. Among the unresolved {{issues related to}} the host-parasitoids interactions are responses of such interactions to global climate change, especially in cases specialized insect species adapted to cold environments such as alpine habitats. Example of such hosts are the Holarctic butterflies of the genus Erebia Dalman, 1986 (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) inhabiting mountains of Central Europe. The aim of this study was sampling caterpillars of lowland and mountain Satyrinae butterflies, rearing the caterpillars to determine the degree of infestation and determine the host specificity of parasitoids using combination of classical and molecular methods. I sampled 39 caterpillars of the Meadow Brown (Maniola jurtina), seven caterpillars of the Mountain Ringlet (Erebia epiphron) and four caterpillars of the <b>Large</b> <b>Ringlet</b> (Erebia euryale) at 14 habitats along the altitudinal gradient in Krkonoše Mountains. It was found more than a one-third parasitization by Ichneumon caloscelis among Maniola jurtina caterpillars and no parasitoids among the mountain species. It suggests the possibility of a higher rate of infestation among species living at lower altitudes than at higher altitudes. There are many factors affecting the parasitization's rate among butterflies. This issue requires further monitoring. This study demonstrates the time-consuming sampling of solitary living caterpillars on common plants. Molecular determination of parasitoids using DNA barcoding is possible without major problems, but with certain restrictions...|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat and}} flora {{encourages}} a good range of invertebrates and butterflies include <b>large</b> skipper, <b>ringlet,</b> marbled white and common blue. The {{yellow meadow ant}} thrives on this bank.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{recordings}} {{are good}} for this habitat and include linnet, whitethroat, tree pipit and the greenfinch. Sightings of the Duke of Burgundy butterfly are recorded here, as are populations of <b>ringlet,</b> <b>large</b> skipper and marbled white.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Joseph Tuggs did not {{precisely}} {{understand what the}} grand tour was, or how such an article was manufactured, he replied, ‘Of course.’ Just as he said the word, there came tripping up, from her seat at {{the stern of the}} vessel, a young lady in a puce-coloured silk cloak, and boots of the same; with long black <b>ringlets,</b> <b>large</b> black eyes, brief petticoats, and unexceptionable ankles.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} species of {{butterfly}} {{to be seen in}} the reserve. Most notable is the silver-studded blue, which remains very abundant in the area, having established a colony on the limestone. Other butterfly species include small blue (seen in May/June and July/August), chalkhill blue (seen in July), dark green fritillary and Adonis blue. Grassland species include dingy skipper, small and <b>large</b> skipper, <b>ringlet,</b> meadow brown and marbled white, while there are migrant species such as the painted lady and clouded yellow. Moth species include the day-flying species six-spot burnet, four-spotted moth and cinnabar, as well as the night flying species Portland ribbon wave, beautiful gothic and valerian pug. Some of the {{many species of}} birds seen at the reserve include warblers and other migrants such as the green woodpecker, raven, peregrine falcon and kestrel.|$|R
