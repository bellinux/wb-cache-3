40|$|The {{development}} {{and assessment of}} oral proficiency and listening comprehension {{is one of the}} most problematic aspects in language teaching, especially when the majority of testtakers are non-standard users of English. The main problems concern the feasibility of such testing and the need for reliable scoring. As far as feasibility is concerned, oral proficiency tests of communicative proficiency require much time as well as repeated assessment in the course of a semester or a year. To obtain a reliable score it is necessary to have more than one examiner, preferably also users of English as an additional language, to assess the same task. This paper will describe an attempt to use automatic speech recognition systems to obtain an objective score for oral proficiency. The process of test {{development and}} the subsequent digitalisation of speech, trialling and evaluation will be discussed with specific reference to a course that leads up to a <b>language</b> <b>endorsement</b> required by teacher trainees in South Africa.

In this paper, we utilized a multiple-case study design to describe and explore the learning of four undergraduate teacher candidates enrolled in a university course on the assessment of English language learners. Working to fulfill the course and clinical requirements for the English as a Second <b>Language</b> <b>endorsement,</b> candidates engaged in fieldwork and conducted authentic language assessments to glean the unique sociocultural and linguistic backgrounds, abilities, and needs of students to inform subsequent instruction. Findings indicated that candidates benefited from diverse school and community field placements that matched their programs of study and cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Additionally, findings demonstrated the affordances of community sites where candidates had authentic and low-stakes opportunities to engage in professional practice, juxtaposed with high-stakes classroom settings where cooperating teachers often limited candidate involvement due to the focus on standardized testing. We close with implications and recommendations for field-based teacher preparation for English language learners...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{collaborative}} and socio-constructivist approach to online education, the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model emphasizes creating an effective learning environment where students feel {{a connection with}} other learners and the instructor and engage in well-designed collaborative learning activities. Following a naturalistic methodology, this qualitative case study investigated the use of synchronous communication for creating a community of inquiry and student satisfaction in an online ESOL (English Speakers of Other <b>Languages)</b> <b>endorsement</b> course for preservice teachers. Elluminate Live was used for class meetings while an instant messenger, Gmail Chat served the needs for impromptu interactions between a student and the teacher. The study was guided by the CoI framework. Data sources included online recordings of live meetings, student written reflections, surveys, interviews, and teacher/researcher journal. The findings indicate that synchronous communication enhances building and sustaining an online community of inquiry. Gmail Chat provided increase in teacher availability, social presence, and student satisfaction, however it did not contribute much to creating cognitive presence simply {{because it was not}} planned to be used for content delivery. Moreover, Elluminate Live contributed effectively to the community of inquiry by enabling manifestations and interactions of its 3 elements; social, teaching, and cognitive presence. Participants perceived that live class meetings promoted their learning and helped them feel the instructor and other students in a more real sense. Class meetings via Elluminate Live promoted cognitive presence by affording the students opportunities for listening to the presentations by the teacher and other students, watching a teacher demonstration through a webcam, interacting actively through Whiteboard tools, text-based chat, microphone, and emoticons, and working with their groups in their private breakout rooms. Instant and audio communication among students created a sense of social presence with trust, comfort, and belonging, and enhanced group work efficiency. The study highlights the critical role of synchronous communications to create effective online learning communities, however it also underlines that the implementation of synchronous communication tools requires robust pedagogical planning to enhance student learning...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 181 - 186. The study {{recorded}} in this dissertation was {{undertaken in the}} School of Education at the University of Cape Town (UCT) during the period 1986 - 1990. It was motivated by perceived anomalies {{in the administration of}} State regulations for endorsement of teachers' diplomas in respect of ability in English (E/e). The study commences with an analysis of the relevant requirements of the regulations for teacher bilingualism, as set out in sections 10 and 11 of Criteria for the Evaluation of South African Qualifications for Employment in Education, 1988. Theoretical and practical problems of evaluation and endorsement identified at UCT are considered in relation to the concept of test failure, as opposed to testee failure. Responses to a questionnaire sent to other teacher training centres indicate similar concerns elsewhere. Arising from a review of recent literature on language testing, and against the background of the multilingual target groups tested at UCT, a proposition is put forward for a distinction between communicative competence and language proficiency as criteria in language assessment, depending on whether English is the medium (communicative competence), or the subject (proficiency), of instruction. Assuming that English will remain a medium of instruction in a changing socio-political dispensation, {{at least in the short}} and medium terms, the study then focuses on test design, construction and scoring, where the objective is to test communicative competence in English, rather than proficiency. The role of English in the curriculum in a future South Africa is discussed briefly. It is concluded that current regulations for <b>language</b> <b>endorsement</b> are in urgent need of review. The following recommendations are made in this regard: that the relevant requirements for teachers in State schools be reformulated to account for one level, rather than two, of endorsement in English as the medium of instruction; that such endorsement be required only in the case of non-English medium graduates, thereby recognising the integrity of the English medium teachers' diploma itself; that procedures for assessment for the purpose of diploma endorsement be standardised; and that the State support further research in this area...|$|R

In line with prior work, the use of a foreign <b>language</b> increased the <b>endorsement</b> of such consequentialist actions for the footbridge dilemma, but not for the trolley dilemma. But contrary to recent theorizing, this effect was not driven by an attenuation of emotions. An attenuation of emotions was found in both dilemmas, and it did not mediate the foreign language effect on moral judgment. An examination of additional scenarios revealed that foreign language influenced moral judgment when the proposed action involved a social or moral norm violation. We propose that foreign language influences moral judgment by reducing access to normative knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Noninterference is {{a popular}} {{semantic}} security condition because it offers strong end-to-end guarantees, it is inherently compositional, {{and it can be}} enforced using a simple security type system. Unfortunately, it is too restrictive for real systems. Mechanisms for downgrading information are needed to capture real-world security requirements, but downgrading eliminates the strong compositional security guarantees of noninterference. We introduce nonmalleable information flow, a new formal security condition that generalizes noninterference to permit controlled downgrading of both confidentiality and integrity. While previous work on robust declassification prevents adversaries from exploiting the downgrading of confidentiality, our key insight is transparent endorsement, a mechanism for downgrading integrity while defending against adversarial exploitation. Robust declassification appeared to break the duality of confidentiality and integrity by making confidentiality depend on integrity, but transparent endorsement makes integrity depend on confidentiality, restoring this duality. We show how to extend a security-typed programming <b>language</b> with transparent <b>endorsement</b> and prove that this static type system enforces nonmalleable information flow, a new security property that subsumes robust declassification and transparent endorsement. Finally, we describe an implementation of this type system in the context of Flame, a flow-limited authorization plugin for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler...|$|R

40|$|Relatively little {{attention}} has been focused on standardization of data exchange in clinical research studies and patient care activities. Both are usually managed locally using separate and generally incompatible data systems at individual hospitals or clinics. In the past decade there have been nascent efforts to create data standards for clinical research and patient care data, and to some extent these are helpful in providing a degree of uniformity. Nonetheless, these data standards generally have not been converted into accepted computer-based language structures that could permit reliable data exchange across computer networks. The National Cardiovascular Research Infrastructure (NCRI) project was initiated with a major objective of creating a model framework for standard data exchange in all clinical research, clinical registry, and patient care environments, including all electronic health records. The goal is complete syntactic and semantic interoperability. A Data Standards Workgroup was established to create or identify and then harmonize clinical definitions for a base set of standardized cardiovascular data elements {{that could be used in}} this network infrastructure. Recognizing the need for continuity with prior efforts, the Workgroup examined existing data standards sources. A basic set of 353 elements was selected. The NCRI staff then collaborated with the 2 major technical standards organizations in health care, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium and Health Level Seven International, as well as with staff from the National Cancer Institute Enterprise Vocabulary Services. Modeling and mapping were performed to represent (instantiate) the data elements in appropriate technical computer <b>language</b> structures for <b>endorsement</b> as an accepted data standard for public access and use. Fully implemented, these elements will facilitate clinical research, registry reporting, administrative reporting and regulatory compliance, and patient care...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHOThe {{psychological}} and guidance service is an ancillary service {{established by the}} Transvaal Education Department {{with a view to}} problems which may arise in the school and family situation. For more than sixty years this service has rendered invaluable service to the pupils of Transvaal. This investigation revealed that {{during the past five years}} this service has expanded considerably. On the 30 th June 1974 there were twenty four Child Guidance Clinics with an establishment of one hundred and sixty one posts. These clinics serve the 24 inspection circuits into which the Transvaal has been divided. They are situated at Pietersburg, Nylstroom, Pretoria (4), Rustenburg, Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom, Krugersdorp, Roodepoort, Vereeniging, South Rand, Johannesburg (3), East Rand (4), Ermelo, Nelspruit and Middelburg. Each clinic has 5 different members of staff, namely a psychologist (clinical), a psychologist (vocational guidance), a psychologist (orthodidactic), an assistant psychologist and a speech therapist. In order to render meaningful service it is imperative that the assistant psychologist should be trained and that as an educationist must know exactly what his field and function is. The minimum requirement for appointment to the post of assistant psychologist is at present classification into category "C" (three years training after the attainment of the standard ten certificate or equivalent qualification) and seven years teaching experience. Nowhere do we find an exact ad hoc description of the field and function of the assistant psychologist, As a result of this and practical experience as an assistant psychologist it was concluded that there was a very real need for this study. After lengthy discussions with the authorities of the Transvaal Education Department the need for this study was thus confirmed, The purpose of this study was to investigate the independence of the assistant psychologist as an integral member of the child guidance clinic team by clearly formulating his field, function and training. In this study we are primarily concerned with the field, function and training of the assistant psychologist, although reference will be made to the other members of the service. The information used in this investigation was mainly obtained from South African and overseas literature on this subject. Permission to undertake this study was granted by the Transvaal Education Department Education Bureau. The post of the assistant psychologist attached to the child guidance clinics of the Transvaal Education Department originated in a urgently felt need for personnel to assist pupils with educational-social problems. In the beginning relatively high training requirements were necessary to qualify for this post, e. g. a B. A. -degree with psychology, sociology and social work plus a teachers diploma. It appears however that the training requirements have been lowered considerably - category "C", i. e. three year training is now accepted. As a result of inadequately trained staff the quality of the service has deteriorated. Furthermore this study revealed that the field and function of the assistant psychologist has never been clearly outlined. This fact caused great uncertainty for the assistant psychologist. This uncertainty regarding his field and function also resulted in the various titles given to this post, e. g. visiting teacher, assistant school psychologist, assistant school psychologist (visiting), assistant psychologist (visiting) and assistant psychologist. Although services to pupils with educational social problems are rendered in the U. S. A., Holland and in England, the titles given to these personnel differ. In the U. S. A. and in Holland the person rendering these services is called the school social worker. In England the Education Welfare Officer is responsible for this task. In spite of the fact that the assistant psychologist is regarded as a member of the Child Guidance Clinic-team, the low training requirements as well as the uncertainty with regards to his exact field and function has led to the situation where he has an inferior position; his salary and status is much lower than the other school psychologists attached to the Child Guidance Clinics of the Transvaal Education Department. The independence of his discipline as such has not yet been realised. As soon as a situation of tension arises that has a negative influence on the pupil's behaviour at school and in the home the principal completes a form which is sent to the child guidance clinic for the circuit inspector. The school psychologist (social) must then identify the educational-social problem. In the U. S. A. the school social worker is a member of the school staff and teachers report pupils in need of attention directly to him. In Holland and in England the principal of the school reports pupils in need of professional help to the school social worker and the Educational Welfare Officer. After the problem has been outlined, an investigation is instituted. Except for the U. S. A. where the school social worker is a member of the school staff, the school social worker in Holland and the Educational Welfare Officer in England, visits the schools. In the Transvaal the school psychologist (social) visits the school and interviews the principal and/or the member of staff who reported the problem. All information and sources or origin is recorded and placed in a special child guidance clinic file opened for the pupil. The pupil is interviewed at the school, where all the necessary information is obtained. The parents may be invited to the school for an interview or this may be conducted at their home. The interview which is conducted at the home serves the purpose of examining the parents view of the situation involving their child. All information and observations are recorded and placed in the pupils file at the child guidance clinic. The pupils personal child guidance clinic file must give a comprehensive picture of the situation and must contain the following: (a) Details of identification (b) Purpose of interview (c) Introductory remarks (d) Sources of information (e) Family history (f) Family relationships (g) Home circumstances and environment (h) Diagnosis (i) Prognosis (j) Recommendations The school psychologist (social) is responsible for the therapeutic placement of pupils in school hostels. This therapeutic placement concerns pupils whose behaviour and circumstances are of such a nature that they do not need placement in a clinic school. The Transvaal Education Department has three clinic schools. In co-operation with school psychologist (clinical) the school psychologist (social) places pupils whose educational-social problems warrant placement in these clinic schools. Pupils placed in these clinic schools receive treatment and must be decertified and reunited with their own parents as soon as possible, because of the importance of the home. This means that simultaneous attention must be given to parent and child. Regular home visits must be carried out by the school psychologist (social); he also visits the clinic schools and reports back to the parents. Parents are encouraged to visit their child at the clinic school. This gives the staff of the. clinic school the opportunity of getting to know the parents. Even after the pupil has been decertified, completed his schooling, been placed in a school hostel or started work, the school psychologist (social) must continue his advisory service to the pupil and his parents. It is also the task of the school psychologist (social) to advise pupils and their parents in regard to exemption from compulsory school attendance. He does this in co-operation with the school psychologist (vocational guidance). The school psychologist (social) must possess a sound knowledge of community resources and their use. He is the link between home and child and the community. He liaisons with the follow= ing: Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, Department of National Education, C. M. R., S. A. V. F., Child Welfare Society, S. A. P., schools and other religious bodies and organizations who can assist the child and his parents. As far as preventative services are concerned the school psychologist (social) has an important function. An example of these preventative services is the following: he will address parent-teacher meetings, church youth meetings etcetera. During these lectures he must choose subjects referring to child education and bring to their notice the services offered by the child guidance clinic. The school psychologist (social) must treat all information in his possession as confidential. In the expanding science and profession of educational psychology, the school psychologist (social) is at best an adolescent in his development. Like an adolescent, he grows, changes almost beyond recognition, faces new demands, fresh opportunities. And in youthful fashion he may try out many roles in the search for an identity with meaning for him. The unprecedented demand for the services of the school psychologists (social), the many contemporary pressures upon the schools, and the extension of educational psychological knowledge all suggest that the present is a crucial time for the profession. A careful reassessment of the place of psychologist serving the schools is imperative if the profession is to push forward rather than slip backward. Such a rethinking must project into the future roles that take into fullest account the use of the particular knowledge and skills educational psychology and social work has to offer, now or in coming years. Such re-examination should relate these roles to the needs and concerns of schools as they change with the times. Until such time as the roles of the helping professions are more clearly structured in the schools and child guidance clinics, there will doubtless be some overlap in functions between the school psychologists (social) and psychologists in many school settings. The chances are good, however, that there will be more than enough work for both groups. The school psychologist (social) is fortunate who has guidance teachers in his schools with whom he can share the load. With the great manpower needs in the helping professions, the chief problem is one of providing the opportunities for each profession to use its greatest potential in working to meet the needs of school children. In such mutual endeavours school social work and school psychology can become strong and effective allies. Taking the above into consideration the following recommendations are made: (1) The independence of this discipline will be realised once the status and salary of the school psychologist (social) is brought in line with that of other school psychologists in the child guidance clinics. (2) The Psychological and Guidance Service of the Transvaal Education Department must furnish the school psychologist (social) with a clear outline of his field and function. (3) The training requirements of the school psychologist (social) must be revised. Only people in possession of a B. A. degree with Psychology and Social Work as major subjects. plus a teaching diploma as well as the B. Ed. degree with specialization in Socio-Pedagogics or Guidance must be appointed to these posts. (4) Equal ability to teach in both official languages must be stated as a requirement, i. e. only people in possession of the <b>language</b> <b>endorsement</b> ("AE" or "EA") must be appointed. (5) The qualifications of more than half of the present assistant-psychologist attached to the Child Guidance Clinics of the Transvaal Education Department are too low to qualify and are therefore not equipped to render these professional services. These people however have had valuable experience and must be granted the opportunity by the Transvaal Education Department to improve their qualifications. (6) The title of the post of the assistant psychologist must be replaced by the title school psychologist (social). This title is a true reflection of this person's training, field and function. The school psychologist (social) is primarily an educationist who has also been trained in social work and psychology. (7) In co-operation with universities the Child Guidance Clinics must be prepared to accept potential school psychologists (social) for practical training. After training the school psychologist (social) must undergo an internship of at least one term at a Transvaal Education Department Child Guidance Clinic. (8) For the benefit of the Clinic School Children and their parents, a member of the Child Guidance Clinic team must be available at every Child Guidance Clinic during school holidays. (9) The appointment to every school of trained guidance teachers will assure that the quality of service rendered by the scho 9 l psychologist (social) will be more purposeful and beneficial. (10) Research in regard to the services rendered by the Transvaal Education Department's Psychological and Guidance Service should be undertaken. The Transvaal Education Department should make bursaries available to this end. (II) In conclusion it is recommended that the universities training the school psychologist (social) must give as much practical training as possible. Master...|$|R
