25|$|Popular {{sovereignty}} was {{the theoretical}} {{basis of the}} Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. This concept was meant to remove the divisive issue of slavery in the Territories from national debate, allowing <b>local</b> <b>decision</b> making, and forestalling armed conflict between the North and South. But during the campaign, the Republican Party denounced the theory as protecting polygamy. Leading Democrats such as Stephen A. Douglas, formerly an ally of the Latter-day Saints, began to denounce Mormonism {{in order to save}} the concept of popular sovereignty for issues related to slavery. The Democrats believed that American attitudes toward polygamy had the potential of derailing the compromise on slavery. For the Democrats, attacks on Mormonism had the dual purpose of disentangling polygamy from popular sovereignty, and distracting the nation from the ongoing battles over slavery.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} social {{learning}} is not useful {{in a model}} of team binary decision making by voting, where each vote carries equal weight. Specifically, we consider Bayesian binary hypothesis testing where agents have any conditionally-independent observation distribution and their <b>local</b> <b>decisions</b> are fused by any L-out-of-N fusion rule. The agents make <b>local</b> <b>decisions</b> sequentially, with each allowed to use its own private signal and all precedent <b>local</b> <b>decisions.</b> Though social learning generally occurs in that precedent <b>local</b> <b>decisions</b> af-fect an agent’s belief, optimal team performance is obtained when all precedent <b>local</b> <b>decisions</b> are ignored. Thus, social learning is futile, and secret ballots are optimal. This conclusion contrasts with typical studies of social learning because we include a fusion center rather than concentrating {{on the performance of}} the latest-acting agents.

2500|$|Most of {{the country}} agreed to pay all the usual taxes, but the Tudurs knew that they needed a {{bargaining}} chip {{if they were to}} lift the dire threat hanging over them. They decided to capture Edward I’s great castle at Conwy. Although the Conwy Castle garrison amounted to just fifteen men-at-arms and sixty archers, it was well stocked and easily reinforced from the sea; and in any case, the Tudurs only had forty men. On Good Friday, 1 April, all but five of the garrison were in the little church in the town when a carpenter appeared at the castle gate, who, according to Adam of Usk’s Chronicon, [...] "feigned to come for his accustomed work". Once inside, the Welsh carpenter attacked the two guards and threw open the gate to allow entry to the rebels. When Percy arrived from Denbigh with 120 men-at-arms and 300 archers, he knew it would take a great deal more to get inside so formidable a fortress and was forced to negotiate. A compromise was reached which would have resulted in pardons issued, but on 20 April, the king overruled Percy's <b>local</b> <b>decision.</b> It was not until Gwilym ap Tudur began to write directly to the king that an agreement was reached on 24 June.

40|$|We {{study the}} utility of social {{learning}} in a distributed detection model with agents sharing the same goal: a collective decision that optimizes an agreed upon criterion. We show that social learning is helpful in some cases but is provably futile (and thus essentially a distraction) in other cases. Specifically, we consider Bayesian binary hypothesis testing performed by a distributed detection and fusion system, where all decision-making agents have binary votes that carry equal weight. Decision-making agents in the team sequentially make <b>local</b> <b>decisions</b> {{based on their own}} private signals and all precedent <b>local</b> <b>decisions.</b> It is shown that the optimal decision rule is not affected by precedent <b>local</b> <b>decisions</b> when all agents observe conditionally independent and identically distributed private signals. Perfect Bayesian reasoning will cancel out all effects of social learning. When the agents observe private signals with different signal-to-noise ratios, social learning is again futile if the team decision is only approved by unanimity. Otherwise, social learning can strictly improve the team performance. Furthermore, the order in which agents make their decisions affects the team decision. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
