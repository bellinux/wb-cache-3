40|$|Data on {{the primary}} {{electron}} spectrum from 5 MeV to 30 GeV are presented {{for a large}} number of balloon flights in the years 1965 - 1972. A new much larger area electron telescope was introduced to these studies in 1971 and the results from this new telescope are given and compared with earlier results. Detailed electron spectra are presented and the effects of solar modulation are examined over a wide energy range. The phase <b>lag</b> or <b>hysteresis</b> in the electron intensity observed after 1969 is also examined between 40 MeV and 1 GeV...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} clearly {{established}} by several different experiments that following the last solar maximum (about 1969), {{there was a}} significant phase <b>lag</b> or <b>hysteresis</b> effect between changes in the low rigidity galactic cosmic rays and the high rigidity components. It was possible to explain this in terms of the diffusion-convection-modulation theory by varying either the diffusion coefficient or the size of the modulation region as a function of time. During the ensuing recovery phase of the solar modulated spectra, at the mid point toward the minimum of the solar activity, new striking features have been observed, and these new observations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Time lags {{have been}} {{recognized}} as valuable measures of heat stress in animals. Some existing models such as the symmetric harmonic hysteresis and the asymmetric harmonic hysteresis models have been shown beneficial for obtaining time lags and describing the dynamics of thermally challenged animals. Both hysteresis models {{are based on the}} assumption that air temperature (forcing function) follows a sinusoidal pattern. This dissertation will present a simple and more general method for estimating time lags using a piecewise regression lags model that does not require sinusoidal air temperature trends. Time lags are estimated from taking the difference between the body temperature change point and the air temperature change point of the piecewise regression models for each response. The segmented method proposed by Muggeo (2003) is used to estimate parameters of a piecewise linear regression model including the change points and to develop a permutation test for testing the existence of the change points. The idea of a segmented method is then extended to a piecewise quadratic regression model for estimating the pseudo change points. The performance of the piecewise regression <b>lags</b> and <b>hysteresis</b> <b>lags</b> were assessed via simulations and applied to heat stress data on heifers with the conclusion that the piecewise regression lags models are efficient for obtaining the lags in comparison with hysteresis models and the animals’ response differently to heat stress. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in delta wing aerodynamics are reviewed. For slender delta wings, recent investigations shed more {{light on the}} unsteady aspects of shear-layer structure, vortex core, breakdown and its instabilities. For nonslender delta wings, substantial differences {{in the structure of}} vortical flow and breakdown may exist. Vortex interactions are generic to both slender and nonslender wings. Various unsteady flow phenomena may cause buffeting of wings and fins, however, vortex breakdown, vortex shedding, and shear layer reattachment are the most dominant sources. Dynamic response of vortex breakdown over delta wings in unsteady flows can be characterised by large time <b>lags</b> and <b>hysteresis,</b> whose physical mechanisms need further studies. Unusual flow-structure interactions for nonslender wings in the form of self-excited roll oscillations have been observed. Recent experiments showed that substantial lift enhancement is possible on a flexible delta wing...|$|R
40|$|Observations of a {{phase lag}} between the {{intensity}} variations of high-energy {{galactic cosmic rays}} and the quiet-time oxygen flux in the energy region 7. 6 - 24 MeV/nucleon during the time period 1974 - 1975 are reported. Phase <b>lag</b> or <b>hysteresis</b> effects have been observed during the 11 -year solar cycle for low-energy galactic cosmic rays and several authors have shown that this hysteresis effect {{is a function of}} the velocity and rigidity (and therefore of the ionic charge) of the particles. Assuming a similar rigidity dependence of the phase lag during the transient intensity decrease of both galactic cosmic rays and the anomalous oxygen component in the time period 1974 - 1975, and comparing the phase lag as observed for protons and helium during the same period with the oxygen measurements, an upper limit of approximately 4 is derived for the ionic charge of the anomalous oxygen component...|$|R
40|$|The {{maternal}} heart significantly adapts to the circulatory {{needs of}} pregnancy, {{but the effect}} of pregnancy on ventricular repolarization is poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify longitudinal changes in ventricular repolarization during pregnancy. Monthly electrocardiographs (ECGs) were recorded in 32 pregnant women with normal uterine perfusion and 32 pregnant women with abnormal perfusion, starting from the 20 th week of gestation until 3 days postpartum. Ventricular repolarization was assessed through various QT interval variability and heart rate adaptation measures. The pregnancy outcomes of all women with normal perfusion were normal. Among pregnancies with abnormal uterine perfusion, 15 pregnancy outcomes were normal, but 17 pregnancies developed preeclampsia and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. In pregnancies with normal perfusion, the QTc interval was unaltered, but the QT interval-heart rate <b>hysteresis</b> <b>lag</b> was shorter and the QT interval-heart rate regression residual was higher compared with those of a control group of 10 healthy non-pregnant women. Pregnancies with abnormal uterine perfusion that developed pathological outcomes showed significantly smaller QT interval-heart rate regression residuals and a trend towards shorter QTc intervals compared with pregnant women with normal perfusion. In conclusion, pregnancy has a significant effect on ventricular repolarization. Pregnancies with abnormal uterine perfusion and subsequent pathological outcomes are paralleled by changes in ventricular repolarization that precede clinical symptoms.

40|$|Increasing use of {{automated}} {{soil respiration}} chambers {{in recent years}} has demonstrated complex diel relationships between soil respiration and temperature that are not apparent from less frequent measurements. Soil surface flux is often lagged from soil temperature by several hours, which results in semielliptical hysteresis loops when surface flux is plotted as a function of soil temperature. Both biological and physical explanations have been suggested for hysteresis patterns, and there is currently no consensus on their causes or how such data should be analyzed to interpret the sensitivity of respiration to temperature. We used a one-dimensional soil CO 2 and heat transport model based on physical first principles to demonstrate a theoretical basis for lags between surface flux and soil temperatures. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrated that diel phase lags between surface flux and soil temperature can result from heat and CO 2 transport processes alone. While factors other than temperature that vary on a diel basis, such as carbon substrate supply and atmospheric CO 2 concentration, can additionally alter <b>lag</b> times and <b>hysteresis</b> patterns to varying degrees, physical transport processes alone are sufficient to create hysteresis. Therefore, the existence of hysteresis does not necessarily indicate soil respiration is influenced by photosynthetic carbon supply. We also demonstrated how lags can cause errors in Q 10 values calculated from regressions of surface flux and soil temperature measured at a single depth. Furthermore, synchronizing surface flux and soil temperature t...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies indicate that}} changes in riverbed morphology often lag changes in water discharge. This <b>lagged</b> response produces <b>hysteresis</b> {{in the relationship between}} water discharge and bed form geometry. To understand these phenomena, we performed flume experiments to observe the response of a sand bed to step increases and decreases in water discharge. For an abrupt rise in discharge, we observed that bed forms grew rapidly by collision and merger of bed forms migrating with different celerities. Growth rate slowed as bed forms approached equilibrium with the higher discharge regime. After an abrupt discharge drop, bed form decay occurred through formation of smaller secondary bed forms, in equilibrium with the lower discharge, which cannibalized the original, relict features. We present a simple model framework to quantitatively predict time scales of bed form adjustment to flow changes, based on equilibrium bed form heights, lengths, and celerities at low and high flows. For rising discharge, the model assumes that all bed form collisions result in irreversible merger, due to a dispersion of initial celerities. For falling discharge, we derive a diffusion model for the decay of relict high-stage features. Our models predict the form and time scale of experimental bed form adjustments. Additional experiments applying slow and fast triangular flood waves show that bed form hysteresis occurs only when the time scale of flow change is faster than the modeled (and measured) bed form adjustment time. We show that our predicted adjustment time scales {{can also be used to}} predict the occurrence of bed form hysteresis in natural floods...|$|R
40|$|Bed load transport, the {{movement}} of sediment by water or air {{in close proximity to}} the river bed or ground surface, is governed by complex interactions among fluid, particles, and evolving bed topography. Recognizing the limitations of deterministic, equilibrium approaches in capturing these interactions and accurately predicting bed load flux, recent studies have shown the advantages of adopting a stochastic approach, i. e., one that treats system components as random variables. One hallmark of bed load is the presence of unpredictable and often extreme temporal fluctuations in transport rates. The goal of this dissertation is to understand these transient processes, both as generated by the internal dynamics of a steadily-driven bed load system and in response to changes in external forcing. Field and experimental observations have been obtained to study the ensemble statistics of bed load transport over time scales ranging from milliseconds to hours and to consider how statistical metrics of bed load change with observational time scale. Flume experiments and field observations show how sand bed forms (ripples and dunes) respond in a lagged manner to changes in water discharge, and how this <b>lagged</b> response produces <b>hysteresis</b> in bed form dimensions through flood waves. Field observations of wind-blown sand demonstrate how turbulent fluctuations in wind stress drive lagged variations in sand flux that produce systematically time-scale biased estimates of the stress-flux relationship. Flume experiments that track gravel particle trajectories reveal the role of ballistic particle motion, intermittent transport, and heavy-tailed particle waiting times in producing particle dispersion that deviates from normal diffusion expectations; these experiments also indicate the potential for the statistical mechanical formalism to describe bed load dispersion. Idealized two-dimensional flume experiments demonstrate the importance of particle collisions for incipient motion and collective transport, and they show how the distribution of particle waiting times is related to the stochastic but mean-reverting tendencies of bed evolution. Together, these observations of stochastic bed load processes reveal characteristic time-scale signatures that can inform attempts to distinguish the origin of transport fluctuations arising from external forcing versus intrinsic fluctuating transport dynamics. ...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, bedload {{sediment}} transport {{has generally been}} investigated under steady flow conditions, which does not represent the typical {{sediment transport}} scenarios observed within natural fluvial channels. These channels often experience significant variations in bedload transport and bed morphological evolution under unsteady flow conditions, especially during flood hydrograph events. At present, however, there is a distinct {{lack of understanding of}} the interaction between hydrograph flow properties and the variability in bedload transport and bed evolution. Within the current study, different series of parametric experiments were conducted in two glass-walled, tilting flume facilities with the main aim of investigating the response of uniform and graded sediment beds to a range of different unsteady flow hydrograph conditions, and compare this to the corresponding response under equivalent steady flow conditions. The novelty of this research against previous studies is highlighted in terms of (i) the identification of the individual influence of hydrograph-related parameters (shape , unsteadiness HG and total water work Wk) on unsteady sediment transport characteristics (e. g. <b>hysteresis</b> and temporal <b>lag)</b> and the resulting bed evolution; (ii) the use of natural-shaped hydrographs (single and double peak) rather than stepped, triangular or trapezoidal hydrographs; (iii) the direct comparison between bedload sediment transport yields and corresponding bed evolution under unsteady hydrograph and equivalent (volume) steady flows; and (iv) enhanced understanding of influence of intergranular effects (e. g. particle exposure and/or hiding) on observed bedload sediment transport behaviour in unsteady and equivalent steady flows. Experiments conducted with both uniform (course sand, d = 1. 95 mm) and graded (fine gravel, d 50 = 2. 64 mm, 5. 00 mm) beds not only confirm the clockwise and counter-clockwise hysteresis in measured bed load transport rates, but also reveal no/mixed hysteresis patterns as a transitional condition between these clockwise and counter-clockwise hystereses for bedload transport measured under unsteady flow hydrographs. For graded sediment transport, the intergranular effect on temporal <b>lag</b> and <b>hysteresis</b> patterns for transport of classified fine, medium and coarse size classes within graded (unimodal, bimodal and fine-grained) sediment beds in unsteady flow hydrographs is also revealed. Specifically, the coarse size class tends to respond preferentially to the changing flow and exhibits clockwise hysteresis in general; whereas the fine size class tends to become more active later and demonstrates reduced clockwise, no/mixed or counter-clockwise hysteresis. Corresponding temporal variations and hysteresis patterns in the median db 50 size of the bedload transport load are also observed, with the db 50 value generally reaching its peaking value during the rising hydrograph limb and indicating a clockwise hysteresis over the hydrograph duration. Bedforms (i. e. dunes and alternate bars) are found to develop only within uniform sediment bed (d = 1. 95 mm) under both steady and unsteady flows tested. A relevant analysis of the formative conditions under which these bedforms develop is presented. By contrast, no bedforms are observed to form within graded sediment beds; only slight bed evolution (e. g. bed aggradation up to + 5 mm at upstream) is identified for fine-grained sediment bed (d 50 = 2. 64 mm) runs. Additionally, the median size of the bed surface ds 50 is shown to coarsen during the antecedent flow conditions within all graded sediment beds (compared to d 50 in specified particle size distributions). This surface coarsening persists over the duration of both steady and unsteady flow events tested in current study [e. g. run-averaged ds 50 values: (i) unimodal grading, ds 50 = 6. 51 mm (> d 50 = 5 mm); (ii) bimodal grading, ds 50 = 6. 74 mm (> d 50 = 5 mm); and (iii) fine-grained grading, ds 50 = 3. 62 mm (> d 50 = 2. 64 mm) ]. The temporal variations in the median bedload size db 50 (< ds 50 throughout) for both the steady and unsteady flow runs, are also responsible for explaining the development and persistence of the surface armour layer. Bedload transport and bed evolution for uniform and graded sediment beds under steady flows are measured to provide a benchmark for direct comparison with equivalent bedload rates and yields, bedform development, and variations in bedload and bed surface grain size composition under unsteady flows. The difference in effects of unsteady and steady flow is found to be significant for bedload rate (with the unsteady-steady bedload ratio Kq = 0. 23 – 14. 95), bedload yields (i. e. yield ratio us = 1. 11 – 13. 56), bedforms (i. e. dunes, alternate bars and etc.) and bedload composition (i. e. db 50 ratio Kb = 0. 38 – 1. 56), but less significant for bed surface composition (i. e. ds 50 ratio Ks = 0. 92 – 1. 33). Further, the individual influence of hydrograph related parameters (shape, unsteadiness HG, total water work Wk) on bedload yields, yield distribution over the rising and falling two limbs of single-peaked hydrographs, and on of bedform characteristics (i. e. type, dimensions) is also evaluated. In more complex flow hydrographs, such as double-peaked hydrographs, the equivalent bedload transport and bed evolution characteristics are also derived. Finally, the presence of specific grain size classes within the graded sediment beds and their influence on the transport of other six classes is considered from comparison of sediment transport characteristics for (i) the unimodal and bimodal sediment mixtures (with the same d 50 = 5. 0 mm), and (ii) the uniform (d = 1. 95 mm) and fine-grained sediment mixture (d 50 = 2. 64 mm), which arise from relative grain exposure and sheltering effects under the same steady and unsteady flow events. An idealised, theoretical analysis of the hydrodynamic forces and moments associated with these potential impacts is provided. Most importantly, the transport of fine particles is found to vary depending upon the presence state of coarser particle sizes in the surface layer (i. e. stationary or mobile to varying rates), which reveals the mechanism for selective fractional transport within the graded sediment bed under equivalent steady and unsteady hydrograph flow conditions...|$|R
