Lateral tire forces acting on each tire are directly measured by load-sensing hub bearings that were invented and further developed by NSK Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a least-squares (LS) vector flow estimator that {{is intended to}} calculate axial and <b>lateral</b> <b>velocities</b> using aperture-domain Doppler data from multiple transmit point sources and multiple receive apertures realized via the synthetic aperture (SA) technique. Our new estimator comprises two main stages. First, for each transmit point and receive aperture, we obtain aperture-domain Doppler ensembles {{and use them to}} compute a frequency estimate (via the lag-one autocorrelator) for every spatial point in imaging view. Subsequently, by noting that each transmit point and receive aperture deviates in flow angle, we estimate flow vectors through creating a set of Doppler equations with two unknowns (i. e. axial and <b>lateral</b> <b>velocities)</b> from the frequency estimates and solving this equation set as an over-determined LS problem. To evaluate the performance of new estimator, Field II simulations were performed for a scenario with a 5 mm-diameter steady flow tube (tube angle: 0 °- 90 °, center velocity: 0 - 25 cm/s). For these simulations, a 5. 5 MHz linear array with 128 elements was used; pre-beamform data was acquired for 97 virtual point sources (0. 3 mm spacing, 32 elements), and 12 two-cycle pulses were fired through each point source (PRF: 5 kHz). Our LS estimator was then applied to a few different transmit-receive SA imaging configurations (e. g. 97 transmit points and 3 receive apertures). Results show that, if a multi-transmit configuration is used, the LS estimator is more capable of providing vector flow maps that roughly resemble the theoretical profile. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In this paper, we will describe how an image is segmented, possible blobs are selected and characterized, how they are tracked, and how the velocity of the helicopter is calculated.

Typically turbulent fluid flows occupy the full three dimensions of space, but {{in certain cases}} motion in one direction is suppressed and a quasi two-dimensional hydrodynamics remains.

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays {{improving}} safety is an indispensable part of research {{issues in the}} automotive industry. Due to increased travelling time, accident potentials and also traffic con-gestions, automated vehicles {{are seen as a}} way to increase freeway capacity and vehicle speed while reducing accidents resulted from human errors. In order to guide a vehicle automatically, vehicle lateral motion should be controlled, active steering control (ASC) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) are two common methods to control the vehicle lateral dynamic, automatically. For higher vehicle lateral acceleration, where the tyres will not be capable of producing enough lateral forces (yaw-moment), ASC could not be useful. In such situation, the advantages of DYC can be clearly observed. In this paper, a novel optimal control law is proposed to control the vehicle path, automatically. The control law uses the vehicle dynamic variables such as the yaw and <b>lateral</b> <b>velocities,</b> <b>lateral</b> offset, and the heading error as well as the road-related variables. These are the road curvature and the lateral offset between the desired path and the vehicle as the feedback/feed-forward signals to produce both the front steering angle and the external yaw-moment signals as the control efforts. Simulation results illustrate the dominant power of the front steering/DYC in the control of the vehicle lateral motion...|$|R
50|$|The type of wave {{used in a}} model {{limits the}} {{resolution}} it can achieve. Longer wavelengths are able to penetrate deeper into the earth, but can only be used to resolve large features. Finer resolution can be achieved with surface waves, with the trade off that they cannot be used in models of the deep mantle. The disparity between wavelength and feature scale causes anomalies to appear of reduced magnitude and size in images. P- and S-wave models respond differently to the types of anomalies depending on the driving material property. First arrival time based models naturally prefer faster pathways, causing models based on these data to have lower resolution of slow (often hot) features. Shallow models must also consider the significant <b>lateral</b> <b>velocity</b> variations in continental crust.|$|E
50|$|An {{approximate}} way {{to relate}} the sound generated to the flow characteristics is to perturb the standard drag equation with velocity perturbations {{as shown in the}} upper equation below.(lift measurements for cylinders are generally not available). The upper equation is the modified drag equation with both drag component u and lift component v and the cross sectional area dL where d is the cylinder diameter and w is the length. Manipulation of the equation yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag. Each time a vortex is shed, the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the <b>lateral</b> <b>velocity</b> fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the vortex is shed on alternate sides. As a result, The drag dipole would be expected to be twice the frequency of the lift dipole.|$|E
