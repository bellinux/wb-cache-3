5|$|A Cardiff Grand Opera Society {{ran from}} 1924 to 1934. It {{presented}} week-long annual seasons of popular operas including Faust, Carmen and Il trovatore, and <b>like</b> <b>its</b> predecessor was mainly an amateur body, with professional guest principals. Apart from the productions {{of these two}} enterprises, opera in Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was generally presented by visiting companies from England.|$|E
5|$|A {{new church}} was needed because the old church needed {{significant}} repair {{and also because}} the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself. <b>Like</b> <b>its</b> predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|A second {{forerunner of}} the Analytical Review was Paul Henry Maty's {{periodical}} A New Review (published 1782–86), which was likewise devoted to reviewing books and offering {{a summary of}} their contents. <b>Like</b> <b>its</b> successor, the New Review paid special attention to foreign literature and took {{a leading role in}} introducing German literature to the British public.|$|E

50|$|DeMille {{first used}} three-strip Technicolor in North West Mounted Police (1940). Audiences <b>liked</b> <b>its</b> highly {{saturated}} color, so DeMille made no further black-and-white features.|$|R
5|$|Altar 6 is a plain {{monument}} {{that was}} found in Group 21 together with Stela 10. <b>Like</b> <b>its</b> associated stela it had been moved from its original location in antiquity but was probably not moved far.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{specific}} {{studies have been}} done on the black catbird's feeding ecology, it is thought to be an omnivore, <b>like</b> <b>its</b> close relatives are. It is known to eat the fruits of Bursera simaruba and Ficus cotinifolia, two deciduous trees found in the Neotropics.|$|E
5|$|Bonded by Blood is an American thrash metal band, {{named after}} Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood. <b>Like</b> <b>its</b> labelmates Evile, Gama Bomb, and Municipal Waste, Bonded by Blood {{is part of}} the thrash metal revival movement.

5|$|Icewind Dale II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Black Isle Studios {{and published by}} Interplay Entertainment, released on August 27, 2002. <b>Like</b> <b>its</b> 2000 predecessor Icewind Dale, the game {{is set in the}} Forgotten Realms fantasy setting in the Icewind Dale region. The player assumes control of a group of mercenaries in a war between the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale and a coalition of persecuted races and religions.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures <b>like</b> <b>its</b> leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from}} the working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued that the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism came to the fore.|$|E
5|$|It {{can become}} quite bold and tame, much <b>like</b> <b>its</b> close relative, the pied currawong on the Australian mainland, {{especially}} in public parks and gardens where people make {{a habit of}} feeding it. Black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods, raiding orchards, seizing chickens from poultry yards, and entering barns in search of mice.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>its</b> art, Palmyra's {{architecture}} {{was influenced}} by the Greco-Roman style, while preserving local elements (best seen in the Temple of Bel). Enclosed by a massive wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's sanctuary plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the Second Temple, the sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of Ebla and Ugarit).|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>its</b> parent Jeep Wrangler, the Storm {{is first}} and {{foremost}} an airmobile, capable offroad and utility vehicle meant to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role, and can be outfitted with a machine gun or other weapons systems. When armed with a 105mm (4.1in) M40 recoilless rifle, the vehicle is uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood rather than in the perpendicular position required by most other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>its</b> {{predecessor}} Titan Quest, Immortal Throne is {{an action}} role-playing game where the player-created character navigates environments within the Ancient World: in Immortal Throne, the player begins by exploring locations like Rhodes and Epirus, {{before entering the}} Underworld and passing through supernatural locations such as the Styx and Elysium. Players progress through the story and different locations by completing quests from non-playable characters (NPCs) for various rewards, including money and experience points.|$|E

5000|$|... "I <b>liked</b> <b>its</b> austerity," [...] she said, [...] "and touches {{such as a}} faint {{suggestion}} of plainsong, which picked up the quasi-medieval notes in the text. It {{was hard to see}} why the composer had withdrawn it." ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>its</b> {{predecessor}} series, The Legend of Korra has a {{broad and}} active fandom, including on social media and at fan conventions. Most fans are young adults, according to The Escapist, but many are children and younger teenagers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>its</b> predecessor, Riven is a {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game played from a first-person perspective. The player explores immersive environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>its</b> predecessor, The Adventure of Link allows storing up {{to three}} games in the cartridge's memory. Once the game has been completed, {{selecting}} the corresponding file in the main menu allows starting a new game preserving the acquired experience levels, techniques, and magic spells (but no special items, Heart and Magic containers, or extra lives, which must be obtained again).|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of the Cuban macaw and its extinct Caribbean relatives. Gundlach reported that it vocalised loudly <b>like</b> <b>its</b> Central American relatives and that it lived in pairs or families. Its speech imitation abilities were reportedly inferior to those of other parrots. Nothing {{is known about}} its breeding habits or its eggs, but one reported nest was a hollow in a palm.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>like</b> <b>its</b> predecessor, XCOM: Enemy Unknown casts {{the player}} as the {{commander}} of an elite military organization.
