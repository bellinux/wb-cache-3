McMillin and Weaver {{did not have}} sufficient high-school credits to enter college and enrolled at Somerset High School for the 1916-17 year, playing with Red Roberts. [...] "I've got a boy under my wing down here in Texas who's a football-playing fool and I {{want him to go}} to Centre. I'd <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to get him in a high school up there, and away from his pool-playing pals in Texas." [...] wrote Myers to a man in Somerset.|$|E
2500|$|Aguirre {{describes}} the SEC as an agency created {{to protect the}} public from Wall Street, but now protects Wall Street from the public, and calls it a revolving door, where people move from SEC positions to highly lucrative positions on Wall Street and also in reverse. [...] "All the agencies have to some extent or another a revolving door [...] But at the SEC, what you rotate into is an enormous salary leap. SEC managers may make $200,000. That same person may make $2 million as a starting salary on the outside and can move up from there. Now, when he leaves, I'm not sure he's worth $2 million as a lawyer, but he takes his Rolodex with him and that Rolodex is gold. The system maintains itself, because those that stay know their turn will come if they play the game. They see a director or associate director move onto a $2 million job with a Wall Street law firm. Then, the departed employee calls back to his former colleagues and says, 'you know I really don't think there is much of a case against so-and-so, I'd <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{to take a look at}} it.' And the case goes away; the system goes on in perpetuity." [...] Two of Aguirre's supervisors left the SEC for lucrative positions at private law firms. Paul Berger works at Debevoise and Plimpton. After failing to investigate the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, Linda Chatman Thomsen left her position as SEC Enforcement Director to become a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, where according to the Wall Street Journal, she would be part of its [...] "white-collar defense group". Robert Khuzami, who succeeded her, worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan's Southern District of New York, then went to Deutsche Bank for several years before returning being named SEC Enforcement Director.|$|E

"Why, the Lord Keeper {{would have}} listened to reason," [...] said the Marquis; [...] "he is rather unwilling to leave his place, which, in the present view of a change, must be vacated; and, to say truth, {{he seemed to have}} a <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and to be {{sensible}} of the general advantages to be attained by such a match.

I have so much <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I do not mind owning that I wish that it were more. Mr. Gilmore, I like you so much that I would make a great sacrifice for you; but I cannot sacrifice my own honesty or your happiness by making believe that I love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ask me so many questions," [...] he murmured, [...] "and I {{tell you}} that I know nothing. I have asked you to come here with me because I had just this to say.

I can see now why you couldn't hit it off with the Family. Because I've seen 'em all! They're here! Yes, Uncle Donald and all of them. Is it a habit of your family to collect in gangs, or have I just happened to stumble into an accidental Old Home Week? When I came down to dinner the first evening, the drawing-room was full to bursting point--not simply because Fillmore was there, but because there were uncles and aunts all over the place. I felt like a small lion in a den of Daniels. I know exactly now what you mean about the Family. They look at you! Of course, it's all right for me, because I am snowy white clear through, but I can just imagine what {{it must have been}} <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> with your permanently guilty conscience. You must have had an awful time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} try if I were you.

I am sure you must have been a political, but now that you have been a wanderer you are so no longer. You have won the governor's good-will, and as soon as your time is up, perhaps before, you will be allowed to live outside the prison. If you go away in the spring you will, when you return as winter comes on, forfeit all this, and have to begin again. When you come out there will be my little hut ready for you, and such a welcome from my wife and me that you will forget how small and rough it is, and there you will live with us till your five years are up, and you can go anywhere you like in Siberia." ...|$|E
