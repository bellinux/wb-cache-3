40|$|We {{obtained}} {{quantitative information}} on <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> and leaf shedding by observing 45 speciesof cool temperate deciduous trees in an arboretum over 5 growing seasons. These trees were in leaf (the foliageperiod) for 207 days on average after 1 April; 50 % of leaves had been shed by 192 days after 1 April. Durationfrom {{the start of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> to 50 % leaf shedding was 157 days on average. <b>Leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> began 35 dayson average after 1 April. For <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> to begin, a 51 ℃․day of cumulated daily mean air temperature above 5 ℃ from 1 January (modified Kira's warmth index) was needed. Fifty-nine days elapsed between initiation andthe final stage of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding.</b> The period of net photosynthetic assimilation was 157 days. The species withsucceeding- type <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> associated with the anemochore seed type dominated the early stage ofsuccession, while the species with flush-type <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> tended to dominate the late stage of succession. Fewspecies were found in regions where late frosts occur after {{the day when the}} cumulative temperature for leafunfolding is achieved. Biological characteristics include time of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding,</b> which affects the life history of eachspecies, so that each species occupies its own niche in the stand. We conclude that that leaf phenology, suchas timing of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> and leaf shedding, is one of the components of each species' ecologicalcharacteristics...|$|E
40|$|With global warming, {{an advance}} in spring leaf {{phenology}} {{has been reported}} worldwide. However, {{it is difficult to}} forecast phenology for a given species, {{due to a lack of}} knowledge about chilling requirements. We quantified chilling and heat requirements for <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> in two European tree species and investigated their relative contributions to phenological variations between and within populations. We used an extensive database containing information about the leaf phenology of 14 oak and 10 beech populations monitored over elevation gradients since 2005. In parallel, we studied the various bud dormancy phases, in controlled conditions, by regularly sampling low- and high-elevation populations during fall and winter. Oak was 2. 3 times more sensitive to temperature for <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> over the elevation gradient and had a lower chilling requirement for dormancy release than beech. We found that chilling is currently insufficient for the full release of dormancy, for both species, at the lowest elevations in the area studied. Genetic variation in <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> timing between and within oak populations was probably due to differences in heat requirement rather than differences in chilling requirement. Our results demonstrate the importance of chilling for <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> in forest trees and indicate that the advance in <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> phenology with increasing temperature will probably be less pronounced than forecasted. This highlights the urgent need to determine experimentally the interactions between chilling and heat requirements in forest tree species, to improve our understanding and modeling of changes in phenological timing under global warming...|$|E

40|$|Earlier spring <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> is a {{frequently}} observed {{response of}} northern trees to climate warming 1, 2, 3, 4. Many deciduous tree species require chilling for dormancy release, and warming-related reductions in chilling may counteract {{the advance of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> in response to warming 5, 6. Empirical evidence for this, however, is limited to saplings or twigs in climate-controlled chambers 7, 8. Using long-term in situ observations of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> for seven dominant European tree species at 1, 245 sites, we show here that the apparent response of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> to climate warming (ST, expressed in days advance per °C) has significantly decreased from 1980 to 2013 in all monitored tree species. Averaged across all species and sites, ST decreased by 40 % from 4. 0 ± 1. 8 days °C- 1 during 1980 - 1994 to 2. 3 ± 1. 6 days °C- 1 during 1999 - 2013. The declining ST was also simulated by chilling-based phenology models, albeit with a weaker decline (24 %- 30 %) than observed in situ. The reduction in ST {{is likely to be}} partly attributable to reduced chilling. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may also play a role, such as ‘photoperiod limitation’ mechanisms that may become ultimately limiting when <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> dates occur too early in the season. Our results provide empirical evidence for a declining ST, but also suggest that the predicted strong winter warming in the future may further reduce ST and therefore result in a slowdown in the advance of tree spring phenology...|$|E

The classical concept of heat requirement (growing degree days) for <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> was developed hundreds of years ago, but this model does not include the recently reported greater importance of daytime than night-time temperature. - A manipulative experiment on daytime vs night-time warming with saplings of three species of temperate deciduous trees was conducted and a Bayesian method was applied to explore the different effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on spring phenology. - We found that both daytime and night-time warming significantly advanced <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding,</b> but the sensitivities to increased daytime and night-time temperatures differed significantly. Trees were most sensitive to daytime warming (7. 4 ± 0. 9, 4. 8 ± 0. 3 and 4. 8 ± 0. 2 d advancement per degree Celsius warming (d °C− 1) for birch, oak and beech, respectively) and least sensitive to night-time warming (5. 5 ± 0. 9, 3. 3 ± 0. 3 and 2. 1 ± 0. 9 d °C− 1).

This study aims to describe patterns of variation and co-variation of functional traits in a water-stressed tree population and test their relationships with performance traits. Within a Mediterranean population of Fagus sylvatica experiencing recurrent summer droughts, we investigated the phenotypic variation of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> phenology, leaf area (LA), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf water content (LWC), water use efficiency (WUE) estimated by carbon isotopic discrimination (d 13 C), twig Huber-value (HV: the stem cross-section divided by the leaf area distal to the stem), wood density (WDens), and leaf nitrogen content (Nmass). First, a principal component analysis revealed that two main axes structured the phenotypic variability: the first axis opposed <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding</b> earliness and LWC to LMA and WUE; the second axis opposed LA to HV. These two axes {{can be interpreted as}} the opposition of two strategies (water economy versus water uptake) at two distinct scales (leaf for the first axis and branches for the second axis).

The timing of spring phenological development plays a crucial role, not only at the species level, but also at the population and individual level, since fresh new leaves are especially vulnerable. For the pronounced late spring frost in May 2011 in Germany, we studied the individual leaf development of 35 deciduous trees (mainly European beech Fagus sylvatica L.) at a mountainous forest site in the Bayerischer Wald National Park using repeated digital photographs. Analyses of the time series of greenness by a novel Bayesian multiple change point approach mostly revealed five change points which almost perfectly matched the expected break points in leaf development: i) start of the first greening between DOY (day of the year) 108 to 119 (mean 113), ii) end of greening and iii) visible frost damage after the frost on the night of May 3 rd/ 4 th (DOY 123, 124), iv) re-sprouting 19 to 38 days after the frost, and v) full maturity around DOY 178 (166 to 184) when all beech crowns had fully recovered. Since frost damage was nearly 100 %, individual susceptibility did not depend on the timing of first spring <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding.</b> However, we could identify significant patterns in fitness linked to an earlier start of <b>leaf</b> <b>unfolding.</b> Those individuals that had an earlier start of greening during the first flushing period had a shorter period of recovery and started the second greening earlier.

When leaf area index is low, sub-optimal day temperatures decrease biomass production due to the formation of thicker leaves. Biomass produced up to flowering is highly variable and depends on cultivar and the interaction between temperature and other growing conditions. More research is required to determine whether differences in biomass produced between cultivars are related to differences in the duration of the cultivation period, growth rate, or both.
