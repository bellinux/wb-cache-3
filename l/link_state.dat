40|$|International audienceThis work {{studies the}} {{problems}} of feedback allocation and scheduling for a multichannel downlink cellular network under limited and delayed feedback. We consider a realistic scenario where a fixed and small number ¯ F of <b>link</b> <b>states</b> {{can be reported to}} the base-station (BS) per time-slot. We study the trade-off between knowing at the BS a small number of accurate <b>link</b> <b>states</b> (i. e. that can be reported within one time-slot) and a larger but outdated number of <b>link</b> <b>states</b> (i. e. number of <b>link</b> <b>states</b> > ¯ F that requires more than one slot to be reported). We propose an efficient algorithm that selects the <b>link</b> <b>states</b> that should be reported to the base-station. A novelty here is that this feedback allocation algorithm is performed at the users side. We show that this algorithm combined with the Max-Weight scheduling achieves at least a fraction η of the stability region achieved under the ideal system (i. e. with full and perfect feedback at no cost). We then provide numerical results that show the best aforementioned trade-off under various system setups...|$|R

25|$|Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing {{protocol}} for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a <b>link</b> <b>state</b> routing (LSR) algorithm and {{falls into the}} group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008).|$|E
25|$|An OSPF {{network is}} divided into areas that are logical groupings of hosts and networks. An area {{includes}} its connecting router having interfaces connected to the network. Each area maintains a separate <b>link</b> <b>state</b> database whose information may be summarized towards {{the rest of the}} network by the connecting router. Thus, the topology of an area is unknown outside the area. This reduces the routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system.|$|E
25|$|OSPF is an {{interior}} gateway protocol (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets solely within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers <b>link</b> <b>state</b> information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology {{is presented as a}} routing table to the Internet layer which routes packets based solely on their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.|$|E

40|$|The OSPF and IS-IS routing {{protocols}} {{widely used in}} today's Internet compute a shortest path tree (SPT) from each router to other routers in a routing area. Many existing commercial routers recompute an SPT from scratch following changes in the <b>link</b> <b>states</b> of the network. Such recomputation of an entire SPT is inecient and may consume {{a considerable amount of}} CPU time. Moreover, as there may coexist multiple SPTs in a network with a set of given <b>link</b> <b>states,</b> recomputation from scratch causes frequent unnecessary changes in the topology of an existing SPT and may lead to routing instability. In this paper, we present new dynamic SPT algorithms that make use {{of the structure of the}} previously computed SPT. Besides efficiency, our algorithm design objective is to achieve routing stability by making minimum changes to the topology of an existing SPT (while maintaining shortest path property) when some <b>link</b> <b>states</b> in the network have changed.

25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its <b>link</b> <b>state</b> database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E
2500|$|Exchange: In the Exchange state, {{a router}} is sending its <b>link</b> <b>state</b> {{database}} {{information to the}} adjacent neighbor. At this state, a router is able to exchange all OSPF routing protocol packets.|$|E
2500|$|Each OSPF router {{within a}} network {{communicates}} with other neighboring routers on each connecting interface {{to establish the}} states of all adjacencies. Every such communication sequence is a separate conversation identified by the pair of router IDs of the communicating neighbors. RFC 2328 specifies the protocol for initiating these conversations (Hello Protocol) and for establishing full adjacencies (Database Description Packets, <b>Link</b> <b>State</b> Request Packets). During its course, each router conversation transitions through a maximum of eight conditions defined by a state machine: ...|$|E

2500|$|OSPF {{supports}} complex networks {{with multiple}} routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple {{links to other}} subnets. Neighboring routers in the same broadcast domain or {{at each end of}} a point-to-point telecommunications communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form adjacencies when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a Hello protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a two-way state and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both unicast and multicast transmission modes to send [...] "Hello" [...] packets and <b>link</b> <b>state</b> updates.|$|E
2500|$|As a <b>link</b> <b>state</b> routing protocol, OSPF {{establishes}} {{and maintains}} neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an adjacency database. Two OSPF routers are neighbors {{if they are}} members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information – the only packets they exchange are Hello packets. [...] OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if {{at least one of them}} is Designated Router or Backup Designated Router (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.|$|E
