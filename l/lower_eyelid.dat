5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid</b> on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the eyes}} do not protrude, {{abnormalities}} in the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid</b> may give that impression. Surgery {{may be necessary}} if the eyes cannot close fully. In addition, the ears may be set low on the head or have a deformed pinna.|$|E

25|$|The eyelids {{of a bird}} are {{not used}} in blinking. Instead the eye is {{lubricated}} by the nictitating membrane, a third concealed eyelid that sweeps horizontally across the eye like a windscreen wiper. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds when they are under water. When sleeping, the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid</b> rises to cover the eye in most birds, {{with the exception of}} the horned owls where the upper eyelid is mobile.|$|E

25|$|The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular {{branches}} {{leave the}} skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory {{information from the}} scalp and forehead, the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including {{the tip of the}} nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid</b> and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches—the lingual nerve—carries sensation from the tongue.|$|E
25|$|If {{keratoconus}} is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid</b> when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E

60|$|During {{laughter}} {{the mouth}} is opened {{more or less}} widely, with the corners drawn much backwards, {{as well as a}} little upwards; and the upper lip is somewhat raised. The drawing back of the corners is best seen in moderate laughter, and especially in a broad smile-- the latter epithet showing how the mouth is widened. In the accompanying figs. 1-3, Plate III., different degrees of moderate laughter and smiling have been photographed. The figure of the little girl, with the hat is by Dr. Wallich, and the expression was a genuine one; the other two are by Mr. Rejlander. Dr. Duchenne repeatedly insists[9] that, under the emotion of joy, the mouth is acted on exclusively by the great zygomatic muscles, which serve to draw the corners backwards and upwards; but judging from {{the manner in which the}} upper teeth are always exposed during laughter and broad smiling, as well as from my own sensations, I cannot doubt that some of the muscles running to the upper lip are likewise brought into moderate action. The upper and lower orbicular muscles of the eyes are at the same time more or less contracted; and there is an intimate connection, as explained in the chapter on weeping, between the orbiculars, especially the lower ones and some of the muscles running to the upper lip. Henle remarks[10] on this head, that when a man closely shuts one eye he cannot avoid retracting the upper lip on the same side; conversely, if any one will place his finger on his <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid,</b> and then uncover his upper incisors as much as possible, he will feel, as his upper lip is drawn strongly upwards, that the muscles of the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid</b> contract. In Henle's drawing, given in woodcut, fig. 2, the musculus malaris (H) which runs to the upper lip may be seen to form an almost integral part of the lower orbicular muscle.|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{compare the}} {{distribution}} of eyelid basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with the relative ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure to different sites on the eyelids.  METHODS—The location of BCC on the eyelids was allocated to one of seven regions. The UVR exposure was recorded with a polymer film attached to the eyelids at seven sites in a manikin and in human subjects.  RESULTS—Localisation of the 329  tumours was mainly on the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelids</b> (225  tumours), and the medial canthal regions (87  tumours). There was no association between UVR doses at the seven sites of the eyelids {{and the location of}} BCCs.

60|$|The lady whose {{appearance}} had asserted {{a difference}} between herself and the Anglebury people, without too clearly showing what that difference was, passed out of the town {{in a few moments}} and, following the highway across meadows fed by the Froom, she crossed the railway and soon got into a lonely heath.

60|$|On the Toledo {{people keep}} upon the narrow sidewalks, or strike {{out into the}} carriage-way, with an {{indifference}} to hoofs and wheels which one, after long residence in tranquil Venice, cannot acquire, {{in view of the}} furious Neapolitan driving. That old comprehensive gig of Naples, with which many pens and pencils have familiarized the reader, is nearly as hard to find there now as the lazzaroni, who have gone out altogether. You may still see it in the remoter quarters of the city, with its complement of twelve passengers to one horse, distributed, two on each thill, four on the top seats, one at each side, and two behind; but in the Toledo it has given place to much finer vehicles. Slight buggies, which take you anywhere for half a franc, are the favorite means of public conveyance, and the private turn-outs are of every description and degree. Indeed, all the Neapolitans take to carriages, and the Strand in London at six o'clock in the evening is not a greater jam of wheels than the Toledo in the afternoon. Shopping feels the expansive influence of the out-of-doors life, and ladies do most of it as they sit in their open carriages at the shop-doors, ministered to by the neat-handed shopmen. They are very languid ladies, as they recline upon their carriage cushions; they are all black-eyed, and of an olive pallor, and have gloomy rings about their fine eyes, like the dark-faced dandies who bow to them. This Neapolitan look is very curious, and I have not seen it elsewhere in Italy; it is a look of peculiar pensiveness, and comes, no doubt, from the peculiarly heavy growth of lashes which fringes the <b>lower</b> <b>eyelid.</b> Then there is the weariness in it of all peoples whose summers are fierce and long.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{nomenclature}} of {{each part}} of the lacrimal canaliculus, for example the vertical portion, does not always reflect the true course. Since we have sometimes observed findings suggesting the so called vertical portion of the lower lacrimal canaliculus inclined laterally, we re-examined the course of the vertical portion. Twenty-eight postmortem <b>lower</b> <b>eyelids</b> in 16 Japanese were examined and divided into 2 groups. The first group was 14 <b>lower</b> <b>eyelids</b> of 7 cadavers. Eyelids were incised sagittally from the lower lacrimal punctum. The second group was 14 <b>lower</b> <b>eyelids</b> of 9 cadavers; these were incised from the lower lacrimal punctum with 5 degrees lateral inclination to the sagittal plane. In the first group, 10 canaliculi of 7 cadavers were interrupted at the halfway point of the vertical portion. Four canaliculi of 4 cadavers included the whole length of the vertical portion. In the second group, all specimens included the whole length of the vertical portion. Most vertical portions of the lower lacrimal canaliculus demonstrated a laterally inclined course of approximately 5 degrees, although some took a completely vertical course...|$|R
