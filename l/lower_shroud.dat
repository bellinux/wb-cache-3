40|$|An {{improved}} {{rotor assembly}} shroud includes {{at least one}} reinforcing flange on the upper surface of the shroud. The strength provided by the reinforcing flange allows for a smaller shroud thickness resulting in a net reduction of shroud mass. The <b>lower</b> <b>shroud</b> mass reduces the centrifugal stress on the rotor assembly blade during operation. The strength provided by the reinforcing flanges also significantly reduces the centrifugal bending stress on the shroud during operation. The shroud mass may be further reduced by tapering the shroud {{leading and trailing edges}} or, for shrouds incorporating a damper, by providing a damper cavity with a lower diameter surface defining an opening therethrough...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} structure of painted and unpainted aluminum alloy sheet {{samples from the}} TV camera shrouds were examined by high-voltage transmission electron microscopy. No clear-cut evidence of radiation damage effects was observed. Noticeable differences in microstructures between the upper visor and the sides {{and bottom of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>shroud</b> suggest different thermal histories, and the maximum temperatures due to solar heating are estimated to be between 164 and 319 C. Some correlation between microstructures and maximum estimated temperature is noted. It is felt that the apparent temperature rise due to solar heating will not affect the structural integrity of spacecraft components except possibly for very long periods of exposure. However, substantial thermal diffusion could affect interpretation of solar wind rare gas studies...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn existing apparatus for testing models of gas eductor systems using high temperature primary flow was modified to provide improved control and performance {{over a wide}} range of gas temperature and flow rates. Secondary flow pumping, temperature and pressure data were recorded for two gas eductor system models. The first, previously tested under hot flow conditions, consists of a primary plate with four tilted-angled nozzles and a slotted, shrouded mixing stack with two diffuser rings (overall L/D = 1. 5). The second consisted of the same nozzles and mixing stack, with a modified shroud and three diffuser rings (overall L/D = 1. 5). A portable pyrometer with a surface probe was used for the second model in order to identify any hot spots at the external surface of the mixing stack, shroud and diffuser rings. The second model is shown to have almost the same mixing and pumping performance with the first one but to exhibit much <b>lower</b> <b>shroud</b> and diffuser surface temperatures.

50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century the futtock band was introduced, being a metal collar fitted to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the futtock shrouds is {{attached}}. Before this the futtock shrouds were attached to the <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard shrouds.|$|R

40|$|NASA s Space Environment Simulation Laboratory s (SESL) Chamber A, {{located at}} the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas has {{recently}} implemented major enhancements of its cryogenic and vacuum systems. The new liquid nitrogen (LN) thermo-siphon system was successfully commissioned in August of 2012. Chamber A, which has 20 K helium cryo-panels (or shrouds) which are shielded by 80 K nitrogen shrouds, is capable of simulating a deep space environment necessary to perform ground testing of NASA s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Chamber A s previous system used forced flow LN cooling with centrifugal pumps, requiring 220, 000 liters of LN to cool-down and consuming 180, 000 liters per day of LN in steady operation. The LN system {{did not have the}} reliability required to meet the long duration test of the JWST, and the cost estimate provided in the initial approach to NASA-JSC by the subcontractor for refurbishment of the system to meet the reliability goals was prohibitive. At NASA-JSC s request, the JLab Cryogenics Group provided alternative options in 2007, including a thermo-siphon, or natural flow system. This system, eliminated the need for pumps and used one tenth of the original control valves, relief valves, and burst disks. After the thermo-siphon approach was selected, JLab provided technical assistance in the process design, mechanical design, component specification development and commissioning oversight, while the installation and commissioning operations of the system was overseen by the Jacobs Technology/ESC group at JSC. The preliminary commissioning data indicate <b>lower</b> <b>shroud</b> temperatures, 68, 000 liters to cool-down and less than 91, 000 liters per day consumed in steady operation. All of the performance capabilities have exceeded the design goals. This paper will outline the comparison between the original system and the predicted results of the selected design option, and the commissioning results of thermo-siphon system...|$|E
5000|$|Futtock shrouds are rope, wire or {{chain links}} in the rigging of a {{traditional}} square rigged ship. They run from the outer edges of a top downwards and inwards to a point on the mast or <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds,</b> and carry the load of the shrouds that rise {{from the edge of}} the top. This prevents any tendency of the top itself to tilt relative to the mast.|$|R
50|$|Most fore-and-aft rigged vessels {{have the}} {{following}} types of standing rigging: a forestay, a backstay, and upper and <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> (side stays).Less common rigging configurations are diamond stays and jumpers. Both {{of these are}} used to keep a thin mast in column especially under the load of a large down wind sail or in strong wind.Rigging parts include swageless terminals, swage terminals, shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators.|$|R
50|$|The mast is {{a sealed}} section with a halyard running inside the track {{to help prevent}} {{inversion}} on capsize. The mast has single spreaders and <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> to allow adjustment for different helms and conditions. The forestay is adjustable to allow depowering {{in conjunction with a}} cascade style kicker. A pivoting centreboard and rudder are made of moulded glass fibre construction. The laminate sails are available in two cuts to suit different sailors.|$|R

5000|$|The {{aluminum}} mast has {{a single}} set of spreaders, and is supported by 1x19 standing rigging. Originally the boats had double <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds,</b> but many have been converted to single lowers to allow the mast to bend more when racing. The rig is described as 15/16ths, meaning that the jibstay attaches about 18" [...] below the masthead. This increases {{the power of the}} adjustable backstay to control the bend of the mast, and therefore the fullness of the mainsail. While the mast and boom were sourced from a number of companies, most of the later boats had spars from Ballenger Spars http://www.ballengerspars.com/, a local sparbuilder.|$|R
50|$|The mast {{rises from}} the deck 14.5 ft aft of the bow. Four shrouds are {{on each side of}} the mast, two <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> for fore and aft {{adjustment}} of mast prebend, plus the upper and intermediate shrouds to keep the mast straight. There are two pairs of spreaders. The standard mast is 45 ft tall off the deck, however a taller mast option was also offered. There is a perforated toe rail running along the deck and hull joint, and a genoa car track set well inboard. Teak handrails and cabin side teak eyebrow trim pieces are mounted on the raised cabin roof.|$|R
50|$|The Nordic Folkboat, as {{initially}} designed, {{is constructed}} of {{wood in the}} clinker or lap-strake method of boat building. The boat {{was designed to be}} built with oak framing and fir planking, although different builders used many different species of wood. The boat has an open cockpit and a low coachroof covering a small cabin usually consisting of two bunks and minimal storage furniture. The boat is rigged as a simple fractional sloop, with minimal standing rigging, consisting only of two <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds,</b> two jumper shrouds, a headstay, and a backstay. Despite the simplicity of the rigging, the mast is highly tunable, enabling the Folkboat to sail well in light and heavy air well beyond initial expectations.|$|R
25|$|The hull is of {{conventional}} glassfibre construction, {{with a strong}} layup conforming to Lloyd's standards. The two tonnes of lead ballast is encapsulated in the hull, obviating the need for keel bolts. The hull is joined to the deck by a large bulwark, topped with a teak caprail. Unusually, the deck has no balsa core, instead using solid glassfibre construction. Although this makes for greater longevity of the hull {{as there is no}} core to rot or delaminate, a slight 'flex' can sometimes be felt. The mast is keel stepped, and is supported by double <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> for greater redundancy. The standing rigging terminates at U-bolts in the deck. Although this type of chainplate is sometimes criticised, there is no recorded instance of a dismasting, and Rogers claims reinforcing this system would have no impact on safety. It has the benefit of simplicity and low cost.|$|R
50|$|Second {{important}} {{innovation is}} the mast folding system. The mast {{can be raised}} or lowered by a single person controlling a single line run from the mast base {{to one of the}} genoa sheet winches. The mast is supported during the raising and lowering process by a set of metal A-frames, one set of which doubles as the <b>lower</b> aft <b>shrouds</b> when the mast is raised. The whole system does not require any adjustment to be made to the standing rigging.|$|R
25|$|While {{cruising}} in {{the company}} of the 36-gun , on 16 April 1797, Pearl helped capture the 24-gun privateer, Incroyable. In March 1798, she sailed for the Leeward Islands via West Africa where on 24 April, she escaped from two French frigates. While passing through the Îles de Los, an archipelago off the coast of Guinea, Pearl discovered an enemy squadron comprising 4 large ships at anchor and a brig under sail. As she approached one of the French frigates hoisted her colours and opened fire. Forced to run between two frigates, Pearl engaged both as she passed then hove to, continuing to fire for a further hour before making off with one, or possibly both frigates in pursuit. The chase continued through the night and all through the following day before Pearl managed to escape, and arrived at Sierra Leone on 27 April, where she was inspected for damage. She had been holed in several places, although all were above the waterline; her foretopgallant yard and fore yard had been shot away and a number of <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds</b> and other rigging had been cut through. In addition two of her carronades had been dismounted, causing the death of one man.|$|R
50|$|The Baba 30 {{is made of}} a solid GRP (glass {{reinforced}} plastic) hull moulded with plank {{lines to}} give {{the effect of a}} timber hull. Alternating layers of 1.5oz Mat and 24 ounce woven roving were used in the hull's construction, six layers of this were used on most of the hull but 10 - 12 layers were used around the keel. It has a full keel with a cutaway forefoot. The keel contains encapsulated iron ballast. It also has a long rudder with a cutaway for the propeller. The boat has a canoe shaped sternThe deck is cored fibreglass and is usually covered in extensive teak. The coachroof is treated the same.The first Babas were supplied with wooden spars but many of the boats have since been upgraded to aluminium mast and boom. Early Babas had no <b>lower</b> <b>shrouds,</b> but these were soon added after a dismasting.The rig is a traditional cutter style and a characteristic feature of many of Robert Perry's boats from this stable is a 4 ft laminated teak bowsprit which supports the forestay/headsail. A large platform sits on the bowsprit supporting two anchor rollers, a set-up typical on many long distance cruisers where two anchors are desirable in many exposed anchorages.Most Babas are fitted with Edson or similar wheel steering systems, however a few tiller steered versions exist.|$|R

5000|$|The Channel Fleet {{played an}} {{important}} role in the closing stages of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, when Howe moved out into the Atlantic in the hope of intercepting an approaching French convoy under Admiral Pierre Jean Van Stabel. The main French battlefleet was also known to be at sea, under Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse. Howe sent Pasley, recently promoted to rear-admiral, and his flying squadron, consisting of Bellerophon and the 74-gun ships , [...] and , ahead to scout for French forces. At 6 am on 28 May the attached frigate [...] signalled Bellerophon to report a sighting of a strange fleet. Pasley took the squadron south-east to investigate, coming in sight of a large fleet at 9 am, and counting thirty-three ships, of which at least twenty-three appeared to be ships of the line. They were confirmed as French by noon, and Pasley signalled this news back to Howe. Howe ordered a pursuit, and by evening the leading British ships, with Pasley's flying squadron forming the van, came in contact with the rear-most French. Bellerophon was the first ship to come into action, when the 110-gun Révolutionnaire dropped back to block her approach. Pasley tacked to close the French ship and began exchanging broadsides. [...] The heavy fire of the larger French ship caused considerable damage, particularly to Bellerophons main topmast, and she fought alone until the remainder of the flying squadron and two ships from the main fleet, [...] and , arrived to assist her. The damaged Bellerophon then drifted clear of the action, and as night fell Howe signalled for the fleet to reform in line ahead and wait for morning before resuming the engagement.The action resumed the following morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line.
