5|$|In the 1970s, {{parts of}} the covertway and glacis were {{destroyed}} {{to make way for}} <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. Today, the lines are still more or less intact, but some parts are in a rather dilapidated state and in need of restoration.|$|E
5|$|Floating {{storage and}} {{offloading}} units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and store {{it until it}} can be offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), {{has the ability to}} process the product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> capacity, and production versatility.|$|E

5|$|At the 1909 opening, 35miles (56kilometres) {{of track}} had been {{completed}} with electricity supplied by the Electric Lighting and Supply Co. The electric tram system ran on 600Volts DC supplied at first from two converter stations, No.1 converter station on East Terrace with 2,500kW of AC to DC capacity and No.2 station at Thebarton with a capacity of 900kW. To cope with variable loads on the system, very <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> lead–acid batteries were installed, the initial one at East Terrace comprising 293 cells and a 50ton tank of sulphuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Naval and {{defensive}} technology continued to improve {{over the next}} few decades, rendering Tilbury Fort's bastion design out-moded. The government considered the defences further down the Thames to be sufficient and Tilbury was therefore not improved; it was largely redundant as a defensive fortification {{by the end of the}} century, although still in use as a strategic depot. From 1889 onwards it formed a mobilisation centre to support a mobile strike force in the event of an invasion, part of the wider London Defence Scheme, and <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> buildings were built across the site to store materiel.|$|E
5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} season premiere, filming {{of the show}} moved from Desilu Cahuenga, in Hollywood, California, to CBS Studio Center, in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. Tom Azzari worked as set {{designer}} during season two; he often re-used sets from the first season, because Castle Rock Entertainment had rented a <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> facility in which sets were stored, to save money. Although the scenes in Monk's Cafe were filmed at CBS Studio Center, the exterior of Tom's Restaurant, a diner {{at the intersection of}} Broadway and 112th Street in Manhattan, was used as the exterior for the cafe. The second season of Seinfeld was supposed to start airing on January 16, 1991, but the premiere was postponed one week because of the commencement of the first Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|The {{first level}} of the {{building}} contains two classrooms, {{both of which have}} a cloakroom, a set of three swivel doors, and a large slate chalkboard that covers one of the walls. The first story also contains two bathrooms, four small storage closets, and a central hall, as well as a large stairwell leading up to the second floor. The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small storage rooms. A metal fire escape door is located {{in the center of the}} west wall of the second story. The schoolhouse also has a partial basement, which contains a <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the most}} widely used current {{applications}} of refrigeration are for air conditioning of private homes and public buildings, and refrigerating foodstuffs in homes, restaurants and <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> warehouses. The use of refrigerators in kitchens for storing fruits and vegetables has allowed adding fresh salads to the modern diet year round, and storing fish and meats safely for long periods.|$|E
25|$|As {{hard drive}} prices have fallen, storage farms {{have tended to}} {{increase}} in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.|$|E

50|$|Because high orbit {{curvature}}s (low curvature radii) {{increase the}} emission of synchrotron radiation, damping rings are often small.

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{economy of}} the Basotho in Lesotho is based on rearing cattle. They practise a seasonal migration between valley and high plateaus of the Maloti (basalt mountains of Lesotho). Pressure on pasture land has increased due to increases in population, as well as construction of <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> dams in these mountains to provide water to South Africa's arid industrial heartland. Growing pressure on pastures is contributing to degradation of sensitive grasslands and could contribute to sedimentation in man-made lakes.|$|E

The Railway Construction and Maintenance Group departed the UK in January 1941. The Group arrived in the Middle East in March that year.|$|E
25|$|Hydropower {{currently}} {{accounts for}} approximately 21% {{of the current}} electricity supply in Ontario. This capacity is estimated to rise to 30% by 2025 as new sites {{are added to the}} current installed capacity and the existing ones are refurbished. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing hydroelectric plants with <b>large</b> <b>storage</b> capacities {{that can be used to}} provide dispatchable energy, which are equally capable of meeting peak electricity demand or offsetting the intermittent nature of other renewable sources such as wind.|$|E
