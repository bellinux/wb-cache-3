25|$|Within {{days of his}} {{confession}} in open court, Heirens denied any responsibility for the murders. Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. He just does not fit into the picture of my mother's death... I have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the things Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England {{started its}} {{periodic}} structural reviews and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> administrative areas {{on an individual}} basis. Leominster District Council proposed a boundary change at Burford, near Tenbury Wells to incorporate the area into Hereford & Worcester from Shropshire during 1987/1988. This proposal {{was rejected by the}} LGBCE as well as a minor adjustment at Upper Arley. The commission also investigated splitting Hereford & Worcester in 1990, following submissions by Hereford City Council and the [...] "Herefordshire Action Committee", although the proposals were rejected at that time. Boundary changes between Hereford & Worcester and Warwickshire at Mappleborough Green, Pebworth, Long Marston and Studley were also proposed, and some were accepted resulting in minor changes to both counties. In 1993 there were more minor adjustments of the county boundary, this time between Bromsgrove and Dudley Metropolitan Borough near to Wollescote and Solihull Metropolitan Borough near Hockley Heath.|$|E

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E
500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one thing I noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} episode, Lieberstein said {{he sought to}} appeal to {{newcomers}} to the series and attract them to the show, without alienating regular The Office watchers: [...] "We {{wanted to do a}} stand-alone comedy episode that could bring people in." [...] Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, [...] "It almost had an air of a pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. We wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front." [...] The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I feel that a comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs." [...] Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, [...] "It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Continuing to {{experiment}} with plastics, [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> kinds of plastic: clear, different thickness, some milky. I also liked {{it because it was}} so big, so flexible, so easy to store, and so cheap." [...] Experimenting with layering, Lowe used plastic as his canvas, drawing with black and color markers to create a transparent yet uniformed design upon the plastic. His simple minimalistic works represented the concepts of transparency, pictorial depth, surface and illusion, reminiscent of works by Dorothea Rockburne.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Chabon, in his {{afterword}} to his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, {{a fictional}} account of two early comics pioneers, wrote, [...] "I want {{to acknowledge the}} deep debt I owe in this and everything else I've ever written {{to the work of}} the late Jack Kirby, the King of Comics." [...] Director James Cameron said Kirby inspired the look of his film Aliens, calling it [...] "not intentional in the sense I sat down and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> my favorite comics and studied them for this film, but, yeah, Kirby's work was definitely in my subconscious programming. The guy was a visionary. Absolutely. And he could draw machines like nobody's business. He was sort of like A. E. van Vogt and some of these other science-fiction writers who are able to create worlds that— even though we live in a science-fictionary world today— are still so far beyond what we're experiencing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|Younge and Muhammad <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of the {{different}} sounds of Harlem, including hip-hop, jazz, blues, and psychedelic rock, to give each character [...] "their own theme and their own sound" [...] that was all still representative of the culture. For Luke Cage specifically, Coker noted {{that he is a}} character who understands the roots of the modern culture, and understands where modern Harlem and hip-hop sensibilities originated, so Younge and Muhammad looked to the beginnings of modern hip-hop for his sound. For Cage's more dramatic or emotional moments, vocalist Loren Oden was used as [...] "kind of like [...] inner voice". For the character of Diamondback, opera singer Brooke deRosa, whom Younge had often worked with before, was used. To reflect the character Cottonmouth's status in the series as a musician who primarily plays the Fender Rhodes, the composers [...] "pretty much exclusively use Fender Rhodes keyboards for him. That is who he is." [...] The most difficult episode for the composers was the fourth, which features flashbacks to Cage's time in prison. They felt that the episode's temp music was [...] "all over the place, and it didn’t feel cohesive", and were unsure whether to illustrate the idea of an incarcerated black man using [...] "old slave-blues-type" [...] music, to go with a [...] "Bernard Herrmann–Alfred Hitchcock-type scary vibe", or to stick with [...] "straight hip-hop, '90s stuff". Younge offered that there was [...] "some intense thinking, but it wasn’t necessarily difficult to execute once we figured it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCreight knew many of {{the great}} Native American chiefs whose {{personal}} adornments filled The Wigwam, {{many of whom had}} been visitors to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and he spoke of their stories with great eloquence, esteem and kinship. Plenty Coups, Grand Chief of the Crows, was an occasional visitor to The Wigwam during President Warren G. Harding’s term. [...] “The tall and dignified Chief took a lively interest in looking over the collection of Indian relics at the Wigwam.” “Flying Hawk related a time when he and Iron Tail spent an evening in the Indian room of the Wigwam going over all of the items there including pipes, war bonnets, moccasins, and other paraphernalia once belonging to Wanata, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull and other of their old-time friends. He said that Iron Tail told him it made him sad when he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> these things.” Chief Flying Hawk contributed his personal adornments and possessions to McCreight’s collection. [...] “When my brother Kicking Bear died he was put in a grave on a hill. [...] All his things are put in a grave with him. [...] I will see his son, Kicking Bear, if they will let us dig open the grave and take out the arrow-head and send it to this wigwam to put along with my things.” [...] When Chief Flying Hawk passed to the “Sand Hills” on December 30, 1930, McCreight expressed his kinship and esteem with a public announcement and exhibit in the Du Bois Public Library displaying chief Flying Hawk’s beaded jacket, pouch and pipe. Chief Flying Hawk was well known to the people of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and McCreight remarked, “The schools are much interested in the exhibit as well as others of the town who had met him on other occasions.” [...] In his later years, McCreight attempted to donate the collection to museums, but without any success. McCreight cared for these national heritage treasures in The Wigwam until his death at the age of 94 in 1958. After his death, McCreight's Native American Collection at The Wigwam was sold and is now with private collectors and museums around the world.|$|E
