5000|$|Many of Kerala's export-based {{industries}} that use Kochi port to route their shipments can grow considerably if they tap {{the potential of}} the State's inland water transport system. Kochi port is connected to Kerala's hinterland through inland waterways which run virtually parallel to the Arabian Sea and link major trading centres. [...] Future potentiality of business improves with improvements in external and internal factors. International Container Trans-shipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam at Cochin Coast is one of such external factor which will create lot of future potential for IWAI in Kerala. The expectations from ICTT are to attract more international cargo movement through India and to reduce the freight cost of India’s international trade. IWAI has already taken steps to utilize such opportunity. Two special terminals, which support the interchange of containers by LO-LO (<b>Lift</b> <b>On,</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Off)</b> and RO-RO (Roll On, Roll Off) barges, are constructed on NW3, near Kochi port.Traffic will, in all likelihood, come to a halt in Kochi when hundreds of container-laden lorries take to the city roads and highways when the Vallarpadam container transhipment terminal becomes functional.Presuming that a container will be loaded and another one unloaded every minute, 2,880 lorries will pass through Kochi’s highways daily. It is proposed to be given to transport the containers in vessels passing through the National Waterway III,” he said.A number of industrial plants on the banks of Udyogamandal Canal, where the public sector FACT and Travancore Cochin Chemicals (TCC) are located. Though waterways are the cheapest, safest and most eco-friendly mode of transport, many of the navigable canals in Kochi are now being used to dump waste from households, shops and markets. Many houses and businesses have encroached on these canals, narrowing them. Bridges such as the one at Kaloor are low-level, hampering the safe passage of boats. This calls for concerted efforts by agencies such as the Inland Waterways Authority of India, the KSINC and the Irrigation and Fisheries departments.|$|E

In Italy over 80 % of freight travels by road, despite the country’s 7400 -km coastline which is particularly suited to short-sea shipping. The ports are organized as freight interchange centres: they are equipped to integrate with road transport for the initial and final links, and use sea and rail routes for long distances.
