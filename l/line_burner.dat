40|$|An {{experimental}} study of water mist fire suppression in a buoyant, turbulent diffusion flame is presented. An existing turbulent <b>line</b> <b>burner</b> facility was modified to allow for water mist suppression. These modifications include streamlining the oxidizer delivery system, facility improvements to increase mist generation efficiency, {{as well as the}} addition of a mist containment system and an enhanced exhaust flow to homogenize the water mist in the flame region and reduce secondary flows. Following these improvements, the capabilities of the water mist generation system were characterized both using a classical mass balance approach and using more modern advanced diagnostic techniques. The turbulent <b>line</b> <b>burner</b> facility fitted with the water mist improvements were applied to suppress a 50 kW methane flame. Species-based calorimetry was used to evaluate the global heat release rate and combustion efficiency to evaluate suppression behavior. Detailed local measurements of flame temperature were also performed and provide a useful data set for the evaluation of flame suppression response and for the validation of CFD fire models...|$|E

50|$|The {{pressure}} {{necessary to}} force the fuel through the <b>line</b> to the <b>burner</b> may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or {{by the introduction of}} an inert gas such as nitrogen. Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather flying. Warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.|$|R

40|$|Combustion {{tests of}} two scaled burners using actual coal gas from a 25 ton/day {{fluidized}} bed coal gasifier are described. The two combustor configurations studied were a ceramic <b>lined,</b> staged rich/lean <b>burner</b> and an integral, all metal multiannual swirl burner (MASB). The {{tests were conducted}} over a range of temperature and pressures representative of current industrial combustion turbine inlet conditions. Tests on the rich lean burner were conducted at three levels of product gas heating values: 104, 197 and 254 btu/scf. Corresponding levels of NOx emissions were 5, 20 and 70 ppmv. Nitrogen {{was added to the}} fuel in the form of ammonia, and conversion efficiencies of fuel nitrogen to NOx were on the order of 4 percent to 12 percent, which is somewhat lower than the 14 percent to 18 percent conversion efficiency when src- 2 liquid fuel was used. The MASB was tested only on medium btu gas (220 to 270 btu/scf), and produced approximately 80 ppmv NOx at rated engine conditions. Both burners operated similarly on actual coal gas and erbs fuel, and all heating values tested can be successfully burned in current machines...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} of perforated panels {{placed in the}} injection line of a turbulent swirled burner is investigated as a passive control solution for combustion instabilities. Perforated panels backed by a cavity are widely used as acoustic liners, mostly in the hot gas region of combustion chambers to reduce pure tone noises. This paper focuses on the implementation of this technology in the injection <b>line</b> of a <b>burner.</b> The system is used to control the inlet acoustic reﬂection coefficient of the burner to stabilize the combustion. This method is shown to be particularly efficient because high acoustic ﬂuxes issued from the combustion region are concentrated on a small surface area in the injection line. Theoretical results are used to design two types of perforated plates featuring similar acoustic damping properties when submitted to low amplitude pressure ﬂuctuations (linear regime). Their behaviors nonetheless largely differ when facing large pressure ﬂuctuations levels (non linear regime) typical of those encountered during self-sustained combustion oscillations. Design criteria are given to control the reﬂection coefficient of perforated panels submitted to high pressure ﬂuctuations levels and damp thermo-acoustic oscillations. While developed on a labora- tory scale swirled combustor, this method is more general and could easily be adapted to practical combustors...|$|R
40|$|Current {{scenario}} of energy insecurity urges us {{to realize the}} importance of alternate energy sources. In country with variety of vegetation like India, Biomass finds its place of which fluidized bed gasification of biomass could be more effective. This paper emphasizes the importance of a fluidized bed gasifier for energy conversion of agro-residues for useful purposes. Coconut Shell and Ground nut shell of gross calorific value 19. 43 MJ/kg and 14. 91 MJ/kg respectively are taken for the study. The particle size is restricted not to exceed 3 mm. Various empirical correlations involved in fluidization are studied and their interdependence is detailed. From various published data, importance of inert materials and their relative proportions with biomass fuels are studied and optimum biomass to sand ratio is fixed as 10 to 15 % by mass. Equations for predicting the minimum fluidization velocities of these mixtures are also discussed. Variations of Fluidization parameters such asminimum fluidization velocity, bubble rise velocity, expanded bed height with respect to temperature, equivalence ratio, particle size is studied and their quantification is analyzed. A 108 mm internal diameter and 1400 mm high FBG is used for the study. Fuel is fed through screw feeder and air is supplied through blower. In the down stream side cyclone separator is placed after which the sampling and <b>burner</b> <b>lines</b> are connected. A regression model is developed and the feasibility of gasifying coconut shell and groundnut shell are discussed. Earlier and present work of coconut shell gasification proves fluidized bed gasification is more appropriate for agro residues...|$|R
40|$|One of the IM tests {{described}} in STANAG 4439 is the Fast Cook-off (FCO) test. The Liquid Fuel or External Fire, Munition Test Procedures is {{described in}} STANAG 4240 : “The objective of the selected fuel fire test is {{the determination of the}} reaction and time to reaction of the munition(s) when subjected to a liquid fuel fire environment”. However, {{there is a lot of}} discussion about this typical test. The drawback of the fuel fire test is the pollution of the environment during burning, as a result of the soot and many other substances in the fuel. Therefor a group of international experts is evaluating the use of propane as an alternate fuel for the Fast Heating Test Procedure identified in STANAG 4240 during a series of Fuel Fire Expert meetings (FFE). In the Netherlands the number of polluting large fuel fire test per year is limited but also the performance of the Dutch small fuel fire test leads to pollution and gives an undesirable situation. This is the reason that, in cooperation with the Knowledge Center of Weapons & Munitions of the Dutch MoD, also TNO has developed and tested a clean FCO test setup, based on propane. In the last IMEMTS conference the set-up was described and the results of several tests series, including a calibrating test series in co-operations with the US laboratories NSWC and NAWC, was presented. Since then, the set-up has been improved with respect to safety and several tests series have been performed to increase the hearth of the fire and improve the temperature distribution over the hearth. Also the heating of none cylindrical items such as munition boxes has been improved. The gas flow of the set-up is now remote controlled for safety reasons during live munition testing. The number of burners has been increased, up to 24 burners can now be used. Four relative expensive piezo-burners are used for ignition while the other have replace by cheaper burners without piezo-igniters. Also, the set-up of the burners has been changed; two <b>lines</b> of <b>burners</b> per side have been made, one pointing on the bottom of the tested item and one somewhere around the middle. This increases the hearth of the fire and the improves temperature distribution around the item. Now up to 10 cm below and above the test item, the temperatures are well above the 800 °C. One of the main advantages of this set-up is that burning is so clean that the fire is totally transparent and all items can be filmed during testing. With the new set-up and with the small fuel fire test a series of tests with live munitions has been performed. The results of the pre-test with the mock-ups, the results and comparison of the two tests series with live munition as well as the lessons learned from these tests series will be presented in this paper...|$|R
