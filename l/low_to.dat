5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Magda {{originated}} from a tropical low that was first {{identified by the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) on 18 January 2010 near the Indonesian island of Roti. Initially situated in a weak steering environment, the low drifted towards the southwest and gradually gained intensity. The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the system. Throughout 19 January, a developing low-level circulation showed improved organisation, feature deep convection over its centre. Atmospheric conditions in the region favoured further development, featuring <b>low</b> <b>to</b> moderate wind shear. A trough situated near the coast of Western Australia aided in improving the low's outflow. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system; they expected the <b>low</b> <b>to</b> intensify into a tropical cyclone within the following 24hours.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 27. As it moved west into the Atlantic, it became more organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level <b>low</b> <b>to</b> the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center's forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4.|$|E
5|$|According to RSMC New Delhi, Cyclone Agni {{developed}} into a depression at 1.5°N, {{which is the same}} latitude as where according to RSMC Tokyo, Tropical Storm Vamei formed during December 2001.
