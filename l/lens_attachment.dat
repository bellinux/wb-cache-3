40|$|We {{propose a}} concept for a <b>lens</b> <b>attachment</b> that turns a {{standard}} DSLR camera and lens into a light field camera. The attachment consists of 8 low-resolution, low-quality side cameras arranged around the central high-quality SLR lens. Unlike most existing light field camera architectures, this design provides a high-quality 2 D image mode, while simultaneously enabling a new high-quality light field mode {{with a large}} camera baseline but little added weight, cost, or bulk compared with the base DSLR camera. From an algorithmic point of view, the high-quality light field mode is {{made possible by a}} new light field super-resolution method that first improves the spatial resolution and image quality of the side cameras and then interpolates additional views as needed. At the heart of this process is a super-resolution method that we call iterative Patch- And Depth-based Synthesis (iPADS), which combines patch-based and depth-based synthesis in a novel fashion. Experimental results obtained for both real captured data and synthetic data confirm that our method achieves substantial improvements in super-resolution for side-view images as well as the high-quality and view-coherent rendering of dense and high-resolution light fields...|$|E

40|$|Flagella and pili are {{appendages}} that modulate attachment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to solid surfaces. However, {{previous studies}} have mostly reported absolute attachment. Neither the dynamic roles of these appendages in surface association nor those of attachment phenotypes have been quantified. We used video microscopy to address this issue. Unworn, sterile, soft contact lenses were placed in a laminar-flow optical chamber. Initial lens association kinetics for P. aeruginosa strain PAK were assessed in addition to lens-surface association phenotypes. Comparisons were made to strains with mutations in flagellin (fliC) or pilin (pilA) or those in flagellum (motAB) or pilus (pilU) function. PAK and its mutants associated with the contact lens surface at a constant rate according to first-order kinetics. Nonswimming mutants associated ∼ 30 to 40 times slower than the wild type. PAK and its pilA mutant associated at similar rates, but each ∼ 4 {{times faster than the}} pilU mutant. <b>Lens</b> <b>attachment</b> by wild-type PAK induced multiple phenotypes (static, lateral, and rotational surface movement), each showing only minor detachment. Flagellin (fliC) and flagellar-motility (motAB) mutants did not exhibit surface rotation. Conversely, strains with mutations in pilin (pilA) and pilus retraction (pilU) lacked lateral-surface movement but displayed enhanced surface rotation. Slower surface association of swimming-incapable P. aeruginosa mutants was ascribed to lower convective-diffusion-arrival rates, not to an inability to adhere. Flagellum function (swimming) enhanced lens association, attachment, and rotation; hyperpiliation hindered lens association. P. aeruginosa bound through three different adhesion sites: flagellum, pili, and body. Reduction of bacterial attachment to contact lenses thus requires blockage of multiple adhesion phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} an {{introduction}} to the use of Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) to assess the response to closed-cell PVC structural foams from damage sustained during service in a marine environment. The effects of damage were accelerated by hygrothermal ageing at a temperature of 60 ºC in distilled water. The CTS-type foam specimens contained a scalpel induced ‘edge-crack’ which were loaded at 0 º, 10 º, 30 º, 45 º, 60 º, 80 º and 90 º to obtain fracture toughness properties. A correlation was observed between increasing foam density and resistance to moisture uptake, with moisture acting as a plasticizer replacing that which has been leached away during immersion. After exposure to moisture specimens exhibited increased brittleness with significant reductions in energy to fracture. Linear foams were found to absorb almost twice the moisture of a cross-linked equivalent, and experience the greatest change in energy to fracture, most notably in shear, the most vulnerable loading mode for a sandwich structure. A CEDIP ‘Silver’ infrared system comprising an array of 320 x 240 detectors was used to perform TSA and evaluate the effects of fracture damage. The system recording capability allows crack propagation to be captured in real-time. The thermoelastic signal data at the crack-tip was related to stress using a calibration constant obtained from a specimen in its aged or unaged states when loaded with a known uniform stress. In addition, a high-resolution <b>lens</b> <b>attachment</b> allowed the cellular response to a crack-tip to be magnified, revealing the complex stress distribution on the thin struts around individual foam cells...|$|E
40|$|In this {{supplementary}} material, {{we present}} additional re-sults {{of the experiments}} shown in the main paper. As men-tioned in the original submission, the method for calibration is very general and can handle {{a wide array of}} radially sym-metric cameras. To emphasize this, in the paper we showed results for the more extreme of these distortions: three cata-dioptric cameras (including a non-central one) and one fish-eye camera. In this supplementary material, however, we want to demonstrate the applicability of the method to other very common camera lens types, such as a pinhole cam-era and popular Wide Field of View (WFOV) cameras. In addition to the model used in the paper, we also present cal-ibrations obtained using the Aachen model from [2]. The experimental results for these additional camera types are presented similarly to the ones detailed in the pa-per, i. e., by showing the calibration mapping as a scatter plot and comparing the data points to well-known calibra-tion toolboxes [1, 3]. As stated in the paper, our calibra-tions are obtained by utilizing the geometric ordering con-straint. The scatter plots of Fig. 2 are color-coded accord-ing to the image that generated the matches, since for all calibration multiple images were needed. This thus illus-trates the amount of images used and the concentration of the scatter near the reference calibration. Such reference calibrations are shown as thick line plots in gray behind the scatter plot. In Fig. 2 a, Fig. 2 b, and Fig. 2 c we show calibrations ob-tained for the Sony ExmorR, GoPro 3, and an iPhone 4 S (no <b>lens</b> <b>attachment),</b> respectively. In the case of Fig. 2 a, we can see that its calibration very closely matches the one ob-tained using [3]. For high radii, however, our calibration appears more accurate (c. f. Fig. 1).

Infants in the ultra-high risk population are most at risk of poor attachment styles. Mothers often {{have a history of}} childhood abuse and adversity, criminality, substance abuse, and poor mental health.

This study investigated Social Workers’ identification of attachment issues using qualitative methodology in the form of document analysis of Social Worker case notes and semi-structured interviews with Social Workers. Results indicate that the accuracy and frequency of identifying attachment varied and that often the focus was on individual behaviours rather than the dynamic attachment processes of the mother-infant dyad. Disturbance in the attachment relationship was most clearly and accurately identified in cases that involved a major disruption to the mother-infant relationship. Attachment styles were identified as secure in almost every non-crisis case, particularly in the infant’s early years. Possible early manifestations of insecure attachment styles were not viewed through the <b>lens</b> of <b>attachment</b> theory, but rather in the context of behavioural and parenting problems.

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors propose, {{on the basis}} of a review of the {{evolutionary}} and neuropsychological study of REM sleep, that REM sleep functions to promote attachment and that in the mature state it may promote sexual pair bonding and serve related compensatory functions.

The review section of this thesis synthesises evidence of the lived experience of adolescent service users’, parents’ and clinicians’ of the CAMHS to AMHS transition. The review reveals that individuals experience a sense of abandonment at this point in the care journey, expressing feelings of insecurity, anxiety and a belief that they are unable to affect change. It highlights the need to explore further individuals experiences of CAMHS to AMHS transitions, giving voice not only to service users and parents but also to clinicians involved in the transition process. It demonstrates the on-going need for further improvements regarding service transitions as recommended by government policy. Research Project: The transition out of CAMHS is a significant event for adolescence reaching the upper age limited of CAMHS services.

40|$|Researchers have {{indicated}} that school-aged children with a caregiver who had been deployed {{were more likely to}} exhibit emotional and behavioral problems. These problems were impacted by the ability of the parent at home to manage emotions so as to utilize appropriate parenting skills with the child. However, there remained an important gap in the literature regarding the experiences of the military personnel reintegrating with their preschool aged child. Therefore, the purpose of this phenomenological study was to address the experiences of military caregivers with their preschool-aged children through semistructured interviews to better understand the variables that impacted the ability to reattach with the child. The main research question for this study examined reattachment experiences of 11 military parents with their preschool-aged child during reintegration through the theoretical <b>lens</b> of <b>attachment</b> theory because previous attachment literature showed the importance of attachment development during the preschool-aged years.

40|$|Posttraumatic growth, {{defined as}} {{positive}} psychological {{changes in the}} aftermath of adversity and suffering, is a relatively recent focus in psychological research. The addition of this concept to the literature has provided a new, more resiliency-based framework through which to view survivors of various forms of trauma. Despite estimates that over half of all sexual assaults are not reported to the authorities, current crime statistics indicate that 1 in 4 women are sexually assaulted in their lifetime (Campbell & Wasco, 2005). Given the large percentage of the population that is impacted by sexual assault, it is essential that professionals better understand the factors that influence the successful healing and growth that can occur post-trauma. The {{purpose of this study was}} to further expand the literature on posttraumatic growth in sexual assault survivors by considering this phenomenon through the <b>lens</b> of <b>attachment</b> theory. Specifically, this study tested a proposed model of the inter-relationships among subjective and objective perceptions of threat during the sexual assault, adult romantic attachment, and posttraumatic growth. It was hypothesized that adult romantic attachment and parent-child attachment would mediate the relationship between subjective, or perceived threat, defined as the victim's perception of life threat, and objective threat, defined as the severity of the sexually aggressive act perpetrated on the victim, and posttraumatic growth. Finally, it was hypothesized that subjective threat appraisal would better predict posttraumatic growth than objective threat appraisal. Contrary to hypotheses, results of the study indicated that adult romantic attachment and parent-child attachment did not mediate the relationship between subjective and objective threat appraisal and posttraumatic growth. Thus, both path analytic models were not viable. However, exploratory analysis indicated that both subjective and objective threat appraisal were directly related to posttraumatic growth, with subjective perceived threat appraisal accounting for more of the variance...|$|R
