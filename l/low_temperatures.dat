According to the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> disease on asphalt {{pavement}} {{in the areas}} of cold and large temperature difference between day and night, conventional index test and <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> bending creep test were used to analyze the influence of diatomite dosage on the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> performance of diatomite modified asphalt, and the mixture’s <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> bending test was applied for verification.

5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells.

5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at <b>low</b> <b>temperatures,</b> where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at <b>low</b> <b>temperatures</b> restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Low</b> <b>temperature</b> is {{a common}} {{production}} constraint in rice cultivation in temperate zones and high-elevation environments, {{with the potential to}} affect growth and development from germination to grain filling. There is a wide range of genotype-based differences in cold tolerance among rice varieties, these differences often reflecting growth conditions in the place of origin, aswell as breeding history. However, improving <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance of varieties has been difficult, {{due to a lack of}} clarity of the genetic basis to <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> tolerance for different growth stages of the rice plant. Seeds or plants of 17 rice varieties of different origins were exposed to <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> during germination (158 C), seedling, booting, and flowering stages (18. 58 C), to assess their cold tolerance at different growth stages. <b>Low</b> <b>temperature</b> at the germination stage reduced both the percentage and speed of germination.
