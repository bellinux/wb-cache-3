5000|$|To {{reduce the}} hazards of working with large amounts of media, {{non-toxic}} materials (ideally, food-grade) are used. The prototype CandyFab 4000 unit uses granulated sugar as its print medium, giving rise to its name, but other materials with low melting temperatures and <b>low</b> <b>toxicities</b> are still under consideration.|$|R
50|$|Toxicity occurs due to terpenoid ledol {{found in}} all Labrador tea species. R. groenlandicum has the <b>lowest</b> <b>toxicity</b> due to lower levels of ledol. Grayanotoxins are also present, but few lethal human cases of {{poisoning}} due to grayanotoxins in Labrador tea have been documented. However, lethal poisonings have been documented in livestock.|$|R
5|$|The small {{particles}} in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> and were not expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued warnings that the smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates have <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> in mammals (similar {{to table}} salt), but are more toxic to {{arthropods}} {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus <b>low</b> <b>toxicity.</b>|$|E
30|$|Significant {{differences}} in toxicity against mosquito larvae were observed between P and NYS media, local (Bacillus sphaericus EMCC 1931, EMCC 1932) and reference (B. sphaericus 1593, B. sphaericus 2297) strains. With {{the rest of}} media, significant differences were observed between all tested strains and media. The <b>lowest</b> <b>toxicity</b> was observed in LB and AYE media, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Co-digestion of sludge and oat {{followed}} by dewatering {{and treatment of}} sludge residue in reed beds can be a sustainable waste management and energy production. We recommend that future studies should involve co-digestion of decontaminated waste mixed with different non-toxic material to find a substrate mixture that produce the highest biogas yield and <b>lowest</b> <b>toxicity</b> within the sludge residue.|$|R
50|$|Many organic {{chemicals}} in high enough concentrations induce narcotic symptoms. Thus, most toxicants {{can be considered}} narcotics. Baseline <b>toxicity,</b> or <b>lowest</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{is often used to}} refer to narcosis because this mode of action is considered the minimal effect. QSAR models are often used to predict minimum or baseline toxicity of chemicals acting through nonspecific mechanisms.|$|R
5|$|Niobium is used {{in various}} superconducting materials. These superconducting alloys, also {{containing}} titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. Other applications of niobium include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics, and jewelry. In the last two applications, the <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal with <b>low</b> <b>toxicity.</b> It {{is poorly}} absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) for {{reduction}} of lead has broadened bismuth's use in electronics {{as a component}} of low-melting point solders, as a replacement for traditional tin-lead solders. Its <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes, although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry, in the EU for example.|$|E

5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a <b>low</b> <b>toxicity,</b> targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself. Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD50 value of 2800mg/kg after seven days (this is very <b>low</b> <b>toxicity,</b> similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD50 of 280mg/kg.|$|E

The seeds were dried, powdered and extracted in Soxhlet`s apparatus in the solvents below 60 °C. Extractions were applied on larvae and adult beetles in filmresidue methods and mortality was recorded after 24 h. For larval bioassay the highest toxicity was recorded for petroleum spirit extract (LD 50 = 0. 03 µg cm- 2) in Raj strain and the <b>lowest</b> <b>toxicity</b> was for methanol extract (LD 50 = 15. 697 µg cm- 2) in FSS II strain.

5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{to humans}} {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{compounds}} have <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{compared to}} those of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E

5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a <b>low</b> <b>toxicity</b> and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had <b>low</b> <b>toxicity).</b> Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
