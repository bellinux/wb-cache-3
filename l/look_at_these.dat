25|$|Limnology is {{the study}} of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the {{littoral}} zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or benthic zone, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication.

According to David Ritz, Whitfield set to record a song that would [...] "out-funk" [...] Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, Gladys Knight, Bubba Knight, William Guest, and Edward Patten worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, {{the first line of}} the second verse ("I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside") was altered to ("Take a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside").

Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> ones.

500|$|Dark Horse Comics {{approached}} {{creative director}} Neil Druckmann, {{who was working}} on The Last of Us, to produce a tie-in comic book series for the game. Druckmann was initially wary of the idea, but eventually agreed when he realized Dark Horse [...] "didn't {{want to do something}} tangential" [...] with the opportunity of expanding their characters and universe beyond the game. Work on the comic began during the game's development, which allowed the stories of the two projects to integrate, and influence each other. Druckmann requested webcomic artist Faith Erin Hicks as a collaborator on the project, after reading her comic Friends with Boys (2012) and appreciating [...] "how personal it felt". He also felt that Hicks could capture the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the game. Hicks then sent some concept art to Dark Horse as a pitch for the job; they accepted, and she became officially involved with the project. Hicks was drawn to the project after reading about the character of Ellie in the game's script; she considered Ellie an unusual character to include in a survival horror game, calling her a [...] "tough teenage girl who wasn't sexualized, and who seemed very much the equal of her male counterpart". Hicks was given access to various gameplay sequences and the game's script during development, to allow her to better understand the story. She was also given videos of the actors performing on set, which was helpful when illustrating the characters. [...] "I get a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> characters and I see them interacting as human beings, not just as concept art," [...] said Hicks.|$|E

With the failure of her plot, Woizero Befana was separated from Menelik, but Menelik apparently was still deeply attached to her.

2500|$|The {{past tense}} of basic verbs is very {{complicated}} and poorly attested. One common reconstructed {{system is to}} use -n: darn. However, the only time this -n actually remains is after a stem in -r. After a stem ending in -l, -n becomes -ll: toll. After -b, -d, -g, -v, or -dh, it is metathesized and then assimilated {{to the same place}} of articulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then experiences what could be called a [...] "backwards mutation": -b, -d, and -g become -p, -t, and -c, and -v and -dh become -m and -d. The matter is complicated even further when pronominal endings are added. Because -mp, -mb, -nt, -nd, and -nc did not survive medially, they become -mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-, and -ng. In addition, past tense stems in -m would have -mm- before any pronominal endings.

The [...] "perfect match" [...] where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires.
