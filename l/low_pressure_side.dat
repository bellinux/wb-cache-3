50|$|Since {{failure of}} the {{circulating}} fan will have immediate and unhappy consequences for the heat exchanger or heating elements, detection of circulation fan failure is vital. This {{can be done in}} several ways. First, monitor the surface temperature of the heater, whether coil or element. If the airflow fails, this will rise suddenly, and the control system can execute an immediate shut-off. Second, install at least one and preferably two airflow sensors. Since the airflow may be at very high temperatures, this can be done with remotely mounted pressure switches that connect to the high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> of the fan by means of stainless steel tubing long enough to put the switches well inside the cool area of the inside of the vessel. These switches should be wired in series on one side for the control circuit, such that either one opening will disrupt the heater power, and in parallel on the other side so that the computer can detect which one has changed state.|$|R

50|$|Low {{pressure}} receptor {{zones are}} areas with baroreceptors {{located in the}} venae cavae and the pulmonary arteries, and in the atria. They are also called volume receptors. These receptors respond {{to changes in the}} wall tension, which is proportional to the filling state of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of circulation (below 60mmHg). Their impulses regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone. An elevated atrial pressure produces a decrease in ADH and aldosterone secretion. The decrease in vasopressin secretion results in an increase in the volume of urine excreted, serving to lower blood pressure. In addition, stretching of atrial receptors increases secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which promotes increased water and sodium excretion through the urine.|$|E
50|$|Fluids {{flow through}} a filter {{due to a}} {{difference}} in pressure—fluid flows from the high pressure side to the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the filter, leaving some material behind. The simplest method to achieve this is by gravity and {{can be seen in}} the coffeemaker example. In the laboratory, pressure in the form of compressed air on the feed side (or vacuum on the filtrate side) may be applied to make the filtration process faster, though this may lead to clogging or the passage of fine particles. Alternatively, the liquid may flow through the filter by the force exerted by a pump, a method commonly used in industry when a reduced filtration time is important. In this case, the filter need not be mounted vertically.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} lithography-based {{microfabrication}} {{process and the}} preliminary experiments for a recuperative heat exchanger intended {{for use in a}} Joule-Thomson (J-T) cryosurgical probe. The heat exchanger must maintain high stream-to-stream thermal conductance while restricting parasitic stream-wise (axial) conduction losses. Rows of fins composed of high conductivity silicon are bonded onto a 100 µm thick base plate composed of low conductivity Pyrex glass. The heat exchanger has a footprint of 61. 5 cm 2 and 2. 5 mm thickness, and is fabricated using a 5 -mask process. The fabrication process involves anodic bonding, deep reactive ion dry etching, glass frit bonding, electrochemical discharge drilling and several other steps, along with special features that compensate for manufacturing tolerances. Preliminary experiments include measurement of the thermal effectiveness in an ice-water bath, as well as evaluation of self-cooling with butane. The data suggest an optimal area of 0. 2 mm 2 for the expansion orifice.

50|$|Closed-loop: Motor-return is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>side,</b> the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>side.</b> Closed-loop circuits are generally used for hydrostatic transmissions in mobile applications. Advantages: No directional valve and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump swivel angle covers {{both positive and negative}} flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and filtering. The flush valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at maximum vehicle speed. The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using hydrostatic transmissions at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E
5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E
40|$|In current wing design, {{multiple}} flaps {{are incorporated}} into the trailing edge to allow mixing of high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> to reduce flow separation. These flaps reduce the efficiency by adding weight and complexity to the aircraft. A single hinged flap would reduce these inefficiencies but is more susceptible to flow separation. Active flow control is {{a means by which}} the fluid flow over a body is deliberately altered and can be altered such that it becomes less likely to separate from the object. By energizing the flow, the degree of separation of the flow can be controlled, and this inherently controls lift. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators are a form of active flow control. These actuators are created by asymmetrically aligning two electrodes and adding a dielectric layer between the electrodes. When the electrodes are electrically connected, ionized air (plasma) travels from the exposed electrode towards the covered electrode. Collisions occur between the plasma and neutral air over the body, and momentum is transferred to the neutral air, effectively energizing it.
