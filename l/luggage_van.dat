60|$|She {{turned and}} saw her husband beckoning to her. He was {{standing}} with Mr. George and Rollo near the <b>luggage</b> <b>van,</b> {{as they call it}} in England, while the railway porters were taking out the luggage.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} Gurwood, but that youth {{did not hear}} her remark, having been forced from her side by a {{noiseless}} luggage truck on India-rubber wheels. Turning, then, towards the captain she found {{that he and his}} daughter had hastily run to recapture a small valise which was being borne off to the <b>luggage</b> <b>van</b> instead of going into the carriage along with them. At the same moment the guard intervened, and the captain and his daughter were lost in the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|Mike nodded. A somber nod. The nod Napoleon {{might have}} given if {{somebody}} had met him in 1812, and said, [...] "So you're back from Moscow, eh?" [...] Mike was feeling thoroughly jaundiced. The future seemed wholly gloomy. And, so far from attempting {{to make the best}} of things, he had set himself deliberately to look on the dark side. He thought, for instance, that he had never seen a more repulsive porter, or one more obviously incompetent than the man who had attached himself with a firm grasp to the handle of the bag as he strode off in the direction of the <b>luggage</b> <b>van.</b> He disliked his voice, his appearance, and the color of his hair. Also the boots he wore. He hated the station, and the man who took his ticket.|$|E

6000|$|As the old gentleman sat waiting {{the moment}} of departure, he was the witness of an {{incident}} strangely connected with the fortunes of his house. A packing-case of cyclopean bulk was borne along the platform by some dozen of tottering porters, and ultimately, {{to the delight of}} a considerable crowd, hoisted on board the van. It is often the cheering task of the historian to direct attention to the designs and (if it may be reverently said) the artifices of Providence. In the <b>luggage</b> <b>van,</b> as Joseph was borne out of the station of Southampton East upon his way to London, the egg of his romance lay (so to speak) unhatched. The huge packing-case was directed to lie at Waterloo till called for, and addressed to one [...] "William Dent Pitman"; and the very next article, a goodly barrel jammed into the corner of the van, bore the superscription, [...] "M. Finsbury, 16 John Street, Bloomsbury. Carriage paid." ...|$|E
6000|$|Albinia went to {{meet the}} delinquent at Hadminster, and {{was struck by the}} {{different}} deportment of the two youths. Algernon Dusautoy, whose servant had met him, sauntered up to her as if nothing had happened, carelessly hoped all were well at Bayford, and, in spite of her exceeding coldness, talked on with perfect ease upon the chances of a war with Russia, and had given her three or four maxims, before Gilbert came up with the <b>luggage</b> <b>van,</b> with a bag in his hand, and a hurried bewildered manner, unable to meet her eye. He handed her into the carriage, seated himself beside her, and drove off without one unnecessary word, while Algernon, mounting his horse, waved them a disengaged farewell, and cantered on. Albinia heard a heavy sigh, and saw her companion very wan and sorrowful, dejection in every feature, in the whole stoop of his figure, and in the nervous twitch of his hands. The contrast gave an additional impulse to her love and pity, and the first words she said were, 'Your father is quite ready to forgive.' ...|$|E
60|$|Deronda {{looked around}} for Grandcourt, {{wondering}} whether he followed his bride's movements with any attention; but it was rather undiscerning to him to suppose that he could find out the fact. Grandcourt had a delusive mood of observing whatever had an interest for him, which could be surpassed by no sleepy-eyed animal on the watch for prey. At that moment he was plunged in the depth of an easy chair, being talked to by Mr. Vandernoodt, who apparently thought the acquaintance of such a bridegroom worth cultivating; and an incautious person might have supposed it safe to telegraph secrets in front of him, the common prejudice being that your quick observer is one whose eyes have quick movements. Not at all. If you want a respectable witness who will see nothing inconvenient, choose a vivacious gentleman, {{very much on the}} alert, with two eyes wide open, a glass in one of them, and an entire impartiality as to the purpose of looking. If Grandcourt cared to keep any one under his power he saw them out of the corners of his long narrow eyes, and if they went behind him he had a constructive process by which he {{knew what they were doing}} there. He knew perfectly well where his wife was, and how she was behaving. Was he going to be a jealous husband? Deronda imagined that to be likely; but his imagination was as much astray about Grandcourt as it would have been about an unexplored continent where all the species were peculiar. He did not conceive that he himself was a likely subject of jealousy, or that he should give any pretext for it; but the suspicion that a wife is not happy naturally leads one to speculate on the husband's private deportment; and Deronda found himself after one o'clock in the morning in the rather ludicrous position of sitting up severely holding a Hebrew grammar in his hands (for somehow, in deference to Mordecai, he had begun to study Hebrew), with the consciousness that he had been in that attitude nearly an hour, and had thought of nothing but Gwendolen and her husband. To be an unusual young man means for the most part to get a difficult mastery over the usual, which is often like the sprite of ill-luck you pack up your goods to escape from, and see grinning at you from the top of your <b>luggage</b> <b>van.</b> The peculiarities of Deronda's nature had been acutely touched by the brief incident and words which made the history of his intercourse with Gwendolen; and this evening's slight addition had given them an importunate recurrence. It was not vanity--it was ready sympathy that had made him alive to a certain appealingness in her behavior toward him; and the difficulty with which she had seemed to raise her eyes to bow to him, in the first instance, was to be interpreted now by that unmistakable look of involuntary confidence which she had afterward turned on him under the consciousness of his approach.|$|E
