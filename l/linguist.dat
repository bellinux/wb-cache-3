50|$|At {{the outset}} of World War II, Britain had few Japanese <b>linguists</b> and {{conventional}} wisdom held that it would require two years to produce qualified <b>linguists</b> for the war effort. In February 1942, an accelerated program was established to train <b>linguists</b> to assist with Japanese signals intelligence. Candidates were put through an intensive six-month course taught by Captain Oswald Tuck, RN. The course was taught in various locations in Bedford including the Gas Company. The course produced <b>linguists</b> for the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Foreign Office. Some of the <b>linguists</b> were sent on to Bletchley, while others were sent to London to work with Captain Malcolm Kennedy.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1920s, {{language}} {{began to}} be seen as a social phenomenon, and Russian and Soviet <b>linguists</b> tried to give a sociological explanation to features of language. At the same time, Soviet <b>linguists</b> sought to develop a [...] "Marxist" [...] linguistics, as opposed to the early theories that were viewed as bourgeois. Based on this, <b>linguists</b> focused more on the spoken forms of the language, and devoted more time to the study of non-standard dialects than previous <b>linguists</b> had done. This can be seen in the work of Boris Alexandrovich Larin and Lev Petrovich Iakubinskii.|$|R

40|$|The Ebonics {{controversy}} revealed surprising public {{rejection of}} the ideas of academic <b>linguists.</b> The intellectual history of the situation provides a reasonable explanation. <b>Linguists</b> lack consensus themselves, while the public consensus includes inherent contradictions. Academic and public ideas of language came into conflict over Ebonics in part because <b>linguists</b> attempted to impose their own ideas on the public, {{in part because of}} confusion over terminology, and in part because the situation was entangled in social politics. The lessons of the affair suggest an approach to language and public policy in which <b>linguists</b> come to terms with public views of language...|$|R
