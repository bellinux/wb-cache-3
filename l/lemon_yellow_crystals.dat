50|$|Iodine trichloride (ICl3) forms <b>lemon</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>crystals</b> that melt under {{pressure}} to a brown liquid. It {{can be made from}} the elements at low temperature, or from iodine pentoxide and hydrogen chloride. It reacts with many metal chlorides to form tetrachloroiodides, and hydrolyses in water.

50|$|Mosesite is {{a minute}} <b>yellow</b> <b>crystal</b> with {{imperfect}} cleavage along {111} and uneven fracture. It is brittle with a hardness of 3.5. Long exposure, {{a month or}} more, to light will change Mosesite to a light olive green. The powdered form retains its color streaking a light yellow. The mineral exhibits no pleochroism and displays uneven birefringence in polarized light. Heat has a notable effect on Mosesite for when heated above 186 C the mineral becomes isotropic. This corresponds optically with the observed crystal form only at this higher temperature. It is considered weakly anisotropic. The index of refraction is n = 2.065±0.01. It has an adamantine luster officially ranges in color from <b>lemon</b> <b>yellow</b> to canary yellow. Mosesite reacts chemically with HCl leaving a residue of HgCl.|$|R
