50|$|The Pacific Ocean Coal Co. {{opened a}} 6km {{line from the}} coal mine at Harutori to Irifune-cho wharf in 1925/27, with a 3km line {{connecting}} the mine to Higashi-Kushiro opening in 1928. The line was truncated 2km in 1966 when a new coal <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> opened, the passenger service ceasing at the same time.|$|E
50|$|In 1864 the Severn and Wye Railway Company began {{operating}} steam locomotives on {{the existing}} tramway. This proved to be unsatisfactory and 1868 the company also added a broad-gauge steam railway line, but both were removed and replaced with standard gauge tracks by 1874. At around the same time, a <b>loading</b> <b>wharf,</b> known as Marsh Sidings, was constructed and Parkend railway station opened in 1875, allowing the company to also operate passenger trains alongside its freight operations.|$|E
50|$|The Thanet Canal {{is a short}} {{branch of}} the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which leaves the main canal in Skipton, and runs to some <b>loading</b> <b>wharfs</b> near Skipton Castle, which were used to load {{limestone}} from local quarries into boats for onward shipment. It was opened in 1773, and extended in 1794. It is sometimes called the Springs Branch.|$|R
6000|$|On {{raising his}} eyes from the note the other had given him, after {{breaking}} its seal, the young man found that the messenger had already vanished. Perceiving how useless it would be to pursue so light a form, amid the mazes of lumber that <b>loaded</b> the <b>wharf,</b> and most of the adjacent shore, he opened the letter and read as follows:-- ...|$|R
50|$|The port has {{an annual}} {{capacity}} to handle 80 million tonnes of iron ore. In comparison, {{the port of}} Dampier can handle 140 million tonnes annually. The former is approximately 40% of Rio Tinto's annual iron ore production from the Pilbara, as of 2009. Individual ships at the port take between 24 and 36 hours to <b>load.</b> The <b>wharf</b> at Cape Lambert is 3 kilometres long, 30 metres high {{and one of the}} highest, longest and deepest wharves in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Built and {{launched}} by the State Dockyard at Newcastle, New South Wales in 1962 for the Commonwealth Lighthouse Service, she serviced the lighthouses, lightships and buoys of the Australian coast from 1963 to the early 1990s. She is being restored by the labour of enthusiasts to become a museum and training ship. She is listed on the Australian Register of Historic Vessels. She is currently berthed at the former coal <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> in Balls Head Bay, Waverton, New South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Higashi Kushiro station - The Pacific Ocean Coal Co. {{opened a}} 6 km {{line from a}} coal mine at Harutori to Irifune-cho wharf in 1926/27, with a 3 km line {{connecting}} the mine to Higashi-Kushiro opening in 1928. Passenger services ceased in 1963, and the line was truncated 2 km in 1966 when a new coal <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> opened. The Higashi-Kushiro - Harutori section closed in 1986, with the remaining 4 km Taiheiyo line continuing to operate as the only remaining colliery line in Japan.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} Moguer in the 15th century {{was based in}} agriculture, fishing, and mercantile activities. in 1489 the Catholic Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand granted a seguro (?) to ships {{arriving}} at the river port of Moguer from the Canary Islands, North Africa and Atlantic European countries. Beginning in the 15th century, Moguer had a <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> for loading and discharging merchandise, a carriageway, shipyards, and an alota that was, together with Huelva and Palos, among the most active on the Huelva coast.Toward {{the end of the}} 15th century, the town had a population of about 5,000, and a city centre with several arterial roads, dominated by the Paris Church of Our Lady of Granada, the castle, the San Francisco convent and the Santa Clara monastery. There was much economic activity and the many ships visited the port. This was the situation of Moguer when it {{played a significant role in}} the first voyage of Christopher Columbus.|$|E
50|$|Later, African-Americans {{and then}} Irish {{immigrants}} {{settled in the}} shadows of the two mighty bridges spanning the East River. They found work on the <b>wharves</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading bags of sugar, tea, coffee and spices that came from countries like the ones they left behind.|$|R
50|$|In August 1951 Dromus was in Singapore, and on 18 August {{she took}} on a new crew for a voyage to the Philippines. On the night of 19-20 August Dromus was <b>loading</b> at <b>Wharf</b> Number 6 of the oil {{terminal}} {{on the island of}} Pulau Bukom off Singapore. During the process of topping up one of her forward tanks there was an overflow of oil from her foredeck and at about 1250 hrs she suffered an explosion and fire that took hold from her forecastle as far aft as her central superstructure.|$|R
5000|$|Alcatraz Wharf {{is located}} on the {{southeast}} side of Alcatraz Island, in San Francisco Bay, California, US. Classified as building number 33 of the Alcatraz Island National Historic Landmark, its historic name variants were [...] "Alcatraz Dock" [...] and [...] "Alcatraz Pier". It is the main access point to Alcatraz. Another dock on the island's northwest side was only used for rock <b>loading.</b> The <b>wharf</b> contained many of the islands historic buildings, including Building 64 (Alcatraz Defensive Barracks), the Bombproof Barracks, Chinatown, Ranger Office, Garage, Dock Tower, Storage Vault, and Firebox #3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enclosures}} at Close e Volley and Ballavolley {{are part}} of the wetlands of the Ballaugh Curragh (Norse: Mirescog - Mire of the Turbary) of 1,000 acres (405 ha) in area. [...] The primary A3 road as part of The Long Round the journey from Castletown to Ramsey made by horse-drawn carriers and the A14 Sandygate Road form a boundary of the Curragh's wetland along with the tertiary U7 Old Sulby Road, C29 Old Windmill Road and B9 Ballacrye Road. In 1879 the Manx Northern Railway built a narrow gauge railway from St.John's to Ramsey which ran parallel to the A3 road from Kirk Michael to Sulby Bridge. The railway line crossed a number of minor roads as it passed through the Curraghs at Ballacrye, Ballavolley and Cooilbane. A small railway siding was built in 1882 to serve Clarke's stone quarry at Ballavolley crossing the primary A3 road at Close e Volley, later renamed Quarry Bends, running to a small <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> and siding to the main Ramsey to St. John's railway line.|$|E
5000|$|Pochin's {{principal}} {{china clay}} works was the Gothers drying complex, near Roche, Cornwall. This {{consisted of a}} number of kilns, each served by a narrow gauge tramway, and was considered to be an extensive works in its day. The tramway was known simply as Pochin's Tramway, and ran from the Gothers works, across the Goss Moor to a <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> on the St Dennis Branch. The tramway was operated by a small fleet of steam locomotives known as [...] "Pochin's Puffing Billies", carrying clay to the wharf in crude three plank wagons. Upon reaching the wharf, the clay would be loaded into standard gauge wagons. Coal for firing the kilns was transferred from standard gauge wagons into the narrow gauge tramway wagons for the return journey, the wagons were then cleaned of coal dust at Gothers before being loaded with clay for another trip. Because the crude tramway wagons had no braking mechanism, the train operators developed a novel solution that involved jamming a piece of timber between the spokes of the wheels while the train was in motion.|$|E

60|$|Going forward, {{we found}} the sailors congregated on the forecastle-deck, engaged in some earnest discussion; while several carts on the <b>wharf,</b> <b>loaded</b> with their chests, were just {{in the act of}} driving off, destined for the boarding-houses uptown. By the looks of our shipmates, I saw very plainly that they must have some {{mischief}} under weigh; and so it turned out.|$|R
50|$|One timber wharf {{was located}} on the south bank, {{downstream}} of the first Hexham bridge. This was originally used by J & A Brown from the mid-1800s to load coal brought by train from Minimi across Hexham Swamp. As J & A Brown's operations expanded coal was <b>loaded</b> at this <b>wharf</b> from their other coal mines. Ship loading at the J & A Brown shiploader ended on 1 November 1967.|$|R
50|$|Portions of {{two sets}} of tracks are visible. The portion of the first set within the area {{consists}} of a single set of double-rail tracks extending from the loading dock behind number 1 wharf southwards to the loading dock {{at the rear of}} number 3 wharf. The track extends past the original fixed 10-ton Cargo Crane behind the number 2 wharf. The tracks change from double-railed to single-railed near {{the southern end of the}} number 3 <b>wharf</b> <b>loading</b> dock.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of liquids being {{exchanged}} between a ship and the Standard Oil Company oil <b>loading</b> <b>wharf,</b> ca. 1920. In the foreground to the right, several steel pipes and valves sitting atop {{a group of}} three horizontal pipes can be seen. These pipes and valves stretch down the edge of the wharf. At center, a small wooden platform can be seen connecting the wharf to the deck of the ship on the right. A few steel pipes and valves can also be seen {{on the deck of the}} ship. A large rubber hose is visible connecting a pipe on the ship's deck to a pipe on the wharf's edge. Several rectangular compartments decorate the deck of the ship. In the far background, a triple-layered structure showing several doors can be seen rising from the upper deck of the ship. On the wooden wharf to the left, an empty bows and part of a metal beam are visible at center. In the far background, a wooden pile sits adjacent to a large structure. Further to the left, a line of utility poles running along a metal fence can be seen. A small sign near the fence above a small structure reads: "Firehose 150 ft. Single Wrap". The Standard Oil Company oil <b>loading</b> <b>wharf</b> included Berths 97 and 98...|$|E
25|$|In February 1965 the Lyttelton Harbour Board {{decided to}} {{construct}} a new passenger terminal and vehicle <b>loading</b> facility on <b>wharf</b> no. 2 to cater for the new roll on/roll off ferries due to enter service from December that year. To facilitate the construction work, the harbour board arranged for the inter-island ferries to use wharf no. 3 {{for the remainder of}} the year, and requested that the Railways Department-owned veranda be shortened to allow the new building to be erected.|$|R
2500|$|From 1828, {{railways}} {{started to}} be built; at first these did not directly compete with the canal, and the canal used the railways, and short tramways, as feeders, encouraging the connection: [...] "the Canal company were not slow to avail themselves of these iron pathways as feeders to their own trade; and accordingly, wherever it has been practicable, they have formed <b>loading</b> basins and <b>wharves,</b> connecting them by offsets with railways in the vicinity. The additional traffic resulting from this source has been very great." ...|$|R
50|$|Hexham {{has its own}} {{railway station}} on the Hunter line, which passes through the area, {{although}} only a few trains stop at this station on a daily basis. It was the riverine terminus of the privately owned Richmond Vale Railway line, an early coal hauling railway from Minmi and Stockrington which crossed the government railway at right angles. Coal <b>loading</b> at the <b>wharf</b> ended in 1967 and the railway line to the adjoining workshops was closed in October 1973. The remaining section of the Richmond Vale Railway was closed in September 1987.|$|R
5000|$|In 1858, the S. L. Mastick Company of San Francisco {{established}} the Port Discovery Mill {{on the western}} shore of the bay, at what today is called [...] "Mill Point." [...] The old growth timber on the steep hillsides above the mill were felled, slid down to the sawmill, milled into lumber and <b>loaded</b> from the <b>wharf</b> to ships for other ports. A village grew around the mill to house its employees. The peak population of the community, in the late 19th century, was in the hundreds. Port Discovery, Washington remained an important coastal port well into the 20th century, and was visited by many Pacific Ocean vessels.|$|R
50|$|The region {{around the}} bay is rugged and remote, {{and for many}} years the only access to the town was by boat. Because the bay is shallow, a long wharf - the longest in New Zealand (600m) - {{was built in the}} 1920s to {{accommodate}} visiting vessels. The last cargo ship to use the <b>wharf</b> <b>loaded</b> a cargo of maize in 1967.In the 1830s there was a thriving flax trade involving early European traders like Barnet Burns. By 1998, the wharf had deteriorated and was in danger of being closed. In response, the Tolaga Bay Save the Wharf Trust raised funds and gained technical help to restore it. The wharf has now been re-opened and the refurbishment project should finish by May 2013.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{force of}} ship {{is one of}} the main <b>loads</b> which High-Piled <b>Wharf</b> bears, the {{assignation}} of transverse component on each bent is the precondition of the calculation which simplified the wharf structure into plane bent. The taking value of transverse component on bent influences a lot on the result of structure calculation. Nowadays, the design of High-Piled Wharf uses the value from the distribution coefficient in the Design and Construction Code of High –Piled Wharf. The results show that the distribution coefficient taken in the code is under the precondition that considering the beam is rigid; the relative stiffness of beam and pile can influence this distribution coefficient. Considering the flexibility of the beam, the distribution coefficient of the horizontal concentrated force on transverse bents will change...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the fall}} of 1887, after {{traveling}} through the White Pass to Lake Bennett, Moore somehow knew that gold would soon be discovered in the Yukon and {{wasted no time in}} preparing for the day his prediction would come to pass. With his son, Ben, Moore struck out for Juneau, Alaska by canoe. When they passed what would later be named Skagway, Moore noted {{that it would be a}} good place for a <b>wharf.</b> <b>Loading</b> up with supplies in Juneau, they swiftly returned through the Lynn Canal to Skagway Bay where Moore preempted [...] at the mouth of the Skagway River at a place the Indians called Skagua, and named it Mooresville. He built a log cabin, a sawmill, and began the construction of a wharf in anticipation of the ships that would land there, offloading thousands of eager gold-seekers.|$|R

When they passed what would later be named Skagway, Moore noted {{that it would be a}} good place for a <b>wharf.</b> <b>Loading</b> up with supplies in Juneau, they swiftly returned through the Lynn Canal to Skagway Bay where Moore preempted 160 acre at the mouth of the Skagway River at a place the Indians called Skagua, and named it Mooresville. He built a log cabin, a sawmill, and began the construction of a wharf in anticipation of the ships that would land there, offloading thousands of eager gold-seekers.He and Ben returned to Victoria in that winter where Moore wrote several letters to Ottawa, telling of the Yukon's great potential and the need for a wagon road over the White Pass. His letters were ignored. Undaunted, as always, Moore returned to his property every summer and freighted through the Lynn Canal with his new sternwheeler, another Flying Dutchman. In 1891, he asked the United States Secretary of the Interior for a contract to build a road through the White Pass, and again, his request was ignored.|$|R
50|$|Another {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} fort is its surviving buildings and tramway system that were once used in the submarine mining operation that was run from the fort during World War I and World War II. During World War II, some 300 mines were planted on {{the east and west}} sides of Conanicut Island, protecting the approaches to Newport, and almost all of these were maintained from the Mine Wharf at Fort Wetherill. The image at left shows the old mine storehouse, one of the best preserved in the United States, with the remains of the tram tracks that used to carry the massive mines in and out its front door. Mine launches would tie up at the nearby <b>wharf,</b> <b>load</b> the mines that were to be laid, transport them out to the inlet, and lay them, together with their electric cables. Then, when these mines needed to be taken in, they were ferried back to the wharf and transported on the tramway to the various service buildings. A dual mine observation station sat atop the hill between the storehouse and Battery Varnum. Spotters manned this station (and others scattered around the harbor defenses) and could locate enemy ships approaching the minefields, signaling to the operators in the mining casemate when a given mine was to be electrically detonated.|$|R
