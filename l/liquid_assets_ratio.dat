Thirteen banks have been chosen to express on the whole Jordanian commercial banks. The liquidity indicators are investment ratio, Quick ratio, capital ratio, net credit facilities / total assets and <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> <b>ratio,</b> while return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) were the proxies for profitability. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) stationary test model was used to test for a unit root in a time series of the research variables and then testing hypothesis by using regression analysis. The empirical results show that a positive effect of the increase in the quick ratio and the investment ratio of the available funds on the profitability, while there is a negative effect of the capital ratio and the <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> <b>ratio</b> on the profitability of the Jordanian commercial banks. The researcher recommends {{that there is a need}} for an optimum utilization of the available liquidity in a various aspects of investment in order to increase the banks ' profitability, and banks should adopt a general framework of liquidity management to assure sufficient liquidity for executing their operations efficiently, and they should initiate an analytical study of the evolution rates of liquidity and their ability to achieve a balance between sources and uses of funds...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has shown that}} a liquidity risk {{plays an important role}} in the current developed financial system. Some Hungarian and Polish banks suffered liquidity problems, too. This paper therefore aims to describe development of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio</b> and to find out determinants which affect their values in the Visegrad countries. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2011. Liquidity of Czech banks declined in 2000 – 2009 (due to higher lending activity and decrease of balances with central banks and other banks) but it has improved during last two years. Liquidity of Slovak banks has decreased in 2009 and 2010 due to impact of {{financial crisis}} on some economic sectors and due to changes in interbank market transactions. Very similar is the development of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio</b> in Hungary and Poland where it has gone down during last five years due to important structural weaknesses such as very high loan-to-deposit ratio, high share of foreign debts, and negative net position in the interbank market.

40|$|In {{this article}} we want to verify if Bank of Canada's actions on the {{availability}} of credit were efficient from 1967 to 1976. During this period, the interest rate was chiefly used to maintain balance of payments equilibrium and the Bank of Canada was trying to affect internal credit conditions (here banks' loans) through its effect on the chartered banks' <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, this ratio is an imperfect indicator of the availability of banks' credit. Chartered banks have in fact many techniques to obtain liquidities: the whole of these constitutes their liability management mechanism. By this way, they can immune themselves from a restrictive monetary policy which operates via the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio.</b> The degree of accommodation of loans is also another factor to consider when studying the impact of the Bank of Canada on banks' loans. It is evident that a high degree of accommodation of loans is a serious obstacle to monetary policy: liquidity management is probably pushed very far in this case. Our theoretical model takes into account these considerations. And the estimation of this model shows that loans have little reacted to Bank of Canada's actions. The degree of loans accommodation was high and consequently banks checked the Bank of Canada's policy by their liquidity management mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{managing}} liquidity, each bank {{should be}} prepared also for unexpected and exceptional events, such as bank runs. The aim {{of this paper is}} therefore to determine the maximum volume of deposits that can be withdrawn from individual banks operating in the Visegrad countries and to identify the determinants of their sensitivity to a bank run. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2014. Although bank liquidity, measured by the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio,</b> decreased in all countries during the analyzed period, the level of liquidity differs among countries. We have simulated a bank run as a sudden withdrawal of 20 % of client deposits. The ability of individual banks to survive this crisis scenario signifi cantly differs. Nevertheless, as Czech and Hungarian banks were more liquid, they are better prepared for a potential bank run than Polish and Slovak banks. After that, using the panel data regression analysis, we tested seven bank-specifi c factors and seven macroeconomic factors. The sensitivity of commercial banks from the Visegrad countries to a possible bank run is determined mainly by different aspects of bank liquidity (not only the level of bank liquidity, but also connection to bank lending activity, the way of its fi nancing and also activity on the interbank market). Among the other bank specifi c factors, profi tability, capital adequacy and size of the banks are relevant in some countries. When it comes to macroeconomic factors, interest rate and unemployment rate are important. However, we can conclude that the most important factor is the level of bank liquidity: banks with a suffi cient buffer of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> are safer than other banks, particular during periods of fi nancial distress...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of {{corporate}} governance in US bank holding companies between 1998 to 2007. In {{the course of the}} thesis, four main contributions to extant literature are brought to the fore. First, the research facilitates {{a better understanding of the}} link between corporate governance and risk-taking. This is the main focus of the thesis and so this strand permeates the entire text. Second, it constructs a distance-to-default indicator, which is used to predict and compare financial conditions in banks that issued subordinated debt with those that did not. Third, it considers the impact of managerial incentives on bank risk-taking through board structure. Finally, the results provide a platform from which to view the various policy implications raised by the thesis. In analysing the extent to which distance to default is explained by bank risk fundamentals, it is shown that distance to default is predicted marginally better in sub-debt banks relative to non-sub-debt banks. For banks that issue sub-debts, again, it is found that charter values and bank capitalisation further increase the power of bank fundamentals to predict default risk. Turning to bank risk-related variables, capital to assets and non-performing loan ratios negatively and positively affect managerial ownership, respectively. This evidence is new. The percentage of independent directors is positively related to capital to <b>asset</b> and <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratios,</b> and negatively related to the non-performing loans <b>ratio.</b> Capital to <b>assets</b> and non-performing loan ratios have an observed positive and negative correlation with the percentage of institutional ownership. Also, excessive risk-taking is evident in ex-ante and ex-post Sarbanes and Regulation and linked to board size. With respect to managerial incentives, equity- and cash-based compensation is positively related to bank risk. Finally, while leverage varies directly with stock options, it is inversely associated with cash compensation...|$|R

Banks took actions to increase capital by slowing lending and raising profit margins, not fully passing through the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. Banks optimally choose capital based on the expected future demand for loans and the marginal cost of capital.

This paper investigates how {{interest}} rates on <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> and excess returns on risky assets are determined when only safe assets {{can be used as}} <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> when waiting for an informative signal of future payoffs. In particular, we carefully differentiate between a demand for <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> while waiting for new in-formation and a demand for safe assets for precautionary reasons. Employing Kreps– Porteus preferences, numerical examples demonstrate that larger waiting-options pre-miums (lower {{interest rates}}) emerge with higher risk aversion in combination with more elastic intertemporal substitution...|$|R

Contrarily, when the macroeconomic environment becomes more tranquil, each manger {{will have the}} latitude to behave more idiosyncratically as she can adjust <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> based on the specific requirements of the firm, bringing about a more efficient allocation of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> Our empirical analysis provides support for these predictions. ...|$|R
