25|$|<b>Live</b> <b>or</b> <b>Die</b> in Entebbe (2012) by {{director}} Eyal Boers follows Yonatan Khayat's {{journey to}} uncover {{the circumstances of his}} uncle Jean-Jacques Maimoni's death in the raid.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the jury}} found that {{one or more of}} the {{aggravating}} factors existed beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant would be eligible for the death penalty. The jury may, but was not required to, then evaluate all the evidence it had heard, including mitigating evidence and other aggravating evidence not supporting one of the ten factors beyond a reasonable doubt—and decide whether the defendant should <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die.</b> This scheme is called a non-weighing scheme, because the sentencer is not required to weigh the statutory aggravating factors against mitigating evidence before imposing a death sentence.|$|E
25|$|Here {{she enters}} the Crypt, a giant {{monolithic}} construct {{from before the}} Seven Days of Fire. She learns that the last scientists of the industrial era had foreseen {{the end of their}} civilization. They created the Sea of Corruption to clean the land of pollution, altered human genes to cope with the changed ecology, stored their own personalities inside the Crypt and waited for the day when they could re-emerge, leaving the world at the mercy of their artificially created caretaker. However, their continual manipulation of the population and the world's environment is at odds with Nausicaä's belief in the natural order. She argues that mankind's behaviour has not been improved significantly by the activities of those inside the crypt. Strife and cycles of violence have continued to plague the world in the thousand years following their interference. She orders the God-Warrior to destroy its progenitors, forcing humanity to <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> without further influence from the old society's technology.|$|E

500|$|Davis said, [...] "It {{was a huge}} thrill. I {{was excited}} to be picked by New York." [...] He {{received}} fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: [...] He just said they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game is <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, {{and learning how to}} play under pressure in front of all those people. He loved it, and I'm looking forward to it, too.|$|E
500|$|Later {{that day}} Tang proclaimed {{to his men}} that, [...] "Our army has entered into the final battle to defend Nanking on the Fukuo Line. Each unit shall firmly defend its post with the resolve to either <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> with it. You're not allowed to retreat on your own, causing defense to collapse." [...] The American {{journalist}} F. Tillman Durdin, who was reporting on site during the battle, saw one small group of Chinese soldiers set up a barricade, assemble in a solemn semicircle, and promise each other that they would die together where they stood.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, J.

[...] Regarding the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its [...] "free institutions", {{separation}} of powers, and the Bill of Rights.

500|$|Franklin was {{impressed}} by Pulaski, and wrote of him: [...] "Count Pulaski of Poland, an officer famous throughout Europe for his bravery and conduct in defence of the liberties of his country against the three great invading powers of Russia, Austria and Prussia... may be highly useful to our service." [...] He subsequently recommended that General George Washington accept Pulaski as a volunteer in the Continental Army cavalry and said that Pulaski [...] "was renowned throughout Europe for the courage and bravery he displayed in defense of his country's freedom." [...] Pulaski departed France from Nantes in June, and arrived in Marblehead, Massachusetts, near Boston, on July 23, 1777. After his arrival, Pulaski wrote to Washington, [...] "I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> for it." ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 November 2012, Debbie Schipp {{from the}} Herald Sun {{reported}} that Anderson {{would return to}} Home and Away in December to shoot [...] "a handful of episodes" [...] to be broadcast during the following year. Schipp revealed that there was [...] "intense speculation" [...] about how the writers would get around the fact that Charlie died on-screen in January. Of her return, Anderson explained [...] "I told my mum and dad that I was coming back, and they almost fell off their chairs. They said: 'Hang on, didn't Charlie die?' It's hilarious, because this time twelve months ago I was keeping it the biggest secret from everyone as to whether Charlie would <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die,</b> and now I'm {{in the same boat}} again as far as not giving anything away." [...] The actress added that the return storyline was outlined {{a couple of months ago}} and she just knew that she wanted to do it. Charlie returned on 17 June 2013.|$|E
500|$|The player's {{actions are}} not {{judged to be}} good or evil, but instead are tracked by a [...] "chaos" [...] system that records the amounts of {{friendly}} fire, violence, and deaths the player causes. This modifies the game world, affecting the story without punishing the player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another. For example, an NPC who disapproves of violence may refuse to support the player, or may even betray them. The game reacts to the chaos caused in scripted ways, such as changing dialogue, and dynamic ways, such as increasing the presence of rats and plagued citizens and adding new scenes. This can affect the active mission and future missions. The system also influences which of the game's two endings is reached, with variations based on which characters <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die.</b> Using violence allows missions {{to be completed in}} less time than using a stealth approach, but violence consumes more in-game resources such as health and mana potions, which are required more often in direct combat.|$|E

500|$|Fichtner {{was cast}} as Alexander Mahone {{one day before}} filming began for the second season. After acting the {{previous}} year in the series Invasion, Fichtner {{did not intend to}} return to network television. When approached with the scripts for the first two episodes of the second season Fichtner was uncertain of his character's background, but attracted to [...] "the potential of who this guy is." [...] Fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and, although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile, he later said that he was glad to have accepted the role. Fichtner has praised the quality of writing on the series, saying [...] "Television shows <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> on writing. The joy of Prison Break has been the writers. They're great and they forever challenged me, which makes the journey worth it." [...] Fichtner has also had several concerns with the scripts written for him, and talks to the writers {{to make sure that the}} character stays consistent. On at least one occasion, he has sat down with the writer and tweaked the entire script.|$|E
500|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold made {{a bid for}} the throne. Janet Nelson {{comments}} that [...] "in {{the eyes of many}} Englishmen as well as Scandinavians this ætheling had claims stronger than Edward's own." [...] According to the 'A' version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Æthelwold abducted a nun from her convent without the permission of King Edward and against the command of the bishop. Her identity is not known, but it must have been intended to strengthen his claim, and {{in the view of the}} historian Pauline Stafford, the Chronicle's account is biased in favour of Edward and might have been intended to delegitimise a politically important marriage. Æthelwold took her to the royal manors of Twynham (now Christchurch) and then Wimborne Minster, symbolically important as his father's burial place, and declared that [...] "he would <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> there". Lavelle sees Wimborne as strategically significant, close to Roman roads to Dorchester and Salisbury, and at a crossing point of the rivers Allen and Stour; it was the southernmost point for control of access to western Wessex and Æthelwold may have intended a division of the kingdom.|$|E
500|$|After Minh {{had ordered}} the rebels to search the areas {{known to have been}} frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was {{informed}} by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being [...] "I don't know whether I will <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat {{announced}} that Amy and Rory would {{leave in the}} seventh series in [...] "heartbreaking" [...] circumstances. Amy's exit was a mutual decision between Moffat and Gillan. Gillan stated {{that she wanted to}} go [...] "on a high when the character was at her prime" [...] and to [...] "go with everything that she wants". She wanted her character to have a final ending, and ruled out returning to the show in the future as she felt it would take away from the impact of her final scene. Moffat stated he felt [...] "tremendous pressure" [...] writing Amy and Rory's ending. He later revealed that he [...] "completely changed" [...] the ending as he was writing it, feeling the emphasis was wrong. During rewrites Moffat went back and forth deciding whether or not Amy and Rory should <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die.</b> He eventually decided that death would complement the storyline involving the [...] "old, sentimental" [...] and [...] "dangerous" [...] characterisation of the Doctor. At one point he considered making the story that involved the Daleks, but felt the Weeping Angels were a [...] "better fit". Moffat was also interested in coming up with a new form for the Angels, and so he introduced the cherubs. He also said that since the Angels had debuted in [...] "Blink", fans had suggested that the Statue of Liberty could be a Weeping Angel.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Scott of Sky Living wrote, [...] "while Clarkson {{is doing}} well musically, her love life still hasn't picked up and she is heartbroken once again. I'm sure the thought of another top ten hit might cheer her up!" [...] Scott Juba of The Trades {{considered}} [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as {{the highlight of the}} album, writing [...] "Now that [...] {{a few years older than}} she was when she recorded her first album, she brings more authenticity to relationship songs." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't Let Me Stop You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness." [...] Joe Cross of Cox Communications thought that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was a decent follow-up to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying [...] "It's no [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." [...] He also listed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005. The same sentiment was echoed by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy who considered the song as Clarkson's second best single after [...] "Since U Been Gone", writing [...] "It proved a slow burner at the time of release, but this track's greatness continues to be realised over time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 3 February 2009, Sirul Azhar {{pleaded with}} the court to not pass the death {{sentence}} on him, as he was like [...] "a black sheep {{that has to be}} sacrificed" [...] to protect unnamed people who have never been brought to court or faced questioning. [...] "I have no reason to cause hurt, what's more to take the life of the victim in such a cruel manner... I appeal to the court, which has the powers to determine if I <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die,</b> not to sentence me so as to fulfil others' plans for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|I'd place Pollock {{along with}} Hofmann and Morris Louis {{in this country}} among the very {{greatest}} painters of this generation. I actually don't think there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn't like Hofmann's paintings. He couldn't make them out. He didn't take the trouble to. And Hofmann didn't like Pollock's allover paintings, nor could most of Pollock's artist friends make head or tail out of them, {{the things he did}} from 1947 to '50. But Pollock's paintings <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die</b> in the same context as Rembrandt's or Titian's or Velázquez's or Goya's or David's or ...or Manet's or Ruben's or Michelangelo's paintings. There's no interruption, there's no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good Raphael was when he was good or Piero when he was good.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should <b>live</b> <b>or</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E
