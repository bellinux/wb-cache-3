50|$|The {{shagreen}} ray or fuller's ray, <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>fullonica,</b> is {{a species of}} skate in the family Rajidae. This ray {{is found in the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Murmansk, Russia through Norway, southern Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Celtic Sea, the northern North Sea and Skagerrak, to northern Morocco, including (infrequently) the western Mediterranean Sea and the Madeira Islands. It is absent from the shallow waters off England and Wales.|$|E
50|$|In the 17th century, the {{bottlenose}} skate was prized by the French for food. Because of {{its large}} size and slow reproductive rate, the bottlenose skate is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by fisheries. Anecdotal data {{suggests that there}} has been a substantial decline in the abundance and geographical range of this species in the north Atlantic and Mediterranean. In the north Atlantic, populations of bottlenose skates have declined severely or disappeared from the Bay of Biscay and the Irish Sea; there are no longer targeted fisheries in these regions due to localized population collapses in the 1960s. There are also no recent records of this species in the waters off the United Kingdom, where it historically occurred. The bottlenose ray still persists along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, though the population data is uncertain due to confusion with the shagreen ray (<b>Leucoraja</b> <b>fullonica)</b> and the sandy ray (L. circularis).|$|E
40|$|This Collective Article {{presents}} {{information on}} 22 species belonging to 5 Phyla, arranged geographically from from west to east. The new records {{were found in}} 8 countries as follows: Spain: first record of the two scarcely known nemerteans Baseodiscus delineatus and Notospermus geniculatus in Formentera; Malta: second record of the alien fish Lagocephalus sceleratus; Italy: the alien polychaete Syllis pectinans and the isopod Paranthura japonica, {{as well as the}} cryptogenic opisthobranch Anteaeolidiella lurana, were found in the fouling assemblages along the docks of the port of Livorno. New decapod records are reported from Sicily (the alien Callinectes sapidus and the native Pachygrapsus maurus) and Apulia (Percnon gibbosus and Procambarus clarkii); the lesser amberjack Seriola fasciata extended its geographical range to the Egadi Isands and Siganus luridus was documented for the first time along the Ionian coasts of Apulia and Calabria. Slovenia: the first record of the alien bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis is reported, together with a survey of up to date Adriatic records. Greece: the first record of the gastropod Rhinoclavis kochi is reported from Gavdos island. In addition, two records of endangered and rare cartilaginous fish were reported, namely, the shark Hexanchus griseus and the ray <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>fullonica,</b> as well as additional records of Siganus luridus for Lesvos and Malleus regula and Fulvia fragilis from Astypalaia. Turkey: the black wing flyingfish Hirundichthys rondeletii is reported {{for the very first time}} from the Black Sea. Egypt: the Indo-Pacific crab Halimede ochtodes is reported as established in Port Said. In addition, biometric parameters and meristic counts are reported for Anthias anthias in Damietta. Cyprus: the alien opisthobranch gastropod Bursatella leachii is reported for first time...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experimental}} longline {{surveys were}} {{carried out in the}} Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) cold-water coral province (Mediterranean Sea) during May-June and September-October 2010 to investigate the effect of corals on fish assemblages. Two types of "megahabitat" characterized by the virtual absence of fishing were explored. One was characterized by complex topography including mesohabitats with carbonate mounds and corals. The other type of megahabitat, although characterized by complex topographic features, lacks carbonate mounds and corals. The fishing vessel was equipped with a 3, 000 m monofilament longline with 500 hooks and snoods of 2. 5 m in length. A total of 9 hauls, using about 4, 500 hooks, {{were carried out}} both in the coral megahabitat and in the non-coral megahabitat during each survey. The fish <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>fullonica</b> and Pteroplatytrygon violacea represent new records for the SML coral province. The coral by-catch was only obtained in the coral megahabitat in about 55 % of the stations investigated in both surveys. The total catches and the abundance indices of several species were comparable between the two habitat typologies. The species contributing most to the dissimilarity between the two megahabitat fish assemblages were Pagellus bogaraveo, Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus spinax and Helicolenus dactylopterus for density and P. bogaraveo, Conger conger, Polyprion americanus and G. melastomus for biomass. P. bogaraveo was exclusively collected in the coral megahabitat, whereas C. conger, H. dactylopterus and P. americanus were found with greater abundance in the coral than in the non-coral megahabitat. Differences in the sizes between the two megahabitats were detected in E. spinax, G. melastomus, C. conger and H. dactylopterus. Although these differences most probably related to the presence-absence of corals, both megahabitats investigated play the role of attraction-refuge for deep-sea fish fauna, confirming the important role of the whole SML coral province as a refuge area from fishing...|$|E
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (<b>Leucoraja</b> <b>fullonica).</b> Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
40|$|The basal {{prerequisite}} for managing species and understanding ecosystems is correct species and population identification. Without knowing the species, we cannot with accuracy detect changes in distribution or abundance due to climate change, fisheries, diseases {{or any other}} types of impact. This thesis gives the first complete overview of chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras), recorded in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. A total of 49 species were found to occur, and the most specious regions were the Bering Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea, {{also known as the}} Arctic Gateways. The Bering Strait is an effective zoogeographic barrier, separating the Pacific from the Atlantic species. In particular, skates are prone to misidentifications. Species complexes are known to occur, and the group is commonly lumped as “Skates & Rays” in fishery statistics or in scientific publications. By use of genetic methods (DNA barcoding), the skate species reported from the northern Northeast (nNE) Atlantic was investigated. A total of 12 species were found to occur in the area, and three of those were new for the region. Skates are commonly encountered in the nNE Atlantic, but ~ 95 % are the smaller-sized Amblyraja radiata. Larger skates may be landed and they are necessarily a mix of the remaining 11 species, some of which are considered threatened. There were strong indications of the disappearance of <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>fullonica,</b> as well as over-reporting of the critically endangered common skate complex formerly known as Dipturus batis. Amblyraja radiata was suspected to be cryptic due to large differences in size-at-maturity across its distributional range. However, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) did not support this hypothesis. To further elucidate this question, a higher resolution method was applied, and 10 microsatellite markers were investigated from specimens across the North (N) Atlantic. Pairwise fixation indexes (FST) indicated that there may be three major clusters in the N Atlantic: Northwest Atlantic, Mid Atlantic (Greenland) and NE Atlantic. However, more rigorous tests revealed high physical mixing of individuals over a large geographical area. The microsatellite results did not support the hypothesis of A. radiata being cryptic. Although the population structure of A. radiata could not be fully explained, baselines for occurrence of chondrichthyan fishes are established, and a new identification guide for skates in the nNE Atlantic is provided. Hopefully, this will pave the way for a better management of the skates by improving data quality...|$|E
