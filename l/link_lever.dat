40|$|This study {{discusses}} the professionalisation {{of higher education}} management and emerging patterns of decision making within a context of academic and organisational change. A total of thirty interviews were conducted across six Universities, with five similar roles interviewed in each institution. Respondents were drawn from both centralised and decentralised parts of the organisation, and represented both academic and professional services perspectives. Three ideas are proposed. The first is an emerging New Collegiality in which decision making behaviour is developing that reflects traditional collegial debate, but within new peer groups of academic and professional services managers. Academic managers are also using New Collegiality to share good management practice, with new organisational combinations offering new forms of collaborative working within and across subject disciplines. A second theme proposes that a Higher Education Professional Services Framework exists, which has situationally contingent characteristics that are unique to the professional services in higher education. These features combine decision making and management behaviours to operate as a singular body positioned throughout the organisation in context specific ways. Finally, a third concept identifies three <b>linked</b> <b>levers</b> of management used by the centre to address tensions of internal demands for decentralisation against the external pressures to centralise. These <b>linked</b> <b>levers</b> consist {{of the creation of}} an intermediate tier such as a faculty or college, a proactive use of management information as an evidential tool for decision making, and a particular use of the Higher Education Professional Services Framework. The findings suggest that Universities are ostensibly decentralising their organisational structures while simultaneously centralising decision making authority through changes in accountability. These trends raise a number of relevant issues to the professionalisation of higher education. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economy of}} a large city is a complex system in which all links are closely interconnected. The slight {{malfunctioning}} {{of one of these}} links may throw the entire system out of balance. In most instances any disproportion is the result of defects in individual <b>links</b> and <b>levers</b> of the economic mechanism, particularly planning the volume of output (work, services), the distribution of capital investments and new technology, the utilization of manpower, etc. In the last decade the increase {{in the size of the}} population of such cities as Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, etc., has to a certain degree been regulated by the imposition of restrictions on residence permits. ...|$|R
50|$|A more {{successful}} scheme for equalizing the pony truck to the drivers {{was invented by}} William S. Hudson, superintendent of the Rogers Locomotive Works, and patented in 1864. In this design, a large equalizing <b>lever</b> <b>linked</b> the front truck with a transverse bar connected to the front spring hangers of the driving wheels. This design was an immediate success and was used on American-built locomotives {{until the end of}} steam building.|$|R

50|$|The Le Rhône engines used an {{unconventional}} valve actuation system, {{with a single}} centrally-pivoting rocker arm moving the exhaust valve and the intake valve. When the arm moved down it opened the intake valve and when it moved up it opened the exhaust value. To make this system work a two-way push-pull rod was fitted, instead of the more conventional one-way pushrod. This feature required the cam followers to incorporate a positive action, a function designed in by {{using a combination of}} <b>links</b> and <b>levers.</b> This design prevented valve overlap and so limited power output, but as the engine structure and cooling arrangements would not have been adequate at a higher power output this should not be considered a significant design fault.|$|R

Items and equipment can also be optionally upgraded using materials gathered from defeated monsters and within each overworld environment, making them stronger and more durable. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of shear strength of longitudinally reinforced concrete beams, {{in which a}} constant shear force acts throughout the shear span, is performed. The shear mechanism {{is found to be}} governed by a second order differential equation <b>linking</b> the internal <b>lever</b> arm with the distance from the support. The solution of the shear governing equation is provided, and then the corresponding shear expression is parametrically defined by means of a mechanical analysis. The empirical parameters are determined from more than 900 test data and results found in the literature. The proposed shear strength formula predicts the experimental behavior in a more accurate and uniform way than most known expressions. It is also proposed a design formula, which is more consistent and reliable than the Eurocode one and even than the laborious procedures suggested by ACI Code and AASHTO Standards, since it exhibits a minor number of unsafe predictions...|$|R
40|$|Smart Contracts {{have emerged}} as a novel way to {{automate}} the execution of contracts in a decentralised and secure environment, minimising the risk of breach or non-compliance. However, recent research {{points out that the}} same measures that secure Smart Contracts against disruption with the purpose of breach makes altering the terms, rights and conditions of contracts difficult. The same research proposes a set of standards inspired in paper-contract law that Smart Contract platforms should implement to enable Smart Contract Undo and Alteration. This paper is about preliminary work on describing terms, rights, and conditions of Smart Contracts as RDF documents <b>linked</b> to them, <b>levering</b> Semantic Web tools enabling: (i) Definition and checking of complex rights and conditions (ii) Separation of the terms of the contract from its execution logic.

50|$|Despite {{very closely}} {{resembling}} the American transmissions, GAZ's copies did have distinctive differences. First of all - their components were adopted to the metric units. Their gear ratios - to the car's engines. Both cars' handbrake actuated a central drum between the housing and the drive shaft, {{instead of the}} rear wheels. Thus a parking pawl was deemed redundant. Volga's transmission, based on the Fordomatic, required additional adaptation to the air-cooled torque converter, as it was driven by a 65 hp 4 cylinder engine. Controlled by a steering column mounted lever, it had four regimes: Зх-Н-Д-П (R-N-D-L). In Drive the car would start in second and automatically shift to third depending on throttle position (the valve was regulated by a <b>lever</b> <b>linked</b> to the accelerator pedal). A kick-down feature was also present. First gear could only be engaged manually in Low (though it could be engaged if the car was in motion, but would only donwshift) and was used for engine braking or rapid starts. Gear ratios were: 2.4 - 1.0 for the torque converter, 2.84 for first gear, 1.68 for second, third was direct and reverse was 1.72.|$|R

40|$|Emotions {{represent}} a significant means of nonverbal communication and their expression represents {{an important aspect}} of social robots functionality. There are two basic ways of expressing emotions. The first one is based on facial expressions that can be realized by moving a particular part of face or by displaying a picture on the screen that represents a face with characteristic features such as eyebrows, eyes, nose and mouth. Combining them is also possible. The second way of nonverbal communication is based on gestures, especially using arms. This paper presents an optimal synthesis of shrug mechanism for humanoid robots. Based on the set requirements the worm-lever mechanism is proposed. It has 1 DOF and enables simultaneous shrug of both shoulders. It consists of a worm which is meshed with two worm gears having different directions of rotation and two four-bar lever mechanisms whose input links are rigidly connected to the worm gears. Based on the kinematic-dynamic analysis the dynamic model is formed, the objective function is defined, the constraints are prescribed and the optimal synthesis is performed. The maximum torque on the input <b>link</b> of the <b>lever</b> mechanism, the driving torque of the complete worm-lever mechanism, the range of transmission angle and the rotation range of the worm gears are determined. The lever mechanism has high efficiency in all positions because the transmission angle has a high value during the whole movement. The worm mechanism enables a significant reduction of driving torque and has acceptable efficiency. The rotation range of the worm gear is small – the mechanism movement is very quick and therefore the shrug speed is large, which was the basic requirement for realization.

40|$|The {{writing of}} every new {{management}} study should include an enquiry into previous, related investigations. This approach helps {{to build up}} a comprehensive picture of the phenomena being considered. Researchers working in isolation tend to repeat past mistakes and rarely achieve much progress. Progress in management sciences comes from building on the efforts of those who have already worked on the subject. Research synthesis is therefore an important task in the theory building/theory testing process. In recent years, quantitative research synthesis (meta-analysis) has gained increasing acceptance. Meta-analysis offers a powerful set of tools for extracting quantitative information from a body of related research. It has already been applied in the fields of archaeology, astronomy, chemistry, education, geophysical science, psychology and public policy. However, it seems suitable even for management researchers since quantitative research is becoming more accepted in management disciplines. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the conditions of applicability of quantitative methods in summarizing past research by drawing overall conclusions from many separate studies. Meta-analysis will be applied to a specific topic of operations management (OM) : the <b>link</b> between JIT <b>levers</b> and manufacturing performance with particular reference to time performance. More specifically, an application of meta-analysis will be made with reference to two of the main steps towards the development of an empirically-tested theory: testing the adequacy of the measurement of variables and testing the linkages between the variables. The preliminary application of meta-analysis to OM has revealed distinct potential. However, in order for this potential to be fully exploited, a set of conditions should be established when publishing empirical research in operations management, in order to simplify the comparison of different studies which are related to the same issue. This recommendation is presented together with the final results of the present study...|$|R
