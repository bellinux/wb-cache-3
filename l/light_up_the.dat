5|$|In verse 11, {{the text}} makes a {{reference}} to a fragment from section 1.14 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, to metaphorically describe how to gain this knowledge. Making his own soul as the lower fire stick and Om the upper fire stick, states the Kaivalya Upanishad, one must rub these together, <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fire of knowledge, and burn the ties to ignorance.|$|E

The castle has one hundred rooms to enter through. If any characters enters a room, their group color will <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> room. Each of the princes starts with nine men-at-arms. Reinforcements will join the side of whoever last visit Gate Rooms. If no one entered a Gate Room before the man-at-arms appears, they will join the King's Guard.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E

5|$|If Magus {{joined the}} party, he departs {{to search for}} Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, {{prompting}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca to {{set out in the}} Epoch to find her while fireworks <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> night sky. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wall behind the band.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E

25|$|In the 1850s, many {{of these}} {{problems}} were solved by the arc lamp invented by William Petrie and William Staite. The lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control {{the gap between the}} two carbon rods. Their light was used to <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> National Gallery in London and was a great novelty at the time. These arc lamps and designs similar to it, powered by large magnetos, were first installed on English lighthouses in the mid 1850s, but the power limitations prevented these models from being a proper success.|$|E

25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that {{a beam of light}} from the eye could instantaneously <b>light</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stars every time someone blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E
