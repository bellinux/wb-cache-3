5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and <b>logical</b> <b>inference.</b> In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E

25|$|In earlier writings, Sanskrit 'Vedānta' simply {{referred}} to the Upanishads, the most speculative and philosophical of the Vedic texts. However, in the medieval period of Hinduism, the word Vedānta came to mean the school of philosophy that interpreted the Upanishads. Traditional Vedānta considers scriptural evidence, or shabda pramāna, as the most authentic means of knowledge, while perception, or pratyaksa, and <b>logical</b> <b>inference,</b> or anumana, {{are considered to be}} subordinate (but valid).|$|E

25|$|Logic-based {{approaches}} {{keep track}} of all logically consistent explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a <b>logical</b> <b>inference</b> process of circumscription. All actions, plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented {{by a set of}} first-order statements called event hierarchy encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{logic is}} the study of {{inference}} with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of Aristotle contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle. In many definitions of logic, <b>logical</b> <b>inference</b> and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 the {{astronomer}} Karl Schwarzschild pointed out an observation about double stars. The motion of two stars orbiting {{each other is}} planar, the two orbits {{of the stars of}} the system lie in a plane. In the case of sufficiently near double star systems, it can be seen from Earth whether the perihelion of the orbits of the two stars remains pointing in the same direction with respect to the solar system. Schwarzschild pointed out that that was invariably seen: the direction of the angular momentum of all observed double star systems remains fixed with respect to the direction of the angular momentum of the Solar system. The <b>logical</b> <b>inference</b> is that just like gyroscopes, the angular momentum of all celestial bodies is angular momentum with respect to a universal inertial space.|$|E

25|$|The first {{administration}} of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it {{was known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of definitions, arithmetic, classification, artificial language, antonyms, number series, analogies, <b>logical</b> <b>inference,</b> and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to Yale University and Smith College. The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. The raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale, although students could score more than 800 and less than 200.|$|E
500|$|The {{initial report}} {{received}} a mixed reception. In the US, a Congressional Research Service report by Dr. Thomas Lum {{stated that the}} Kilgour–Matas report relied largely on <b>logical</b> <b>inference,</b> without bringing forth new or independently obtained testimony; the credibility {{of much of the}} key evidence was said to be questionable. The initial 6 July 2006 report found that, [...] "the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained" [...] and concluded that [...] "there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners." [...] U.N. special rapporteur Manfred Nowak said in March 2007 that the chain of evidence Kilgour and Matas were documenting showed a [...] "coherent picture that causes concern", which the United Nations Committee Against Torture followed up in November 2008 with a request for [...] "a full explanation of the source of organ transplants", to investigate the claims of organ harvesting, and to take measures to prosecute those committing abuses. Other investigators, such as Ethan Gutmann, followed the Kilgour–Matas report; Gutmann estimating that between 450,000 and 1 million Falun Gong members were detained at any given time, and estimated that tens of thousands may have been targeted for organ harvesting.|$|E

Partly influenced {{by the work of}} Sydney Lamb, his goal was to make the meaning independent of the words used in the input, i.e. two sentences identical in meaning, would have a single representation.

40|$|Expert {{system and}} neural network both are {{intelligent}} technologies and share common goals. Both {{are used to}} deduct some <b>logical</b> <b>inferences</b> from a given data. While expert systems rely on <b>logical</b> <b>inferences</b> and focus on modeling human reasoning, neural network rely on parallel data processing and focus on modeling a human brain. Expert system treat the brain as a black box, since we don’t know what’s going inside the system, whereas neural network look at its structure and functions, particularly at its ability to learn. These difference {{can be seen in}} knowledge representation and data processing techniques used in expert systems and neural networks.

[...] Says Rand, [...] "The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, is logic.

60|$|We must, therefore, admit as {{derivative}} knowledge {{whatever is}} the result of intuitive knowledge even if by mere association, provided there is a valid logical connexion, and the person in question could become aware of this connexion by reflection. There are in fact many ways, besides <b>logical</b> <b>inference,</b> by which we pass from one belief to another: the passage from the print to its meaning illustrates these ways. These ways may be called 'psychological inference'. We shall, then, admit such psychological inference as a means of obtaining derivative knowledge, provided there is a discoverable <b>logical</b> <b>inference</b> which runs parallel to the psychological inference. This renders our definition of derivative knowledge less precise than we could wish, since the word 'discoverable' is vague: it does not tell us how much reflection may be needed {{in order to make the}} discovery. But in fact 'knowledge' is not a precise conception: it merges into 'probable opinion', as we shall see more fully in the course of the present chapter. A very precise definition, therefore, should not be sought, since any such definition must be more or less misleading.|$|E
