5|$|The {{first of}} three sons born in Adelaide,Unley to Martin and Jeanne (née Richardson), Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands {{as soon as he}} could walk, and his {{maternal}} grandfather was famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who captained Australia {{at the end of a}} nineteen-Test career. Chappell was given weekly batting <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> age of five, as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor, who both also went on to play for Australia.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{was born}} in 1885 in Lower Mitton, Stourport in Worcestershire. He was the eldest of four sons and three daughters of Walter Henry Harrison a grocer and candle maker {{from the village of}} Powick near Malvern, and his wife, Henriette Julien née Schoeller, a German-born former governess. He was educated at a dame school in Stourport, and at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Hartlebury. The family was musical; Walter Harrison was {{conductor}} of the Stourport Glee Union, and Henriette was Julius's first piano teacher. He later took organ and violin <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> organist of Wilden parish church, and sang in the church choir.|$|E

5|$|Mulgrew Miller {{was born}} in Greenwood, Mississippi, to parents who had been raised on plantations. He had three {{brothers}} and four sisters.

He had piano <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> age of eight. As a child, he played blues and rhythm and blues for dances, and gospel music in a church. His family was Methodist, but he played in churches of various denominations. His principal influence on piano at this stage was Ramsey Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{best known}} for his work in applied {{philosophy}} concerning refugees, immigration policy and genocide, Adelman published a major study entitled Early Warning and Conflict Management: Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda (1996) as part of the 5 volume study International Response to Conflict and Genocide: <b>Lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rwanda Experience. In 1999, he co-edited The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire, already regarded a classic on the subject. Adelman served as an associate editor for the Macmillan three-volume Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity (2005). These efforts earned international acclaim.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were {{intended}} as improved {{versions of the}} s, but were recast as battlecruisers after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, saw no real need for more battleships. A number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to {{the bulk of the}} Grand Fleet's battlecruisers so the design was revised to counter these. The class was going to consist of , Anson, Howe, and Rodney—all names of famous Admirals—but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. Their designs were updated to incorporate the <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to begin again with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Öland was {{the first}} of several major Swedish defeats at sea that ended in {{complete}} Danish dominance over the southern Baltic {{for the duration of the}} Scanian War. That the main naval base in Stockholm was locked in ice during the winter of 1675–76 showed the necessity of an ice-free harbor that was closer to Danish home waters. In 1679, King Charles personally chose the site for a new base at what would later become Karlskrona. The <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war also led to improvements in Swedish naval organization under the guidance of Hans Wachtmeister (1641–1714) which included better funding and maintenance, increased readiness for mobilization in the southern Baltic and permanent recruitment of skilled personnel through the allotment system.|$|E
5|$|The ships, {{named after}} provinces of France, were never {{completed}} due to shifting production requirements after {{the outbreak of}} war in 1914. The first four ships were sufficiently advanced in construction to permit their launching to clear the shipyards for other, more important work. Many of the guns built for the ships were instead converted {{for use by the}} Army. After the war, the French Navy considered several proposals to complete the ships, either as originally designed or modernized to account for <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war. The weak French post-war economy, however, necessitated that the first four ships be broken up for scrap. The last ship, which was not significantly advanced at the time work halted, was converted into an aircraft carrier in the 1920s. She remained in service in various capacities until the 1960s. The ship was ultimately scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful <b>lessons</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|E
