5|$|Prior to the North American hard court swing, Murray {{announced}} he was extending his partnership with Amélie Mauresmo {{until the end of}} the US Open, but was ideally looking for a long-term deal. He also revealed he had only just returned to a full training schedule following his back surgery <b>last</b> <b>September.</b> Murray reached back-to-back quarterfinals at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters, losing to eventual champions Jo Wilfried Tsonga, after being a break up in the decider, and Roger Federer, after being two breaks up in the second set, respectively. He made it to the quarterfinals of the 2014 US Open, losing to Novak Djokovic, after earning his first top ten win of the year in the previous round against Jo Wilfried Tsonga. This was the first season since 2009 where Murray failed to reach a grand slam final. As a consequence Murray fell outside of the top 10 ranking places for the first time since June 2008.|$|E
25|$|Despite his ranking {{dropping}} to 10th after Wimbledon, withdrawals from Nadal and del Potro meant that Murray was seeded eighth for the Canadian Open and thus received a first round bye. Before the tournament began, Murray {{announced that he}} would be extending his partnership with Mauresmo until at least the end of the US Open but was ideally looking for a long-term deal. Murray also revealed that he hadn't been able to train fully earlier in the year following his back surgery <b>last</b> <b>September,</b> but had now returned to a full training schedule. In his opening match at the Canadian Open he faced wild card Nick Kyrgios, who had also been a Wimbledon quarter-finalist after upsetting Rafael Nadal. However, Murray faced no such issues with the Australian teenager and recorded a straight sets win in just under an hour. Murray then advanced to the quarter-finals after Richard Gasquet withdrew before their third round match with an abdominal injury. Murray was defeated at the quarter-final stage by eventual champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, despite having been a break up in the final set.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{an article}} in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style:Cockburn's claim {{is that some of}} the quotes should not have been cited to their {{original}} sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: [...] "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged...." ...to which Cockburn responded:Quoting The Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing [...] "the original" [...] as opposed to the secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where [...] "the original" [...] means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage ("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled [...] "Citations Taken from Secondary Sources." [...] Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: [...] "'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted in") is generally to be discouraged, since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed."So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals. Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the language of Chicago's guidelines, cobbling together two separate discussions. On behalf of Dershowitz, Harvard Law School dean Elena Kagan asked former Harvard president Derek Bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism; Bok exonerated Dershowitz of the charge. In an April 3, 2007 interview with the Harvard Crimson, [...] "Dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter <b>last</b> <b>September</b> to DePaul faculty members lobbying against Finkelstein's tenure." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{president}} of the Institute of the Middle East, Yevgeny Satanovsky, told Itar-Tass on February 6 that [...] "The caricatures of Prophet Mohammad published {{as far back as}} <b>last</b> <b>September</b> angered the entire Islamic world but especially the countries where Iran’s influence is the strongest, and the apex of the conflict coincided precisely with the discussion of the Iranian nuclear dossier at the International Atomic Energy Agency." [...] This theory is echoed by Scientific Council of the Moscow Carnegie Centre member, Alexei Malashenko, who believes that [...] "the fuss around the caricatures was made artificially." [...] That is, {{at a time when the}} Muslim world has no concerted position either on the Iranian nuclear program or Hamas, whose ideology is opposed by moderate Islamic regimes, the caricature uproar provides a [...] "pretext for showing how coherent Muslims are." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Bowen classifies {{motherhood}} as {{a central}} problem in The House in Paris. [...] The machinations of Mme Fisher, of course, are {{the worst of all}} of the novel's mothers. In the past Max recalled of Mme Fisher, [...] "she acted on me like acid on a plate," [...] while Karen thought, [...] "She is a woman who sells girls; she is a witch." [...] After Mme Fisher contributed to Max's suicide, even her daughter Naomi [...] "saw then, that evil dominated our house." [...] In fact, Neil Corcoran sees Mme Fisher as [...] "quasi-vampiric," [...] since she [...] "does indeed draw blood from Max, when he slits his wrist in the house in front of her." [...] Additionally, Mrs. Michaelis presented some apathy and detachment to her daughter, although Karen {{went so far as to}} classify her mother as [...] "ruthless." [...] At one point, Karen was aware that her mother's passive-aggressive parenting caused a key power shift between them: [...] "She has made me lie for a week. [...] She will hold me inside the lie till she makes me lose the power I felt I had." [...] Aware of these troubling examples, in the present Karen longs to correct her abandonment and be a [...] "natural mother" [...] to Leopold, but her son realises that [...] "she would not lend herself to him." [...] Neil Corcoran calls Leopold's reaction to his mother's failure [...] "the novel's most concentrated expression of the psychological and emotional wounding that is parentlessness." [...] Bowen's attention to motherhood continues throughout her oeuvre, attending to difficult maternal figures like Mrs. Kelway in The Heat of the Day and Lady Naylor in The <b>Last</b> <b>September,</b> for example.|$|E
