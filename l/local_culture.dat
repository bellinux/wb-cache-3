50|$|The {{study of}} <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> in India {{has so far}} been {{confined}} to the traditional approach of the departments of folk culture, English literature and socio-anthropological studies. There is a need to release the study of <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> from these confines and to put it in a broader framework of interdisciplinary studies. Recognizing this, some of us, from within the Kuvempu University and the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap in Belgium came together to set up the Centre for the Study of <b>Local</b> <b>Cultures</b> (CSLC). Financial assistance for this project is provided by the Flemish Interuniversity Council - VLIR. The long-term goal of the Centre for the Study of <b>Local</b> <b>Cultures</b> is to become an internationally renowned research centre on South-Indian culture and society, which cultivates deep links with the local society and its cultural traditions.|$|R

5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell out of the mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on <b>local</b> <b>culture,</b> not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E

5|$|Despite Singapore's growing importance, the {{administration}} governing {{the island was}} understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with {{the welfare of the}} populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with <b>local</b> <b>culture</b> and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. As a result of {{the administration}}'s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.|$|E

From June 17 to July 2, 1994, the research trip flew to Beijing, China, which is where Pam Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall, Datong, Luoyang, Xi'an, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, and Guilin.|$|E
5|$|Resources {{and funds}} {{were needed to}} {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes professional services could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen and suppliers had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on <b>local</b> <b>culture</b> {{and the role of}} the state. Despite the special nature of the memorials, contractual arguments and issues over costs, timings and specifications were common, from smaller works in villages through to major works, such as the Vimy Memorial. The sheer volume of work encouraged industrial innovation: carving the inscriptions into the many thousands of British memorial stones had to originally be undertaken by hand, for example, until a Lancashire company invented an automated engraving process.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 census gave a total {{population}} of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population {{at the time was}} mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the Yangbajain Geothermal Station. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. Tibetan Buddhism and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the <b>local</b> <b>culture</b> since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.|$|E

40|$|Tourism policy {{matters in}} {{cultural}} tourism. The {{starting point of}} this paper is the observation that many tourism policy studies draw three inter-related conclusions. One, tourism policy must be inclusive and require the support of different stakeholders (Baker 2009; Bernhard Jørgensen and Munar 2009). Two, a balanced approach to tourism policy is needed to harness the benefits of tourism while mitigating negative effects (Budeanu 2009; Chang 1997; Jenkins 1997; Leheny 1995, Newby 1994; Teo and Yeoh, 1997). Three, tourism policies should accentuate and maintain the cultural uniqueness and authenticity of the destination (Morgan et al. 2011). It seems that many tourism authorities are ignorant of local interests, unaware of the touristification of <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> and uninterested in promoting <b>local</b> <b>cultures.</b> But <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> and communities are what that constitute cultural tourism...|$|R
40|$|Tourists visit a {{destination}} for only relatively {{short periods of time}} and they lack the local knowledge to truly appreciate the destination's local cul-tures. Under such conditions, tourists can easily misinterpret, ignore or not even notice many cultural aspects of the host society. However, tourists rely on cultural mediators and interpreters to help them understand and appreci-ate the destination's <b>local</b> <b>cultures.</b> This paper examines how the Singapore Tourism Board mediates the tourist cultural experience in Singapore. The process of helping tourists interpret and decode <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> is not simple or straight-forward. This process not only describes <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> to tourists, it also involves enticing tourists and drawing economic benefits from the enterprise. These goals may lead to the manufacturing of cultures for tourist consump-tion. This paper argües that the decoding of cultures for tourists extends beyond describing <b>local</b> <b>cultures</b> to tourists, it can initiate change in local soci-ety too. In sum, this paper asks these questions: What types of interpretations are offered to tourists? How would new tourist cultural producís, which are invented to enhance the promoted image of the destination, fit into and influ-ence the host society...|$|R
5|$|The Soviets and an American {{group of}} architects each devised {{separate}} outlines for rebuilding {{the town of}} Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American's proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that {{were found to be}} rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the <b>local</b> <b>culture.</b> For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical top-down approach to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan for rebuilding Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's grid plan road scheme was found to {{not take into account the}} hillside at the new city's location, and the American's plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} regions of Karnataka, the Western Gangas of Talakad were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas {{were followed by}} the imperial dynasties of the Badami Chalukya Empire, the Rashtrakuta Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from {{the west of the}} subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the Bahamani Sultanate of Bidar and the Bijapur Sultanate from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the <b>local</b> <b>culture</b> and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the <b>local</b> <b>culture,</b> so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E
