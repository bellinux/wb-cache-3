The roadway camber is 0.13 metres and there is an integral kerb at each side.

50|$|As {{the bridges}} were for light roadways {{and did not}} have to carry the weight of a railway or train, their girders were of a {{lightweight}} construction, known as Balloon flange girders that simplified manufacture. A full balloon upper flange was used, similar in shape to the South Wales Railway bridges, but the flange sat above the main web of the girder and the web did not span the flange and reach to the top. This simplified construction as it avoided the T-joint, the necessary L-strips and thus several rows of riveting. The <b>lower</b> <b>flange</b> was of an entirely novel form, being triangular in section, although with concave sides. Again, the main web did not span the flange.

40|$|Abstract. Composite beam using {{asymmetric}} H-shaped {{steel is}} one of the constructional structures developed in the advanced countries in Europe since early 1990 s. The purpose of this study on composite beams where H-shaped steel is partially laid in concrete slabs was to find how to design fire protection and improve fire-resistance to make deep deck plates provide the beams with advantages upon a fire and to improve stiffness in structural aspect. Only <b>lower</b> <b>flange</b> which is directly exposed to a fire was included in fire-resistance design in order to decide optimal fire-protection design condition and test was conducted for spray-coating and paint-coating. In the fire resistance test, web thickness and <b>lower</b> <b>flange</b> thickness were varied to derive the optimum condition for improving fire-resistance performance. It was observed from the test that 90 -minute-protection employed to <b>lower</b> <b>flange</b> provided fire resistance for 3 hours. It was also observed that the basic shape resisted fire for 89 minutes, while web reinforcement and <b>lower</b> <b>flange</b> reinforcement provided fire-resistance for 112 and 157 minutes, respectively.

40|$|The recent {{specification}} {{requires that}} lateral bracing {{must be provided}} to resist lateral forces and ensure stability of main girders. Based on the specification the unbraced length should not be geater than six meters and thirty times of the flange width for I section plate girders. Since no requirements related to lateral bracing are provided in the clause of composite girders, the requirements for plate girders have been applied correspondingly to composite girders. Lateral buckling modes of composite beams under negative bending {{differ from those of}} plate girders. The bucling modes of a composite beams may be assumed as the same modes of a inverted tee sections whose tip of the stem is hinged. The lateral buckling equation of an inverted tee section with a hinge is herein derived based on Vlasov's theory. Concludingly the minimum unbraced length of composite girders can be increased into about fifty times of the <b>lower</b> <b>flanges</b> from the buckling analysis.

40|$|A {{configuration}} of beam-to-column joint with circular hollow section columns is proposed. A vertical plate, called through-plate, {{passing through the}} column is used to support the beams. In order to facilitate connecting the beams, two horizontal plates, {{each side of the}} column, are welded to the upper side of the through-plate. The <b>lower</b> <b>flanges</b> of the steel beams are connected to the horizontal plates by bolts, and the upper flanges are attached to the concrete slab by shear connections. The joint is considered as hinges in the construction phase while semi-rigid and partial strength can be adopted for the joint behaviour during the exploitation time. A development on the through-plate component of the joint is presented in this paper. Global behaviour of the joint under hogging moment and shear force is analysed leading to a mechanical model of the through-plate component. Using the elastic buckling theory of plates, the analytical formulas for critical stresses of the through-plate are obtained. The coefficients taking into account boundary conditions, material plasticity and geometrical imperfection are determined by finite element analysis. The proposed model is validated by experimental results showing a good accuracy. The design guideline for the component is finally provided for the practical purpose. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|If the {{industry}} generally considers composite materials as potentially interesting, {{the lack of}} durability makes their often limited employment. Indeed, the design of composite structures often requires taking account of the long-term behaviour under various types of complex solicitations. This study {{is based on the}} development of a methodology for modeling the long term behavior under constant load for multilayer composite structures subjected to complex solicitations. This study is on the evaluation of the long-term behaviour of tri-layers glass/polyester-wood composite material. The objective is the evaluation of the long term strength of this material by the Goldenblat-Kopnov criterion. The studied model is an orthotropic tri layer plate of sandwich type with upper and <b>lower</b> <b>flanges</b> (skins) are in composite material glass/polyester KACT-B and the intermediate layer (soul) is pine wood. The character of loading of the plate is reflected in the model by the functions &sigmaik(&xi), &sigmamn(&xi) which can be of different natures. For example, to load in the long term by constant constraints in time (the weight own element for example), we will have: &sigmaik = const &sigmamn = const.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the fire resistance behaviour of the Ultra Shallow Floor Beams (USFB) partially {{encased in concrete}} using numerical analysis method based on material specifications of the EN 1994 - 1 - 2. Investigating the behavior of USFBs under elevated temperatures is crucial in determining their fire resistance and evaluating their overall performance in contemporary construction. Even though the manufacturing company provides fire resistances for USFBs based on EC 4 - 1 - 2 procedures, their response to elevated temperature effects remains up to date neither well documented nor clearly understood. The analyses involved two different beams of span 5 m and 8 m respectively, as specified by the manufacturer. Analysis results showed that such beams, when unprotected, experience severe temperature gradients if exposed to fire, as the <b>lower</b> <b>flange</b> still remains unprotected {{in contrast to the}} concrete encased part of the cross-section. As it was anticipated, the moment capacity governs the fire resistance of the beams and the load factor highly effects the elevated temperature behavior. In addition, the loss of the <b>lower</b> <b>flange,</b> which develops high temperatures, is not compensated by the web and consequently the moment capacity ultimately depends on the temperature of the <b>lower</b> <b>flange.</b> Results also suggest that simulated beams sustained the applied load for approximately 40 min of exposure to the standard fire...|$|E

40|$|Wake fields excited {{in a small}} gap of {{a vacuum}} chamber by ampere beams can have enough {{amplitude}} to heat the chamber. The electric component of these fields can be above the arcing limit. Usually flange connections in a vacuum chamber contain a vacuum gasket and an inner RF gasket. If a small gap occurs between the RF gasket and flange surface, wake fields can heat the flanges. The flanges are usually made of stainless steel, which efficiently absorbs RF power. Some flanges consist of two parts (like a vacuum valve flange) and are mechanically connected but have poor thermal contact. A temperature rise can lengthen the inner part of the flange and make firmer the thermal contact to the outer part of the flange. The heat will then flow to the outer part of the flange, which is air and water-cooled. This cooling <b>lowers</b> the <b>flange</b> temperature and the thermal contact becomes poor again.
