50|$|Pouch <b>laminators</b> are {{designed}} for moderate use in the office or home. For continuous, large-volume lamination projects, a roll laminator performs more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|A heated roll {{laminator}} uses heated rollers to {{melt glue}} extruded onto lamination film. This film is in turn {{applied to a}} substrate such as paper or card using pressure rollers. The primary purpose of laminating with such a machine is to embellish or protect printed documents or images. Heated roll <b>laminators</b> can vary in size from office based pouch <b>laminators</b> to industrial sized machines. Such industrial machines are primarily used for high quantity/quality output by printers or print finishers.|$|E
50|$|A pouch <b>laminator</b> uses a {{lamination}} pouch that {{is usually}} sealed on one side. The inside of the lamination pouch is coated with a heat-activated film that adheres to the product being laminated as it runs through the <b>laminator.</b> The substrate side of the board contains a heat-activated adhesive that bonds the print to the substrate. This can be any {{of a number of}} board products or another sheet of laminate. The pouch containing the print, laminate, and substrate is passed through a set of heated rollers under pressure, ensuring that all adhesive layers bond to one another.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHand layup {{is still}} the {{dominant}} forming process {{for the creation of}} the widest range of complex geometry and mixed material composite parts. However, this process is still poorly understood and informed, limiting productivity. This paper seeks to address this issue by proposing a novel and low cost system enabling a <b>laminator</b> to be guided in real-time, based on a predetermined instruction set, thus improving the standardisation of produced components. Within this paper the current methodologies are critiqued and future trends are predicted, prior to introducing the required input and outputs, and developing the implemented system. As a demonstrator a U-Shaped component typical of the complex geometry found in many difficult to manufacture composite parts was chosen, and its drapeability assessed by the use of a kinematic drape simulation tool. An experienced <b>laminator's</b> knowledgebase was then used to divide the tool into a finite number of features, with layup conducted by projecting and sequentially highlighting target features while tracking a <b>laminator's</b> hand movements across the ply. The system has been implemented with affordable hardware and demonstrates tangible benefits in comparison to currently employed laser-based systems. It has shown remarkable success to date, with rapid Technology Readiness Level advancement. This is a major stepping stone towards augmenting manual labour, with further benefits including more appropriate automation...|$|R
50|$|Whether {{small office}} or {{industrial}} machines their primary {{function is to}} embellish or protect printed works. Such <b>laminators</b> are used to apply varying thicknesses of lamination film onto substrates such as paper or fabrics. The main advantage {{to the use of}} heated roll <b>laminators</b> is that of speed. Heated <b>laminators</b> use heated rollers or heated shoes to melt the glue which is applied to lamination film. The process of heating the glue prior to applying the film to a substrate allows for a faster application of the film. The laminates and adhesives used are generally cheaper to manufacture than cold roll laminates, often as much as half the cost depending on the comparison made. As the materials are non-adhesive until exposed to heat, they are much easier to handle. The glue is solid at room temperature, so lamination of this type is less likely to shift or warp after its application than pressure activated laminates, which rely on a highly viscous, adhesive fluid.|$|E
50|$|Printers or print {{finishers}} {{often use}} industrial heated roll <b>laminators</b> to laminate {{such things as}} paperback book covers, magazine covers, posters, cards and postcards, in-shop displays {{as well as other}} applications.|$|E
50|$|Cold roll <b>laminators</b> use {{a plastic}} film which is coated with an {{adhesive}} and glossy backing {{which does not}} adhere to the glue. When the glossy backing is removed, the adhesive is exposed, which then sticks directly onto the item which needs to be laminated. This method, apart from having the obvious benefit of not requiring expensive equipment, is also suitable for those items which would be damaged by heat. Cold <b>laminators</b> range from simple two roller, hand crank machines up to large and complex motor driven machines with high precision rollers, adjustable roller pressure and other advanced features.|$|E

50|$|More complex ID {{cards are}} now being created by {{printing}} on a material called Teslin or Artisyn, which are paper-like materials that are actually micro-porous plastic sheets. When butterfly pouches and holograms are applied, the card is then run through a heat <b>laminator</b> which creates a professional-looking ID card.|$|R

50|$|Roll <b>laminators</b> {{typically}} use two {{rolls to}} complete the lamination process, with one roll being on top and the other roll on the bottom. These rolls slide onto metal bars, known as mandrels, which are then placed in the machine and feed through it. In the United States, the most common core size found on lamination film is one inch (25- to 27-inch-wide film). Larger format <b>laminators</b> use a larger core, often 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Film is usually available in 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mil thicknesses. The higher the number, the thicker the film. A mil is one thousandth of an inch (.001").|$|E
50|$|Cold roll <b>laminators</b> {{are also}} used for laying down {{adhesive}} films in the sign making industry, for example mounting a large print onto a board. A practiced operator can apply a large adhesive sheet in {{a fraction of the}} time it takes to do so by hand.|$|E

50|$|In many {{hospitals}} in the United Kingdom, many common ultrasound sonogram devices output {{the results of the}} scan onto thermal paper. This can cause problems if the parents wish to preserve the image by laminating it, as the heat of most <b>laminators</b> will darken the entire page—this can be tested for beforehand on an unimportant thermal print. An option is to make and laminate a permanent ink duplicate of the image.|$|E

In 1947, John Green, a yachtsman friend, paid Tritt to design and build a racing sailboat in the twenty foot range. Fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) seemed the logical construction material, and Otto Bayer of Wizard Boats was enlisted as <b>laminator.</b> The boat was named the Green Dolphin, and four were built. This was Tritt's introduction to FRP.|$|R
50|$|Many pouch <b>laminators</b> {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps prevent the hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the rollers. The carrier {{prevents}} the rollers from getting sticky, which helps to prevent the lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the laminator.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} for the thesis {{project is to}} find a suitable mathematical model of the velocity dependent friction force that arises between the nip roller and the carton material in the <b>laminator</b> at slip, in order to enable realistic simulations of the nip in the <b>laminator.</b> Theoretically, the LuGre model is found to contain the necessary physical properties for the actual situation. Experiments are conducted measuring friction between a rubber sample and carton samples in order to find an expansion and validation of the model. The model is found to produce a satisfac-tory low-magnitude residual in relation to the experiments for the range that varies with velocity. During the low velocities high-amplitude friction induced oscillations appear making the measurements highly inaccurate. It is known, however, that the slip will never reach these low velocities so this source of error is disregarded. Also, the measurement instrument is found not to be entirely ideal for this project. An instrument that can continuously change the velocity would be better. This model is good for most of the nip cases. However, further investigations are needed for the boundary effects that arise due to the cylindrical shape of the rollers and also a way to identify the dynamical parameters and thus expand from a steady-state model to a dynamical model...|$|R
