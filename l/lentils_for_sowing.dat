40|$|Currently, swine {{building}} ventilation {{design is}} based on heat and moisture rates measured in the 1950 s and 1970 s. Advancements in genetics, nutrition and management practices to increase productivity and pork quality during this period likely have led to considerable changes in heat and moisture production rates of the animals and their housing systems. This study quantifies total heat production rate (THP), house-level moisture production rate (MP) and house-level sensible heat production rate (SHP) of a 4300 -sow breeding, gestation, and farrowing facility in Iowa for 17 consecutive months. THP was determined using indirect animal calorimetry, MP was determined from mass balance, and SHP was calculated as the difference between THP and latent heat production (LHP). A Mobile Air Emission Monitoring Unit (MAEMU) was installed to monitor the deep-pit breeding-early gestation barn (1800 head), the deep-pit late gestation barn (1800 head), and two shallow-pit (pull-plug) farrowing rooms (40 head per room). This paper reports on data collected from February 2012 through {{the completion of the}} study in June 2013. Preliminary results from the study show that THP averages 373 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 376 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 1191 W/sow+litter <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. The house-level MP averages 198 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 192 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, 818 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. Finally the house-level SHP averages 223 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 230 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 572 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. Compared with the ASABE standards, values from the current study <b>for</b> gestation <b>sows</b> showed increases of 55 % in THP, 20 % in MP, and 58 % in SHP. Similarly, values <b>for</b> farrowing <b>sow</b> and litter showed increases of 85 % in THP, 64 % in MP, and 80 % in SHP relative to the ASABE standards...|$|R

Literature summary is focused to the principles of seed reproduction, ecological seed production legislation and seed checking and inspection. The bachelor dissertation results in low share of areas of reproduction in comparision with the total area of arable soil in ecological agriculture. It is related to insufficient proposal of bioquality seeds in the Czech Republic, for example in comparison with neighbouring Austria. Ecological farmers establish vegetations in practice and they mostly use farmer seeds (58 %), conventional unimpregnate seeds (37 %) and minimum of bioquality seeds (5 %) ...|$|R
