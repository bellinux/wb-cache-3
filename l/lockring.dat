25|$|There {{are many}} options for rotor mounting. IS is a six-bolt mount {{and is the}} {{industry}} standard. Centerlock is patented by Shimano and uses a splined interface along with a <b>lockring</b> to secure the disc. The advantages of centerlock are that the splined interface is theoretically stiffer, and removing the disc is quicker because it only requires one <b>lockring</b> to be removed. Some of the disadvantages are that the design is patented requiring a licensing fee from Shimano. A Shimano cassette <b>lockring</b> tool (or an external BB tool in case of through-axle hub) is needed to remove the rotor and is more expensive and less common than a Torx key. Advantages of IS six-bolt are {{that there are more}} choices when it comes to hubs and rotors.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a <b>lockring</b> may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket <b>lockring</b> is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket <b>lockring</b> is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{companies}} sell bicycle frames {{designed specifically}} for use with fixed-gear hubs. A fixed-gear or track-bike hub includes special threads for a <b>lockring</b> that tightens in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction compared with the cog. [...] This ensures that the cog cannot unscrew when the rider [...] "backpedals" [...] while braking.|$|E
40|$|Sharing {{personal}} content online {{is surprisingly}} hard {{despite the recent}} emergence of {{a huge number of}} content sharing systems and sites. These systems suffer from several drawbacks: they each have a different way of providing access control which cannot be used with other systems; moving to a new system is a lengthy process and requires registration and invitation of all one’s friends to the new system; and the rules for access control are complicated and become more so as our networks of online friends grow. In this paper, we present <b>Lockr</b> – an access control scheme based on social relationships that makes sharing personal content easy. <b>Lockr</b> separates social networking information from the content sharing mechanisms, thereby eliminating the need for users to maintain many site-specific copies of their social networks. We describe <b>Lockr’s</b> design, security properties, and limitations. We also present how we integrated <b>Lockr</b> with two popular systems for sharing content online – BitTorrent and Flickr...|$|R

50|$|If a track hub is not available, or if a {{beginner}} wishes {{to try a}} fixed gear bicycle without buying a new hub or rear wheel, track cogs can be installed on a standard Freewheel hub using a right hand threaded ISO English bottom bracket <b>lockring</b> as the <b>lockring</b> for the cog (the threads are exactly the same). This may work for some lighter, or delicate riders, but any repeated reverse or braking pressure on the pedals will eventually cause the cog and <b>lockring</b> to come loose. It is recommended that anyone using a freewheel hub with a track cog in this manner do so with caution and with both front and rear brakes mounted to the bicycle.|$|E

5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left hand threads {{to accept a}} <b>lockring.</b> The <b>lockring</b> is reverse threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand <b>lockring</b> (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for lock ring compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed.|$|E

At full pressure, the force acting against {{the door of the}} grey machine is over one thousand tons. Both machines use rotating <b>lockring</b> doors; the larger one is hydraulically turned, the smaller is pneumatic.|$|E
5000|$|The MG 15 fires {{from an open}} bolt, {{meaning that}} the bolt stays back when the gun is ready to fire, and also making it nearly {{impossible}} for [...] "through the propeller" [...] synchronized forward firing on a fuselage mount. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt and allows it to go forward, stripping a round from the magazine. The bolt continues pushing the round into the chamber and locks up when the <b>lockring</b> rotates and locks the bolt and barrel extension together. At this point the trip lever releases the firing pin and the gun fires. Recoil pushes the barrel, lock and bolt backwards until the <b>lockring</b> hits a cam that rotates it unlocking the bolt and barrel. Inertia carries the bolt backwards until {{the base of the}} fired case hits the ejector flinging the empty out of the receiver. If the trigger is held down the cycle will continue. If the trigger is released the bolt will remain in the rearward position.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{removal from}} the hub {{and of the}} cassette, there is limited, if any, access for {{cleaning}} and lubrication. The part can be fabricated relatively inexpensively and {{is not intended to}} be serviced or disassembled with hand tools. The latter is only possible by means of specialized or shop equipment. The outer cup covering the ratchet pawls and bearings is pressed into place at the factory, secured by interference fit, leveraging the same inner threads of the shell into which the cassette <b>lockring</b> normally screws.|$|E
50|$|Cassettes are {{distinguished}} from freewheels in that a cassette has {{a series of}} straight splines that form the mechanical connection between the sprockets and the cassette compatible hub, called a freehub, which contains the ratcheting mechanism. The entire cassette is held on the hub {{by means of a}} threaded <b>lockring.</b> Some cassette systems from the late 1980s and early 1990s use a threaded small sprocket to hold on the larger splined sprockets. Cassettes resemble freewheels when installed, but are clearly different when removed as they do not contain a freewheel's internal ratcheting mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Freewheels are {{threaded}} onto an axle hub, using conventional right-hand threads. As {{the bicycle}} rider pedals, the freewheel is continuously kept tight, as chain torque {{is in the}} right-hand direction. This becomes a problem when the freewheel needs to be removed. Having undergone high torque from leg muscles, {{it is difficult to}} loosen and remove the freewheels. A freehub, on the other hand, has cogs that slide onto an axially-splined cylindrical outer shell. A <b>lockring</b> or the last cog(s) are threaded onto the freehub. It is fastened to the wheel hub itself with a hollow retaining screw (for example, using a hex key on some models) through which the axle is inserted during operation.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, {{one side}} has a fixed type stepped threading, {{and the other}} side is {{threaded}} for a standard freewheel. Occasionally you may find double sided fixed hubs with stepped threading on both sides, but these are rare and only a few companies offer them. The fixed side has a stepped down diameter thread to accept a <b>lockring.</b> The larger diameter thread on the fixed side accepts a standard threaded cog, and uses the same size threads as the freewheel side of the hub. The most common standard I.S.O. thread size is 1.375" [...] x 24 tpi (threads per inch), but there are other less common older sizes (British 1.370" [...] x 24 tpi, French 34.7 x 1 mm, Italian 35 mm x 24 tpi).|$|E
