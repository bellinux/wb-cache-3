40|$|Research of {{the effect}} of giving {{mangosteen}} <b>leather</b> <b>flour</b> (Garcinia mangostana L.) as additive feed on performance of goat etawah cross breed (PE) has been conducted in Limpok Village, Darussalam Subdistrict, Aceh Province from March to May, 2016. The purpose of this research was to determined performance of goat etawah cross breed that was given mangosteen <b>leather</b> <b>flour</b> as additive feed to increase livestock production quality. This research was used 16 Etawah goats. This research was used Randomized Block Design (RBD) which consists of 4 treatments, 4 replications and livestock was grouped by lactation mass until obtained 16 unit trials. Each treatment consists of A treatment (control rations without mangosteen <b>leather</b> <b>flour),</b> B treatment (rations with added mangosteen leathet flour 2. 5 %), C treatment (rations with added mangosteen leathet flour 5 %), and D treatment (rations with added mangosteen leathet flour 7. 5 %). The research data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Parameters measured were : increasing of weight gain, feed consumption, rations convertion, and increasing of the udder volume. The results showed that the differences were not significant (P> 0. 05) on increasing of weight gain, feed consumption, ration conversion, and increasing of the udder volume.

50|$|Valdivia prospered with industries, {{including}} shipyards, the Hoffmann gristmill, the Rudloff shoe factory, the Anwandter beer {{company and}} many more. The steel mills of Corral were the largest recorded private investment in Chile at the time, {{and were the}} first steel mills in South America. In 1891 Valdivia became a commune according to a law that created such subdivisions. After the Malleco Viaduct was built in 1890 the railroads advanced further south, reaching Valdivia in 1895. The first passenger train arrived in 1899. In 1909 a fire destroyed 18 city blocks in downtown Valdivia, which were rebuilt with modern concrete buildings. By 1911 lumber production, from clearing of native forests, became the most important industry. Cattle-raising was a growing industry, and wheat was grown on the cleared lands. Lumber, cattle, <b>leather,</b> <b>flour</b> and beer were exported. In 1895 the city's population was 8,062 inhabitants and was estimated at 9,704 in 1902.|$|R
