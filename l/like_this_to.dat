5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> be addressed.|$|E

25|$|At one point, {{it began}} to rain, and the weather {{conditions}} would get worse as the game continued. There was much speculation, including that from Fox baseball commentators Joe Buck and Tim McCarver, that the game may be called early because of the weather. Major League Baseball rules state that the game could have been called after the 5th inning, ending the game and resulting in the Phillies winning the World Series. MLB commissioner Bud Selig had {{made it clear to}} both teams prior to the game anyway, that the game would not be called early under any circumstance, as he would not allow such an important game <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> be ended before the 9th inning. However, such a controversy was prevented from happening because of the events on the field, when in the 6th inning, Carlos Peña scored B.J. Upton to tie the game at 2–2.|$|E

500|$|Pfefferberg, {{one of the}} Schindlerjuden, made it his life's {{mission to}} tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg {{attempted}} to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. [...] "I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character," [...] he said. [...] "What would drive a man <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?" [...] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years. In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> coach us." ...|$|E
500|$|Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian {{stated the}} series is [...] "one of those shiny and insubstantial series," [...] adding that [...] "all that leaping out of bed at dawn on the pretext {{that you have to}} go and sell a house tends to wear thin." [...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected" [...] and stated, [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid it has to be true." [...] Fellow Guardian {{reviewer}} Gareth McLean stated that Spooks is [...] "so good it makes {{you want to be a}} spy." [...] Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak rated the series eight out of ten, calling it [...] "thrilling, dramatic, and fast", while [...] "much more concise" [...] than many American series. Landmann added; [...] "Each story is complex and convincing, plus the scripts are very well written. A lot goes on in each episode, and it's detrimental for a show <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> keep the action and tension going as fast as possible." [...] The reviewer also noted that having only six episodes worked as an advantage over American television, stating [...] "while this seems incredibly short, the idea is actually very good. This ensures that each episode is strong in content and execution. American shows tend to run for 20–25 episodes a season, and while developments occur, there are always the filler episodes. With [...] there is nothing like it, no filler material at all. In fact, the first season sees a lot of development." ...|$|E
500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she really would choose a guy who would do something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E

500|$|The 1909 score {{contains}} {{a number of}} minor changes from the autograph score. Some are changes of phrase: Cavaradossi's reply to the sacristan when he asks if the painter is doing penance is changed from [...] "Pranzai" [...] ("I have eaten.") to [...] "Fame non ho" [...] ("I am not hungry."), which William Ashbrook states, {{in his study of}} Puccini's operas, accentuates the class distinction between the two. When Tosca comforts Cavaradossi after the torture scene, she now tells him, [...] "Ma il giusto Iddio lo punirá" [...] ("But a just God will punish him" [...] ); formerly she stated, [...] "Ma il sozzo sbirro lo pagherà" [...] ("But the filthy cop will pay for it."). Other changes are in the music; when Tosca demands the price for Cavaradossi's freedom ("Il prezzo!"), her music is changed to eliminate an octave leap, allowing her more opportunity to express her contempt and loathing of Scarpia in a passage which is now near the middle of the soprano vocal range. A remnant of a [...] "Latin Hymn" [...] sung by Tosca and Cavaradossi in act 3 survived into the first published score and libretto, but is not in later versions. According to Ashbrook, the most surprising change is where, after Tosca discovers the truth about the [...] "mock" [...] execution and exclaims [...] "Finire così? Finire così?" [...] ("To end <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> <b>To</b> end like this?"), she was to sing a five-bar fragment to the melody of [...] "E lucevan le stelle". Ashbrook applauds Puccini for deleting the section from a point in the work where delay is almost unendurable as events rush to their conclusion, but points out that the orchestra's recalling [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] in the final notes would seem less incongruous if it was meant to underscore Tosca's and Cavaradossi's love for each other, rather than being simply a melody which Tosca never hears.|$|E
