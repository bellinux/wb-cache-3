40|$|The {{reduction}} behaviour of the olivine {{iron ore}} pellet MPBOwas studied in laboratory scale at KTH {{as well as}} in the LKABexperimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Initially, a newreduction-under-load, or so-called reduction/softening/melting,test equipment was developed. Experiments using differentreducing conditions, corresponding to different radialpositions of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace,</b> were conducted. The experimentsincluded different temperature profiles, reducing atmospheresand mechanical loads applied on the sample bed to simulate thevarying conditions in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> process. The progressof reduction was investigated, as well as the processes ofsintering and contraction during reduction. A model of thecarburisation (pick-up of carbon by the reduced iron) andmelt-down process during rapid contraction was presented. Laboratory testing of MPBO pellets was compared with resultsfrom the LKAB experimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> The reduction of ironore pellets in the experimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> was surveyed by adissection of the furnace after quenching. The high temperaturephenomena occurring when reducing the MPBO pellet, with limitedsoftening and a short temperature range of the melting process,resulting in a thin cohesive zone, were found to be the same inlaboratorytests and in the experimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Thereduction down through the burden of the experimental blastfurnace was similar, but not identical to the results of theRUL experiments. The differences were found to be due todifferent reducing conditions. Therefore, it was concluded thata simulation of the reduction occurring in the blast furnacecan be performed in laboratory scale, provided the experimentalconditions are correctly chosen.
