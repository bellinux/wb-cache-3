5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E

25|$|After {{many months}} of waiting at Oscott College, Barberi finally secured {{possession}} of Aston Hall {{and so in}} February, 1842, after twenty-eight years of effort, he established the Passionists in England, at Aston Hall, Staffordshire. The reception of Barberi and his fellow Passionists was less than welcoming. The local Catholics feared the arrival of these newcomers would cause renewed persecutions. Barberi was also met with ridicule; his attempts to read prayers in English were met with the <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> his congregation. The community increased in numbers and as the people of Aston grew to know Barberi they became enamoured of him and Barberi soon began to receive {{a steady stream of}} converts. A centre was also set up in neighboring Stone where Barberi would say Mass and preach to the local populace.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, Mosby was unhappy, {{despite the}} electoral victory {{of his friend}} Garfield in November and his son Beverley joining him as vice-consul. His {{repeated}} requests for leave to return home and visit {{the rest of his}} family kept being denied, as were most requests for supplies or funds, and one relative was removed from the Lighthouse Board. In addition to the press and bureaucratic sniping, Mosby found his salary insufficient to support socialization among the local merchant class. Still, as the new year began, Mosby won a slander lawsuit brought against him in Hong Kong by Peter Smith, the sailors' boardinghouse keeper associated with ex-consul Bailey, reporting that he defended himself to the applause of jury and spectators, as well as <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> the distinguished judge. By the time Mosby received notice that his U.S. leave had been approved, President Garfield had been assassinated and was hanging on to life. Garfield died on September 20, and President Chester Arthur considered promoting Mosby to the similar post at Shangai (with higher living expenses), but Mosby wanted to either return home or remain in Hong Kong. Thus he remained in exile and dealt with the implications of the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the growing opium trade and the brewing war between France and China.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough and walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{described}} {{performances by}} FIG as a [...] "sonic negotiation of eroticism, resistance, liberation, joy, pleasure, power, and agency, a multilayered call and response between individual improvisers {{and a community}} of listeners".

500|$|The {{first section}} of Either is a {{collection}} of many tangential aphorisms, epigrams, anecdotes and musings on the aesthetic mode of life. The word 'diapsalmata' is related to 'psalms', and means [...] "refrains". It contains some of Kierkegaard's most famous and poetic lines, such as [...] "What is a poet?", [...] "Freedom of Speech" [...] vs. [...] "Freedom of Thought", the [...] "Unmovable chess piece", the tragic clown, and the <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> the gods.|$|E
500|$|The novel shows irony with [...] "unmistakable {{strains of}} cynicism,...laughing at human nature without any real hope of {{changing}} it". Laughter in the story, which ranges from irresponsible laughter to laughter at people and <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> amusement and relief, {{can also be}} linked to the sexual tensions among the different characters. Despite their appeal to modern audiences, laughter and wit were seen as vulgar and irreverent in Austen's time. The BBC drama made changes [...] "with a view to exposing a character, or adding humour or irony to a situation". The adaptation comically exaggerates the characters of Mrs. Bennet, Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins, even showing Mrs. Bennet on the verge of hysteria in many of the early scenes.|$|E

500|$|Ayola's {{first film}} {{appearance}} {{was in the}} 1993 film Great Moments in Aviation, written by Jeanette Winterson, in which she starred alongside Jonathan Pryce and John Hurt. Variety magazine's David Rooney said of her performance: [...] "In the film's most naturalistic turn, Ayola is a constant pleasure to watch. Unforced and appealing, she often succeeds in pulling the fanciful fireworks momentarily back down to Earth." [...] Ayola recalls having been daunted {{at the prospect of}} working alongside so many established names, but has deemed it to have been a [...] "wonderful experience". Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret <b>Laughter</b> <b>of</b> Women, set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth, thriller The i Inside, filmed in Sully Hospital, Cardiff, and starring Ryan Phillippe, and Sahara, filmed in Morocco whilst Ayola was pregnant with her first child, starring Penélope Cruz. Ayola says of her film career: [...] "I really like doing film [...] I've not done enough big films though to really know the difference between film and television." ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly {{response from the}} audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, apart from the enthusiastic <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> a few in the audience. The major media outlets {{paid little attention to}} it initially. Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin and Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin claimed that this was because Colbert's routine was as critical of the media as it was of Bush. Richard Cohen, also writing for The Washington Post, responded that the routine was not funny. The video of Colbert's performance became an internet and media sensation, while, in the week following the speech, ratings for The Colbert Report rose by 37% to average just under 1.5million total viewers per episode. In Time magazine James Poniewozik called it [...] "the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006". Writing six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich referred to Colbert's speech as a [...] "cultural primary" [...] and called it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the 2006 midterm elections.|$|E
500|$|... {{and is now}} often {{listed as}} one of the {{greatest}} films of all time. Weiler, writing in The New York Times, praised Grant's performance, remarking that the actor [...] "was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam" [...] and handled the role [...] "with professional aplomb and grace". Grant wore one of his most iconic suits in the film which became very popular, a fourteen-gauge, mid-gray, worsted wool one custom-made on Savile Row. Grant finished the year playing a U. S. Navy Rear Admiral aboard a submarine opposite Tony Curtis in the comedy Operation Petticoat. The reviewer from Daily Variety saw Grant's comic portrayal as a classic example of how to attract the <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> the audience without lines, remarking that [...] "In this film, most of the gags play off him. It is his reaction, blank, startled, etc., always underplayed, that creates or releases the humor". The film was major box office success, and in 1973, Deschner ranked the film as the highest earning film of Grant's career at the US box office, with takings of $9.5 million.|$|E

Another commercial lead-out featured Winstead's parents, on her answering machine, reading that day's [...] "Final Jeopardy!" [...] question and answer. In each show, Kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews, ending with a segment called [...] "Five Questions" [...] in which the guest was made to answer {{a series of questions}} that were typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion. These are highlighted in a 1998 book titled The Daily Show: Five Questions, which contains transcripts of Kilborn's best interviews. Each episode concluded with a segment called [...] "Your Moment of Zen" [...] that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a Chinese zoo feeding baby chickens to the alligators. Originally the show was recorded without a studio audience, featuring only the <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> its own off-camera staff members. A studio audience was incorporated into the show for its second season, and has remained since.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s {{there was}} a view that the free {{improvisation}} music space was largely the domain of male heterosexuals, and that women were marginalized. Canadian academic Julie Dawn Smith wrote in her 2004 essay, [...] "Playing Like a Girl: The Queer <b>Laughter</b> <b>of</b> the Feminist Improvising Group", that [...] "The opportunity for freedom in relation to sexual difference, gender, and sexuality for women improvisers was strangely absent from the discourses and practices of free jazz and free improvisation". When the Feminist Improvising Group appeared in 1977, they challenged the established male-dominated musical improvising community. FIG were a mixture of white, black, lesbian, straight, working- and middle-class women. Maggie Nicols wanted the group {{to be open to}} all women of different backgrounds and different levels of musicianship, even those who had not improvised before. She saw these differing abilities, which gave rise to unexpected results, as a strength and not a weakness. According to critic Dana Reason Myers, [...] "The result was a music that had to be taken on its own terms, as music that decidedly and consciously included the politics of being women, musicians, improvisers, and members of a society." ...|$|E
500|$|Each route {{the game}} takes {{invariably}} concludes with an ending {{specific to the}} choices made up to that point. Depending on these choices, {{the outcome of the}} story will either be good or bad. School Days became popularly known for its bad endings, which depict the deaths of characters. In one ending titled [...] "The Bloody Conclusion", a character's neck is slit open with a dōzuki, causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> her assailant. In another called [...] "Eternally", a character commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school, landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of other characters. The game's good endings, by contrast, depict the well-being of characters and their relationships. In the ending [...] "Christmas Eve", a couple share an embrace in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape. In another titled [...] "Two Lovers", a pair of characters agree to have a polyamorous relationship with the male lead instead of rivaling with each other. Because of the numerous alternate endings that can be achieved, players who wish to watch additional endings and sex scenes will have to play through the game more than once.|$|E
40|$|Laughter as an every-day, human-specific, affective, nonverbal {{vocalisation}} {{has attracted}} researchers from many disciplines. One {{consequence of the}} multi-disciplinarity {{is that the way}} of segmenting the acoustic signal <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> as well as the terminology are used in a heterogeneous and partially contradictory way. This study tries to analyse the terminological variety from a phonetic perspective. A short overview on various types <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> indicates that further concepts for description are needed. In a pilot study with a small corpus <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>laughter</b> the usefulness <b>of</b> the concepts and terms in practice is examined. This analysis revealed that the laughter events are much more complex than implied by an idealised segmentation and most of the existing descriptions <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> types.

500|$|Given {{only the}} artwork and outline {{to work with}} during production, writer Yoshinori Kitase felt that one early scene of Kefka's {{approach}} of a castle was too [...] "boring to make completely normal" [...] and decided to ad-lib a scene where he requests that his accompanying soldiers dust off his boots {{in the middle of}} a desert. The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards, suggesting that there [...] "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head". He has been described as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for delegating his authority. He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one-liners. As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life, expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word [...] "hate" [...] to his enemies. He is also very sadistic, taking amusement at the very idea of people dying and screaming. This is especially evident when he poisons Doma, as well as his admission prior to confronting the Returners for the final time that he enjoys destroying things precisely because precious lives are lost in the process. In his Dissidia appearance, Kefka's insanity is further explored, suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life with meaning. Final Fantasy VI features a song called [...] "Kefka", which exemplifies the [...] "sadistic joy" [...] of the character. His laughter has been called the greatest video game <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> all time.|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair {{running up and down the}} staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The <b>laughter</b> <b>of</b> invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed.
