Fumigation with methyl bromide (MB) is the only gaseous rapid treatment available for handling infested bulbs.

According to Rindner et al., (2003) LT 99 values for Merodon eques maggot infested bulbs at 50 mm Hg absolute pressure, at hermetic conditions (for the bio-generation of modified atmospheres) and at 90 % CO 2 were 24, 34, and 24 h, respectively. Respiration of the bulbs, under hermetic conditions, depleted the O 2 concentration to 0. 1 % and increased the CO 2 to 21 % within 24 h at 30 ºC. The bio-generation of modified atmospheres under hermetic conditions did not adversely affect the germination levels of the bulbs.

500|$|Although not {{achieving}} the sensationalism of tulips, daffodils and narcissi {{have been much}} celebrated in art and literature (see The Arts). The <b>largest</b> demand for <b>narcissi</b> <b>bulbs</b> were <b>large</b> trumpet daffodils, N. poeticus and N. bulbocodium, and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe. By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were {{an important component of}} the spring garden. By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties. A catalog of a Dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties. In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale, writing [...] "The garden does not afford, in its Kind, a prettier plant than this; nor do we know one that has been so early, or so honorably mention'd by all Kinds of Writers" [...] (see illustration). Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available, primarily the bunch flowered (multiple flower heads) N. tazetta (Polyanthus Narcissus). However interest varied by country. Maddock (1792) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England, whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen (1760) stated that N. tazetta (Narcisse à bouquet) is the fifth most important – [...] "Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur, après les Jacinthes, les Tulipes les Renoncules, et les Anemones, (dont nous avons déja parlé,) qui merite nôtre attention". Similarly Philip Miller, in his Gardeners Dictionary (1731–1768) refers to cultivation in Holland, Flanders and France, but not England, because it was too difficult, a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time. However, for most species of Narcissus Lauremberg's dictum Magna cura non indigent Narcissi was much cited.|$|R

40|$|Wheat <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> (WBF) (Delia coarctata, Fallén, Diptera: Anthomyiidae) is a pest of {{commercial}} importance in cereal crops. Control {{is dependent on}} organophosphates {{some of which are}} restricted in the UK, while current oviposition monitoring techniques are labour intensive and subjective. Eggs are not laid in association with a host-plant, therefore, prompt location of a suitable host is critical to the survival of the newly hatched larvae. Wheat <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> larvae have been shown to exhibit a positive chemotactic response to wheat and other host-plant seedlings and their root exudates. The objective {{of this study was to}} improve the control and population monitoring methodology associated with WBF, by investigating the ecology and specifically the chemical ecology of the WBF. Bioassays were used to investigate the behavioural response of WBF to known chemical constituents of host-plant exudates. Four secondary metabolites were found to be attractive while CO 2 was found to alter the behaviour of larvae. Wheat <b>bulb</b> <b>fly</b> oviposition was assessed in field situations to describe egg laying spatially and through time. Geostatistical and ecological techniques were used to observe the spatial dependence and dispersion of oviposition and construct contour maps or scale-sized dot graphs of oviposition density. The traditional single line transect sampling pattern was compared against a more intensive sampling regime. Oviposition monitoring was conducted over a three year period to ascertain the time of peak egg density of this fly. A molecular based diagnostic test to assess WBF egg populations for damage forecasting was developed. A real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was produced to estimate field populations of WBF eggs through the quantification of eggs from field samples. In addition endpoint PCR was used to identify the presence or absence of eggs from samples.
