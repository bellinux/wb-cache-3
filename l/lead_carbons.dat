In {{order to}} study the weak point and {{influence}} factor on creep rupture properties of dissimilar joint, a simulation joint which contains a transition layer has been built with the same welding parameters, the same base and weld materials as the real structure, providing theoretical principle for weld material selection and welding process optimization. In the creep rupture test of the simulation joint, most fractures are found at the fusion zone of transition layer. The existence of a softened layer at fusion zone of transition layer has been proved with metallographic observation, micro hardness test, chemical composition analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The softened layer causes strain concentration and makes {{it much easier to}} fracture. A great Cr gradient between transition layers is considered as the reason of soften layer formation, since it <b>leads</b> <b>carbon</b> distribution and decreases the hardness where lack C element.
