25|$|Temperature ranges for solidus and <b>liquidus</b> (the {{boundaries}} of the mushy state) are listed as solidus/liquidus.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of total solidification is the solidus of the alloy, the temperature at which all components are molten is the <b>liquidus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>liquidus</b> {{temperature}} {{has been}} modeled by non-linear regression using neural networks and disconnected peak functions. The disconnected peak functions approach {{is based on}} the observation that within one primary crystalline phase field linear regression can be applied and at eutectic points sudden changes occur.|$|E
25|$|As magma cools, {{minerals}} typically crystallize {{from the}} melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, {{the composition of}} the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a <b>liquidus</b> temperature near 1,200°C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a <b>liquidus</b> temperature as low as about 700°C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the <b>liquidus</b> for that magma composition. Note also that assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process {{goes hand in hand}} with the natural cooling of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The {{planetary}} {{core of the}} IIABs {{was rich}} in sulfur and phosphorus. This special chemical composition caused the magma to split into two separate liquids while cooling. The concentration of sulfur is estimated to have been about 5%. For this reason the metallic magma reached the <b>liquidus</b> curve (a point where solids coexist with a liquid) of the iron + liquid field. This led to the crystallization of the IIAB meteorites. The remaining liquid was trapped in cavities of the IIABs and crystallized once the temperature reached the eutectic point. At this temperature the remaining magma crystallized schreibersite and iron, thereby forming the IIG meteorites.|$|E
25|$|If {{the desired}} glass {{property}} {{is not related}} to crystallization (e.g., <b>liquidus</b> temperature) or phase separation, linear regression can be applied using common polynomial functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree. The C-values are the glass component concentrations like Na2O or CaO in percent or other fractions, the b-values are coefficients, and n is the total number of glass components. The glass main component silica (SiO2) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on correlation and significance analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by dummy variables. Further details and examples are available in an online tutorial by Fluegel.|$|E
500|$|Semi-solid {{die casting}} uses metal that is heated between its <b>liquidus</b> and either solidus or {{eutectic}} temperature, {{so that it}} is in its [...] "mushy region". [...] This allows for more complex parts and thinner walls.|$|E
500|$|Peralkalinity had {{remarkable}} {{effects on}} lava morphology and mineralogy during the bimodal stratovolcano stage. A unique {{characteristic of the}} peralkaline felsic lava flows produced during this stage of activity is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30 times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. As {{a result of this}} fludity, the peralkaline felsic lava flows were able to form small-scale flow folds and [...] diameter lava tubes. The <b>liquidus</b> temperatures of these flows were in excess of [...] with viscosities as low as 100,000 poise. Glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous during the bimodal stratovolcano stage as shown by the existence of volcano-glacial deposits in the volcanic edifice.|$|E
2500|$|A {{thermal profile}} {{is a complex}} set of time-temperature data {{typically}} associated with the measurement of thermal temperatures in an oven (ex: reflow oven). [...] The thermal profile is often measured along a variety of dimensions such as slope, soak, time above <b>liquidus</b> (TAL), and peak.|$|E
2500|$|After the soak segment, {{the profile}} enters the ramp-to-peak {{segment of the}} profile, which is a given {{temperature}} range and time exceeding the melting temperature of the alloy. [...] Successful profiles range in temperature up to 30°C higher than <b>liquidus,</b> which is approximately 183°C for eutectic and approximately 217°C for lead-free.|$|E
2500|$|Other platings {{used are}} OSP (organic surface protectant), {{immersion}} silver (IAg), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating (ENIG), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold (ENEPIG) and direct gold plating (over nickel). [...] Edge connectors, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then gold-plated. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin <b>liquidus</b> or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.|$|E

2500|$|This plant's genus name Liquidambar {{was first}} given by Linnaeus in 1753 from [...] <b>liquidus,</b> fluid, and the Arabic ambar, amber, in {{allusion to the}} {{fragrant}} terebinthine juice or gum which exudes from the tree. Its specific epithet styraciflua is an old generic name meaning [...] "flowing with storax" [...] (a plant resin). The name [...] "storax" [...] has long been confusingly applied to the aromatic gum or resin of this species, that of L.orientalis of Turkey, and to the resin better known as benzoin from various tropical trees in the genus Styrax.|$|E
2500|$|In {{specific}} proportions, some alloys {{can become}} eutectic — that is, their {{melting point is}} the same as their freezing point. Non-eutectic alloys have markedly different solidus and <b>liquidus</b> temperatures, and within that range they exist as a paste of solid particles in a melt of the lower-melting phase. In electrical work, if the joint is disturbed in the pasty state before it has solidified totally, a poor electrical connection may result; use of eutectic solder reduces this problem. The pasty state of a non-eutectic solder can be exploited in plumbing, as it allows molding of the solder during cooling, e.g. for ensuring watertight joint of pipes, resulting in a so-called [...] "wiped joint".|$|E

You will observe {{also that}} the {{importance}} of laying the stone in the building as it lay in its bed was from the first recognised by all good northern architects, to such extent that to lay stones 'en delit,' or in a position out of their bedding, is a recognized architectural term in France, where all structural building takes its rise; and in that form of 'delit' the word gets most curiously involved with the Latin delictum and deliquium. It would occupy the time of a whole lecture if I entered into the confused relations of the words derived from lectus, <b>liquidus,</b> delinquo, diliquo, and deliquesco; and of the still more confused, but beautifully confused, (and enriched by confusion,) forms of idea, whether respecting morality or marble, arising out of the meanings of these words: the notions of a bed gathered or strewn for the rest, whether of rocks or men; of the various states of solidity and liquidity connected with strength, or with repose; and of the duty of staying quiet in a place, or under a law, and the mischief of leaving it, being all fastened in the minds of early builders, and of the generations of men for whom they built, by the unescapable bearing of geological laws on their life; by the ease or difficulty of splitting rocks, by the variable consistency of the fragments split, by the innumerable questions occurring practically as to bedding and cleavage in every kind of stone, from tufo to granite, and by the unseemly, or beautiful, destructive, or protective, effects of decomposition. [1] The same processes of time which cause your Oxford oolite to flake away like the leaves of a mouldering book, only warm with a glow of perpetually deepening gold the marbles of Athens and Verona; and the same laws of chemical change which reduce the granites of Dartmoor to porcelain clay, bind the sands of Coventry into stones which can be built up halfway to the sky.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{sterling}} silver has a solidus melting temperature of 1475°F (802°C) and a <b>liquidus</b> flow point of 1650°F (899°C). The solidus of Argentium 935 Sterling silver is 1477°F (803°C) and a <b>liquidus</b> of 1657°F (903°C). The solidus of Argentium 960 silver is 1661°F (905°C) and a <b>liquidus</b> of 1697°F (925°C).|$|E
50|$|The <b>liquidus</b> {{temperature}} can be contrasted to the solidus temperature. The solidus temperature quantifies {{the point}} at which a material completely solidifies (crystallizes). The <b>liquidus</b> and solidus temperatures do not necessarily coincide; if a gap exists between the <b>liquidus</b> and solidus temperatures, then within that gap, the material consists of solid and liquid phases simultaneously (like a slurry).|$|E
50|$|Basalt {{has high}} <b>liquidus</b> and solidus temperatures—values at the Earth's surface are near or above 1200 °C (<b>liquidus)</b> and near or below 1000 °C (solidus); {{these values are}} {{higher than those of}} other common igneous rocks.|$|E
50|$|The solidus quantifies the {{temperature}} at which melting of a substance begins, but the substance {{is not necessarily}} melted completely, i.e., the solidus {{is not necessarily a}} melting point. For this distinction, the solidus may be contrasted to the <b>liquidus.</b> The solidus is always {{less than or equal to}} the <b>liquidus,</b> but they need not coincide. If a gap exists between the solidus and <b>liquidus</b> it is called the freezing range, and within that gap, the substance consists of a mixture of solid and liquid phases (like a slurry). Such is the case, for example, with the olivine (forsterite-fayalite) system.|$|E
50|$|Above the <b>liquidus</b> {{temperature}} {{the material}} is homogeneous and liquid at equilibrium. Below the <b>liquidus</b> temperature, more and more crystals will form in the melt if one waits a sufficiently long time, depending on the material. Alternately, homogeneous glasses can be obtained through sufficiently fast cooling, i.e., through kinetic inhibition of the crystallization process.|$|E

50|$|Time above <b>liquidus</b> (TAL), or time above reflow, {{measures}} {{how long}} the solder is a liquid. The flux reduces surface tension at the juncture of the metals to accomplish metallurgical bonding, allowing the individual solder powder spheres to combine. If the profile time exceeds the manufacturer’s specification, the result may be premature flux activation or consumption, effectively “drying” the paste before formation of the solder joint. An insufficient time/temperature relationship causes {{a decrease in the}} flux’s cleaning action, resulting in poor wetting, inadequate removal of the solvent and flux, and possibly defective solder joints. Experts usually recommend the shortest TAL possible, however, most pastes specify a minimum TAL of 30 seconds, although {{there appears to be no}} clear reason for that specific time. One possibility is that there are places on the PCB that are not measured during profiling, and therefore, setting the minimum allowable time to 30 seconds reduces the chances of an unmeasured area not reflowing. A high minimum reflow time also provides a margin of safety against oven temperature changes. The wetting time ideally stays below 60 seconds above <b>liquidus.</b> Additional time above <b>liquidus</b> may cause excessive intermetallic growth, which can lead to joint brittleness. The board and components may also be damaged at extended times over <b>liquidus,</b> and most components have a well-defined time limit for {{how long the}}y may be exposed to temperatures over a given maximum. Too little time above <b>liquidus</b> may trap solvents and flux and create the potential for cold or dull joints as well as solder voids.|$|E
