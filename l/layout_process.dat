40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. In this work, a {{systematic}} methodology to construct distributed layouts has been developed. Previous researches {{in this field}} suggest distributed layouts {{as an alternative to}} <b>process</b> <b>layouts.</b> But there has been no systematic methodology so far to develop distributed layouts. Earlier works concentrate on evaluating different production schedules for randomly distributed resources throughout the plant floor. As opposed to former approaches, in this work, distributed layouts are developed based on actual production and routing data. Taking into account the exact capacity requirements of machines, a methodical approach to distribute resources rather than random assignment is considered. The need for developing <b>process</b> <b>layouts</b> is analyzed and justified using product similarity and cell utilization. <b>Process</b> <b>layouts</b> are developed only when the given production data meets <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> requirements. The efficiency of proposed approach relative to traditional <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> strategy has been evaluated in terms of material handling cost for both single and multi period settings. In a multi period setting, the impact of demand disturbances on both <b>process</b> and distributed <b>layouts</b> is studied using case studies. From the case study results, it is concluded that distributed layouts constructed using proposed approach performs exceedingly well over traditional <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> approach. Distributed layouts proved to be efficient and robust for both single and multi-period cases. Even huge fluctuations in demand level of products had only little impact on distributed <b>layouts</b> whereas <b>process</b> <b>layouts</b> suffered tremendous loss in terms of material handling cost. It turned out that for all cases, the improvement in efficiency of distributed layouts was more than 30 % over <b>process</b> <b>layouts...</b>|$|R

5000|$|With modern desktop {{publishing}} software such as flagship software Adobe Indesign and cloud-based Lucidpress, the <b>layout</b> <b>process</b> can occur entirely on-screen. (Similar layout options {{that would be}} available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by {{desktop publishing}} software; in contrast, [...] "word processing" [...] software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.) A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer). Greyscale images must be either halftoned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas. Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use computer to plate technology to skip the physical original entirely.

50|$|Behind-the-scenes {{technologies}} {{developed by}} Adobe Systems set {{the foundation for}} professional desktop publishing applications. The LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus printers included high quality, scalable Adobe PostScript fonts built into their ROM memory.

Later, the Macintosh II was released which was much more suitable for desktop publishing because of its greater expandability, support for large color multi-monitor displays, and its SCSI storage interface which allowed fast high-capacity hard drives to {{be attached to the}} system. Macintosh-based systems continued to dominate the market into 1986, when the GEM-based Ventura Publisher was introduced for MS-DOS computers.

5000|$|Natural {{stone is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used materials in countertops. Natural stone or dimension stone slabs (e.g. granite) are shaped using cutting and finishing equipment in the shop of the fabricator. The edges are commonly put on by hand-held routers, grinders, or CNC equipment. If the stone has a highly variegated pattern, the stone may be laid out in final position in the shop for the customer's inspection, or the stone slabs may be selected by experienced inspectors. Emerging technology allows for virtual stone placement on a computer. Exact photographs can now be taken which allow for the integration of a dxf file to lay on top of a stone image. Multiple slabs of material may be used in this <b>layout</b> <b>process.</b> Then the countertop assembly is installed on the job site by professionals.Commonly, initial countertop fabrication takes place at or near the quarry of origin, with blocks being sawn to thickness and then machined into standard widths (600mm and upwards), before being surface polished and edged.This method removes the need to ship waste material, and reduces the time needed to prepare client orders. This practice is called [...] "cut to size"A wide range of details may be pre-machined by the fabricator, allowing for installation of different sinks and cooker designs. A common drawback to natural stone is the need for sealing to prevent harboring of bacteria and/or fluids that may cause staining. In recent years oleophobic impregnators have been introduced as an alternative to surface sealers. With the advent of impregnators the frequency of sealing has been cut down to once every five to ten years on most materials.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We propose and {{demonstrate}} a concept development process (CDP) {{as a framework}} to solve a value stream mapping (VSM) related <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> design optimization problem. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of CDP framework in a portable fire extinguisher manufacturing company. To facilitate the CDP application, we proposed the system coupling level index (SCLI) and simulation to evaluate the <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> design concepts. Findings: As part of the CDP framework application, three <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> design concepts - current layout (CL), express lane layout (ELL) and independent zone layout (IZL) - were generated. Then, the SCLI excluded CL and simulation selected IZL as the best concept. The simulation was also applied to optimize the performance of IZL {{in terms of the}} number of pallets. Based on this case study, we concluded that CDP framework worked well. Research limitations/implications: The <b>process</b> <b>layout</b> design optimization issue has not been well addressed in the VSM literature. We believe that this paper initiated the relevant discussion by showing the feasibility of CDP as a framework in this issue. Practical implications: The CDP and SCLI are very practice-oriented approaches in the sense that they do not require any complex analytical knowledge. Originality/value: We discussed a not well-addressed issue with a systematic framework. In addition, the SCLI presented was also unique. <br /...|$|R
