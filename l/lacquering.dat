25|$|Three {{assassination}} {{attempts were}} made on Qin Shi Huang's life, leading him to become paranoid and obsessed with immortality. He died in 210 BC, while {{on a trip to}} the far eastern reaches of his empire in an attempt to procure an elixir of immortality from Taoist magicians, who claimed the elixir was stuck on an island guarded by a sea monster. The chief eunuch, Zhao Gao, and the prime minister, Li Si, hid the news of his death upon their return until they were able to alter his will to place on the throne the dead emperor's most pliable son, Huhai, who took the name of Qin Er Shi. They believed that {{they would be able to}} manipulate him to their own ends, and thus effectively control the empire. Qin Er Shi was, indeed, inept and pliable. He executed many ministers and imperial princes, continued massive building projects (one of his most extravagant projects was <b>lacquering</b> the city walls), enlarged the army, increased taxes, and arrested messengers who brought him bad news. As a result, men from all over China revolted, attacking officials, raising armies, and declaring themselves kings of seized territories.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Lacquering</b> mostly {{developed}} in the state {{during the colonial period}} in Uruapan, Patzcuaro and Quiroga.

2500|$|Finishing {{the work}} is often {{necessary}} when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called [...] "burrs" [...] that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before <b>lacquering</b> or sealing, {{which may or may}} not be desired by the artist.|$|E

50|$|The word <b>lacquer</b> {{is derived}} from lac (Sanskrit: lākshā, लाक्षा), a {{resinous}} substance obtained from lac insects that was once used as a <b>lacquer.</b> The best known <b>lacquer,</b> an urushiol-based <b>lacquer</b> common in East Asia, {{is derived from}} the dried sap of Toxicodendron vernicifluum. Other types of <b>lacquers</b> are processed from a variety of plants and insects.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to health}} risks and {{environmental}} considerations {{involved in the}} use of solvent-based <b>lacquers,</b> much work has gone into the development of water-based <b>lacquers.</b> Such <b>lacquers</b> are considerably less toxic and more environmentally friendly, and in many cases, produce acceptable results. While water-based <b>lacquer's</b> fumes are considerably less hazardous, and it does not have the combustibility issues of solvent based <b>lacquers,</b> the product still dries fairly quickly. Even though its odor is weaker, water-based <b>lacquer</b> can still produce airborne particulates that can get into the lungs, so proper protective wear still needs to be worn. More and more water-based colored <b>lacquers</b> are replacing solvent-based clear and colored <b>lacquers</b> in under hood and interior applications in the automobile and other similar industrial applications. Water based <b>lacquers</b> are used extensively in wood furniture finishing as well.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to inventing {{the form of}} urushi-e, painting with <b>lacquer,</b> Zeshin also experimented greatly with the technical elements of using <b>lacquer.</b> He mixed his <b>lacquers</b> {{with a variety of}} substances to achieve different colors and textures, and to control the consistency and flexibility of the <b>lacquer.</b> He mixed certain substances with the <b>lacquer</b> to ensure it would not crack when his urushi-e scroll paintings were rolled up. He used bronze in his <b>lacquer</b> to simulate the appearance and texture of iron, and cereal starch to thicken his <b>lacquer</b> to simulate, at least in some respects, the effect of Western oil painting.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} problematic of indoor air pollution. There were tested low emitting types of <b>lacquers</b> – UV and waterborne <b>lacquers.</b> The {{work has been}} splitted in to two parts. In the first part samples of <b>lacquers</b> were applied on the particle board with beech veneer on the surface. Samples of air with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from <b>lacquers</b> were taken 3 and 24 hours after application. Tests proved that film layer of UV <b>lacquer</b> emit much smaller volumes of VOCs than acrylic waterborne <b>lacquers</b> or than 2 –component epoxide waterborne <b>lacquer.</b> Acrylic waterborne lacquers’ materials emitted especially butoxyethylene, epoxide <b>lacquer</b> emitted a lot of butoxyethanol and methoxypropanol and UV <b>lacquers</b> particularly emitted toluene, benzene and xylene. Se­cond part of testing consists of VOCs’ measuring of chosen <b>lacquers</b> applied on different base materials – inertial material glass and particle board with beech veneer. Tested criterion was the impact of different base material on emitted amount of VOCs. The results showed that <b>lacquer</b> coated on glass emit much more chemicals than <b>lacquer</b> on wood material. All materials were also tested on total amount of organic compounds emitted in to the air – on the TVOC. Measuring showed the same results as the first parts of research...|$|R
50|$|The word <b>lacquer</b> {{refers to}} quick-drying, {{solvent-based}} varnishes or paints. Although their names may be similarly derived, <b>lacquer</b> {{is not the}} same as shellac and is not dissolved in alcohol. <b>Lacquer</b> is dissolved in <b>lacquer</b> thinner, which is a highly flammable solvent typically containing butyl acetate and xylene or toluene. <b>Lacquer</b> is typically sprayed on, within a spray booth that evacuates overspray and minimizes the risk of combustion.|$|R

50|$|These <b>lacquers</b> {{are also}} used on wooden products, {{furniture}} primarily, and on musical instruments and other objects. Nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> {{are also used}} to make firework fuses waterproof. The nitrocellulose and other resins and plasticizers are dissolved in the solvent, and each coat of <b>lacquer</b> dissolves some of the previous coat. These <b>lacquers</b> were a huge improvement over earlier automobile and furniture finishes, both in ease of application and in colour retention. The preferred method of applying quick-drying <b>lacquers</b> is by spraying, {{and the development of}} nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> led to the first extensive use of spray guns. Nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> produce a hard yet flexible, durable finish that can be polished to a high sheen. Drawbacks of these <b>lacquers</b> include the hazardous nature of the solvent, which is flammable and toxic, and the hazards of nitrocellulose in the manufacturing process. <b>Lacquer</b> grade of soluble nitrocellulose is closely related to the more highly nitrated form which is used to make explosives. They become relatively non-toxic after approximately a month since at this point, the <b>lacquer</b> has evaporated most of the solvents used in its production.|$|R
50|$|After metalisation, the discs {{pass on to}} a spin-coater, where UV curable <b>lacquer</b> is {{dispensed}} {{onto the}} newly metallized layer.

After the <b>lacquer</b> is applied, the disks pass under a high intensity UV lamp which cures the <b>lacquer</b> rapidly. The <b>lacquer</b> also provides a surface for a label, generally screen printed or offset printed. The printing ink(s) must be chemically compatible with the <b>lacquer</b> used. Markers used by consumers to write on blank surfaces can lead to breaks in the protective <b>lacquer</b> layer, which may lead to corrosion of the reflective layer, and failure of the CD.|$|R

50|$|Diluents (or thinners) {{are usually}} added to <b>lacquers</b> {{to reduce their}} {{viscosity}} (they are used to adjust the rheology).

The addition of reactive diluents facilitates the processing of the <b>lacquers,</b> allows the addition of more fillers and improves the wetting behavior on the substrate. If volatile diluents are replaced by reactive diluents, flammability, smell, skin irritation and environmental compatibility (by lower or no VOC emissions) can be improved.|$|R
