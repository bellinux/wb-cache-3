5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the <b>larder</b> beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground <b>larder</b> chambers.|$|E
5|$|To keep up morale {{following}} Amherst's departure, Maxwell began organising {{his remaining}} 200 men (and one woman) {{to secure their}} position and gather supplies. The men were divided into parties, with one ordered to dig a well while another returned to the wreck of Alceste to salvage what weapons and equipment they could. A third party was ordered to clear a path to the island's central hill, where a cool cave {{could be used as}} a <b>larder</b> and trees felled to form a protective stockade. By the end of the first day the well was producing a steady supply of water.|$|E

50|$|<b>Larders</b> {{were used}} in the Indus River Valley to store bones of goats, oxen, and sheep. These <b>larders</b> were made of large clay pots.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>larders</b> {{have small}} {{unglazed}} windows with the window opening covered in fine mesh. This allows free circulation of air without allowing flies to enter. Many <b>larders</b> also have tiled or painted walls to simplify cleaning. Older <b>larders,</b> and {{especially those in}} larger houses, have hooks in the ceiling to hang joints of meat or game. Others have insulated containers for ice, anticipating the future development of refrigerators.|$|R
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a <b>larder</b> and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in <b>larder</b> chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} {{the contents of his}} <b>larder</b> at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo {{to get him out of}} trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E
50|$|Game <b>larders</b> {{were usually}} {{situated}} near the kitchen. The usual English design is single storey, sometimes octagonal, and usually of brick or stone construction; ventilation {{is provided by}} louvred roof lanterns and louvred or mesh-covered unglazed windows. Some game <b>larders</b> had separate rooms for small and large game. A stone or slate floor helped to cool the room. By the early 20th century, refrigeration via cooling pipes was employed. Game <b>larders</b> were sometimes combined with other outbuildings, especially ice houses, as for example at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire and Raith Park in Fife. In central Europe, ice houses were themselves sometimes used for storing deer carcasses.|$|R

5|$|The Lion Tower was the {{entrance}} to {{the north end of the}} great hall. Above the archway through the tower were displayed heraldic items, symbolic of the Percy earls' power. The lion at the bottom was the emblem of the earls. Though now much damaged, above the lion were the ancient arms of the family and the arms of the Lucy family, whose property the Percys had inherited in the 1380s. As the tower was entered from the bailey, on the right was a doorway leading to the incomplete collegiate church. To the left was the great hall, and beyond that, withdrawing chambers; to the right were the buttery, pantry, <b>larder,</b> and kitchen. Immediately north of the kitchen was a postern tower. Built around 1200, its upper floors were later reused for accommodation. An entrance of lesser status than the main gatehouse, the gate's position next to the kitchen suggests it was a tradesmen's entrance, used for conveying supplies to the castle.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant was {{the first}} time White had a kitchen staff {{organised}} into traditional brigades such as he had worked in while at Albert Roux's Le Gavroche. At Harveys, White had eight chefs under him on average, which was expanded to a team of about 20 at The Restaurant. Five of the chefs moved from Harveys to The Restaurant with him, while another former Harveys chef joined them among several others who joined from other Michelin starred restaurants from the UK and France. This enabled White to adopt a structure with himself, a head chef, a team of four or five sous chefs and teams on fish, meat/sauce, <b>larder</b> and pastry. Each of those sections was then broken down into a chef de partie heading the team, and then commis chefs under them. By 1994, Éric Chavot had joined the brigade as head chef under White. He left the following year with White's assistance to open the restaurant Interlude de Chavot.|$|E
25|$|William <b>Larder</b> married Constance Pyne, heiress of Upton Pyne. He was {{succeeded by}} his son Edmond <b>Larder</b> (died 1521), whose effigy survives in Upton Pyne Church, set within a Tudor-arched recess. It is inscribed above in Latin: Orate pro a(n)i(m)a Edm(u)ndi <b>Larder</b> Ar(migeri) ("Pray ye all {{for the soul of}} Edmund <b>Larder,</b> Esquire"). Below are four sculpted heraldic shields. Edmond married Isabel (or Elizabeth) Bonville, one of the daughters and co-heiresses of John Bonville (died 1491), lord of the manor of Combe Raleigh, Devon, and bastard son of the magnate William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville (died 1461). He was {{followed}} {{by his son}} Tristram <b>Larder</b> (1515–1547), who married Mary Stucley, a daughter of Sir Hugh Stucley (1496–1559), lord of the manor of Affeton and Sheriff of Devon in 1545. He was followed by his son Humphrey <b>Larder</b> (died 1588), whose chest tomb survives in Upton Pyne Church. Humphrey died without male children and left as his sole heiress his only daughter, Margaret <b>Larder,</b> who married Anthony Coplestone (died 1648) of Weare Gifford, who made Upton Pyne his residence.|$|E

25|$|England's captain Shaun Edwards ruled {{himself out}} of the final with an {{infected}} knee. Despite almost being ruled out of the tournament with pneumonia, St Helens centre Paul Newlove was selected by coach Phil <b>Larder</b> for starting line-up in the final. <b>Larder</b> also handed the captaincy to veteran test forward Denis Betts. With the former Wigan back rower now playing for the Auckland Warriors in the Australian premiership, his selection as captain created history as he became the first player to captain England while not currently playing in the British competition.|$|E
25|$|Many of the abbey's {{outbuildings}} were derelict in {{the late}} 20th century. The stables were restored and converted into luxury holiday cottages in 1994–97. Restoration of the game <b>larder</b> and clock tower was completed in the early 21st century, removing the former from the at risk register.|$|E
50|$|<b>Larder's</b> {{assistant}} coaches {{on the tour}} were Clive Griffiths and Gary Hetherington and the tour manager was Phil Lowe. Andy Farrell was appointed as the tour captain, with Denis Betts named as vice-captain.|$|R

25|$|In 1996 Great Britain {{embarked}} on a disastrous tour of the Southern Hemisphere under coach Phil <b>Larder.</b> They did not play Australia because of the Super League War, but played and won their first and so far only test against Fiji, before losing a series 3–0 to New Zealand. Several British players had to be sent home early because the tour ran out of money.|$|E
25|$|Meat was {{frequently}} roasted on a spit {{and as many}} cabins were devoid of ovens, cornbread was generally baked directly on the fireplace coals. A common staple of pioneer life was waffles, baked from batter in a folding iron mold three or four feet long. Modern canning processes were unknown and the wintertime <b>larder</b> consisted primarily of bread and meat. Vegetables were consumed seasonally, with pumpkin, red peppers, corn, and venison dried for later use.|$|E
25|$|The manor of Upton Pynes {{was long}} {{held by the}} Pyne family and Herebert de Pino, as he was called in a Latin charter, held the manor {{during the reign of}} King Henry I (1100–1135). He was succeeded {{successively}} by Simon, Herebert, Simon, Sir Herebert, Sir Herebert, John, William, Edmond, and Nicholas Pyne. Nicholas Pyne died without male children and left his daughter Constance Pyne as his sole heiress. She married William <b>Larder,</b> to which family the manor of Upton Pyne passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are starving, Koppelstok; can you {{inform us}} {{how we can}} get some food? We have picked up two Spanish traders on our way here from Dover, but our <b>larders</b> were emptied before we sailed, and we found but scant supply on board our prizes." ...|$|R
50|$|Using {{radiocarbon}} dating, {{the age of}} {{the seeds}} was estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 years, dating the seeds to the Pleistocene epoch. The embryos were damaged, possibly by the animals' activity. The research team presented their findings at the Botany & Plant Biology conference in Chicago, Illinois in 2007. The burrows were found 20 - 40 m below the present-day surface. Usually the rodents would eat the food in their <b>larders,</b> but in this case a flood or other weather event buried the whole area. Since the rodents had placed the <b>larders</b> {{at the level of the}} permafrost, the material froze almost immediately, and did not thaw out at any time since. More than 600,000 fruits and seeds were located at the site.|$|R
50|$|Game <b>larders</b> {{continue}} to be used on shooting estates in Britain to store game and sometimes additionally to process it to meat products such as venison. To comply with modern food hygiene regulations, their design incorporates drinking-quality water outlets, and frequently powered ventilation, insect-killing devices and refrigeration.|$|R
25|$|At Bolling Field, he {{was greeted}} by Acting Secretary of State Robert Olds, Mexican Ambassador Miguel Tellez, other dignitaries and spectators. The next day, he had lunch with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge whom hosted the aviator at the Pan American Union. According to the New York Times, the two had to have lunch there because The White House <b>larder</b> was empty due to the first family's {{impending}} departure for a vacation. While in Washington, he placed a wreath on {{the tomb of the}} unknown soldier.|$|E
25|$|Logistics. The {{fast moving}} host, like all {{military}} formations, needed supplies. These {{were provided by}} young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, sleeping mats, extra weapons, rations, and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable <b>larder.</b> Again, such arrangements in the local context were probably nothing unusual. What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding major benefits when the Zulu were dispatched on military missions. Shaka's general ratio of logistic personnel was one herdboy to three men.|$|E
25|$|The {{shopping}} area is mainly along Fore Street, with some small {{shops and restaurants}} situated in the Glanvilles Mill shopping centre which is accessible from Fore Street and the car park. The shopping centre contains over 35 shops including the bistro/restaurant the Riverbank, a number of charity shops, Nature's <b>Larder</b> health store and therapy centre, a post office, a hair salon, several estate agents, a Co-operative food store and a Warrens Bakery. The town's closest superstore is a Tesco Extra in the neighbouring village of Lee Mill (3 miles). There is also a garden centre known as Endsleigh (Wyevale)just outside the town.|$|E
60|$|He {{led them}} on and on, {{through a maze of}} back kitchens, dairies, <b>larders,</b> and sculleries, that melted along covered ways into a farm-house, visibly older than the main building, which again rambled out among barns, byres, pig-pens, stalls and stables to the dead fields behind.|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} of the wedding-day all the <b>larders,</b> cellars, {{cupboards}} and tables of the people, whether rich or poor, were loaded as if by enchantment with bread, wine, beer, cakes and tarts, roast larks, and even geese, so that Tubby could not complain any more that his son had married Famine.|$|R
60|$|Late on {{the evening}} of the {{following}} day the fur-clad hunters arrived at their village with shouts of rejoicing--hairy and happy--for they brought with them many a carcass of walrus and seal wherewith to replenish their wardrobes and <b>larders,</b> and banish hunger and care from their dwellings for a considerable time to come.|$|R
