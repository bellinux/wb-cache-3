The American Judges Association was formed in the United States and has most of its members there. It also has a substantial—and growing—membership in Canada.

500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> rain check. I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s that interesting awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|R
40|$|One {{consideration}} in designing representations for domain knowledge {{is the ability}} of an automated reasoning system to manipulate, use, and derive consequences within the representation. Work on designing Discovery Systems has uncovered several characteristics of representations which facilitate automated reasoning. I will discuss the Discovery Systems AM and EURISKO by Lenat, CYRANO by Ken Haase, and the related work of Fawcett and Utgoff on automatic feature generation. I will also present the relationship of representation design in Genetic Algorithm systems, as worked on by John Holland and John Koza, to representations for knowledge based systems.

But what proportion is there between the structural alteration and the functional result? Is it not perfectly obvious that the alteration is of the minutest kind, yet that slight as it is, it has produced an infinite difference in the performance of the functions of these two instruments? ...|$|R

40|$|As the {{incoming}} president of SIPES, I have to first state how honored I am {{to have this}} opportunity to serve the membership of our great organization. But, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> minute {{to say a few}} words about our outgoing president, George Johnson. George personifies the word "service. " In the past year, he has unselfishly dedicated his time and efforts for SIPES and its membership. George, a hearty "Job Well Done" and sincere "Thank You " for all you have done. Everyone that made the New Orleans annual meeting knows what a great event that was! The weather, the hotel, the New Orleans restaurants, were all very enjoyable. The New Orleans Chapter did a great job on getting the speakers and field trip arranged; the technical sessions were all directly applicable to our endeavors as independents. Additionally, we had the opportunity to have Jim Bob Moffett of Freeport-MacMoRan speak at our convention lunch on new GOM discoveries. At our SIPES Foundation Seminar, we had Stephen Nelson of Tulane give his talk on the levee breaches during Hurrican...|$|R
5000|$|A {{template}} for new jack swing and hip-hop soul ballads, [...] "Human Nature" [...] is comparatively slower and more intimate than Thrillers other songs. [...] "If {{this town is}} just <b>an</b> apple, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bite," [...] quivers Jacksons voice over a cascading synthesizer and percolating bass line. Though written by John Bettis and Steve Porcaro of Toto, the lyrics resonate with Jacksons yearning to break free from his tower of celebrity and mingle with young people in a [...] "city that winks its sleepless eye." [...] Serena Kim, South Coast Today. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was released on July 3, 1983, as the fifth single from Thriller. Although not released in the UK, the song achieved chart success in the US. Reaching number two on Billboards Hot Adult Contemporary chart and number seven on the Hot 100, the song became Jacksons fifth Top 10 hit from Thriller. [...] "Human Nature" [...] charted at number 27 on the R&B singles chart. In the Netherlands the single reached number 11.|$|R

40|$|The {{real point}} of {{democratic}} reform, what I {{have been calling}} institutional reform, {{is not just to}} change the complexion of researchers, teachers and students, nor just to change the location of research and teaching, to be truly meaning- fill, reform has to lead to a change in the orientation of these activities. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> hypothetical example, one where you succeed in adding more black and female faces to the research and leaching establishment and even to shifting the location of that establishment mainly to historically black universities - say your most advanced medical research facilities come to be located at the University of Fort Hare, with researchers mainly black and female, but the facility is still oriented to proton beam research for special types of cancer, away from the public health needs of the people - what will you have achieved? I dare say you would then have joined the ranks of independent Africa. The key issue will still remain not addressed: who should centres of research and learning serve and how? This is why I think the real challenge for all of us, whether south or north of the Limpopo, whether black or brown, yellow or white, is to begin thinking of how to root African universities in African soil...|$|R

"Avon Saxon, {{who with}} great dignity and {{sweeping}} gesture, protested {{that he had}} been a great baritone, hung on the bar in the Jefferson Market Court yesterday and sang to Magistrate Breen.

His most important engagement was with the Royal English Opera Company in London, of which D'Oyly Carte is Director, he declared. His wife, he said, was Virginia Cheron, formerly of the Opera Comique of Paris, from whom he is divorced.Saxon was picked up by Policeman Corevan of the Charles Street Station, who noticed his acting strangely on Sixth Avenue, near the Court House." ...|$|R

If any man, woman, or child comes here and wants {{to go out to}} camp, and I see that they are sickly or weak or in any way not fit to live in the woods, I don't let them go one step until they are fit for it. The air and the food and the water they get here will make them fit, if {{anything}} will do it, and if these three things don't set them up they simply have to go back where they came from. They can't go into camp from this house. But if they fancy this hotel--and there isn't any reason why anybody shouldn't fancy it--they can stay here as long as they like, and I'll take care of them. Now, sir, {{if you want to go}} into camp, the first thing for you to do is to bring your family here and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at them.
