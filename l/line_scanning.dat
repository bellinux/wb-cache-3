500|$|The {{marketing}} for The Last Stand was darker and more ambiguous {{compared to the}} two predecessors. Fox president Tom Rothman declared that {{the decision was made}} so the film would [...] "be different from all of the other movies in the summer," [...] with a campaign that [...] "wanted people to stop and not have it be so immediately apparent that we're selling a movie. We're interested in selling an emotion and an idea." [...] The film's official website was launched in October 2005. The teaser trailer release with King Kong the following December was done in conjunction with the studio releasing the film's first official screen shots of the film to USA Today. Diamond Select Toys created a toy <b>line,</b> <b>scanning</b> the actors from the film with likenesses {{for the first time in}} the trilogy. Additional product tie-ins came with Harley-Davidson and 7-Eleven. A seven-minute sneak peek aired on Fox Broadcasting two weeks before the film's theatrical release.|$|E

60|$|The {{ships of}} the vice-admiral's {{division}} had {{closed in the}} night, agreeably to an order given before quitting the anchorage, which directed them to come within the usual sailing distance, {{in the event of}} the weather's menacing a separation. This command had been obeyed by the ships astern carrying sail hard, long after the leading vessels had been eased by reducing their canvass. The order of sailing was the Plantagenet in the van, and the Carnatic, Achilles, Thunderer, Blenheim, and Warspite following, in the order named; some changes having been made in the night, in order to bring the ships of the division into their fighting-stations, in a line ahead, the vice-admiral leading. The superiority of the Plantagenet was a little apparent, notwithstanding; the Carnatic alone, and that only by means of the most careful watching, being able to keep literally in the commander-in-chief's wake; all the other vessels gradually but almost imperceptibly setting to leeward of it. These several circumstances struck Sir Gervaise, the moment his foot touched the poop, where he found Greenly keeping an anxious look-out {{on the state of the}} weather and the condition of his own ship; leaning at the same time, against the spanker-boom to steady himself in the gusts of the gale. The vice-admiral braced his own well-knit and compact frame, by spreading his legs; then he turned his handsome but weather-beaten face towards the <b>line,</b> <b>scanning</b> each ship in succession, as she lay over to the wind, and came wallowing on, shoving aside vast mounds of water with her bows, her masts describing short arcs in the air, and her hull rolling to windward, and lurching, as if boring her way through the ocean. Galleygo, who never regarded himself as a steward in a gale of wind, was the only other person on the poop, whither he went at pleasure by a sort of imprescriptibly right.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{high-resolution}} CCD {{cameras are}} used. Use of both <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> and area scan cameras {{has been reported}} in the literature. <b>Line</b> <b>scan</b> cameras have been widely used as it is easier to realise a strong and even illumination to the surface area to be inspected. The disadvantage with the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> cameras is that they do not generate a complete image at once and requires an external hardware to build up images from multiple <b>line</b> <b>scans</b> [7]. Most of the automatic surface inspection system manufacturers use <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> camera. For area scan cameras, the usage of transport encoder is optional and the inspection resolution in both directions is independent of the object (web) speed. However, while using area scan camera, special attention is needed to ensure even illumination of the total area under scan to the extent possible. High-resolution video cameras are also used as complimentary systems [30].|$|R
40|$|IEEE Finger interruptions or finger breaks are {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in screen printed solar cell manufacturing and may result in decreased performance due {{to an increase in}} effective series resistance. Identification of finger interruptions is typically accomplished using electroluminescence imaging. This paper demonstrates contactless detection of finger interruptions using <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> photoluminescence imaging. Modeling is used to highlight the difference between <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> photoluminescence images and conventional luminescence imaging methods. Significant benefits of using <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> photoluminescence imaging over electroluminescence imaging to identify finger interruptions are presented: in <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> photoluminescence images, finger interruptions cause an increase in luminescence intensity, while high recombination regions cause a decrease in intensity. This contrast inversion allows for a more unambiguous identification of defect types. Detailed modeling is performed to determine the impact of finger interruptions on <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> photoluminescence images, {{as a function of the}} location of the finger interruption and of illumination intensity. The increase in luminescence intensity from a finger interruption is found to correlate linearly with the corresponding power loss. Finally, experimental <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> photoluminescence images of industrial cells and full sized modules are presented and found to agree well with the modeling results...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the inter-observer agreement {{for the detection}} of optical coherence tomography (OCT) features of disease activity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Method. A cross-sectional agreement study with grading of OCT <b>line</b> <b>scans</b> from patients with nAMD prior to receiving treatment conducted by 2 retinal specialists. Scans were graded for the presence of features of nAMD disease activity (intra-retinal cysts, IRC; subretinal fluid, SRF; diffuse retinal edema, DRE; retinal pigment epithelial detachment, PED and sub-retinal tissue, SRT). Results. Though scans from 78 patients were available for analysis, 5 patients were excluded due to a mean signal strength of less than 7. Two hundred and seventy-eight <b>line</b> <b>scans</b> were analyzed from 73 patients (40 with cross-hair scan sets and 33 with radial <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> sets). Agreement for per <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> analysis was 77 % for IRC (kappa = 0. 41); 81 % for SRF (kappa = 0. 62); 91 % for macular fluid (kappa = 0. 28); 79 % for DRE (kappa = 0. 10); 90 % for PED (kappa = 0. 78); 79 % for SRT (kappa = 0. 53). There was 1 patient (with a cross-hair scan) in which the 2 observers disagreed regarding the presence of macular fluid. Conclusion. Interpretation of OCT <b>line</b> <b>scans</b> from patients with nAMD is subject to inter-observer variability. However, when all <b>line</b> <b>scans</b> acquired are examined for the presence of fluid (IRC or SRF), there is a high level of agreement {{for the detection of}} macular fluid on a per patient basis...|$|R

50|$|In spatial scanning, each {{two-dimensional}} (2-D) {{sensor output}} represents a full slit spectrum (x,Î»). Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) devices for spatial scanning obtain slit spectra by projecting {{a strip of}} the scene onto a slit and dispersing the slit image with a prism or a grating. These systems have the drawback of having the image analyzed per lines (with a push broom scanner) and also having some mechanical parts integrated into the optical train. With these line-scan systems, the spatial dimension is collected through platform movement or scanning. This requires stabilized mounts or accurate pointing information to â€˜reconstructâ€™ the image. Nonetheless, line-scan systems are particularly common in remote sensing, where it is sensible to use mobile platforms. Line-scan systems are also used to scan materials moving by on a conveyor belt. A special case of <b>line</b> <b>scanning</b> is point scanning (with a whisk broom scanner), where a point-like aperture is used instead of a slit, and the sensor is essentially one-dimensional instead of 2-D.|$|E

50|$|Drop frame {{timecode}} originates from {{a compromise}} invented when color NTSC video was invented. The NTSC designers wanted to retain compatibility with existing monochrome televisions. To minimise subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver {{it was necessary}} to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency; the multiple originally chosen was 495. With a 30 Hz frame rate the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency is (30 Ã— 525) = 15750 Hz. So the subcarrier frequency would have been (495/2 Ã— 15750) = 3.898125 MHz. This was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen, but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 MHz sound intercarrier could be seen. The visibility of this pattern could be greatly reduced by lowering the subcarrier frequency multiple to 455 (thus increasing the beat frequency from approx 600 kHz to approx 920 kHz) and by making the beat frequency also equal to an odd multiple of half the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency. This latter change could have been achieved by raising the sound intercarrier by 0.1% to 4.5045 MHz, but the designers, concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers, decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency, and thus both the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency and the frame rate, by 0.1% instead. Thus the NTSC color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 MHz (exactly 315/88 MHz), the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> frequency as 15734.27 Hz (exactly 9/572 MHz) and the frame rate 29.97 Hz (exactly 30/1.001 Hz).|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Dedicated breast CT prototypes used in {{clinical}} investigations utilize single circular source trajectory and cone-beam geometry with flat-panel detectors {{that do not}} satisfy data-sufficiency conditions and could lead to cone beam artifacts. Hence, this work investigated the glandular dose characteristics of a circle-plus-line trajectory that fulfills data-sufficiency conditions for image reconstruction in dedicated breast CT. METHODS: Monte Carlo-based computer simulations were performed using the GEANT 4 toolkit and was validated with previously reported normalized glandular dose coefficients for one prototype breast CT system. Upon validation, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the normalized glandular dose coefficients {{as a function of}} x-ray source position along the <b>line</b> <b>scan.</b> The source-to-axis of rotation distance and the source-to-detector distance were maintained constant at 65 and 100 cm, respectively, in all simulations. The ratio of the normalized glandular dose coefficient at each source position along the <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> to that for the circular scan, defined as relative normalized glandular dose coefficient (RD(g) N), was studied by varying the diameter of the breast at the chest wall, chest-wall to nipple distance, skin thickness, x-ray beam energy, and glandular fraction of the breast. RESULTS: The RD(g) N metric when stated as a function of source position along the <b>line</b> <b>scan,</b> relative to the maximum length of <b>line</b> <b>scan</b> needed for data sufficiency, was found to be minimally dependent on breast diameter, chest-wall to nipple distance, skin thickness, glandular fraction, and x-ray photon energy. This observation facilitates easy estimation of the average glandular dose of the <b>line</b> <b>scan.</b> Polynomial fit equations for computing the RD(g) N and hence the average glandular dose are provided. CONCLUSIONS: For a breast CT system that acquires 300 - 500 projections over 2 pi for the circular scan, the addition of a line trajectory with equal source spacing and constant x-ray beam quality (kVp and HVL) and mAs matched to the circular scan, will result in less than 0. 18 % increase in average glandular dose to the breast per projection along the <b>line</b> <b>scan...</b>|$|R
