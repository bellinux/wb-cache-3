40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} manner by which the uptake of direct dyes on cellulosic fibres is promoted by {{a reduction in the}} <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio</b> used for dyeing. According to the model, which invokes the concept of interstitial water in dyeing, reducing the <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio</b> promotes dye aggregation which reduces the solubility of the dye in the bulk dyebath phase, so that the inherent preference of the dye to favour the aqueous phase shifts towards the fibre phase. It is suggested that the same mechanism accounts for the promotion of direct dye uptake imparted by the addition of inorganic electrolyte to direct dye dyebaths. As such, reduced <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio</b> and added inorganic electrolyte exert a combinatorial promotional effect on direct dye uptake...|$|E

Ultrasonic wool scouring could be an alternative technology to minimise the negative impact, provided that the cleaning efficiency and fibre quality are not compromised. This study examined the influence of ultrasonic irradiation frequency and ultrasonic power variations on wool scouring performance at different <b>liquor</b> <b>ratios.</b> Scoured fibre, residual ash content, residual grease content, whiteness and yellowness were evaluated. The impact of liquor degassing on wool scouring effectiveness was studied. Fibre surface damage was also assessed in this work. It was observed that while {{there was no significant}} influence of ultrasonic frequency on the whiteness or yellowness of the scoured fibres, wool scoured at frequencies of 28 kHz and 80 kHz had more grease and dirt removed than that scoured at 45 kHz. Low ultrasonic power and degassed bath liquor increased wool grease removal ability. Ultrasonic treatment caused scale cracking/peeling in some wool fibres. More severe cuticle damage was observed in fibres scoured at the lower frequency. This damage resulted in increased dye uptake by the fibres...|$|R
40|$|Wet textile {{colouration}} has {{the highest}} environmental impact of all textile processing steps. It consumes water, chemicals and energy and produces liquid, heat and gas waste streams. Liquid effluent streams are often quite toxic to the environment. There {{are a number of}} different dyeing processes, normally fibre type specific, and each has a different impact on the environment. This research investigated the energy, chemical and water requirements for the exhaust colouration of cotton, wool, polyester and nylon. The research investigated the liquid waste biological and chemical oxygen demand, salinity, pH and colour along with the energy required for drying after colouration. Polyester fibres had the lowest impact on the environment with lowest water and energy consumption in dyeing, good dye bath exhaustion, the lowest salinity levels in their effluent, relatively neutral pH effluent and low energy in drying. The wool and nylon had similar dye bath requirements and outputs however the nylon could be dyed at far lower <b>liquor</b> <b>ratios</b> and hence provided better energy and water use figures. The cotton and wool required high energy consumption in drying after colouration. Cotton performed poorly in all of the measured parameters...|$|R
40|$|Textile wet {{processing}} such as dyeing adds {{value to the}} apparel but {{has the potential to}} cause significant environmental and human health impacts. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the environmental impacts of fabrics made of spun-dyed modal with conventionally dyed modal fabrics (for production in Austria, system "cradle-to-factory gate"). The chosen functional unit is one kilogram of black modal knitted fabric. We assessed energy use, GHG emissions, water use and the impact categories covered by CML 2001 method. We found that the cradle to gate production of spun-dyed modal fabric has 50 % lower energy use, 60 % lower carbon footprint, and requires only 50 % of water and has significantly lower (40 – 60 %) environmental impacts compared to conventionally dyed fabric. Sensitivity analysis with <b>liquor</b> <b>ratios</b> and number of washing cycles does not substantially change the above results. Conventional dyeing in China leads to four-fold higher GHG emissions per kg fabric compared to spin-dyeing in Austria. Finally, we described linkages of sustainable innovation with business value creation. We showed that spin-dyeing can significantly reduce costs for value chain actors, helps reducing the environmental footprint of end products, enhances reputation of brands and retailers, and can contribute to mitigating global problems while catering for the rising demand for clothing fuelled by ever growing world population...|$|R
40|$|Both {{the colour}} {{strength}} of 2 % omf dyeings {{and the extent}} of dye exhaustion achieved for three commercial grade direct dyes on cotton were promoted by the addition of 20 gl- 11 NaCl at each of eight liquor ratios (1 : 50, 1 : 20, 1 : 10, 1 : 6, 1 : 3, 1 : 2, 1 : 1. 5 and 1 : 1). The extent of electrolyte-enhanced dye uptake decreased with decreasing <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio.</b> For each of the three dyes, unlevel dyeings were obtained at 1 : 1 <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio</b> only in the presence of added electrolyte, whereas level dyeings were secured even at 1 : 1 <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio</b> in the complete absence of added electrolyte. The depth of the dyeings obtained in the absence of added electrolyte using both 1 : 1 and 1 : 1. 5 liquor ratios were of similar magnitude to those secured using 1 : 10, 1 : 20 and 1 : 50 liquor ratios in the presence of 20 gl- 11 NaCl. The promotion of dye uptake imparted by both added electrolyte and reduced <b>liquor</b> <b>ratio</b> were interpreted in terms of their effects on the substantivity of the direct dyes towards the cotton substrate.

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium sulfate (N%SO,) {{are used in}} the exhaust dyeing of cellulose with fiber reactive dyes. Many traditional fiber reactive dyes require 50 - 100 g/L of the salts to promote adequate exhaustion. Even with the large {{quantities of}} water required for rinsing the dyeings, the effluent still averages 2000 - 3000 ppm NaCl when it is used, [I]. This level exceeds the current toxicity limit for NaCl established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and many dyers are discharging at or above this level [2]. Recent attempts to lower the levels of NaCl or NqSO, in waste water effluent have involved the selection of dyes with higher affinity for cellulose and dyeing at lower <b>liquor</b> <b>ratios</b> [3]. Also, many dyestuff manufacturers have developed a line of fiber reactive dyes that require less salt to promote exhaustion [4]. Neither of these efforts has proven to be totally satisfactory.

40|$|The hydrodynamics of a {{dyeing machine}} affects the {{exchange}} mechanisms between a textile {{material and the}} liquid medium to a large extent. Namely, the transfer of dyes and chemicals from the dyeing liquor {{and the release of}} non-bonded substances during subsequent rinsing steps can be altered by relative movement between phases. Such aspects have not been investigated thoroughly, although the typical approach of chemical engineering can offer a relevant contribution in this view. As a practical result, important benefits may follow in various operations of the dyeing process, aimed at optimising the equipment use or saving resources, in particular water. The attention of this study was focused on hank-dyeing machinery, since this production demands a considerable amount of water due to the large <b>liquor</b> <b>ratios.</b> The experimental study was carried out at a textile industry facility by operating on two units of equipment at significantly different scales. The rinsing operation was monitored by sampling the liquid at several positions along the vertical direction of the liquor: colour, conductivity and other chemical properties were measured in order to devise an optimal production policy aimed at saving water. A mathematical model of the equipment, based on a simple hydrodynamic hypothesis and proper mass balances, was proposed, and its outputs were compared with the experimental results.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree Master of Technology Chemical Engineering In the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyWet textile processing (WTP), is faced with many challenges {{that are related to}} operating costs and market competiveness. WTP uses large amounts of water and electricity, which constitute a big portion of operating costs of dyehouses and other costs are related to releasing large quantities of water, high concentrations of dyes and chemicals into the textile effluents with possible effluents discharge limits (EDL) penalty charges if EDL are exceeded. EDL penalty costs had become a normative part of the operating costs for some WTP textile factories, making the EDL penalties, a monthly cost item, because water utilities and the effluent discharge are not controlled and optimized. Cotton dyeing is a complicated chemi-physical-sorption process that is not easy to perform efficiently. Inefficient dyeing (off-shades and un-level dyeing) sometimes results in several reprocessing steps, leading to mega litres of water and chemical usage. Inefficient dyeing can also lead to higher concentrations of dyes and chemicals in the dyeing effluents. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the applicability of electrocoagulation (EC) in treatment of reactive dyes textile effluents for safe discharge into sewers or forreuse and also to evaluate EC reaction kinetics in removal of various pollutants from reactive dyes textile effluent with a batch electrocoagulation reactor (ECR). To achieve these objectives; textile effluents to be used had to be created instead of using factory effluents because textile effluents vary between dyeing batches and reaction kinetics study require constant and consistent composition of effluents. This was done by following the standard commercial sample cotton-dyeing procedures. The dyeing and pre-bleaching procedures were formulated from literature sources.

The fibers were on the average 4. 2 mm long, 31. 5 mm wide and 6. 1 mm thick. The pseudostem was characterized by 3. 4 % ash, 7. 4 % lignin, 48 % cellulose and high extractive contents. Prolonged cooking at a low tempera-ture resulted only in a small increase in the total pulp yield over that obtained at a high tempera-ture for {{the same degree of}} pulping. The selectivity of lignin dissolution was independent of the working conditions...|$|R
