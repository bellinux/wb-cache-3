At this time, current market available monitoring system unable to detect failure on both uplinks {{when one of the}}m inactive due to system failure. This problem occurs because device probing could only be established up to ONT. In this case, engineer does not aware whether their link is up or not, and dual homing scheme does not really works. Due to problem which is explained above, this paper offers a new approach to monitor two target of each ONT: the IP address and the <b>logical</b> <b>port</b> of the OLT where the ONT connected.

50|$|Group {{address and}} unknown {{destination}} individual frames are optimally transmitted to only {{members of the}} same Ethernet service. IEEE 802.1aq supports the creation of thousands of logical Ethernet services in the form of E-LINE, E-LAN or E-TREE constructs which are formed between non participating <b>logical</b> <b>ports</b> of the IEEE 802.1aq network. These group address packets are encapsulated with a PBB header which indicates the source participating address in the SA while the DA indicates the locally significant group address this frame should be forwarded on and which source bridge originated the frame. The IEEE 802.1aq multicast forwarding tables are created based on computations such that every bridge which is on the shortest path between a pair of bridges which are {{members of the same}} service group will create proper forwarding database (FDB) state to forward or replicate frames it receives to that members of that service group. Since the group address computation produce shortest path trees, there is only ever one copy of a multicast packet on any given link. Since only bridges on a shortest path between participating <b>logical</b> <b>ports</b> create forwarding database (FDB) state the multicast makes the efficient use of network resources.|$|R
50|$|If no {{printer port}} is present at 0x3BC, the second port {{in the row}} (0x378) becomes <b>logical</b> {{parallel}} <b>port</b> 1 and 0x278 becomes <b>logical</b> parallel <b>port</b> 2 for the BIOS. Sometimes, printer ports are jumpered to share an interrupt despite having their own IO addresses (i.e. only one can be used interrupt-driven at a time). In some cases, the BIOS supports a fourth printer port as well, but the base address for it differs significantly between vendors. Since the reserved entry for a fourth <b>logical</b> printer <b>port</b> in the BIOS Data Area (BDA) is shared with other uses on PS/2 machines and with S3 compatible graphics cards, it typically requires special drivers in most environments.Under DR-DOS 7.02 the BIOS port assignments can be changed and overridden using the LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 (and optionally LPT4) CONFIG.SYS directives.|$|R
30|$|For {{the target}} image, {{we would like}} to be able to both read and write one target pixel per cycle. It is also {{important}} that the size of the target image stored on one node be as large as possible, so memories with larger capacity are better. Thus, we will use multiple on-board SRAMs to store the target image. By implementing a two-memory storage system, we can provide two <b>logical</b> <b>ports</b> into the target image array. During any given processing step, one SRAM acts as the source for target pixels, and the other acts as the destination for the newly computed pixel values. When the next set of projections is sent to the FPGA, the roles of the two SRAMs are reversed.|$|R

50|$|If {{there is}} an unused slot, the port {{addresses}} of the others are moved up. (For example, if a port at 0x3BC does not exist, the port at 0x378 will then become the first <b>logical</b> parallel <b>port.)</b> The base address 0x3BC is typically supported by printer ports on MDA and Hercules display adapters, whereas printer ports provided by the mainboard chipset or add-on cards rarely allow to be configured to this base address. Therefore, in absence of a monochrome display adapter, a common assignment for the first <b>logical</b> parallel <b>port</b> (and therefore also for the corresponding LPT1 DOS device driver) today is 0x378, even though the default is still 0x3BC (and would be selected by the BIOS if it detects a printer port at this address). The IRQ lines are typically configurable in the hardware as well. Assigning the same interrupt {{to more than one}} printer port should be avoided and will typically cause one of the corresponding ports to work in polled mode only. The port addresses assigned to slot can be determined by reading the BIOS Data Area (BDA) at 0000h:0408h.|$|R
40|$|Design and {{management}} of product variety is a typical problem in product portfolio management. This paper presents computer software (ASDN) for cost based analysis of product platforms and product portfolio analysis. The approach is based on modelling logical bill-of-materials trees and assigning cost and logistics information on each component. Product families are modelled as hierarchical component lists, which may contain <b>logical</b> <b>ports</b> such as AND (Assembly) and OR (alternative component). Each product has a demand and standard deviation of demand. This information is then distributed with components which have an embedded with cost and volume information. By combining the product structure information with volume, cost and replenishment time, the user of variant analysis tool may find answers for following questions: (1) What {{is the cost of}} adding a new variant into a product? (2) How much is the benefit of replacing a specialized component with standardized one? (3) How much inventory replenishment time affects to total product cost? (4) How to improve the routing structure (logical BOM) from product architecture point of view? The paper aims to connect product family design with logistics analysis by demonstrating some possible analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ Interfacing keypads with microcontrollersâ€™ port {{lines is}} classicaly {{represented}} by the wellknown matrix structure, but many other solution are available. Since new generations of microcontrollers are bringing new facilities, alternative solutions were proposed {{in order to obtain}} the maximum number of interface keys with minimum costs. Some of these solutions consist in using analog-to-digital interfaces instead of the <b>logical</b> I/O <b>ports.</b> Coding the keys with analog voltages involve A/D converters for decoding. Since analogue coding is usualy based on cheap resistive dividers connected with the keypads, reading the keys voltage values could be done with comparators or A/D converters if included with the system. With appropiate sofware algorithm, low cost interface could be designed. The paper is sugesting some optimal solutions to do that...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” In {{this paper}} a black-box {{identification}} technique {{based on the}} radial basis functions (RBF) is used in developing global dynamic behavioural models of electronic devices from measured transient responses. RBF allow to reproduce a non-linear dynamic model of the device under modelling (DUM) automatically taking into account all the physical effects relating input and output data, from measured waveform only: {{no knowledge of the}} internal structure is needed. Suitable parameters have to be evaluated by using selected voltage/current identification signals that allow to build up the global model of the DUM. The development of such global model constitutes the first step for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) compliance in high performance electronic systems for information and communication technology and for industrial applications. In fact, due to the high complexity of such interconnected systems, EMC compliance can be obtained since the design stage only if the whole system is firstly scattered in low complexity sub-systems, opportunely modeled and then composed by the system physical interconnections to obtain the original apparatus. Global model is firstly obtained for <b>logical</b> I/O <b>port</b> and the validation is obtained by comparison with SPICE simulations. Original application related to single electronic component such as bipolar junction transistor is also reported and validated by comparing simulation results with measured data.

40|$|Optical {{switching}} fabrics (OSFs) {{are receiving}} increasing {{attention in the}} design of high speed packet switches, due to their excellent properties in terms of available bandwidth and reduced power consumption. However, most optical devices require a reconfiguration latency each time input/output switch port connections are modified. This latency may not be negligible with respect to the packet transmission time, and can adversely affect switch performance, creating high delays and reduced throughput. In this paper we consider OSFs and we propose a multi-hop approach to schedule packet transfer, i. e., packets are sent to the final destination port exploiting transmission through intermediate ports. We show that the multi-hop approach is a promising technique to control the trade-off between delay and throughput. We propose a general framework to solve the issue of multi-hop transmission in IQ packet switches. Furthermore, we examine the multi-hop approach when using <b>logical</b> interconnections among <b>ports</b> based on multi-dimensional regular topologies. We discuss the switch scheduling problem, and the design of routing and queueing schemes. Performance are analyzed both analytically and by simulation. I...|$|R

However, it has several {{limitations}} for iSCSI, SRP, and SBP- 2 devices, and for devices with target ports using {{more than one}} transport protocols: 1. iSCSI port names and device names use a string format that cannot be represented in the current VPD formats. The strings approach 256 bytes in length; 02 - 303 expanded INQUIRYâ€™s allocation length to return such amounts of data. Suggestion: A new VPD device identifier type for this string format is needed so iSCSI devices can report its target port (ASSOCIATION field set to 1 h) and target device identifiers (ASSOCIATION field set to 2 h). 2. iSCSI logical unit names are undefined.

5000|$|Banda Aceh, {{situated}} {{at the tip of}} Sumatra, has long been a strategic, transportation and trading hub in the eastern Indian Ocean. Its first mention in western accounts comes from 1292 when Marco Polo and his expedition visited the city, referred to as 'Lambri' from Lamuri Kingdom which previously existed there and noted as the <b>logical</b> first <b>port</b> of call for travelers from Arabia and India to Indonesia. Ibn Battuta also reported visiting the city in the mid-14th century when {{under the control of the}} trading kingdom of Samudera Pasai, the then dominant entity in northern Sumatra. However the Pasai began to collapse under pressure from declining economic conditions and the Portuguese, who occupied much of the area after occupying Malacca in the early 15th century. Sultan Ali Mughayat Syah, ruler of the newly founded Sultanate of Aceh, aggressively expanded in the area in the 1520s and established sultanate was built on the remains of the Pasai and other extinct kingdoms in the area, and made Banda Aceh the capital, naming it for himself as Kutaraja or 'City of the King'.After a long period of rule by the Sultanate, Aceh began to come into conflict with the Dutch and the British in the second half of the 18th century. At the end of the 18th century, the territory of Aceh in the Malay Peninsula, namely Kedah and Pulau Pinang, were seized by the British. In 1871, the Dutch began to threaten Aceh, and on 26 March 1873, the Dutch formally declared war on Aceh. The Dutch bombarded the capital in that year and sought to capture the Sultan's palace in the city to bring about a capitulation of the Acehnese. Significant support from the British in the region led the modernisation and fortification of the city, and while coastal areas were lost the Dutch underestimated the city's defences. The Dutch expedition commander General Johan KÃ¶hler was killed in a skirmish around the city, leading to the failure of the first expedition. A second expedition was mounted by the Dutch within months and was successful in overwhelming the city. The Dutch moved into the capital in January 1874 believing the Acehnese to have surrendered; however, the conflict moved into the countryside, and the Acehnese continued to actively oppose Dutch rule. After it entered the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on 28 December 1962, the name of the city was changed back to Banda Aceh by the Ministry of Public Administration and Regional Autonomy on 9 May 1963. On 26 December 2004, the city was hit by a tsunami caused by the 9.2-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean. The disaster killed 167,000 inhabitants and destroyed more than 60% of the city's buildings. Based on the statistical data issued by the City Government of Banda Aceh, Banda Aceh had 248,727 inhabitants in May 2012.|$|R
