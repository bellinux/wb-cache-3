25|$|Kodagu style – this drape is {{confined}} to ladies hailing from the Kodagu district of Karnataka. In this style, the pleats are created in the rear, instead of the front.

25|$|Long-pan systems (pans and seam lengths {{greater than}} 10-feet) {{accommodate}} the cumulative expansion stress over long spans of copper sheets. These installations can be complicated {{due to the}} length of roof pan versus seam length, cleat design and spacing, and the physical expansion characteristics of copper sheets. This expansion must be accommodated by fixing the pan at one end (which accumulates the expansion at the <b>loose</b> <b>end)</b> or by fixing the center of the pan (which accumulates half of the expansion at both free ends).|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick of the wrist.|$|E

25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari tucked into the {{waistband}} of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> is draped over the shoulder. The <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E
25|$|Bengali and Odia {{style is}} worn without any pleats. Traditionally the Bengali style is worn without pleats where the saree is wrapped around in an {{anti-clockwise}} direction {{around the waist}} and then a second time from the other direction. The <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> is a lot longer and that goes around the body over the left shoulder. There is enough cloth left to cover the head as well. The modern style of wearing a saree originates from the Tagore family. Jnanadanandini Devi, the wife of Rabindranath Tagore's elder brother Satyendranath {{came up with a}} different way to wear the saree after her stay in Bombay. This required a chemise or jacket (old name for blouse) and petticoat to be worn under the saree and made it possible for women {{to come out of the}} secluded women's quarters in this attire.|$|E

In the confusion sure to break out among the superstitious sailors, Peters and Augustus, helped by Tiger, will take over the ship again. Everything goes according to plan, and soon the three men are masters of the Grampus: all the mutineers are killed or thrown overboard except one, Richard Parker, whom they spare to help them run the vessel.

500|$|South Indian women {{traditionally}} wear a sari, {{a garment}} {{that consists of}} a drape varying from [...] to [...] in length and [...] to [...] in breadth that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, baring the midriff. Ancient Tamil poetry such as the Silappadhikaram describes women in exquisite drapery or sari. The sari is to be wrapped around the waist, with the <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> of the drape to be worn over the shoulder, baring the midriff as according to Indian philosophy, the navel is considered {{as the source of}} life and creativity. Madisar is a typical style worn by Brahmin ladies from Tamil Nadu. Women wear colourful silk sarees on special occasions such as marriages.|$|E
500|$|A neurolytic {{block is}} the {{deliberate}} injury of a nerve by {{the application of}} chemicals (in which case the procedure is called [...] "neurolysis") or physical agents such as freezing or heating ("neurotomy"). These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve's fibers and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals. In these procedures, the thin protective layer around the nerve fiber, the basal lamina, is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber regrows, it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct <b>loose</b> <b>end,</b> and function may be restored. Surgically cutting a nerve severs these basal lamina tubes, and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, a painful neuroma or deafferentation pain may develop. This is why the neurolytic is preferred over the surgical block.|$|E

[...] Drummer Phil Collins, having a temporary break from Genesis after his first marriage had failed, was at a <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked Jones, who had previously played with the Small Faces and the Faces. Jones officially joined the band in November 1978. John [...] "Rabbit" [...] Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist. On 2 May 1979, the Who returned to the stage with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, followed by the Cannes Film Festival in France and dates at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E
500|$|There still {{remained}} {{the question of}} Leask's concession, the existence of which Rudd's negotiating team had learned in Bulawayo {{towards the end of}} October. Rhodes resolved that it must be acquired: [...] "I quite see that worthless as [...] concession is, it logically destroys yours," [...] he told Rudd. This <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> was tied up in late January 1889, when Rhodes met and settled with Leask and his associates, James Fairbairn and George Phillips, in Johannesburg. Leask was given £2,000 in cash and a 10% interest in the Rudd Concession, and allowed to retain a 10% share in his own agreement with Lobengula. Fairbairn and Phillips were granted an annual allowance of £300 each. In Cape Town, with Rhodes's opposition removed, Robinson altered his stance regarding the Matabele mission, cabling Whitehall that further investigation had shown Babayane and Mshete to be headmen after all, so they should be allowed to board ship for England.|$|E
500|$|Cibber {{was born}} in Southampton Street, in Bloomsbury, London. He was the eldest child of Caius Gabriel Cibber, a {{distinguished}} sculptor originally from Denmark. His mother, Jane née Colley, came {{from a family of}} gentry from Glaston, Rutland. He was educated at the King's School, Grantham, from 1682 until the age of 16, but failed to win a place at Winchester College, which had been founded by his maternal ancestor William of Wykeham. In 1688, he joined the service of his father's patron, Lord Devonshire, {{who was one of the}} prime supporters of the Glorious Revolution. After the revolution, and at a <b>loose</b> <b>end</b> in London, he was attracted to the stage and in 1690 began work as an actor in Thomas Betterton's United Company at the Drury Lane Theatre. [...] "Poor, at odds with his parents, and entering the theatrical world at a time when players were losing their power to businessmen-managers", on 6 May 1693 Cibber married Katherine Shore, the daughter of Matthias Shore, sergeant-trumpeter to the King, despite his poor prospects and insecure, socially inferior job.|$|E

500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a <b>loose</b> <b>end.</b> And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just where I was going or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1940 Mitford {{suffered}} {{her second}} miscarriage. Shortly afterwards Rodd, {{who had been}} commissioned into the Welsh Guards, departed overseas. Alone in London, Mitford moved to the family's Rutland Gate house where she remained during the London blitz. The main house had been requisitioned to provide a refuge for Jewish families evacuated from the bombed areas of the East End. Mitford {{spent much of her}} time looking after these families, [...] "so hard-working, clean and grateful". A brief affair with a [...] Free French officer, André Roy, resulted in a third pregnancy. Mitford again miscarried, with complications that led, in November 1941, to a hysterectomy. After convalescence, at a <b>loose</b> <b>end,</b> she began working as an assistant at the Heywood Hill bookshop in Curzon Street. The shop became the centre of Mitford's daily activities, and was a favoured meeting place for London's literati. In September 1942 she met Gaston Palewski, a French colonel attached to General Charles de Gaulle's London staff. She found him fascinating, and he became the love of her life—though her feelings were never fully reciprocated—and an inspiration for much of her future writing. For the sake of Mitford's reputation the affair was pursued with discretion, before Palewski left for Algeria in May 1943. Thereafter the relationship was conducted mainly by letters and occasional phone calls, since Palewski was only intermittently in England {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
