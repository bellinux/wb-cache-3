40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> <b>level</b> to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews were used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can be explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies on <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls. Increased <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> may possibly be correlated to increased disease activity in both diseases, but evidence is mixed. For WG, a positive correlation of disease incidence with latitude has been found, which may indicate <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> as a cause. Discussion: More research in larger groups is required to determine the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> to susceptibility and disease activity in SLE, AAV and SSc...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B- 12 {{metabolism}} in HIV-infected {{patients in}} the age of highly active antiretroviral therapy: role of homocysteine in assessing vitamin B- 12 status 1 – 3 Angel F Remacha, Josep Cadafalch, Pilar Sardà, Montserrat Barceló, and Montserrat Fuster Background: Before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 20 % and 10 % of HIV-infected patients had <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 and red blood cell folate (RBCF) concentra-tions, respectively. However, few patients had real vitamin B- 12 deficiency. Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 and RBCF concentrations in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART and the usefulness of serum homocysteine (sHcy) for differenti-ating patients with deficiency from those with harmlessly <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12. Design: The prevalence of <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 and RBCF was eval-uated in 126 HIV-infected patients receiving HAART. Moreover, sHcy concentrations were evaluated in 40 HIV-infected patients with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 and in 37 HIV-infected patients with low RBCF and were compared with those in 128 HIV-infected patients with normal vitamin B- 12 and RBCF. sHcy was used to monitor treatment with vitamin B- 12 and folic acid in 28 patients (24 with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 and RBCF and 4 with hyperhomocysteinemia but normal vitamin B- 12 and RBCF). Results: The prevalence of <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 was significantly lower in patients receiving HAART than in previously studied patients who did not receive HAART (8. 7 % compared with 27 %). Nine of the 40 patients (22. 5 %) with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 (≤ 200 pmol/L) had hyperhomocysteinemia (> 17. 5 mol homocysteine/L). Nineteen (51. 4 %) of the 37 patients with low RBCF (≤ 580 nmol/L, percentile 10) had hyperhomocysteine-mia. Among the 9 patients with an RBCF concentra-tion ≤ 450 nmol/L (percentile 2. 5), all had hyperhomocys-teinemia. The treatment with vitamin B- 12 and folic acid normalized sHcy concentrations. Conclusions: The prevalence of <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 decreased after the introduction of HAART. The study of sHcy is useful for detecting HIV-infected patients with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 and rea...|$|R

25|$|Anticonvulsants {{affect the}} bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, <b>low</b> <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>levels,</b> and {{increased}} parathyroid hormone. Anticonvulsants {{also contribute to the}} increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants.

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D {{status and}} obesity have {{concomitantly}} reached epidemic levels worldwide. Up to now {{the direction of}} the association between <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D status and obesity, the exact mechanisms responsible for this association and the clinical usefulness to increase vitamin D status for reducing adiposity still warrant further evaluation. The aim of the present review was to examine the current evidence linking <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D status and obesity in relation {{to the role of the}} nutritionist. On the one side, considering obesity as a causal factor, low sun exposure in obese individuals due to their sedentary lifestyle and less outdoor activity, vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue, and volumetric dilution of ingested or cutaneously synthesized vitamin D 3 in the large fat mass of obese patients, might represent some of the factors playing a major role in the pathogenesis of the <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D status. On the other side, the expression of both vitamin D 3 receptors and enzymes responsible for vitamin D 3 metabolism in adipocytes depicted a role for the <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D status per se in the development of obesity by modulating adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. Nutritionists need to accurately address the aspects influencing the <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D status in obesity and the vitamin D supplementation in obese individuals...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to explore the relationship between <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). Ninety-six subjects with acute or chronic motor complete SCI participated. Levels of serum vitamin D 25 (OH), calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were collected, and information regarding nutritional patterns and fracture history was obtained from subjects. Evidence of current or previous HO was ascertained through chart review. Of the 96 subjects, 12 were found to have developed HO, 11 with serum vitamin D 25 (OH) between 5 and 17 ng/mL. Nine subjects exhibited secondary hyperparathyroidism in the range of 72 to 169 pg/mL. Only one subject demonstrated HO in the absence of <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D. However, many subjects with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D (5 – 31 ng/mL) did not have hyperparathyroidism or HO. Statistical testing demonstrated a correlation between hyperparathyroidism and HO (>p < 0. 001) as well as hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL). Direct correlation between HO and <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D was not observed, but hyperparathyroidism may increase this risk. We believe that those patients who demonstrate <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D and elevated PTH should be screened for HO in addition to beginning vitamin supplementation.

30|$|Long-term stable osseointegrated {{implants}} are {{the primary}} goal in dental implantology. Although dental implants have proven clinical reliable in the long term, the failure of implants {{at a very early}} stage of osseointegration has been described [1, 2]. The pursuit to identify the mechanisms leading to early implant failure is ongoing to date and include the following: tobacco usage, diabetes, wear particle release and foreign body reaction, local bone necrosis due to heat generation during bone preparation or implant placement [2 – 9]. Systematic reviews demonstrated that an antibiotic regimen before dental implant placement subtly reduces the early implant infection and consequently implant failure [10, 11]. In orthopedics, the risk to develop a periprosthetic joint infection has been associated with a <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> D level [12]. A relationship between bone metabolism, vitamin D, and early implant failure in human has not been proven to date. Vitamin D induces bone formation around implants in rodents [13 – 17]. Besides the classical function, findings of the last decades indicate vitamin D as an important immune regulator targeting both, the innate and adaptive immune response, since all cells of the immune system express <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> receptor (VDR) [18 – 20].|$|R

40|$|Background: In some {{patients}} with vitamin B- 12 deficiency mistakenly treated with folic acid, anemia resolved but neurologic complications became worse (masking). Fortification of enriched cereal grains with folic acid has raised concerns {{that people who}} consume large quantities of cereal grains, particularly the elderly, may be at increased risk of masking. It is unclear, however, what proportion of people with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 concentrations do not have anemia and whether the proportion is increasing. Objective: We investigated whether fortification has increased the proportion of patients with <b>low</b> <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 but without anemia. Design: We reviewed the laboratory results of every patient for whom a vitamin B- 12 concentration was measured at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, DC, between 1992 and 2000.

2500|$|Dark-skinned {{people living}} in low {{sunlight}} environments have been recorded to be very susceptible to vitamin D deficiency due to reduced vitamin D synthesis. A dark-skinned person requires about six times as much UVB than lightly pigmented persons. This {{is not a problem}} near the equator; however, it can be a problem at higher latitudes. For humans with dark skin in climates of low UVR, it can take about two hours to produce the same amount of vitamin D as humans with light skin produce in 15 minutes. Dark-skinned people having a high body-mass index and not taking vitamin D supplements were associated with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D {{plays an important role in}} regulating the human immune system and chronic deficiencies in vitamin D can make humans susceptible to specific types of cancers and many kinds of infectious diseases. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing tuberculosis fivefold and also contributes to the development of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The most prevalent disease to follow vitamin D deficiency is rickets, the softening of bones in children potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is caused by reduced vitamin D synthesis that causes an absence of vitamin D, which then causes the dietary calcium to not be properly absorbed. This disease in the past was commonly found among dark-skinned Americans of the southern part of the United States who migrated north into low sunlight environments. The popularity of sugary drinks and decreased time spent outside have contributed to significant rise of developing rickets. Deformities of the female pelvis related to severe rickets impair normal childbirth, which leads to higher mortality of the infant, mother, or both. Vitamin D deficiency is most common in regions with low sunlight, especially in the winter. Chronic deficiencies in vitamin D may also be linked with breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, and possibly other types of cancers. [...] The relationship between cardiovascular disease and vitamin D deficiency also suggest link between health of cardiac and smooth muscle. <b>Low</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>levels</b> have also been linked to impaired immune system and brain functions. In addition, recent studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to autoimmune diseases, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and incidence of memory loss. Outside the tropics UVR has to penetrate through a thicker layer of atmosphere, which results in most of the UVB reflected or destroyed en route; because of this there is less potential for vitamin D biosynthesis in regions far from the equator. Higher amount of vitamin D intake for dark-skinned {{people living in}} regions with low levels of sunlight are advised by doctors to follow vitamin D rich diet or take vitamin D supplements, although there is recent evidence that dark-skinned individuals are able to process vitamin D more efficiently than lighter-skinned individuals so may have a lower threshold of sufficiency.|$|E
