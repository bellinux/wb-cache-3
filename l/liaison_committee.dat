5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general.

5|$|The Polish {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam, {{his wife}} Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, {{worked on the}} Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military <b>Liaison</b> <b>Committee</b> or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device. It fell to Oppenheimer, {{as chairman of the}} AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), to decide whether the United States should develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, and this was a factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954.|$|E
