25|$|An {{increase}} in lymphocyte concentration {{is usually a}} sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> in an otherwise normal person). A high <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of Bordetella pertussis, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children.

Retrospective single center evaluation of disease activity and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> {{in patients with}} AAV, and of <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in kidney transplant-recipients, were done; both at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Twenty-three patients with AAV were included. Remission was achieved in all patients. Ten patients experienced a relapse after a median of 66 weeks (range 15 - 189 weeks). Median <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> at diagnosis {{were significantly higher than}} at remission (1. 38 x 10 (9) /L vs. 0. 99 x 10 (9) /L; P = 0. 007).

40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is an {{inflammatory}} granulomatous disease of unknown origin. Lungs and thoracic lymph nodes {{are most frequently}} affected. To assess inflammatory process activity, disease activity criteria are to be identified. In clinical practice, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>count</b> and blood neopterin levels are commonly used for the monitoring of inflammatory activity in sarcoidosis, though, reliability of the methods may be inadequate. Aim: To assess reliability of BAL fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>count</b> and blood neopterin levels as inflammatory markers in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Materials and methods: BAL fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> and blood neopterin levels were measured in 111 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. 39 patients had stage I sarcoidosis on chest radiographs, 57 patients had stage II, 15 patients had stage III sarcoidosis. In 28 patients, BAL fluid was sampled from different segments of the lung to compare <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts.</b> The results were paralleled with pulmonary function tests, radiographic stage and lung parenchyma changes in computed tomography. Results: <b>Lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> in BAL fluid correlated with blood neopterin levels (r= 0. 26, p= 0. 027), forced vital capacity value (r=- 0. 24, p= 0. 04), and did not correlate with sarcoidosis radiographic stage. In 43 % of patients, relative <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in BAL fluid samples {{from different parts of}} the lung varied significantly (from 5 to 23 %). Normal neopterin levels were detected in 40 % of patients with active inflammation. Conclusion: Non-uniform pattern of pulmonary inflammation results in variable <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> in BAL fluid samples from different parts of the lung. BAL fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> and blood neopterin levels should not be used for reliable monitoring of inflammation in sarcoidosis. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{people with}} A-T have low <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in the blood. This problem {{seems to be}} {{relatively}} stable with age, but a rare number of people do have progressively decreasing <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> as they get older.

Although <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> are often as low in people with A-T, they seldom have problems with opportunistic infections. (The one exception to that rule is that problems with chronic or recurrent warts are common.)

40|$|The {{health effects}} of {{occupational}} radiation exposure have long {{been a source of}} scientific and administrative debates related to setting exposure standards. Relevant to this field are the effects of occupational long term radiation exposure on the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> which are especially sensitive to radiation. The trend of <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in radiation workers is of major importance since decreases in <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> may be precursors of immunity disorders, cancer susceptibility or other chronic conditions. Another important question is whether the occupational radiation affects the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> similarly in males and females, given the relative lack of information on the effects and health implications of long term occupational radiation exposure on female subjects. This dissertation presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the relationship between dosimetric (yearly gamma exposure) and hematological (<b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts)</b> data collected from a historical cohort (1948 - 1956) of highly exposed radiation workers at Mayak Plant Association located in Russia. The analysis controls for important covariates, such as the baseline <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> sex, work location related to Plutonium exposure lifestyle variables and the number of years from the first exposure. The analysis contrasts the most relevant radiation dose-response models by using marginal models and the GEE technique. STATA programming tools have been developed to check the assumptions required by the GEE technique, with special attention to the missing data mechanisms and patterns in the framework of a longitudinal study with repeated measurements and unbalanced number of observations. The issue of non-linearity between the outcome variable and the explanatory covariates is addressed by the implementation of linear splines within GEE models. Statistical analyses indicate: (a) that a linear radiation dose-response model is appropriate for the data, (b) a statistically significant negative relationship between the log-transformed <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> and the log-transformed external gamma dose, (c) no statistically significant differences between males and females regarding the effect of occupational radiation exposure on the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts.</b> Public health significance of this research is:a) The linear radiation dose-response model is reasonable for regulatory purposes, andb) Males and females do not require differential regulatory standards for low dose occupational radiation exposure...|$|R

It was a retrospective cohort study using medical record review based on a convenience sampling from 2007 till May 2011 in both in-patient and ambulatory setting in Royal Adelaide Hospital. There were a total of 294 patients who received 376 courses and 1, 571 cycles of rapid rituximab infusion. Forty-three (14. 6 %) patients experienced acute adverse events of hypotension being the most commonly occurring events followed by patients feeling hot and face-flushed. There were 11 predictors analysed, namely age, gender, diagnosis, stage of disease, presence of cardiac or lung morbidities, type of treatment, number of course and cycles, total white blood cells <b>count,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> and lactate dehydrogenase using log generalised estimating equation for univariate and multivariate analysis.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the accuracy of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> to predict a mechanical complication (MC) after myocardial infarction (MI). Within 10 years, we identified 36 patients with 39 echocardiographically confirmed MC within 30 days of MI: ventricular septal defect (17 cases), papillary muscle rupture (10 cases), and left ventricular free wall rupture (12 cases). They were compared to 41 controls with an uncomplicated hospital course after MI. Peak CRP levels and minimum relative <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> obtained within 96 h of the acute MI (AMI) and before diagnosis of the complication were compared with clinical parameters. Prior to the MC, peak CRP levels were significantly higher (p < 0. 001) and relative <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> lower (p < 0. 001) than in controls while creatine kinase levels did not differ (p = nonsignificant). Using multivariate logistic regression, the following score was identified to have excellent prognostic significance for MC: CRP (mg/l) - 10 x Lyc (%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0. 90 +/- 0. 05 (p < 0. 001).

Immune {{responses}} following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) were examined {{from the point}} of view of <b>lymphocyte</b> subset <b>counts</b> and natural killer cell activity (NKA). Patients and Methods. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 62 patients at 4 time points between pretreatment and 4 weeks post-treatment for analysis of the change of total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> (TLC) and <b>lymphocyte</b> subset <b>counts</b> of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 19 +, CD 56 +, and NKA. In addition, the changes of <b>lymphocyte</b> subset <b>counts</b> were compared between patients with or without relapse. Further, the correlations between SBRT-related parameters and immune response were analyzed for the purpose of revealing the mechanisms of the immune response. Results. All <b>lymphocyte</b> subset <b>counts</b> and NKA at post-treatment and 1 week post-treatment were significantly lower than pre-treatment (P< 0. 01). No significant differences in the changes of <b>lymphocyte</b> subset <b>counts</b> were observed among patients with or without relapse. The volume of the vertebral body receiving radiation doses of 3 [*]Gy or more (VV 3) significantly correlated with the changes of nearly all <b>lymphocyte</b> subset <b>counts.</b> Conclusions.

A cohort of 102 patients receiving either the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib or dabrafenib was analyzed. The amount of patients receiving either medication with or without systemic corticosteroids (dexamethasone) was determined and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> before and under therapy assessed. Additionally, the number and severity of infections occurring in these groups was analyzed. Vemurafenib treatment led to a considerable decrease in <b>lymphocyte</b> cell <b>counts,</b> with 62. 3 % of patients having lymphopenia.
