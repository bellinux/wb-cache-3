[...] This is because the petal design on the F-15 was problematic and could fall off in flight; therefore they were removed, resulting in a 3% aerodynamic drag increase.|$|E

50|$|A Controlled Parking Zone or CPZ is a {{specific}} type of UK parking restriction that may be applied to a group of roads within the zone. The intended purpose of a CPZ is to reduce the clutter that can arise from erecting several signs that would otherwise convey the same information, such as a common time restriction sign adjacent to all the single yellow lines in the zone. A sign indicating the start of a CPZ typically states that there are parking, <b>loading,</b> <b>weight</b> or other restrictions between certain hours of operation. The CPZ applies to all parking within the zone and within the zone there should be no other road markings, although this point {{was the subject of a}} judgement in the Court of Appeal.|$|E
50|$|Gliders are {{planes that}} do not {{typically}} have any type of propulsion. Unpowered glider flight must be sustained through exploitation of the natural lift produced from thermals or wind hitting a slope. Dynamic soaring is another popular way of providing energy to gliders that {{is becoming more and}} more common. However, even conventional slope soaring gliders are capable of achieving speeds comparable with similar sized powered craft.Gliders are typically partial to slow flying and have high aspect ratio, as well as very low wing <b>loading</b> (<b>weight</b> to wing area ratio). Two and three-channel gliders which use only rudder control for steering and dihedral or polyhedral wing shape to automatically counteract rolling are popular as training craft, due to their ability to fly very slowly and high tolerance to error.|$|E

Although the previous configuration improves the <b>load</b> <b>weight</b> of the rotor, levitation and guidance stability has been decreased because of the repulsive force of the permanent magnet.

50|$|A man-aboard {{system can}} provide {{significant}} floorspace savings over manual or fork lift operations {{but is not}} truly an AS/RS, as the operation is still manual. Storage system heights are not limited by the reach height of the order picker, as the picker rides along on the platform as it is moved vertically or horizontally to the various storage locations. Shelves or storage cabinets can be stacked as high as floor <b>loading,</b> <b>weight</b> capacity, throughput requirements, and/or ceiling heights will permit. Man-aboard storage and retrieval systems are {{far and away the}} most expensive picker-to-stock equipment alternative, but are less expensive than a fully automated system. Aisle-captive storage/retrieval machines reaching heights up to 40 feet cost around $125,000. Hence, there must be enough storage density and/or productivity improvement over cart and tote picking to justify the investment. Also, because vertical travel is slow compared to horizontal travel, typical picking rates in man-aboard operations range between 40 and 250 lines per person-hour. The range is large because there is a wide variety of operating schemes for man-aboard systems. Man-aboard systems are typically appropriate for slow-moving items where space is fairly expensive.|$|E
5000|$|The karyological data of Schmutz and Oliphant {{provided}} early {{scientific evidence}} of the unexpectedly close relationship between the peregrine and prairie falcons. Wink and Sauer-Gürth later estimated using molecular systematics that the prairie falcon diverged about 3 to 5 million years ago from an archaic peregrine ancestor, assuming a molecular clock calibration of 2% sequence divergence per 1 million years. The prairie falcon then evolved from its peregrine stock forebears {{in a process of}} parapatric speciation based on partially separated environments where different selective pressures lead to separate genetic drift and eventually to separate species. This process has led to the prairie falcon having enhanced survivability in the sparse arid environment that dominates the interior of the American west. This enhanced competitiveness in this environment is based on superior energy efficiency (being no larger than the prey base and competition with other raptors requires), and versatility in the utilization of a wider range of prey. Moderately lower weight than the muscular peregrine for similar wingspan not only allows lower food and energy requirements by the simple expedient of less muscle to support, but also allows a lighter wing <b>loading</b> (<b>weight</b> per square unit of wing area) that allows more distance to be covered per calorie consumed when hunting over prey sparse terrain. [...] The lighter wing loading also allows greater maneuverability, which is valuable in the pursuit of agile lightly wing loaded prey and rapidly dodging ground prey. When the prairie falcon locates needed prey, it is relentless in its pursuit. Quoting from the book The Prairie Falcon, [...] "Because they evolved in the harsh western environment, prairie falcons have the stamina to out-fly the strongest quarry. They have the spirit to crash through dense cover when attacking prey, something peregrines seldom attempt." [...] In the longer distance lower prey density American west, the prairie falcon also has evolved eyes that are proportionally larger relative to head size than the already large eyes of other falcons. The specialization of the prairie falcon to this particular environment is also reflected by {{the fact that there are}} no subspecies of the prairie falcon evolved to fit other environments, and that it seldom strays far outside the native range to which it is most suited and within which it has competitive advantages over the peregrine falcon.|$|E

However, the application of the iron-oxide may prevent Re 7 + from reducting to Re 4 + during the calcination at 673 K in He in the case of proper Re <b>loading</b> <b>weight</b> probably through the interaction of ammonium perrhenate with the supports, leading to the growth of Re 6 + on the catalyst surface. Above the monolayer <b>loading</b> <b>weight</b> of ReO 3, there was coexistence of Re 6 + and Re 6 + on the catalyst surface. A redox mechanism between Re 6 + and Re 4 + species on the catalyst surface was proposed to be responsible for the high performance in the methanol selective oxidation to dimethoxymethane...|$|E

A nonlinear relation between POECPK and driving speed was explored based on the data. Furthermore, a data-based model was established to estimate driving distance of BELVs in consideration of SOC and driving speed. The verification results indicate that the model has the good estimation accuracy. By using the model, the economical driving speed of BELVs is explored, which indicates that the overall economical driving speed is 51.2028  km/h.

Measuring postural sway may complement analyses of walking with loads, allowing for quick and efficient determination of how load carriage gear will impact the Soldier.
