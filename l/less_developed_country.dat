According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country,</b> its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory.

40|$|The {{question}} that <b>Less</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Countries</b> have faced {{since the advent}} of floating exchange rates among the Industrial Countries is whether they should also adopt a floating exchange rate system. The <b>Less</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Countries</b> have opted for a pegged exchange rate system, since their economic characteristics and institutional structure indicate that floating for the <b>Less</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Countries</b> would result in volatile or unstable exchange rates. Since <b>Less</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Countries</b> peg t heir exchange rates in the presence of flexible rates among industrial <b>countries,</b> the <b>Less</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Countries</b> pegged exchange rates move in accordance to the exchange rates to which they are pegged. This study examines whether there are differences in the variability of the different effective exchange rate indices or currency baskets. Specifically the export, import and total trade weighted effective exchange rates for three African <b>Less</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Countries</b> are examined. Currency baskets are varied by changing the number of currencies coefficent of variation included in was used the basket.

30|$|This paper {{examines}} why advanced {{countries are}} more monogamous than <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> A common feature of developed economies {{is that the}} level of human capital and, relatedly, the average labor income in these countries are much higher than they are in <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> I argue that this characteristic is the main reason for the variations in the degree of polygyny among advanced and <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> I further assert that, through the process of industrialization and economic development, the spread of human capital and the increase of labor income have led to the virtual disappearance of polygyny at the later stage of the transition.|$|R

40|$|Relying on a {{model of}} new {{economic}} geography, this paper focuses {{on the relationship between}} trade policy and the economic conditions of take-off. We confirm notably in a trisectoral analysis that both unilateral trade liberalization and import substitution, while influencing the balance between centrifugal and centripetal forces, may be successful in getting the <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> out of the poverty trap. In our model, technological externalities resulting from sectoral learning spillovers complete the usual presence in such theoretical framework of pecuniary externalities. By this way, we show that the degree of technological diffusion is a determining parameter for a Southern economy. We show also that sectoral trade policies, {{in the same way as}} an active industrial policy, favour structural change in the <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country.</b> Classification JEL : F 12, F 13, O 14...|$|E

Results suggest the pertinence of allowing for a temporary differentiation of fiscal discipline rules in favour of the <b>less</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country.</b> R&D subsidies granted by this country seem to lead to an easier catching-up without producing important negative external effects, also as not hurting severely the conditions for long-run sustainability of public accounts.
