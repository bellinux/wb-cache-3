However, high-quality faces {{can be difficult to}} achieve for devices grown on a sapphire substrate as this material is difficult to cleave cleanly. We have therefore investigated a technology known as “stealth dicing”. The technology uses a pulsed laser to damage a plane of material inside of the wafer due to multi-photon absorption instead of cutting through the wafer surface. If the damage is induced in a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> points, the sample can then be cleaved easily along the damaged plane to leave a high-quality surface.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} load-carrying capability of the multiply cross-section rod. This calculation {{is based on the}} model of the ideal plasticity of the material, so that the desired ultimate torque is a torque at which the entire cross section goes into a plastic state. The article discusses the cylindrical multiply cross-section rod. To satisfy the equilibrium equation and the condition of plasticity simultaneously, two stress function Ф and φ are introduced. By mathematical transformations it has been proved that Ф is constant along the path, and a formula to find its values on the contours has been obtained. The paper also presents the rationale of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> discontinuity and obtained relationships, which allow us to derive the equations break lines for simple interaction of neighboring circuits, such as two lines, straight lines and circles, circles and a different sign of the curvature. After substitution into the boundary condition {{at the end of the}} stress function Ф and mathematical transformations a formula is obtained to determine the ultimate torque for the multiply cross-section rod. Using the doubly connected cross-section and three-connected cross-section rods as an example the application of the formula of ultimate torque is studied. For doubly connected cross-section rod, the paper offers a formula of the torque versus the radius of the rod, the aperture radius and the distance between their centers. It also clearly demonstrates the torque dependence both on the ratio of the radii and on the displacement of hole. It is shown that the value of the torque is more influenced by the displacement of hole, rather than by the ratio of the radii. For the three-connected cross-section rod the paper shows the integration feature that consists in selection of a coordinate system. As an example, the ultimate torque is found by two methods: analytical one and 3 D modeling. The method of 3 D modeling is based on the Nadai’s sand analogy, complements and develops it. The presented technique not only enables us to make calculations of the load-carrying capacity based on the ideal plasticity, but also allows us to investigate complex multiply crosssection rods in the creep. </p...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate structural shadow zones encountered in shipbuilding design using the I-DEAS (Integrated Design Engineering Analysis Software) software. The term 'shadow zone' refers to areas <b>of</b> low <b>stress</b> concentrations that are caused by <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> bending around structural discontinuities. Two ship design situations frequently encountered that result in shadow zones are hull girder penetrations and short structural longitudinal bulkheads.

This can prove to be expensive. However, powerful finite element analysis software is readily available that can analyze the shadow zones in greater detail and possibly minimize the area considered ineffective.

40|$|An {{engineering}} structure can be optimized to maximize its stiffness under a setof applied loads, or (equivalently) to ensure all stresses {{in the structure}} are at alimit value. Such an optimum can be refined by including more members in thestructure, enlarging the solution space and allowing an improved result. Continuingthis process, we obtain the limit of refinement of a sequence of optimal structures. Originally studied by Michell, the limit consists of a continuum of infinitely densemembers, and is the most optimal structure possible for a given sequence of structuraltopologies. In this work, we lift the work of Michell from the plane onto curved three-dimensional shell structures. This is accomplished in two parts: first, we consideroptimal continuum shells in their own terms, then we consider a sequence of optimaldiscrete grid shells and examine their convergence to the limit. The properties of thecontinuum guide our search for a correct sequence; in particular, we expect the gridshell to converge to the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> principal <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> the continuum in the limit. Crucialto our result {{is the concept of}} a net, a discrete collection of continuous curves thatretains the topological characteristics of a grid shell but allows us to use calculus toreason about structures near the limit.

However, in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability.

40|$|SUMMARY Small {{fractures}} in the posterior {{elements of the}} spine were identified by stereoscopic radiography in 7 patients suffering from back pain. The clinical data on these 7 patients are presented. Pain in the lumbar region is the commonest rheuma-tological disability. It is possible to identify {{the causes of the}} pain in some patients, but in many the under-lying pathogenic mechanism is uncertain. Radio-logical changes may be found in the lumbar spine, but their significance is uncertain. It seems better to label these patients as having 'nonspecific back pain', a term which carries no pathological implications, rather than apply diagnostic terms which have no proven basis. Gross fractures of the lumbar spine following trauma produce acute back pain and are easily recognised. At the other extreme, microfractures of trabeculae may occur along <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> (Vernon-Roberts and Pirie, 1973). They have been found in pathological studies, but cannot be identified in life. Their clinical significance is uncertain, but they could be responsible for acute episodes of back pain which settle as the fracture heals. The use of the Zeiss stereoplotter (Jacoby et al., 1976) enables us to examine paired stereoscopic radiographs and to see detail with a clarity not possible with conventional x-rays. In particular, the posterior elements of the spine can be seen more clearly. This technique has enabled us to identify small {{fractures in}} the laminae and apophyseal processes in patients who would otherwise be labelled as having 'nonspecific back pain'.
