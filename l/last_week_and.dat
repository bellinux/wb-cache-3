5|$|Hardy won the TNA World Title from EC3 on the January 19, 2016 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, {{becoming}} {{the first man to}} defeat him in a one-on-one match in TNA. During the match a double turn took place; Hardy turned heel after Tyrus betrayed EC3. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Jeff Hardy had confronted him about <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> issued a challenge to Matt for the World Heavyweight title in the main event and Matt accepted. However, later before the main event could begin, Eric Young and Bram would attack Jeff from behind. Kurt Angle would then come out to try save Jeff and Matt would have Tyrus attack Angle from behind. While Matt watched from the ramp, Young attacked Jeff with the Piledriver off the apron through a table. The following week, he successfully retained his title against Kurt Angle. At Lockdown, he retained his title in a Six-side of steel match against Ethan Carter III, with the help of Rockstar Spud. He lost his title against Drew Galloway on the March 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, after a match featuring EC3 and Jeff Hardy.|$|E
25|$|With {{both teams}} {{suffering}} surprising upsets {{at home in}} their previous games, both Cal and UCLA came into their Rose Bowl machup looking to restore their reputations and Pac-10 title hopes. Despite out of conference losses to Notre Dame and Utah, UCLA remained undefeated in the conference at 4–0 and controlled their Pac-10 destiny. Cal had suffered only the loss from <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> were returning Nate Longshore back to the lineup. The game was played at the Rose Bowl with 83,494 in attendance.|$|E
500|$|The {{witty and}} playful side of Creangă's personality, which became notorious {{during his time}} at Junimea and {{constituted}} {{a significant part of}} his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow Junimists in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself [...] "for against" [...] during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle {{and the two of them}} on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: [...] "not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day before yesterday and <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> throughout life". His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink. Overall, Eduard Gruber's report contended, Creangă's writing relied on him being [...] "a strong sensual and auditive type", and a [...] "very emotional" [...] person.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} the poorest {{performance}} of the season by the Longhorns, both offensively and defensively. On offense, Vince Young had only 162yards of offense, his lowest output of the season. The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, {{considered one of the}} nations best quarterbacks and a Heisman trophy candidate coming into the game, was [...] "not even the best quarterback on the field that day". The Daily Texan predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach Mack Brown as saying [...] "Looking at the numbers from what Reggie Bush did <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Building on {{the success}} of their singles in the United States, and riding {{on the back of the}} British Invasion, Them {{undertook}} a two-month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The Doors were the supporting act on the <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> Morrison's influence on the Doors singer, Jim Morrison, was noted by John Densmore in his book Riders On The Storm. Brian Hinton relates how [...] "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks." [...] On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on [...] "Gloria".|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. De Ferran stated that: [...] "I think first of all, I'd {{like to say that}} we're still running under {{a little bit of a}} cloud with all of the things that happened in the U.S. <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> what happened to (Alex) Zanardi is still in all of our minds." [...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of the Ginger Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was like coming back to a picnic you've been on <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> pick up the bones all around and see what the ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show {{us what you}} can do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E

Emin spoke out angrily against what she perceived as a general public lack of sympathy, and even amusement, {{at the loss of}} the artworks in the fire.

On the second day, Sussex moved to 412 all out, and in reply, defending champions Warwickshire made 141 for 5. There was worse news for England cricket fans as Ashley Giles was unable to field because of a strained hip flexor muscle. Giles said, [...] "It's a shame because it's been going really well. It's the best start to a season I've had but the hip was a bit stiff <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> it got worse yesterday. I haven't had this kind of injury before so, even without the England situation, it would be stupid to make it any worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien {{was a major}} {{focal point}} of dissatisfaction with Turner, with many polls showing his popularity. His 1985 book, Straight from the Heart, recounted his early life in Shawinigan, his years spent in the Canadian House of Commons as both a member of {{parliament}} and Cabinet Minister, and his failed 1984 leadership bid. It was an instant best-seller. In a 1985 interview, Frank Moores told Peter C. Newman: I was down fishing with Chrétien <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> he really hates Turner with a passion. He {{might be interested in}} joining the Tories if Turner is re-elected Liberal leader, although it would take a lot of discussion. Ed Broadbent later recalled that Chrétien harboured a marked degree of animosity towards Turner and that [...] "I noticed that any negative comment Chrétien could make about John Turner in the lobbies, he would do it. I didn't like that".|$|E

But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki.
