25|$|Phosgene {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style refrigerant gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small gas torch (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a sniffer tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any refrigerant gas was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the sniffer tube and would cause a colour change of the gas flame to a bright greenish blue. In the process, phosgene gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of phosgene poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of phosgene, produced during such <b>leak</b> <b>testing.</b> Electronic sensing of refrigerant gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, phosgene poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of refrigerant leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon refrigerant leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E

The objective of this thesis is {{to design and fabricate}} a <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> rig. The thesis describes the approaches of designing and fabricating a <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> rig. There are numerous steps taken to design and fabricate the test rig. The structural three-dimensional solid modelling design of test rig was developed by using the Solidwork engineering drawing software. The fabrication process also undergoes many steps such as material marking, cutting, drilling, welding and grinding. In addition, it also explains the procedure of testing by the simulation of three types of common leakages which includes pinhole, pipe crack/dent and gasket <b>leak.</b> The <b>testing</b> the rig is also explained in this thesis by maintaining a pressure of 4 bars in the test rig to prove whether the test rig is functioning efficiently.

Although the cuff <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> is a simple method to pre-dict postextubation stridor, {{little is known about}} its use in monitoring the effects of steroid treatment for this complication. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of steroids on postextubation stridor based on the clini-cal response and the cuff <b>leak</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: A cohort of 110 translaryngeal intubated patients in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled. A cuff <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> was conducted before extuba-tion. Patients developing postextubation stridor were intravenously given 5 mgs of dexamethasone every 8 hours for 3 days. The clinical response and cuff leak volume before and after steroid treatment were gathered for analy-sis. Results: The incidence of postextubation stridor was 18. 2 % (20 / 110). Fifty-five per-cent of patients (11 / 20) with stridor needed reintubation. Overall, 80 % of patients (16 / 20) with postextubation stridor improved with steroid treatment...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the Hermicity Tests in detail. Hermeticity testing is {{a technology that}} deals with the transfer of media (gasses) {{in and out of}} sealed enclosures based on vacuum science, physics, and chemistry. The chapter aims to establish an understanding of the different seal test methodologies for MEMS packages. The hermeticity classes are explained. Method for measuring package and seal Integrity using helium as the tracer gas defines and quantifies these classes differently but uses the same wording. Only three nondestructive <b>leak</b> <b>tests</b> possess high enough measurement sensitivity for modern inertial sensors. The relevant hermeticity tests for MEMs packages are membrane resonance, Kr 85 radioactive tracer gas tests, optical deformation, internal pressure measurement, helium <b>leak</b> <b>test,</b> IR transmission tests, and Q factor monitoring. The neon ultra-fine <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> is an elaborated hermeticity test environment with a dedicated vacuum prediction model (vacuum lif etime model) based on quality factor monitoring of micro resonating devices. The neon ultra-fine <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> procedure for a new device starts with measuring a calibration curve for Q factor over a relevant pressure range, using selected open devices. The calculation regarding the vacuum lifetime model can be done easily in an analytical way such as cavity with ideal getter and getter saturation.
