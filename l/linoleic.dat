5|$|Apple seed oil, high in <b>linoleic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|Egusi seed oil, {{from the}} seeds of Cucumeropsis mannii naudin, is {{particularly}} rich in <b>linoleic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of <b>linoleic</b> acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, <b>linoleic</b> acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include <b>linoleic</b> acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E
5|$|Okra seed oil, from Abelmoschus esculentus. Composed {{predominantly}} of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> acids. The greenish yellow {{edible oil}} has a pleasant taste and odor.|$|E
5|$|Persimmon seed oil, {{extracted}} from the seeds of Diospyros virginiana. Dark, reddish-brown color, similar in taste to olive oil. Nearly equal content of oleic and <b>linoleic</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of S.brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe—18.4% {{of the dry}} weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, <b>linoleic</b> acid made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), oleic acid was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by palmitic acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). <b>Linoleic</b> acid—a {{member of the group}} of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.|$|E
5|$|Passiflora edulis Passion fruit oil is {{extracted}} from the seeds and composed mainly of <b>linoleic</b> acid (62%) with smaller amounts of oleic acid (20%) and palmitic acid (7%). It has varied applications in cosmetics manufacturing and for uses as a human or animal food.|$|E
5|$|The total lipid, or crude fat, content {{makes up}} 2.6% {{of the dry}} matter of the mushroom. The {{proportion}} of fatty acids (expressed as a % of total fatty acids) are: palmitic acid, 9.8%; stearic acid, 2.7%; oleic acid, 36.1%; <b>linoleic</b> acid, 42.2%, and linolenic acid, 0.2%.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico {{showed them to}} have the following composition: moisture 94.53%; ash 0.323%; dietary fiber 3.024%; fat 0.368%; and protein 1.581%. The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was oleic acid (1.95%), followed by <b>linoleic</b> acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} shows R.botrytis {{to have a}} food energy value of 154 kilojoules per 100 grams of fresh fruit bodies, which {{is comparable to the}} 120–150 kJ range reported for commercially grown edible mushrooms. As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude protein, 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash. The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic (43.9%), <b>linoleic</b> (38.3%), and palmitic (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as <b>linoleic</b> acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in <b>linoleic</b> acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid <b>linoleic</b> acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in <b>linoleic</b> acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in <b>linoleic</b> acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E
25|$|The murine homolog {{of human}} 15(S)-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B), 8(S)-lipoxygenase, while preferring arachidonic acid over <b>linoleic</b> acid, metabolizes <b>linoleic</b> acid {{predominantly}} to (9(S)-HpODE, which in tissues and cells is rapidly reduced to 9(S)-HODE. However, ALOX15B, similar to human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15), metabolizes <b>linoleic</b> acid to 13(S)-HODE {{but not to}} 9(S)-HODEs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{predominant}} fats include {{palmitic acid}} and <b>linoleic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|Conjugated <b>linoleic</b> acid {{is claimed}} {{to help reduce}} obesity but it is {{ineffective}} for this use.|$|E
25|$|The seeds {{have a high}} <b>linoleic</b> acid {{content and}} can be used to feed cattle and chickens.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{soybeans}} are 20% fat, including {{saturated fat}} (3%), monounsaturated fat (4%) and polyunsaturated fat, mainly as <b>linoleic</b> acid (table).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the best}} source of ALA is seeds, most seeds and seed oils are much richer in an n−6 fatty acid, <b>linoleic</b> acid. Exceptions include {{flaxseed}} (must be ground for proper nutrient absorption) and chia seeds. <b>Linoleic</b> acid is the other essential fatty acid, but it, and the other n−6 fatty acids, compete with n−3s for positions in cell membranes and have very different effects on human health. There is {{a complex set of}} essential fatty acid interactions.|$|E
25|$|A hepoxilin-like {{metabolite}} of <b>linoleic</b> acid {{forms in}} the skin of humans and rodents. This hepoxilin is esterified to sphinganine in a lipid complex termed EOS (i.e. esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine, see Lipoxygenase#Biological function and classification#Human lipoxygenases) that also contains a very long chain fatty acid. In this pathway, ALOX12B metabolizes the esterified <b>linoleic</b> acid to its 9R-hydroperoxy derivative and then ALOXE3 metabolizes this intermediate to its 13R-hydroxy-9R,10R-epoxy product. The pathway functions to deliver very long chain fatty acids to the cornified lipid envelope of the skin surface.|$|E
25|$|MRPs {{can also}} contain other ingredients, such as {{creatine}} monohydrate, glutamine peptides, L-glutamine, calcium alpha-ketoglutarate, additional amino acids, lactoferrin, conjugated <b>linoleic</b> acid, and medium-chain triglycerides.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 73% of {{the energy}} in hemp seeds {{is in the form}} of fats and {{essential}} fatty acids, mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, <b>linoleic,</b> oleic and alpha-linolenic acids.|$|E
25|$|Essential {{fatty acids}} play {{a large role}} in healthy skin as well as nails. Splitting and flaking of nails may be {{due to a lack of}} <b>linoleic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|Walnut oil is {{composed}} mostly of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid and <b>linoleic</b> acid, although it also contains oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat and 31% of total fat is saturated fat.|$|E
25|$|Both crunchy/chunky {{and smooth}} peanut butter are sources of {{saturated}} (primarily palmitic acid, 21% of total fat) and monounsaturated fats, mainly oleic acid as 47% of total fat, and polyunsaturated fat (28% of total fat), primarily as <b>linoleic</b> acid).|$|E
25|$|Grape {{seed oil}} from crushed seeds {{is used in}} cosmeceuticals and skincare {{products}} for perceived health benefits. Grape seed oil contains tocopherols (vitamin E) and high contents of phytosterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as <b>linoleic</b> acid, oleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid.|$|E
25|$|The cypselas contain almost 7% {{oleic acid}} and 12½% <b>linoleic</b> acid, making the oil {{comparable}} to soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. Commercial use would {{be dependent on}} plant breeding to improve crop yield, suitability for harvesting and for food processing, such as selection of spineless plants.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the major fatty acid components, palmitic acid, oleic acid and <b>linoleic</b> acid, C.cristata contains two unusual fatty acids, cis-9, cis-14-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, and the conjugated cis-9, trans-11, trans-13, cis-15-octadecatetraenoic acid (commonly known as α-parinaric acid). C.cristata is the only fungi known to contain α-parinaric acid.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} fat taste receptors {{have been}} identified. G protein-coupled receptors GPR120 and GPR40 {{have been linked}} to fat taste, because their absence resulted in reduced preference to two types of fatty acid (<b>linoleic</b> acid and oleic acid), as well as decreased neuronal response to oral fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo meat is high {{in protein}} and low in fat (about 2%). Kangaroo meat has a high {{concentration}} of conjugated <b>linoleic</b> acid (CLA) compared with other foods, and is a rich source of vitamins and minerals. Low fat diets rich in CLA have been studied for their potential in reducing obesity and atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} found associations between early androgenic alopecia, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, with low HDL being the component of metabolic syndrome with highest association. Linolenic and <b>linoleic</b> acids, two major dietary sources of HDL, are 5 alpha reductase inhibitors. Premature androgenic alopecia and insulin resistance may be a clinical constellation that represents the male homologue, or phenotype, of polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|One {{benefit of}} Opuntia ficus-indica for {{human and animal}} {{consumption}} is its water content in an arid environment, containing about 85% water as an important source for wildlife. The seeds contain 3-10% of protein and 6-13% of fatty acids, mainly <b>linoleic</b> acid. As the fruit contains vitamin C (containing 25–30mg per 100g), it was once used to mitigate scurvy. There are high levels of selenium in Opuntia.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 review found {{evidence}} suggesting that consumption of milk is effective at promoting muscle growth. Some {{studies have suggested that}} conjugated <b>linoleic</b> acid, which can be found in dairy products, is an effective supplement for reducing body fat. With regards to the claim of milk promoting stronger bones, there has been no association between milk consumption or excess calcium intake and a reduced risk of bone fractures.|$|E
25|$|A type of {{trans fat}} occurs {{naturally}} {{in the milk}} and body fat of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep) {{at a level of}} 2–5% of total fat. Natural trans fats, which include conjugated <b>linoleic</b> acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate in the rumen of these animals. CLA has two double bonds, one in the cis configuration and one in trans, which makes it simultaneously a cis- and a trans-fatty acid.|$|E
25|$|Human 15-LOX-1 prefers <b>linoleic</b> acid over {{arachidonic acid}} as its primary substrate, oxygenating it at carbon 13 to form 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid (13-HpODE or 13(S)-HpODE) which may then be reduce to the {{corresponding}} hydroxy derivative, 13(S)-HODE or 13-HODE (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). In addition to 13(S)-HpODE, non-human 15-LOX1 orthologs such as mouse 12/15-LOX and soybean 15-LOX metabolize <b>linoleic</b> acid to 9-hydroperoxy-10E, 12Z-octadecaenoic acid (9-HpODE or 9(S)-HpODE), which is rapidly converted to 9(S)-HODE (9-HODE) (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid)). 13(S)-HODE acts through Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the TRPV1 and human GPR132 receptors to stimulate {{a variety of}} responses related to monocyte maturation, lipid metabolism, and neuron activation (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid##Activities of 13-HODEs; 9(S)-HODE is a marker for diseases involving oxidative stress and may contribute to this disease {{as well as to}} pain perception and atherosclerosis (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid##Biological and clinical relevancy of 9-HODEs). The two HODEs can be further metabolized to their ketones, 13-oxo-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid and 9-oxo-10E, 12Z-octadecaenoic acid; these ketones have been implicated as biomarkers for and possible contributors to the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Steatohepatitis, and other pathological conditions.|$|E
