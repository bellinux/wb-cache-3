5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female <b>literacy,</b> <b>education,</b> work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} a theoretical tradition which {{is concerned with}} how adult <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> might not always serve to socialise students into existing society, instead encouraging possibilities for desirable alternatives to it. Without this possibility, adult <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> might only {{be understood as a}} socialising machine that slots students into society as it stands and where the role of research is to describe its operation. My research describes a long-standing refusal by educators, researchers and students to accept this possibility and my thesis continues this tradition. Through the analysis and interplay of the work of Pierre Bourdieu, James Paul Gee, Paulo Freire, Jacques Rancière, I distinguish between empowerment and emancipation in the context of <b>literacies</b> <b>education.</b> I set out the assumptions that Bourdieu and Gee make, how they understand power, identity, discourse and oppression, and what this means for the practice of an empowering adult <b>literacies</b> <b>education.</b> I also present assumptions made by Freire and Rancière, how they understand equality and oppression, and how an emancipatory <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> might be understood and practiced. In particular, I describe how education for ‘empowerment’ encourages practices underpinned by the assumption that ideological processes prevent students from understanding how oppression is manifested. In contrast, I describe how an emancipatory education implies enacting educational relationships that are not reliant on this assumption, whilst exerting a social response to societal oppression. I make three claims. Firstly, that the idea of an emancipatory <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> has come to be neglected or conflated with the idea that <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> might empower, which has come to hold great sway. In so doing, I critique Freire’s work whilst reclaiming it as an emancipatory project. Secondly, that the educational practices associated with adult literacies for empowerment can be understood to encourage the socialisation of students into society as it stands. This emphasises the importance of distinguishing between empowerment and emancipation in the context of adult <b>literacies</b> <b>education.</b> Finally, that emancipation is a notion that must continue to be questioned and explored if educators, students and academics are {{to take responsibility for the}} practice of adult <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> and its consequences. An emancipatory <b>literacies</b> <b>education</b> cannot be reliant upon the assumption that discourse is inherently ideological. Instead, it is predicated upon teachers and students assuming that emancipation is possible and acting on that assumption...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the applicability of}} economic and contextual theories of <b>literacy</b> and <b>education</b> in Bangladesh. Economic theories assert that with <b>literacy</b> and <b>education</b> individuals can obtain employment and socioeconomic mobility and nations can experience development and progress. Contextual theories contend that the political, economic, and social contexts within which literacy and educational activities occur influence the power that <b>literacy</b> and <b>education</b> {{may or may not}} have within particular societies. This study describes the historical context of <b>literacy</b> and <b>education</b> in the region known today as Bangladesh. It then describes the language activities, oral and written, as well as the educational policies and systems in Bangladesh in modern times. The study highlights the textbooks and teacher 2 ̆ 7 s guides used to teach the Bengali language to primary school students in formal, government-run schools. It describes the content and exercises of the textbooks and offers illustrative summaries and examples of the instructions given to teachers in the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s guides. The study offers data showing that <b>literacy</b> and <b>education</b> have not necessarily led to employment for the Bangladeshi people or development for the Bangladeshi nation, thus denying economic theories of <b>literacy</b> and <b>education.</b> Instead, the historical, political, economic, and social contexts of Bangladesh have influenced the structure, ideologies, and methodologies of literacy and educational activities in Bangladesh, thus confirming contextual theories of <b>literacy</b> and <b>education.</b> In particular, the study shows the ways by which dominant social groups in Bangladesh have retained and manifested power through the curriculum used to teach the Bengali language to the nation 2 ̆ 7 s students attending formal, government schooling. The study concludes explaining that as the dominant groups 2 ̆ 7 ideas, attitudes, values, and behaviors form the ideology of school knowledge and procedures, school knowledge and procedures function to stratify students along socioeconomic class lines, privileging students from those dominant classes. ...|$|R
