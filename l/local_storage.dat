5|$|The first {{shipments}} {{took place}} in 1806 when Tudor transported an initial trial cargo of ice, probably harvested from his family estate at Rockwood, to the Caribbean island of Martinique. Sales were hampered, however, {{by the lack of}} <b>local</b> <b>storage</b> facilities, both for Tudor's stock and any ice bought by domestic customers, and as a result the ice stocks quickly melted away. Learning from this experience, Tudor then built a functioning ice depot in Havana and, despite the U.S. trade embargo declared in 1807, was trading successfully again by 1810. He was unable to acquire exclusive legal rights to import ice into Cuba, but was nonetheless able to maintain an effective monopoly through his control of the ice houses. The 1812 war briefly disrupted trade, but over subsequent years Tudor began to export fruit back from Havana to the mainland on the return journey, kept fresh with part of the unsold ice cargo. Trade to Charleston and to Savannah in Georgia followed, while Tudor's competitors began to supply South Carolina and Georgia by ship from New York or using barges sent downstream from Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} the {{imported}} ice varied according {{to the amount of}} economic competition; in Havana, Tudor's ice sold for 25 cents ($3.70 in 2010 terms) per pound, while in Georgia it reached only six to eight cents ($0.90–$1.20 in 2010 terms). Where Tudor had a strong market share, he would respond to competition from passing traders by lowering his prices considerably, selling his ice at the unprofitable rate of one cent ($0.20) per pound (0.5kg); at this price, competitors would typically be unable to sell their own stock at a profit: they would either be driven into debt or if they declined to sell, their ice would melt away in the heat. Tudor, relying on his <b>local</b> <b>storage</b> depots, could then increase his prices once again. By the middle of the 1820s, around 3,000 tons (3 million kg) of ice was being shipped from Boston annually, two thirds by Tudor.|$|E

40|$|Parallel {{decoding}} {{is required}} for low density parity check (LDPC) codes to achieve high decoding throughput, but it suffers from a large set of registers and complex interconnections due to randomly located 1 's in the sparse parity check matrix. This paper proposes a new LDPC decoding architecture to reduce registers and alleviate complex interconnections. To {{reduce the number of}} messages to be exchanged among processing units, two data flows that can be loosely coupled are developed by allowing duplicated operations. In addition, intermediate values are grouped and stored into <b>local</b> <b>storages</b> each of which is accessed by only one processing unit. In order to save area, <b>local</b> <b>storages</b> are implemented using memories instead of registers. To verify the proposed architecture, a 1024 bit rate- 1 / 2 LDPC decoder is implemented using a 0. 18 um CMOS process.

25|$|Windows {{specific}} compiler {{support is}} also needed for Structured Exception Handling (SEH).

The Microsoft/Borland C++ compilers {{had the ability to}} use this system {{as soon as it was}} introduced in Windows 95 and NT, however the actual implementation was undocumented and had to be reverse engineered for the Wine project and free compilers. SEH is based on pushing exception handler frames onto the stack, then adding them to a linked list stored in thread <b>local</b> <b>storage</b> (the first field of the thread environment block). When an exception is thrown, the kernel and base libraries unwind the stack running handlers and filters as they are encountered. Eventually, every exception unhandled by the application will be dealt with by the default backstop handler, which pops up the Windows common crash dialog.|$|E
500|$|Project E {{was used}} more widely {{to refer to}} similar {{arrangements}} for providing nuclear weapons the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). NATO began integrating tactical nuclear weapons into its war plans in 1954, and the BAOR adopted a doctrine under which {{they would be the}} dominant arm on the battlefield as NATO forces conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Rhine River. In 1954, the British Army purchased 113 Corporal missiles from the United States. It was intended that they would be equipped with British warheads under a project codenamed Violet Vision, but Project E offered a quicker, simpler and cheaper alternative. Weapons were made available under the same terms as those of the RAF: US custody and dual control. The 47th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery, was formed in 1957 and moved to Dortmund, Germany, in 1958.

2500|$|... “Distributed” or “grid” {{computing}} {{in general}} is a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a network (private, public or the Internet) by a conventional network interface producing commodity hardware, compared to the lower efficiency of designing and constructing {{a small number of}} custom supercomputers.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} a whole-system live migration scheme, which transfers {{the whole system}} run-time state, including CPU state, memory data, and <b>local</b> disk <b>storage,</b> of the virtual machine (VM). To minimize the downtime caused by migrating large disk storage data and keep data integrity and consistency, we propose a three-phase migration (TPM) algorithm. To facilitate the migration back to initial source machine, we use an incremental migration (IM) algorithm {{to reduce the amount}} of the data to be migrated. Block-bitmap is used to track all the write accesses to the <b>local</b> disk <b>storage</b> during the migration. Synchronization of the <b>local</b> disk <b>storage</b> in the migration is performed according to the block-bitmap. Experiments show that our algorithms work well even when I/Ointensive workloads are running in the migrated VM. The downtime of the migration is around 100 milliseconds, close to shared-storage migration. Total migration time is greatly reduced using IM. The block-bitmap based synchronization mechanism is simple and effective. Performance overhead of recording all the writes on migrated VM is very low. I...|$|R
