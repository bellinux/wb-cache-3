5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> occurred in the past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Sony Pictures {{released}} a remake/sequel for Adobe Flash titled Q*bert 2004, containing a faithful {{rendition of the}} original arcade game, along with 50 <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> use new board layouts and six new visual themes. Q*Bert Deluxe for iOS devices was initially {{released a}}s a rendition of the arcade game, but later received updates with the themes and stages from Q*Bert 2004.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rise}} of sea <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> {{occurred}} during the Pleistocene approximately 17,000years ago, the runoff of water from Lake Okeechobee slowed and created the vast marshland that {{is now known as}} the Everglades. Slower runoff also created an accumulation of almost 18 feet (5.5 m) of peat in the area. The presence of such peat deposits, dated to about 5,000years ago, is evidence that widespread flooding had occurred by then.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the eight Robot Masters, the player proceeds to Dr. Wily's fortress, {{which consists of}} six <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> are played linearly. As in the first title, the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily's fortress. However, these battles {{take place in a}} single room rather than a series of linearly connected rooms. The room contains teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master. The devices can be entered in any order, but are not labeled. Once the bosses are defeated again, the player must fight Dr. Wily.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists {{took to the streets}} to free political prisoners, without waiting for the government to do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all <b>levels,</b> <b>that</b> they would win. Portela would, a year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a Popular Front government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in June 1998, {{directly}} {{after the release of}} its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Banjo-Tooie features <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics. The game is also included in the Rare Replay video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015.|$|E

5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> might {{make it hard to}} understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E
5|$|Every {{character}} {{has been given}} their own unique ability. For example, Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high or distant places, Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex, and the Combaticons {{have the ability to}} combine into the Decepticon Bruticus. Segments in which players control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies. The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of <b>levels</b> <b>that</b> utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E
