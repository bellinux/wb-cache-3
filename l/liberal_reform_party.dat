Serving from 1884 for Tenterfield, he entered the Free Trade Party cabinet of George Reid in 1898 as Minister for Justice and briefly as Secretary for Public Works in 1899 until he returned to opposition in late 1899. Following Federation and the change of focus of the old party system in 1901, Lee was elected as the compromise leader of the new <b>Liberal</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> and consequently the first official Leader of the Opposition. After leading the party to electoral defeat in 1901, he resigned owing to ill health in 1902. When the Liberal Reformers won office under Sir Joseph Carruthers in 1904, he was made Secretary for Public Works. He served with distinction, overseeing the expansion of rural infrastructure, under Carruthers and his successor Charles Wade, until the government lost office to the Labor Party in 1910.

500|$|Baldorioty de Castro began {{promoting}} {{the restructuring of}} the social, political and educational establishments. These contributions led Fernando Norzagaray, the colony's incumbent governor to offer him the position of mayor {{of one of the}} island's municipalities (towns). Baldorioty de Castro declined the offer, based on his ideals. At the time, the government displayed no interest in promoting education among the Criollos of the island. Two years earlier, the governor had imposed the Reglamento del Jornalero, which promoted a more ample labor base by reducing the amount of unemployed citizens. However, this measure was criticized for its elements that were used to increase the wealth of employers. As a consequence, the merits of said law were reconsidered and a group led by Baldorioty de Castro was selected to decide its validity. In 1853, he {{became a member of the}} <b>Liberal</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5000|$|The {{question}} of tariff policy which, had created and divided the Free Trade Party and Protectionist Party in New South Wales in the 1890s, became a federal {{issue at the}} time of federation.

The Progressive Party's vote collapsed at the 1904 election and many of its members then joined the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party.</b> By 1907, the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> was left as the main centre-right party in New South Wales.|$|E
