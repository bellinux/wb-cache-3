5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist. His satirical works, {{inspired}} by {{the philosophy of the}} Age of Enlightenment, were critical of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, the corruption of its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E

The number of people with a complete <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> or ones who received a partial education is lower in Skopje at 9% compared to the provincial average of 17%. 80% of Macedonian citizens who hold a PhD take up residence in Skopje.|$|E
5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although {{it is widely believed}} that its use establishes of <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> or social standing in the speaker.|$|E

He was passed over for a commission due to his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> but was promoted to corporal on 30 April and lance sergeant on 8 May. The 24thInfantry Battalion landed at Gallipoli on 5 September 1915 and took over part of the line at Lone Pine. Savige became company sergeant major on 20 September. There, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 November 1915.

5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E
5|$|Educated at {{home until}} she was seven, Bishop then went to a private {{elementary}} school {{until the age of}} nine. In 1909, then ten years old, she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls. Though Bishop intended to study chemistry, her <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany, chemistry, and zoology. That first-year course in zoology sparked her lifelong interest in and commitment to the field. She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology, receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921; she received her master's degree in 1922. During her undergraduate years, under the tutelage of the helminthologist R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{once was}} {{credited}} with creating 300 new vicarages within the diocese, largely {{on the basis of}} his surviving documents dealing with this, known as the Liber Antiquus. Further research has shown that a number of the vicarages he was once assumed to have founded were instead earlier foundations that Hugh either augmented or reassessed. Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese, attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese had enough to live on. Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste.|$|E
5|$|Lisa hates {{her role}} as a homemaker, and realizing that her future dreams have been shattered, she loses {{interest}} in being a good student. Bart enjoys spending time with the police, and he even ends up stopping Snake during a car chase. When Principal Skinner discovers Bart's new interest in law enforcement, he enlists him as a hall monitor. Bart starts handing out demerits to his classmates for minor infractions and has order restored to the school. When Lisa secretly steals all of the Teachers' Editions of the schoolbooks and reveals the teachers' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> it is up to Bart to figure out who stole the books. Realizing his sister is the culprit, Bart takes the blame and returns to his life as a bad student and detention regular, while Lisa goes back to being a good student. As Bart spents his time in detention, Lisa plays her saxophone outside his classroom to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly {{accused him of being}} involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E

5|$|With no {{counterpart}} to the south, the Kansas Turnpike ended {{at the state}} line, at an at-grade intersection with E0010 Road. Just across the state line was an oat field, into which many inattentive motorists crashed. This abrupt end became nationally famous after Wyoming governor Milward L. Simpson and his wife crashed in mid-1957. The oat farmer plowed the field to provide a safer landing, and the KTA was persuaded to install a huge wooden barrier {{at the end of}} the highway. However, within a day, three more drivers had crashed and destroyed the barrier, so the KTA closed the turnpike south of the South Haven interchange. KTA provided the state of Oklahoma with financial aid to construct its portion of a temporary road leading to the interchange. The lack of continuity in the highway was one of the primary reasons that the road did not generate much revenue in the years following the opening; another reason was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> on the part of motorists as to the concept of a toll road.|$|E

25|$|On a {{national}} level, economic development is severely hindered by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> of trafficked children; {{this results in}} a major loss of potentially productive future workers. Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work. There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities. Furthermore, the persistence of child trafficking indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence. As a result, UN.GIFT has cited child trafficking as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.|$|E
