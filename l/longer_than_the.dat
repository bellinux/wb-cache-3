5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British breeds, and 65 to 70 days <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other continental European breeds). When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British breeds, and 170 to 220 days <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other continental European breeds).|$|E
5|$|The abdomen has six segments, {{the first}} five of which bear pleopods, {{although}} these may be absent or vestigial in females. The fourth pleopod is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> others in males and has a specialized reproductory function.|$|E
5|$|The hindfeet {{are long}} and have the three central digits <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the hindfeet are {{surrounded}} by ungual tufts of silvery hair that are <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|E

5|$|The ride is {{considered}} to be a terrain roller coaster, meaning the ride experiences various elevation changes. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first. It drops through Thunderbolt's structure, which is located at the bottom of a hill in a ravine.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} nerves {{supplying}} the larynx, {{the right and}} left RLNs lack bilateral symmetry. The left RLN is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> right, because it crosses under the arch of the aorta at the ligamentum arteriosum.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> actual time spent at depth).|$|E

5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> preceding {{one has been}} noted. Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route was slightly <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Sublette, but {{had the advantage of}} only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E

5|$|In {{the long}} term, Pluto's orbit is chaotic. Computer {{simulations}} {{can be used}} to predict its position for several million years (both forward and backward in time), but after intervals <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Lyapunov time of 10–20 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Raetia {{maintained}} its Roman traditions <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest of Switzerland, {{but most of}} it was eventually assimilated as well, leaving only a small territory where a Vulgar Latin dialect, Romansh, is spoken to this day. The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, {{and the beginning of the}} transition to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have {{shortened}} fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fore wings. In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight.|$|E

5|$|The DVD was {{released}} in 2003 and contains many extra features, such as extensive interviews with DuBowski and Rabbi Steven Greenberg. There is also a mini-documentary about reactions to the film {{around the world and}} what happened to the people who were featured in the documentary. The total running time for the special features is actually over 2 hours <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> documentary itself.|$|E
5|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{approximately}} 27.3 days, {{relative to a}} fixed frame of reference. This {{is known as the}} sidereal month. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.|$|E
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
