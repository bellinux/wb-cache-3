The Belgian Army used the fort to store munitions. In May 1940 the fort was bombed by Stukas that had mistaken Hollogne for the active Fort de Flémalle. During the second occupation the fort was proposed as a <b>launching</b> <b>site</b> for V-2 rockets. After the area was liberated in 1944 it was used by American forces as a hospital. Following the conclusion of the war it became a depot for Belgian forces, then became a Belgian Air Force command post until 1992.

500|$|Due to {{the extreme}} tidal range in the Bristol Channel, finding a {{suitable}} <b>launching</b> <b>site</b> for lifeboats proved an arduous task for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). Davits were installed on the pier in 1882, enabling a lifeboat to be lowered into the water below, even at low tide. A new, larger lifeboat was stationed here in 1889 and a boathouse was built for it on the north-east {{side of the island}} with a [...] slipway beside the pier. This facility was replaced in 1902 when a new boathouse was built on the south-east side of the island. This had a [...] slipway which enabled the lifeboat to be launched at most states of the tide and was the longest in England. The slipway was closed in 2007 due to its poor condition, since when the lifeboats have been launched from the north-east side of the island. The crews continued to use the 1889 boathouse but the two inshore lifeboats were kept on their launch trolleys in the open air on Birnbeck Island. In April 2011 a new [...] "temporary" [...] boathouse was erected to give them cover. The structure cost £70,000 but has been designed {{so that it can be}} dismantled once permanent facilities are built and transported to be reused elsewhere. In 2015 the RNLI announced that it would seek planning permission for a permanent lifeboat station at Knightstone Harbour along with deep-water anchorage at Anchor Head and the facilities on Birnbeck Pier were closed.|$|E

The fighting, which lasted eight days and resulted {{in the deaths of}} 52 Palestinians (including 14 civilians, according to the IDF, and 22 civilians, according to HRW) and 23 Israeli soldiers, has been interpreted quite differently by Israelis and Palestinians. In the aftermath of the fighting, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat claimed that the IDF had killed 500 Palestinians and accused Israel of committing a [...] "massacre". Early news publications, following both IDF estimates of 200 Palestinians killed and Palestinian estimates of 500 Palestinians killed, reported hundreds of Palestinian deaths and repeated claims that a massacre had taken place. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International later found that no massacre had taken place, although both organizations charged the IDF with war crimes and human rights violations. The United Nations similarly dismissed claims that hundreds of Palestinians had been killed as unsubstantiated, a finding which was widely interpreted and reported as rejecting claims of a [...] "massacre".|$|E
