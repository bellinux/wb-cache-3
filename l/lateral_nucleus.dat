25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things. An increase in blood flow to this area has been shown when people look at scary faces, or remember traumatic events. Research has also shown that the <b>lateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the amygdala is a crucial site of neural changes that occur during fear conditioning.|$|E
2500|$|The nuclei {{corresponding}} to the lemniscal territory are called VP. The tactile part nucleus ventralis posterior caudalis VPC is the posterior part of the lateral region, {{in front of the}} pulvinar. It is the addition of a <b>lateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> VPL and of the superior part of the classic arcuate nucleus VPM. VPC receives axons from the dorsal column nuclei located in the lower medulla oblongata: the nucleus gracilis (Goll) medial and the nucleus cuneatus (Burdach) lateral. Starting from these nuclei, axons go ventralwards and decussate (to the other side) still in the medulla oblongata forming the [...] "lemniscal decussation". Axons from the two sides form the thick medial lemniscus close to the midline. Higher, it separates in order to reach the lower border of the two VPC. In this nucleus, the axons terminate forming lamellae and a somatotopic map. The axons conveying information from the leg are the most lateral and the most dorsal. Those conveying information from the mouth and tongue are the most medial and ventral (in VPM). The axonal arborisations are rather small and very dense. The mediator of the lemniscus system is glutamate. The thalamocortical axons of the VPC send their axons to the primary somatosensory area (areas 3b and 1) where there is also a clear somatotopic map.|$|E
5000|$|The ventral <b>lateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> in the {{thalamus}} {{forms the}} motor functional {{division in the}} thalamic nuclei along with the ventral anterior nucleus.

50|$|In rodents, the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> {{contains}} the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> (dLGN), the ventral <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> (vLGN), {{and the region}} in between called the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to study the}} comparative anatomy of the parageniculate nucleus in carnivores. In Felidae it is closely applied to the lateral margins of the posterior <b>lateral</b> and suprageniculate <b>nuclei,</b> and is composed of small, deeply stained and fusiform cells. Caudally it lies just lateral to the ventrolateral part of the <b>lateral</b> pulvinar <b>nucleus</b> and to the suprageniculate nucleus. As the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> appears, the parageniculate nucleus extends ventrally between the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> and the suprageniculate nucleus or the inferior pulvinar nucleus. In the other carnivores examined, the parageniculate nucleus tends to be confined to the lateral margins of the lateral pulvinar and suprageniculate nuclei. At the most anterior levels of the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus,</b> the parageniculate nucleus extends ventrolaterally to reach the region just dorsomedial to the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus,</b> but does not extend between the geniculate nucleus and the dorsal thalamus proper. The parageniculate nucleus {{is regarded as a}} connecting cell group between the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> and the dorsal thalamus proper, and may be a dorsal thalamic derivative...|$|R

5000|$|Researchers {{observed}} that [...] "The ventral <b>lateral</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{has long been}} established as an effective surgical target for controlling distal limb tremor, including Parkinson Disease tremor. However, because it receives predominantly cerebellar afferents and no direct basal ganglia afferents, the reason why it is effective in controlling Parkinson Disease tremor has remained a paradox.

40|$|In mammals, the retinogeniculocortical pathway is the pri-mary afferent {{route to}} visual cortex. The flow of {{information}} along this pathway can be modulated at the thalamic level (i. e., at the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus)</b> {{as a function of}} arousal, attention, and phenomena such as eye movements. Phys-iological studies indicate that an important source of this state-dependent influence on geniculate neuronal respon-siveness is the parabrachial region of the brain stem. We used the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglu-tinin to study the anatomical connections between the parabrachial region and the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus.</b> La-beled parabrachial axons are found throughout the thala-mus, including all laminae of the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus,</b> the <b>lateral</b> posterior-pulvinar complex, the ventral <b>lateral</b> ge-niculate <b>nucleus,</b> the perigeniculate nucleus, and the retic...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} dark rearing immediately after birth on the maturation of the visual relay neurons in the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus.</b> Methods: Fifty neonatal rats were used. Neonates of the control groups were raised under a normal light/dark cycle. Neonates of the experiment groups were dark reared and isolated from light during the entire experimental period, then exposed to the sun light for 1 hour before sacrifice. Results: In the control groups, the neurons in the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> developed normally at each age tested. In the experiment groups, the cytoplasm of the large neurons in the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> of 2 -week-old rats contained small vesicles, and the cytoplasm of the large neurons of 4 -week-old rats was converted into a vacuole-like space. Moreover, c-Fos immunoreactivity of the large neurons in the dorsal <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> in the experiment groups was significantly increased {{compared to that of}} the control groups. Conclusions: We suppose that the maturation of the neurons in the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> might be influenced by light stimulation during the critical period. Furthermore, c-Fos could be a marker of the functional activity of the visual relay neurons of the <b>lateral</b> geniculate <b>nucleus</b> in albino rats...|$|R

Besides the well known mossy fibre {{connections to the}} cerebellar cortex and collaterals to the cerebellar nuclei, a substantial bilateral projection to the <b>lateral</b> vestibular <b>nucleus</b> was found. Terminal arborizations found within this nucleus appeared to detach from the reticulocerebellar fibres in the cerebellar white matter and enter the <b>lateral</b> vestibular <b>nucleus</b> from dorsally.
