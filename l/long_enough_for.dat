5|$|The {{plan for}} the battle was {{straightforward}} for both sides. The Russians wanted {{to break through the}} Polish defences to Warsaw, while the Polish aim was to defend the area <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a two-pronged counteroffensive from the south, led by General Józef Piłsudski, and north, led by General Władysław Sikorski, to outflank the attacking forces.|$|E

5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E
5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering {{from a lack of}} infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of {{defenders}} was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle.|$|E

5|$|Polish forces, {{numbering}} 5,500–7,300, faced Russian forces numbering {{over half}} of the 46th Corps of 26,000. The Polish forces were eventually forced to retreat, but delayed the Russians <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the other Austro-Hungarian units in the area to retreat in an organized manner.

5|$|Titanics down angle altered fairly rapidly {{from zero}} degrees to about {{four and a}} half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but {{the rate at which the}} ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, {{worsening}} only to about five degrees. This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E
5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> acceptance testing.|$|E
