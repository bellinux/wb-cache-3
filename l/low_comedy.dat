500|$|The Moving Picture World {{reviewed}} {{the film as}} being a <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> that featured [...] "somewhat disgusting" [...] dental humor with the extraction of teeth with pincers and ice tongs. A more direct review {{in response to the}} film's comedic antics came from {{a letter to the editor}} of The Motion Picture Story Magazine which appealed the vulgar antics in the film as going to alienate members the audience and risk their continued patronage. The film had a wide national release that was shown in theaters throughout the United States. Locations included Chicago, Illinois, Atlanta, Georgia, Oklahoma, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Oregon, [...] Wisconsin, and Kansas.|$|E
500|$|The Cheese Special is a 1913 American silent short comedy film {{featuring}} Max Asher and {{marking the}} film debut of Louise Fazenda. The scenario {{was written by}} Allen Curtis, but {{the identity of the}} director is unknown. It was the first production released by the newly formed Joker productions, as part of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. The film is presumed to be lost and there is no published [...] synopsis of the film. Known production details state that it was shot on a beach resort and used a miniature train. The film had a wide release and was reviewed by The Moving Picture World as a <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> suited for the burlesque theaters.|$|E
500|$|Leno also {{appeared}} in burlesque and, every year from 1888 to 1904, in the Drury Lane Theatre's Christmas pantomime spectacles. [...] He was generous and active in charitable causes, especially to benefit performers in need. [...] Leno continued to appear in musical comedies and his own music hall routines until 1902, although he suffered increasingly from alcoholism. This, together with his long association with dame and <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> roles, prevented him from being taken seriously as a dramatic actor, and he was turned down for Shakespearean roles. Leno began to behave in an erratic and furious manner by 1902, and he suffered a mental breakdown in early 1903. He was committed to a mental asylum, but was discharged later that year. After one more show, his health declined, and he died aged 43.|$|E
60|$|That is true. Nearly {{every time}} the {{audience}} roared I knew it was over {{something that would be}} condemned in the morning (justly, too) but must be left in--for <b>low</b> <b>comedies</b> are written for the drawing-room, the kitchen and the stable, and if you cut out the kitchen and the stable the drawing-room can't support the play by itself.|$|R
50|$|Between 1987 and 2015, Hungary {{performed}} {{as many as}} 76 of his dramas, {{many of which were}} played many times. These include dramas, tragicomedy, fairy tale plays, scripts of musicals, <b>comedies,</b> and <b>low</b> <b>comedies.</b> One of his best musicals is titled the Monte Cristo grófja (The Count of Monte Cristo) the music and lyrics of which were written by György Szomor.|$|R

500|$|The new Joker {{line was}} billed {{as one of the}} [...] "best comedies yet" [...] by {{advertisers}} wanting to draw crowds to the theaters, but there may have been truth in the claims because it was cited as one of Max Asher's best roles in a 1914 edition of Moving Picture World. The film had a wide release with showings in Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, and in Chicago, Illinois. The Moving Picture World review of the film noted that it was a <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> suitable for the burlesque houses with [...] "less particular audiences" [...] than finer establishments because one of the minor characters spat frequently on camera, interrupting the humor and thus making it unfit for the best theaters. Another newspaper review claimed {{that it was one of}} the best comedies released in months, but ended up referring to the film as [...] "The Chinese Special". The date of disappearance is unknown, but Universal destroyed its remaining copies of silent era films in 1948. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} accent used by {{actors and}} announcers was [...] "Southern English", an upper class British version that emulated the BBC. The actual Australian accent was acceptable only in <b>low</b> <b>comedy,</b> {{as in the}} long-running [...] "Dad and Dave from Snake Gully" [...] program.|$|E
2500|$|The Aldwych farces were {{a series}} of twelve stage farces {{presented}} at the Aldwych Theatre, London, nearly continuously from 1923 to 1933. All but {{three of them were}} written by Ben Travers. They incorporate and develop British <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> styles, combined with clever word-play. The plays were presented by the actor-manager Tom Walls and starred Walls and Ralph Lynn, supported by a regular company that included Robertson Hare, Mary Brough, Winifred Shotter, Ethel Coleridge and Gordon James.|$|E

50|$|Le Hay {{then left}} the D'Oyly Carte {{organisation}} and played in pantomime, in <b>low</b> <b>comedies</b> with Cooper Cole's Strand Company, and for several years with Edward Terry. In 1886, he created the part of Tom Strutt in Alfred Cellier's Dorothy at the Gaiety Theatre {{and the role of}} Crook in Cellier's Doris (1889). He then played Private Smith in The Red Hussar (1889), Jacob in The Red Rover (1890), Prince Bulbo in The Rose and the Ring (1890), and Sir Guy of Gisborne in Maid Marian (1891).|$|R
50|$|In November 1927, Alvaro Moreyra {{founded the}} Toy Theatre (Teatro de Brinquedo). Like this company, {{it was in}} the late 1920s when the first stable theatre {{companies}} formed around well-known actors. These actors were able to practice authentic Brazilian gestures gradually freed from Portuguese influence. Except for some political criticism in the <b>low</b> <b>comedies,</b> the dramas of this period were not popular. Occasionally the question of dependence on Europe or North America was raised. Even with more Latin American influence of theatre starting to filter in, its theatre still was under heavy influence of Europe.|$|R
2500|$|In the Vienna {{production}} of the opera, Zerlina follows Leporello and recaptures him. Threatening him with a razor, she ties him to a stool. He attempts to sweet-talk her out of hurting him. (Duet: [...] "Per queste tue manine" [...] – [...] "For these hands of yours"). Zerlina goes to find Masetto and the others; Leporello escapes again before she returns. This scene, marked by <b>low</b> <b>comedy,</b> is rarely performed today. Also in the Vienna production, Donna Elvira is still furious at Don Giovanni for betraying her, but she also feels sorry for him. ("Mi tradì quell'alma ingrata" [...] – [...] "That ungrateful wretch betrayed me").|$|E
2500|$|In {{the age of}} television, a new {{genre of}} chimp act emerged in the United States: series whose cast {{consisted}} entirely of chimpanzees dressed as humans and [...] "speaking" [...] lines dubbed by human actors. These shows, examples of which include Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp in the 1970s or The Chimp Channel in the 1990s, relied on the novelty of their ape cast to make their timeworn, <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> gags funny. Their chimpanzee [...] "actors" [...] were as interchangeable as the apes in a circus act, being amusing as chimpanzees and not as individuals. Animal rights groups have urged a stop to this practice, considering it animal abuse.|$|E
2500|$|The Aldwych farces also {{featured}} a regular team of supporting actors: Robertson Hare {{as a figure}} of put-upon respectability; Mary Brough in eccentric old lady roles; Ethel Coleridge as the severe voice of authority; the saturnine Gordon James as the [...] "heavy"; and first Yvonne Arnaud, then Winifred Shotter, as the sprightly young female lead. The plays generally revolved around a series of preposterous incidents involving a misunderstanding, borrowed clothes and lost trousers, involving the worldly Walls character, the innocent yet cheeky Lynn, the hapless Hare, the beefy, domineering Brough, the lean, domineering Coleridge and the pretty and slightly spicy Shotter, all played with earnest seriousness. The scripts incorporated and developed British <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> styles, particularly [...] "silly-asses, henpecked husbands, battleaxe mothers-in-law and lots of innocent misunderstandings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though a Court {{returned}} to Lisbon in 1640, it preferred, for {{one hundred and}} fifty years, Italian opera and French plays to vernacular representations. Early in the eighteenth century several authors sprung from the people vainly attempted to found a national drama. Their pieces mostly belong to <b>low</b> <b>comedy.</b> The [...] "Operas Portuguezas" [...] of António José da Silva, produced between 1733 and 1741, have a real comic strength and a certain originality, and, like those of Nicolau Luiz, exploit with wit the faults and foibles of the age. The latter divided his attention between heroic comedies and comedies de capa y espada and, though wanting in ideas and taste, they enjoyed a long popularity. At the same time the Arcadia endeavoured to raise the standard of the stage, drawing inspiration from the contemporary French drama, but its members lacked dramatic talent and achieved little. Garção wrote two bright comedies, Quita some stillborn tragedies, and Manuel de Figueredo compiled plays in prose and verse on national subjects, which fill thirteen volumes, but he could not create characters.|$|E
2500|$|The broad comedic stylings of the {{minstrel}} shows {{helped develop}} the vaudeville shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s. With this shift, the [...] "wench players" [...] became [...] "prima donnas", and became more elegant and refined, while still retaining their comedic elements. [...] While the [...] "wenches" [...] were purely American creations, the [...] "prima donnas" [...] were inspired by both America and European cross-dressing shows, like Shakespearean actors and castrati. With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, Great Migration of African Americans, and an influx of immigrants, vaudeville's broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy. With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well. [...] Many female impersonators started with <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna. Famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge found success in this and eventually {{made his way to}} the broadway stage performing as a woman. [...] At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished. Connection with sex work and homosexuality eventually lead to the decline of vaudeville during the Progressive Era. Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was {{enthusiastic about}} the episode, stating that the episode's jokes and humor were solid throughout. He was pleased {{that the relationship between}} Leela and Fry was [...] "finally" [...] addressed, also feeling that up until this episode, [...] "he writing on Leela hasn't been as solid this season". Praising the episode's full use of science fiction and the smart structure of the episode, concluding: [...] "It feels like we're back in the sweet spot here, mixing high and <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> with sharp ideas, and a surprisingly uncynical sincerity. Everything old is new again, I guess, and that's a very good thing." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, citing it as another example of Futurama's [...] "smart takes" [...] on time travel. He felt that [...] "it showed that there's still a lot of thought going into plotting out these time trips", although he also stated that the episode did not have enough laughs. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama at its finest. If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality." [...] He concluded that [...] "his combined with last week's episode has restored my full confidence in the production team". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done. Nearly every episode of this season has been better than the last, and it looks like it's finally reached the peaks it's hit in the past. As of now, I think any doubt about the Futurama's reboot should be pretty damn well silenced." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most notably, Hirschfeld {{testified that}} [...] "homosexuality {{was part of}} the plan of nature and {{creation}} just like normal love." [...] Hirschfeld's testimony caused outrage all over Germany. The Die Vossische Zeitung newspaper condemned Hirschfeld in an editorial as [...] "a freak who acted for freaks in the name of pseudoscience". The Die Mūnchener Neuesten Nachrichten newspaper declared in an editorial: [...] "Dr. Hirschfeld makes public propaganda under the cover of science which does nothing but poison our people. Real science should fight against this!". A notable witness at the trial was Lilly von Elbe, the former wife of Moltke who testified that her husband had only made love to her twice in their entire marriage. Elbe spoke with remarkable openness for the period of her sexual desires and her frustration with a husband who was only interested in having sex with Eulenburg. Elbe's testimony was marked by moments of <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> when it emerged that she had taken to attacking Moltke with a frying pan in vain attempts to make him have sex with her. The fact that General von Moltke was unable to defend himself from his wife's attacks was taken as proof that he was deficient in his masculinity, which many saw as confirming his homosexuality. At the time, the subject of female sexuality was taboo, and Elbe's testimony was very controversial, with many saying that Elbe must in some way be mentally ill because of her willingness to acknowledge her sexuality. At the time, it was generally believed that women should not have any sort of sexuality, and the idealized woman was seen as a [...] "chaste" [...] and [...] "pure" [...] in her asexuality. Letters to the newspapers at the time from both men and women overwhelmingly condemned Elbe for her [...] "disgusting" [...] testimony concerning her sexuality. As an expert witness, Hirschfeld also testified that female sexuality was natural, and Elbe was just a normal woman who was in no way mentally ill. After the jury ruled in favor of Harden, Judge Hugo Isenbiel was enraged by the jury's decision, which he saw as expressing approval for Hirschfeld. He overturned the verdict under the grounds that homosexuals [...] "have the morals of dogs" [...] and insisted that this verdict could not be allowed to stand.|$|E

6000|$|... is an {{excellent}} example of <b>low</b> <b>comedy</b> in poetry. One of the best poems in the book is The Ballad of Three Kingdoms.

[...] The date is not earlier than that of Ben's satiric play on the poets, The Poetaster (1601), to which reference is made. Since Kempe is to be represented as wholly ignorant, his opinion of Shakespeare's pre-eminent merit only proves, {{as in the case of}} Gullio, that the University wits decried the excellences of Shakespeare.
