Academic {{discourse}} on trust is fractured along disciplinary <b>lines.</b> <b>Security</b> theorists routinely use {{a definition of}} trust which, apparently, has {{little in common with}} any of the definitions of trust that appear in the sociological and psychological literature. In this essay, we extend a recently-proposed framework for the technical analysis of secure systems, so that its notion of trust is roughly congruent with the sociological theories of Parsons, Luhmann, Barber, Lewis and Weigert. This congruent extension suggests some ways in which a computerised system might, appropriately, inspire trust in its non-technical users. Key words: Trust, security analysis, trust management...|$|R

These in-dices can be obtained with slight modification from the power system loadability limit calculation, which is normally limited by a static voltage stability con-straint. A repetitive power flow is employed with-out loss of generality. Sensitivity factors of apparent power flow at the receiving end bus are adopted to predict power flow direction of each transmission line corresponding to a specified scenario of generation and demand in-creased. The proposed performance indices provide information regarding severe trans-mission paths that need for expansion or upgrading. A six-bus system is used to test with satisfactory re-sults...|$|E
