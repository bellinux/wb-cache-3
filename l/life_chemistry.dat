40|$|ABSTRACTAll {{events in}} the world are caused by {{chemical}} events and reactions. One of the most important aims of <b>life</b> <b>chemistry</b> is bringing up individuals who have sensitivity towards the environment and environmental awareness; could apply their learnt knowledge to daily issues and problems; have the ability to comment and adopt their knowledge into different situations. In order to achieve these aims, it is of great importance to train students of all levels and create awareness in the society. Therefore, <b>life</b> <b>chemistry</b> has been emphasized together with what could be done about it and how it could be integrated into the curriculum including which applications should be done at which level. This study aimed to investigate the effect of distance education and technology assisted cooperative learning projects on students’ achievement and attitude in “Chemistry events and concepts in our life”. In the light of this aim, student achievement scores as outcomes of student cooperative learning projects were evaluated together with technology attitude scale...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Self-assembly is a {{fundamental}} process by which supramolecular species form spon-taneously from their components. This process is ubiquitous throughout the <b>life</b> <b>chemistry</b> and is central to biological information processing. Algorithms for solving many mathematical and com-putational problems via tile self assembly has been proposed by many researchers in the last decade. In particular tile set for doing basic arithmetic of two inputs have been given. In this work we give tile set for doing basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication) of n inputs and subsequently computing its modulo. We also present a tile set for primality testing. Finally we present a software ’xtilemod ’ for doing modular arithmetic. This simplifies the task of creating the input files to xgrow simulator for doing basic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) as well as modular arithmetic of n inputs. Similar software for creating tile set for primality testing is also given...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCooperative {{effects are}} {{fundamental}} for electroprotonic energy transduction processes, crucial to sustain much of <b>life</b> <b>chemistry.</b> However, the primary cooperative {{mechanism by which}} transmembrane proteins couple the downhill transfer of electrons to the uphill activation (acidification) of protic groups is still a matter of great controversy. To understand cooperative processes fully, {{it is necessary to}} obtain the microscopic thermodynamic parameters of the functional centres and relate them to the relevant structural features, a task difficult to achieve for large proteins. The approach discussed here explores how this may be done by extrapolation from mechanisms used by simpler proteins operative in similar processes. The detailed study of small, soluble cytochromes performing electroprotonic activation has shown how they use anti-electrostatic effects to control the synchronous movement of charges. These include negative e−/H+ (redox-Bohr effect) cooperativities. This capacity is the basis to discuss an unorthodox mechanism consistent with the available experimental data on the process of electroprotonic energy transduction performed by cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) ...|$|E
