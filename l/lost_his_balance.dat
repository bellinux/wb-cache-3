5|$|On 2 February 2005, Hardee's {{body was}} {{recovered}} from Greenland Dock, {{after he was}} reported missing from The Wibbley Wobbley on 31 January; he had been last seen late-night on 30 January. A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying {{to make his way}} home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen yards away across Greenland Dock, Hardee had <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance</b> and drowned while drunk. But the Coroner found that, whilst attempting to access The Sea Sovereign from the quayside, Hardee had fallen into the dock while drunk.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance</b> {{and fell to the}} ice, {{crashing}} into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance</b> while preparing to take a shot. After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E

When the police are {{notified}} of the death they arrest Ronnie, but later release her without charge. DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) investigates the rest of the Mitchell family. Phil is given a false alibi by his friend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who finds a blood-stained shirt amongst his belongings. Phil explains that he found Archie dead and <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance,</b> falling into the blood, but did not call the police because he panicked. They burn the shirt, and when Marsden visits them again, asking to see the clothes Phil was wearing at Christmas, Shirley produces a freshly laundered one. Shirley's flatmate Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) reveals that Phil was not really with Shirley on Christmas Day, prompting Shirley to make an anonymous call stating she saw Janine enter The Queen Victoria {{on the day of the}} murder, deflecting suspicion from Phil. Peggy and Phil attempt to pin the murder on Sam, who retaliates by blaming Peggy. Both are questioned by Marsden at the police station, and though Peggy is released without charge, Sam is arrested for breaking her bail.|$|E

25|$|Firefighters were {{immediately}} alerted {{due to a}} natural gas explosion and fire in a Scottsdale house. It ripped through the home in the 2000 block of North 74th Place at 8:42am. It appeared to be centered in the living room, and the subsequent fire burned the house to rubble. The initial explosion {{was strong enough to}} collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for a half-mile (800 m) in all directions. Firefighters kept the -high blaze from spreading to neighboring houses. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance</b> and fell near the burning house.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{year after}} he lost most of his finger, his father died. Vacationing with his family near Arcata in Northern California in 1947, Garcia's father went fly fishing in the Trinity River, part of the Six Rivers National Forest. Not long after {{entering}} the river, Garcia's father slipped on a rock, <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance</b> and was swept away by the river's rapids. He drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw his father fall into the river, Dennis McNally, author of the book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote Garcia: An American Life, lends weight to McNally's claim. Jackson's evidence: a local newspaper article describing Jose's death failed to mention Garcia was present when his father died.|$|E
25|$|Against Bradman's Invincibles in 1948, Compton was England's {{standout}} {{performer in}} a losing cause. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he scored 184 {{in the second}} innings after Australia had established a first innings lead of 344, and {{it looked as though}} he might save the match for England until he <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> <b>balance</b> to a short-pitched ball from Miller and hit his wicket. In the Third Test at Old Trafford, Compton scored an unbeaten 145 in the first innings, when no other batsman made more than 37. He had scored only four runs when, while facing a bumper barrage from Ray Lindwall, he edged the ball onto his forehead. Compton was forced off the ground with a cut head, given two stitches, and ordered to rest despite wanting to return to the crease. He eventually came back out when England was teetering at 119 for 5 and enabled the team to reach 363. This was the only match that England did not lose, and if so much time had not been lost to the weather they might have won it. In the series he made 562 runs at 62.44, against fierce fast bowling from Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston.|$|E

He remained in a mental health facility for 14 years in Amritsar. The causes of his loss of mental balance are not known, but it is possibly due to his act of apprehending Nathuram Godse. Godse was the person who killed Mohandas Gandhi. The next person on Godse's list of people to be eliminated was possibly Jinnah (another person supporting the creation of Pakistan),He received a monthly pension from the Indian government until he died in May 1987.|$|R

Cornette tried to distract Piper, but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt. Bret maintained the advantage for a little while, but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex.

2500|$|Being out hit-wicket {{is often}} seen as a comic method of dismissal.

500|$|Vettel set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} final session which {{clinched}} him the sixth pole position of his season (and his third consecutive) with a lap of 1:13.791 which was recorded on his final timed lap. Although {{he was happy to}} start on the pole he said his lap was not [...] "100% perfect" [...] as he drove off the circuit after he pushed hard. Vettel was joined on the grid's front row by Alonso who recorded a lap 0.002 seconds off Vettel's pace. Alonso had recorded the fastest times in the first and second sessions and was happy to start on the grid's front row. Massa took third despite running wide on his final timed lap but was optimistic on a track where he felt comfortable. Webber, fourth, ran wide at the Nordkurve right-hand corner on his final lap when he turned in late and cut the kerb which cost him three seconds and he opted to abandon his lap. The two McLaren cars lined up on the grid's third row (with Button ahead of Hamilton). Button was happy with his lap whilst Hamilton said his qualifying pace was poor despite the McLaren drivers recording the fastest speeds on the circuit's main straight. Kubica qualified seventh and felt he could have set a faster lap time as he was held up in the track's final sector. He also believed that he would not have qualified in a higher position had he not been held up. Barrichello experienced understeer in the final session and <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> car's <b>balance</b> which restricted him to eighth position. Rosberg and Hülkenberg rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|R

60|$|At length {{they came}} to a bridge, covered with planks, which led across a small stream. It was in rather a solitary place, with woods {{on each side of the}} road. Beyond the bridge there was a level piece of road for a short distance, and then a gentle ascent, with a {{farmhouse}} near the top of it, on the right hand side of the road. At the end of the bridge, between the planks and the ground beyond them, there was a jolt, caused by the rotting away of a log which had been imbedded in the ground at the beginning of the planking. As it was rather dark, on account of the shade of the trees, the driver did not observe this jolt, and he was just beginning to put his horses to the trot, as they were leaving the bridge, when the forward wheels struck down heavily into the hollow, giving the front of the coach a sudden pitch forward and downward. Marco grasped the iron bar at his end of the seat, and saved himself; and the driver, who was habitually on his guard, had his feet so braced against the fender before him, that he would not have fallen. But the poor sailor, entirely unprepared for the shock, and perhaps unable to resist it if he had been prepared, pitched forward, <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> hold, went over the fender, and was tumbling down, as the driver had predicted, head foremost, under the horses' heels. The driver seized hold of him with one hand, but finding this insufficient dropped his reins and tried to grasp him with both. In doing it, however, he <b>lost</b> <b>his</b> own <b>balance</b> and went over too. He, of course, let go of the sailor, when he found that he was going himself. The sailor fell heavily and helplessly between the pole and the side of one of the horses, to the ground. The driver followed. He seized the pole with one hand, but was too late to save himself entirely, and thinking there was danger of being dragged, and finding that the horses were springing forward in a fright, he let himself drop through to the ground also. The coach passed over them in a moment, as the horses cantered on.|$|R
