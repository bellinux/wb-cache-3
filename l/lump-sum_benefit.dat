In the U.S. private industry, whose retirement benefits may be distributed in several alternative ways, using some type of <b>lump-sum</b> <b>benefit</b> as a payment option has become popular as an alternative to annuity payments (see Moore and Muller 2002; Blostin 2003 or Butrica et al. 2006). 1 The Financial Times reported in July 2011 that 79  % of polled pensioners collecting a company or private pension that year took a lump sum at their retirement.|$|E

In a first best framework, where a benevolent government exercises perfect control over the individuals' labor supply and retirement-decisions, the results show that a decrease in the standard deviation of life-length leads to an increase in the optimal retirement age and vice versa, if the preferences for 'the number of years spent in retirement' are characterized by constant or decreasing absolute risk aversion. A similar result follows in a second best setting, where the government raises revenue via a proportional tax (or pension fee) to finance a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>benefit</b> per year spent in retirement. We consider two versions of this model, one with a mandatory retirement age decided upon by the government and the other where the retirement age is a private decision-variable...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, child-related {{policies}} in Spain have experienced relevant changes at different government levels. The central government implemented a new universal child benefit at birth and reformed {{some of the}} most relevant policies for children living in low income households. Also, many regional governments (Comunidades Aut 3 nomas) have implemented their own policies to support families with children with different schemes in terms of design and generosity. All these policies have increased social protection expenditure aimed at families and children in Spain as a whole along the last decade (one of the lowest in the EU). So far, however, little is known about their impact on child poverty in Spain. Making use of the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union - EUROMOD - this paper simulates the eligibility and receipt of most of the existing monetary child-related policies at all government levels and assesses their real (for central government policies) or potential (for regional policies) effect on the reduction of child poverty in Spain. Our results underline that, even after the introduction of a universal <b>lump-sum</b> <b>benefit</b> for newborns at the central government level in 2007, in aggregate terms, central government tax credits are the main child-related policy in Spain. Results also underline that central government policies have a considerably larger role in reducing poverty risk even if {{policies in}} some regions perform best than others. In general, our simulations suggest that regional benefits and tax credits reinforce and complement the focus of central government policies on younger children, who, on the other hand, seem to be less vulnerable to poverty than older children in Spain...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} pensions on the timing of retirement, focusing on the differences between defined benefit (DB) plans and defined contribution (DC) plans. I find that DC plans have different effects on the accumulation of retirement wealth, the incentives for retirement {{and the risk of}} retirement benefits than DB plans. Thereby, DC plans have different effects from DB plans on the decision to retire. This paper is the first empirical study to investigate the effect of longevity risk in pension plans on retirement. It is an important addition to the literature on retirement behavior since longevity risk will become more important as individuals have longer life expectancies and bear more longevity risk due to increasing likelihood of coverage by DC plans or Social Security personal accounts. Previous research has found that DB plans have an age-incentive effect on retirement. That is, the structure of DB plans may induce individuals to retire at a specific age. By contrast, the structure of DC plans does not have age-incentive effects. Thereby, individuals with DC plans may retire either earlier or later on average than individuals with DB plans because of the absence of age-related incentives in DC plans. To shed further light on these issues, this study introduces risk factors, and particularly longevity risk, to an option value model of the retirement decision. Longevity risk is important to DC participants since DC plans usually offer a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>benefit</b> at retirement. Since payouts are not guaranteed over life expectancy, retirees with DC plans bear a greater risk of outliving their resources, i. e., longevity risk. The additional risks in DC plans may make workers save more, and retire later. This paper extends a standard intertemporal model of consumption and retirement by incorporating risk factors for different pension types into the retirement decision problem. Comparative statics from the optimal solution show that increases in risk factors (i. e. longevity risk) during retirement induce workers with DC plans to retire later than workers with defined benefit (DB) plans. This study then test the predictions of this model empirically, using the data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Empirical results confirm the predictions of the theoretical model. First, workers with DC plans expect to retire later than workers with DB plans. Next, increase in pension option value, measured as the difference between the maximum pension value and the pension value of 1992, decreases the probability of retirement, thereby increasing the expected retirement wage. By contrast, greater pension wealth increases the probability of retirement, reducing the expected retirement age. Considering that pension wealth in DC plans is about half of pension wealth in DB plans, it is reasonable to conclude that workers with DC plans retire later than workers with DB plans. Finally, longevity risk, as measured by the Annuity Equivalent Wealth (AEW), decreases probability of retirement, increasing the expected retirement age...|$|E
40|$|As {{the members}} of the “baby boom” {{generation}} — people born between 1946 and 1964 — approach retirement, the demographic profile of the U. S. workforce will undergo a substantial shift: a large number of older workers will be joined by relatively few new entrants to the labor force. According to the Census Bureau, while the number of people between the ages of 55 and 64 will grow by about 11 million between 2005 and 2025, {{the number of people who}} are 25 to 54 years old will grow by only 5 million. This trend could affect economic growth because labor force participation begins to fall after age 55. In 2006, 91 % of men and 76 % of women aged 25 to 54 participated in the labor force. In contrast, just 70 % of men and 58 % of women aged 55 to 64 were either working or looking for work in 2006. The rate of employment among persons age 55 and older is influenced by general economic conditions, eligibility for Social Security benefits, the availability of health insurance, and the prevalence and design of employer-sponsored pensions. Labor force participation among people 55 and older may, for example, be affected both by the trend away from defined-benefit pension plans that offer a monthly annuity for life to defined contribution plans that typically pay a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>benefit.</b> The declining percentage of employers that offer retiree health insurance also may result in more people continuing to work until they are eligible for Medicare at 65. Recent Census Bureau data show that the percentage of men and women age 62 and older who work in paid employment has risen over the past 10 years. In March 2007, 49 % of men aged 62 to 64 were employed, compared with 43 % in 1995 and 42 % in 1990. Of men aged 65 to 69, 33 % were employed in March 2007, compared with 27 % in 1995 and 26 % in 1990. Among women 62 to 64 years old, 42 % were working in March 2007, compared with 32 % in 1995 and 28 % in 1990, whereas among women 65 to 69 years old, 26 % were working in March 2007, compared with 17 % in 1995 and 1990. There also has been a trend toward more full-time employment among older Americans who work. In March 2007, 81 % of employed men aged 62 to 64 were working full-time, compared with 77 % in 1995 and 1990. Seventy-one percent of men aged 65 to 69 who were working in March 2007 were employed full-time, compared with 57 % in 1995 and 56 % in 1990. Among working women aged 62 to 64, 69 % worked full-time in March 2007, compared with 60 % in both 1995 and 1990, whereas among working women aged 65 to 69, 54 % were employed full-time in March 2007, compared with 43 % in 1995 and 44 % in 1990. As more workers reach retirement age, employers may try to induce some of them to remain on the job, perhaps on a part-time basis. This is sometimes referred to as “phased retirement. ” Several approaches to phased retirement — job sharing, reduced work schedules, and rehiring retired workers on a part-time or temporary basis — can be accommodated under current law. Under the recently enacted Pension Protection Act, a pension plan can begin to pay benefits to workers who have not yet separated from the employer at the earlier of age 62 or the pension plan’s normal retirement age, which in most plans is 65. Some employers would like to be able to pay partial pension distributions to workers who have reached the pension plan’s early retirement age. This would require a change in federal law...|$|E

Sharp increases in unemployment also boosted the numbers receiving redundancy payments. Overall lump sum payments amounted to 0.8 per cent of total disposable income in 2008.

40|$|It {{seems to}} be a never-ending debate on whether the public or the private sector should deliver {{services}} to the public. Although the political divide {{seems to be}} ideologically motivated, the arguments made are often one of efficiency and optimal outcomes. The field of economics {{plays an important role in}} separating the facts from the values in this debate, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of both public and private ownership in various sectors and organizational forms. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are no exception to this. PPPs have been heavily debated since its increasing popularity in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Its organizational features of providing incentives compatible with socially efficient outcomes are theoretically attractive. In practice, however, there are still much uncertainty as to whether these benefits actually materializes and whether they outweigh the potential costs of such arrangements. While much work has been done on the efficiency gains of PPP arrangements, surprisingly little has been done on the private finance aspect of PPP (Dewatripont and Legros, 2005). It is of course very likely that more research on this aspect of PPPs has been done since 2005. However, to my knowledge there is still quite limited literature on the effect from private finance on the PPP arrangement. In this thesis I investigate the potential benefits of private finance. Assuming private finance is not necessary for realizing the benefits if PPP, does it still have a valuable contribution and if so, how much private finance is necessary to reap the benefits of private finance? Furthermore, does this private finance have any distorting effect on the efficiency gains from PPP? In a influential paper on PPP, Iossa and Martimort (2012) uses an incomplete contract approach to show the costs and benefits of bundling the building and operation of infrastructure projects. Towards the end of the paper, the authors presents a scenario in which there exists a Private Financier with expertise in evaluating project risk. Together with the assumption of private finance being more costly than public finance, this sets the stage for a discussion on the costs and benefits of private finance. This thesis picks up on this discussion and explores when private finance is socially preferable. I investigate this in a setting with a simplified PPP structure but with a more complex private finance arrangement. In this paper I first present a simple PPP model with and without a third party Private Financier, building on the incomplete contract approach by Iossa and Martimort (2012). Then I present the main model including a Private Financier with several changes to the assumption made by Iossa and Martimort (2012). I assume that the Private Financier contributes with some level of private finance to the infrastructure investment and is compensated by receiving a share of the variable income to the consortium of builder and operator in the PPP (from now on referred to as "PPP Consortium"). This Private Financier has the option to exert a level of effort to observe an exogenous shock, to which it can insure the PPP Consortium should the shock be observed. Both the PPP Consortium and the Private Financier are assumed to be risk averse. The Private Financier receives the same share of the risk as the share of revenue it can claim. Thus, the share of risk and revenue needed to provide incentives for Private Financier to exert effort must be large enough such that the cost of exerting effort is lower than the disutility the Private Financier gets from the exogenous risk. I show that under certain conditions, it is socially optimal to have partly private financing and partly public financing. When the infrastructure is only partly financed by a Private Financier, it entails that the Government has been able to extract all the surplus from these contracts. If the Private Finance investment are no more costly than public financing investments, then this solution must also involves no distortions of the PPP Consortium's effort in creating infrastructure quality. However, if we assume that there is a higher financing cost from private finance, like Iossa and Martimort (2012) suggests, then even though the Government extracts all the surplus there is a distortion of reduced PPP Consortium infrastructure quality effort. Thus, whether the Private Finance is socially optimal depends on whether the cost of this distortion is lower than the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>benefit</b> of insuring the PPP Consortium. If the Private Financier's cost of making an effort in observing the shock is high enough relative to the share of risk and revenue it needs to exert this effort, then this model shows that the benefits of having private finance is outweighed by the costs. The reduced infrastructure quality effort made by the PPP Consortium costs more from the Governments point of view than the benefits it gets from insuring the PPP Consortium. Although this implies no private finance, in this model we might still consider including the Private Financier as a form of insurance company. If the total cost of Private Financier effort and investment cost is low enough, then the optimal level of Private Finance is full Private Finance. This scenario might actually involve the Private Financier extracting some of the surplus from the arrangement, assuming that the share of the risk and revenue it needs to exert the effort is high enough relative to total effort and investment costs. This means that even though the Private Financier is able to make a positive profit from the PPP arrangement, it might still be the socially optimal case. This has some interesting real world consequences. It suggests that even though one observes the private financier profiting from PPPs above the competitive level, it might still be the socially optimal solution. This is, of course, not necessarily true in reality but the model does suggests that under certain restricting conditions it might be. Furthermore, this scenario would imply that a higher financing premium is a cost born by the Private Financier and thus the socially optimal case is not affected by changes in the private financing premium. The model I propose in this thesis relies on several simplifying assumptions. I have assumed a separable disutility function for the exogenous risk. This allows for the simple approach of treating the exogenous risk as a separable cost, which is a function of the risk. However, this does run the risk of oversimplifying the problem. Furthermore, the quite restricted financial contractual form I propose must be seen as one of many potential forms that could represent the real world. Therefore, the results and conclusions in this thesis should not be viewed in isolation but seen as a contribution that might provide some additional insights to the role of private finance in Public-Private Partnerships...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper assesses the fiscal tolerability of the Thai Social Security Pension Fund to early retirement decisions, {{particularly among the}} workforce aged 50 - 54. Starting from 2014, the Social Security Pension Fund is due to pay regular monthly pension benefits to eligible insured persons. There has been increasing concern over the potentially high proportion of early retirees opting for one-time <b>lump-sum</b> old-age <b>benefits</b> instead of the more modest amount of monthly retirement pension. This can create severe shocks to the system. Forecasts and sensitivity analyses under alternative scenarios are conducted using an actuarial method. The estimation employs the latest 2010 National Economic and Social Development Board population forecast. In the worst case scenario, with an early retirement rate of 9 percent or higher per year, the tolerability of the system can be maintained for no longer than 25 years from now. The future generations risk facing {{a situation in which}} the old-age benefits may not be promptly received in the expected amount. This points to the important policy precaution that the currently high level of reserves in the Social Security Pension Fund does not ensure fiscal sustainability and tolerability as commonly believed. The result also implies that withdrawal from the social security pension fund by the government for other purposes is fiscally detrimental to life of the fund.

40|$|Asset allocation, the {{decision}} of {{how much of a}} portfolio to allocate to different types of securities, is one of the fundamental issues in financial economics. The paper examines the portfolios created out of <b>lump-sum</b> pensionary <b>benefits</b> received by 495 government pensioners who retired between 1967 and 2002. The paper uses the available data for the household investment in financial assets between 1970 and 2002, and compares it with the investment in financial assets of the pensioners. It is found that pensioners in the sample remain under-diversified. They were found to have taken an alarming magnitude of idiosyncratic risk. Despite being seemingly aware of the benefits of diversification, pensioners appear to adopt a “naive” strategy for diversifying their portfolios without giving proper consideration to the correlations among the assets that they invest into. Over the years, the average number of assets in pensioner portfolio has increased resulting in a decrease in the average portfolio variance. This may be ascribed to facts that reforms in Indian market opened floodgates for investment avenues and that these improvements resulted primarily from changes in the correlation structure of the Indian household investment market. Least diversified portfolios were found amongst pensioners who had lesser funds at their disposal and retirees of lower class (junior) categories. An analysis of a cross-sectional variations in diversification across demographic groups also suggest that younger, active and recent retirees are over-focused thereby holding under-diversified portfolios, not by chance but by choice. By and large, results indicate that pensioners face an intimidating task of constructing and maintaining a well-diversified portfolio despite realizing the benefits of it...|$|R
30|$|The key {{elements}} of “Agenda 2010 ” aimed to reform labor market institutions. The so-called Hartz reforms, which represented {{the core of the}} Agenda, were implemented in different steps between 2003 and 2005. In addition to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal Employment Services, the fundamental concept to improve the functioning of the labor market and reduce unemployment can be characterized as “supporting and demanding.” In other words, the reforms adopted a “carrot and stick” approach. On the “carrot” side, several instruments aimed to facilitate the integration of the unemployed, such as support for training measures, wage subsidies and improved conditions to place workers in new jobs. Concrete elements on the “stick” side include the—albeit moderate—weakening of job protection standards, the reduction of the maximum entitlement period for unemployment insurance benefits, the tightening of job acceptance regulations for the unemployed as well as the de-regulation of temporary work agencies. Perhaps the most substantial change, however, was the merger between unemployment assistance and welfare (“Hartz IV”). The implication of this change is that, after receiving unemployment insurance for 12 months, workers typically fall back into the basic welfare system. The former unemployment assistance system (Arbeitslosenhilfe) was related to previous earnings. Basic welfare, however, provides <b>lump-sum,</b> means-tested <b>benefits</b> only. Compared to the pre-reform situation, this meant a substantial deterioration in the positions of workers. Three important aspects have to be mentioned in this context. First, the social security system was traditionally status-oriented. The new institutional system, however, implies the possibility of a deep fall in social status after only 1 year of unemployment. This represented a credible threat. Second, compared to the pre-reform situation, the position of long-term unemployment recipients was significantly weaker. Third, the criteria under which workers could reject a job offer became stricter.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how members of Australian superannuation funds can manage risks arising from uncertain security returns and unpredictable mortality so as to ensure a steady income stream during retirement. In chapter 2 we note {{that the proportion of}} superannuation assets invested in foreign assets has increased over the past two decades, exposing investors to currency risk. Surveys of superannuation funds verify that most international bond holdings, but not equity holdings, have been hedged for currency risk. We test the mean-variance efficiency of this practice against two alternative hedging strategies: a conventional forward hedge and a selective hedge conditioned on the domestic-foreign interest differential. Implementing optimal hedging results in portfolios whose returns stochastically dominate portfolios constructed under restricted equity hedging, according to our new adaptation of Barrett-Donald (2003) tests. Selective hedging works best for equities and conventional hedging for bonds. Chapter 3 applies a discrete-time Merton (1971) model to questions of optimal decumulation and asset allocation for self-funded retirees drawing down <b>lump-sum</b> retirement <b>benefits.</b> Risk management is taken to revolve around protecting a pre-specified minimum consumption stream. Risk tolerances and lifetimes are allowed to span a range of possibilities. In the case of an agent living to age 90, ideal investment in equity-type assets increases gradually from 27 - 43 % over remaining life. This is much lower than the 55 - 60 % observed among retirees. Conservative investment strategies are needed to meet consumption goals over long lifetimes. Milevsky and Young (2002, 2003) attribute the reluctance to voluntarily annuitise to a valuable real option to delay annuitisation (RODA). Chapter 4 extends the RODA analysis to the case of HARA preferences. A formula for the optimal timing of annuitisation is derived from the solution to a dynamic stochastic consumption and investment problem with uncertain lifetime. The effect of introducing a consumption floor is to reduce the delay before annuity purchase. As in the CRRA case, delayed annuitisation is associated with optimistic predictions of the Sharpe ratio and divergence between annuity purchaser and provider predictions of mortality...|$|R
40|$|Since the millennium, {{the labor}} market {{participation}} of women and mothers is increasing across European countries. Several work/care policy measures underlie this evolution. At the same time, {{the labor market}} behavior of men and fathers, {{as well as their}} involvement in care work, is relatively unchanging, meaning that employed mothers are facing an increased burden with respect to gainful employment and providing care. We propose a family working time model that incentivizes fathers and mothers to both work in extended part-time employment. It provides a benefit in form of a lumpsum transfer or income replacement for each parent if, and only if, both parents work 30 hours per week. Thus, it explicitly addresses fathers and - contrary to most conventional family policies - actively promotes the dual earner/dual carer paradigm. Combining microsimulation and labor supply estimation, we empirically analyze the potential of the family working time model in the German context. The relatively small share of families already choosing the symmetric distribution of about 30 working hours would increase by 60 per cent. By showing that a <b>lump-sum</b> transfer especially <b>benefits</b> low-income families, we contribute to the debate about redistributive implications of family policies. The basic principles of the model generalize to other European countries where families increasingly desire an equal distribution of employment and care. In order to enhance the impact of such a policy, employers' norms and workplace culture as well as the supply of high-quality childcare must catch-up with changing workforce preferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} has {{the goal}} of providing a better understanding {{on the effectiveness of}} specific active labour market policies that aim at integration of young and older workers. The first Chapter evaluates the effectiveness of the 2003 reform of the Italian apprenticeship regime. This reform raised the age-eligibility and revised the training component. The different timing of the implementation of the reform in the Italian regions and sectors is exploited. To estimate the treatment effect (ATT) of the apprentices in the reformed regime (compared to the old regime), the Covariate Balancing Propensity Score estimator is implemented (CBPS - Imai and Ratkovic, 2014) employing a large set of covariates. The inflow sample of about 18, 000 apprentices hired in 2007 is drawn from administrative data of the Social Security Institutions (INPS). Four years after hiring, the reform induced an increase in the transition rate to permanent jobs in the same firm and boosted the average wage of the apprentices. Finally, by a DiD estimator on the LFS, it is found that the higher diffusion of the apprenticeship among the youth becoming eligible is offset by a reduction of other temporary jobs. Granting the eligibility to the youth aged 25 - 29 also encouraged their transition from non-employment to employment. The research related to the second and the third Chapters assesses the effectiveness of two Belgian federal policies to boost the employment rate of the older population. In this research we rely on an endogenous stratified sample of administrative data containing about 244, 000 individuals (aged between 52 and 61 years old in 2002) with their employment history since 1957. The second Chapter assesses the impact of a Belgian employers’ Social Security Contributions reduction for workers older than 58. The analysis is performed on multiple repeated cross-sections even if panel data are available, to account for age-varying confounding factors. We use a CDiD estimator (Heckman et al., 1997) and when needed a trend-adjusted version of it (Wolfers, 2006). To facilitate the integration of endogenous sampling weights in this estimator, we implement it as an Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimator, which we extend to allow for multiple cross-sections in the before and after periods. We find small positive short-run impacts on working time and larger ones on the employment rate, but only for employees at high risk of leaving to early retirement. The wage is not affected. In a Cost-Benefit-Analysis, we estimate that during the 1. 25 years after its introduction the subsidy imposed a net monthly cost of € 3, 700 € per saved job to Society. Had the subsidy been targeted to sectors where early retirement schemes are widely used, Society would instead have gained 400 € per saved job. The third Chapter evaluates the impact of the Belgian part-time Time-Credit scheme for older workers. The policy measure allows older workers to reduce their working time by 20 % (or 50 %) with {{the goal of}} postponing their retirement decision and possibly improve their work-life balance. Workers receive a <b>lump-sum</b> in-work <b>benefit</b> of about € 215 (€ 385), granting an average income replacement of 90 % (66 %) of the full-time wage. We assess the ATT on the survival in employment and we control for selection on observable (IPW) by using their whole employment history. As control units can enter the treatment in later periods, we take into account the dynamic treatment selection (Vikström, 2014). Our estimates indicate a positive employment effect in the short-run followed by a negative impact after four years with insignificant health effects. The policy does not pass the Cost-Benefit-Analysis test...|$|R
