40|$|Abstract: Foresight {{approach}} has received increasing attention on future policy-making {{over a few}} decades. Adaptive foresight has recently emerged to emphasize the role of diverse individual actors and external development. With {{the highlight of the}} planning process with adaptive foresight approach, reflexive governance shows a good model for the proper structure of governance that urban foresight may seek. Still despite the importance of guiding orientation towards future, this was under-estimated in foresight studies. Hence, this paper suggests an integrated framework by considering urban resilience as a future orientation in which urban foresight may seek, with the combination of adaptive foresight and reflexive governance addressed by Weber (2006). On focusing adaptive foresight, reflexive governance, and urban resilience, this paper develops the analytical framework of urban foresight from various related literature to evaluate <b>urban</b> <b>plans.</b> As a case of an <b>urban</b> <b>plan</b> in megacity level, 2030 Seoul Plan, a 20 -year <b>long-term</b> basic <b>urban</b> <b>plan</b> of Seoul, explicitly shows a remarkable and meaningful turn from conventional planning approaches to participatory foresight approaches, triggered by strong political leadership.

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Earth’s human {{population}} has reached unprecedented levels and its natural resources are being pushed to the limit. Thus, cities are focused on sustainable development and they have begun to develop new strategies for improving the built environment. Sustainable development provides the best outcomes for the human and natural environments by improving the quality of life that protects and balances the ecological, social and economic values. This brings us to the main point: to build a sustainable built environment, cities need to redesign many of their technologies and planning policies within the context of ecological principles. As an environmental sustainability index model, ASSURE is developed to investigate the present environmental situation of an urban area by assessing the impacts of development pressure on natural resources. It is an innovative approach to provide the resilience and function of urban ecosystems secure against the environmental degradation for now and the future.

40|$|We {{show that}} energy {{concepts}} {{can contribute to}} the understanding of human travel behaviour. First, the average travel times for different modes of transportation are inversely proportional to the energy consumption rates measured for the respective physical activities. Second, when daily travel-time distributions by different modes of transport such as walking, cycling, bus or car travel are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal functional relationship. This corresponds to a canonical-like energy distribution with exceptions for short trips, which can be theoretically explained. Altogether, this points to a law of constant average energy consumption by the physical activity of daily travelling.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Environmental nuisances, {{including}} {{ambient air}} pollution, {{are thought to}} contribute to social inequalities in health. There are two major mechanisms, which may act independently or synergistically, through which air pollution may play this role. Disadvantaged groups are recognized as being more often exposed to air pollution (differential exposure) and may also be more susceptible to the resultant health effects (differential susceptibility). METHOD: European research articles were obtained through a literature search in the Medline database using keywords 'Socioeconomic Factors, Air Pollution, Health' and synonymous expressions. RESULTS: Some studies found that poorer people were more exposed to air pollution whereas the reverse was observed in other papers. A general pattern, however, is that, irrespective of exposure, subjects of low socio-economic status experience greater health effects of air pollution. So far as we are aware, no European study has explored this relationship among children. Conclusion: The housing market biases land use decisions and may explain why some subgroups suffer from both a low socio-economic status and high exposure to air pollution. Some data may be based on inaccurate exposure assessment. Cumulative exposures {{should be taken into}} account to explore health problems more accurately. The issue of exposure and health inequalities in relation to ambient air quality is complex and calls for global appraisal. There is no single pattern. Policies aimed at reducing the root causes of these inequalities could be based on urban multipolarity and diversity, two attributes that require <b>long-term</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|E
40|$|In 1962, Reginald Ashley, the Secretary of the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society, {{wrote that}} allotments are ‘the {{heritage}} of the tenement dweller’. He was writing {{at a time of}} great upheaval in the allotments movement; allotments had come under threat from post-war development and had largely lost their role in food production that had been vital during the Depression and both World Wars. In writing this statement, Ashley connected allotments to the idiosyncratic dwellings of Scottish city life; {{he made it clear that}} allotments are a part of, rather than an escape from, Scottish cities. For the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society, allotments are not only there to grow food but they also improve the mental and physical health of tenement dwellers by providing them with their own outside space. This thesis will explore the role of the allotment within the city, using Glasgow as the location of study. It will use archival research and oral history interviews to answer five core research questions: how has the purpose of an allotment changed and developed from 1930 to the present day; how has the allotment movement advocated for these changing purposes; what has been the role of allotments in sustainable food production; how have allotments developed as places of community; and, what do allotments mean to individual plotholders. Through answering these five questions, this thesis will argue that allotments have developed as places of both individuality and community, a paradox that is needed for the health and well-being of plotholders. It will conclude that allotments are an integral part of Scottish cities that need to be included in <b>long-term</b> <b>urban</b> <b>planning,</b> providing protected green spaces for plotholders, communities, plants and animals in otherwise changing and developing urban environments...|$|E
