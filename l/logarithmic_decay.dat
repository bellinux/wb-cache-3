50|$|In 1966 and 1967, Liston {{developed}} a Digital-Alpha circuit {{to calculate the}} <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> of a capacitor-resistor. The circuit was patented by Liston Scientific in 1967. It was used in bichromatic analyzers which Liston designed for Abbott Laboratories, beginning with the ABA-100. The ABA-100 was a single-reagent double-channel kinetic analyzer for ultra-micro chemical analysis and simultaneous bichromatic spectrophotometry. One module of the instrument performed the chemical processing, dispensing the reagent and sample for the reaction and performing the spectrophotometry measurements. A second module monitored and controlled the processing module and calculated and reported results. Later models incorporated specialty microprocessors instead of memory chips.|$|E

We {{consider}} the stabilization of Maxwell’s equations with space-time variable coecients in a bounded region {{with a smooth}} boundary by means of linear or nonlinear SilverMüller boundary condition.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of stabilization of the (nonstationary) heteregeneous Maxwell's equations in a bounded region with a Lipschitz boundary by means of nonlinear Silver-Müller boundary condition.

As a consequence we get an explicit decay rate of the energy, for instance exponential, polynomial or <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decays</b> are available for appropriate feedbacks. Based on the linear stability estimate, we further obtain certain exact controllability results for the Maxwell system...|$|R
40|$|The slow {{dynamics}} for a {{colloidal suspension}} of particles interacting with a hard-core repulsion complemented by a short-ranged attraction is discussed within {{the frame of}} mode-coupling theory for ideal glass transitions for parameter points near a higher-order glass-transition singularity. The solutions of the equations of motion for the density correlation functions are solved for the square-well system in quantitative detail by asymptotic expansion using {{the distance of the}} three control parameters packing fraction, attraction strength and attraction range from their critical values as small parameters. For given wave vectors, distinguished surfaces in parameter space are identified where the next-to-leading order contributions for the expansion vanish so that the decay functions exhibit a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> over large time intervals. For both coherent and tagged particle dynamics the leading-order <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> is accessible in the liquid regime for wave vectors of several times the principal peak in the structure factor. The <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> in the correlation function is manifested in the mean-squared displacement as a subdiffusive power law with an exponent varying sensitively with the control parameters. Shifting parameters through the distinguished surfaces, the correlation functions and the logarithm of the mean-squared displacement considered as functions of the logarithm of the time exhibit a crossover from concave to convex behavior, and a similar scenario is obtained when varying the wave vector.

40|$|The {{definition}} of coherent derived {{units in the}} International System of Units (SI) is reviewed, and {{the important role of}} the equations defining physical quantities is emphasized in obtaining coherent derived units. In the case of the dimensionless quantity plane angle, the choice between alternative definitions is considered, leading to a corresponding choice between alternative definitions of the coherent derived unit - the radian, degree or revolution. In this case the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) has chosen to adopt the definition that leads to the radian as the coherent derived unit in the SI. In the case of the quantity <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> (or gain), also sometimes called decrement, and sometimes called level, a similar choice of defining equation exists, leading to a corresponding choice for the coherent derived unit - the neper or the bel. In this case the CGPM has not yet made a choice. We argue that for the quantity <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> the most logical choice of defining equation is linked to that of the radian, and is that which leads to the neper as the corresponding coherent derived unit. This should not prevent us from using the bel and decibel as units of <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay.</b> However, it {{is an important part of}} the SI to establish in a formal sense the equations defining physical quantities, and the corresponding coherent derived units. ...|$|E

40|$|Building on mode-coupling-theory calculations, {{we report}} a novel {{scenario}} for multiple glass transitions in a purely repulsive spherical potential: the square shoulder. The liquid-glass transition lines exhibit both melting by cooling and melting by compression {{as well as}} associated diffusion anomalies, {{similar to the ones}} observed in water. Differently from all previously investigated models, we find for small shoulder widths a glass-glass line that is disconnected from the liquid phase. Upon increasing the shoulder width such a glass-glass line merges with the liquid-glass transition lines, featuring two distinct end point singularities that give rise to <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decays</b> in the dynamics.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} questions, especially in applications, is how to choose a decay function in the study of stability for a concrete equation. Motivated {{by the fact that the}} coefficients of the considered equation mainly suggest the choice of the decay function, the point of analysis in the paper is to carry out the Lyapunov function approach and to state coercivity conditions dependent on decay in the study of the pth moment stability with a general decay rate for a certain stochastic differential equation with variable time delay. Some criteria including the usual exponential decay are discussed, particularly the ones with a concave decay, special cases of which are polynomial and <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decays.</b> Some consequences and examples are given to illustrate the theory. ...|$|R

40|$|The local moment {{approach}} is {{extended to the}} orbitally degenerate (SU(2 N)) Anderson impurity model (AIM).

The approach captures many-body broadening of the Hubbard satellites and recovers the correct exponential vanishing of the Kondo scale for all N, and its universal scaling spectra are found to be in very good agreement with numerical renormalization group (NRG) results. In particular the high-frequency <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decays</b> of the scaling spectra, obtained here in closed form for arbitrary N, coincide essentially perfectly with available numerics from the NRG.

40|$|We use {{large scale}} {{simulations}} to study interacting particles in two dimensions {{in the presence}} of both an ac drive and quenched disorder. As a function of ac amplitude, there is a crossover from a low drive regime where the colloid positions are highly disordered to a higher ac drive regime where the system dynamically reorders. We examine the coarsening of topological defects formed when the system is quenched from a disordered low ac amplitude state to a high ac amplitude state. When the quench is performed close to the disorder-order crossover, the defect density decays with time as a power law with α = 1 / 4 to 1 / 3. For deep quenches, in which the ac drive is increased to high values such that the dynamical shaking temperature is strongly reduced, we observe a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> of the defect density into a grain boundary dominated state. We find a similar <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> of defect density in systems containing no pinning.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and systematically}} investigate a numerical procedure that reveals the asymptotically self-similar dynamics of solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach {{is based on}} the renormalization group (RG) theory for PDEs. This numerical version of RG method, dubbed as the numerical RG algorithm, numerically rescales the temporal and spatial variables in each iteration and drives the solutions to a fixed point exponentially fast, which corresponds to self-similar dynamics of the equations. Moreover, the procedure allows us for detecting and further finding the critical exponent of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decay</b> hidden in self-similar solutions. We carefully examine the ability of the algorithm for determining the critical scaling exponents in time and space that render explicitly the distinct physical effects of the solutions of the Burgers equation, depending on the initial conditions. We use the phenomena of dispersive shock waves of the Korteweg-de Vries equation to show that the algorithm {{can be used as a}} time integrator for investigating intermediate asymptotic behavior of solutions.
