5000|$|Forty {{minutes before}} the race the pitwall radar read that more than thirty minutes of steady 2-3 (0 = no rain and 4 = heavy shower) {{intensity}} rain was expected at 15:50 pm local time (ten mins before race start). All drivers except the two HRT's began the race on the green banded intermediate tyre. The HRT team opted for the blue banded full wet tyres. Grosjean starting from 7th, made a good start and was third into turn 1. Schumacher and Grosjean made contact at turn 4 and both spun, losing several positions {{in the process and}} Grosjean eventually retired on lap 4 after spinning into a gravel trap. On the first <b>lap,</b> <b>turn</b> 9 to 11 was almost completely dry {{but the rest of the}} track was very wet. Pérez stopped after the first lap to change to full wets in a move that would elevate him to an eventual podium scoring position. With almost all drivers having pitted onto full wets by laps 5, the pitwall radar was shown to read [...] "the intensity will increase to 4 from time to time" [...] meaning heavy rain was still to come.|$|E

5000|$|Practice summary: The warmest day of {{the week}} thus far saw some of the fastest <b>laps</b> <b>turned</b> so far for the month. Scott Dixon set fast lap with two minutes {{remaining}} in the session. Danica Patrick was second fastest for the day. No incidents were reported ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Fast Friday," [...] {{the final}} day of {{practice}} before time trials saw the fastest <b>laps</b> <b>turned</b> in Indy history. Shortly after the track opened, Scott Brayton ran his fastest lap of the month, 235.688 mph. Tony Stewart ran a 236.004 mph, while Scott Sharp ran a 235.300 mph lap.|$|R
50|$|Elmer George {{was one of}} {{the drivers}} who took <b>laps</b> in Wednesday, <b>turning</b> a fast <b>lap</b> of 155.17 mph. Jim Rathmann took to the track in a specially-modified Kurtis-Kraft {{roadster}} prepared by Ray Nichels. The car had a 370 in³ Pontiac V8 engine. The test run was arranged by Firestone in order to test high speed tires. Rathmann clocked a fast lap of 172.80 mph, setting a new unofficial track record, eclipsing the <b>lap</b> <b>turned</b> in by Marshall Teague back in February.|$|R
50|$|After {{testing and}} practice, {{participants}} generally praised the course. However, {{there was an}} underlying concern around the paddock about the incredible speeds. Cars were routinely <b>turning</b> <b>laps</b> at an average speed of more than 30 mph faster than <b>laps</b> <b>turned</b> at Indianapolis. Another point of concern was the abrupt transition from the steep 31° banking in the turns to the nearly flat apron. Drivers were worried that a spinning car may come down the banking and hit the apron, resulting in a serious crash.|$|R

[...] Then he returned, and laying his hand once again upon her <b>lap</b> <b>turned</b> his face away from her. [...] "Bear it," [...] she said. [...] "Bear it." [...] His hand quivered where it lay as he shook his head. [...] "Call upon your courage and bear it." ...|$|R
50|$|Root {{arrived at}} the track with the Sumar Streamliner, a {{modified}} Indy roadster with streamlined body and a canopy top. The driver was to be Marshall Teague, a former NASCAR and AAA/USAC Stock Car driver turned Champ Car driver. On Monday February 9, Teague made his first practice <b>laps,</b> <b>turning</b> a total of nine laps. His best lap was 171.821 mph. It was the fastest single lap ever run on a closed circuit in the United States.|$|R

50|$|On {{the second}} <b>lap</b> in <b>turn</b> two, Jeff Bucknum spun out and {{collected}} his teammate P. J. Chesson, taking {{both of the}} entries from Hemelgarn Racing out of the race.|$|R
5000|$|... 2011: Brad Keselowski blew a tire on {{the final}} <b>lap</b> in <b>Turn</b> 1, Mark Martin won, and Danica Patrick {{finished}} 4th, the best finish for her and a female in any of NASCAR's top three series.|$|R
60|$|The two aunts were at Clipstone early; {{and might}} be {{satisfied}} with the true Merrifield tints of Magdalen Susanna, but perhaps she had been over much warned to be gracious, for the very contrary was the effect. She had been very civil to her great-aunt Lilias, and had allowed both her uncles to take her up in their arms; but she retreated upon Angela, planted an elbow on the well-known <b>lap,</b> <b>turned</b> her back, and put a skinny little finger in her mouth by way of answer to Susan's advances, advances which had hardly ever before been repelled even by the most untamable of infants.|$|R
6000|$|That {{seemed a}} good idea, so they halted the procession, and the Bear King held the little Pink Bear on his <b>lap</b> and <b>turned</b> the crank in its side and asked, [...] "Where is Ozma of Oz?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{he folded}} small, and handed towards her. Bathsheba would not read it; {{she would not}} even put out her hand to take it. Pennyways, then, with a laugh of derision, tossed it into her <b>lap,</b> and, <b>turning</b> away, left her.|$|R
5000|$|The Richmond {{race has}} been {{extended}} by 50 <b>laps</b> (37.5 miles), <b>turning</b> it from a 250-lap race to 300 laps.|$|R
5000|$|Simon Pagenaud led {{the speed}} chart on [...] "Fast Friday," [...] {{the final day}} of {{practice}} before qualifications. It was the second day in a row Pagenaud was the top driver of the day, and it was the fastest <b>lap</b> <b>turned</b> thus far of the month. Hot and windy conditions kept the speeds down from expected. Teams were allowed increased turbocharger [...] "boost" [...] for Friday, and Scott Dixon set an early [...] "no tow" [...] speed of 230.655 mph during the first hour. No incidents were reported, however, many cars stayed off the track for most of the afternoon. Only 1,055 laps were completed all day, approximately half of previous days. A total of 33 out of 34 cars completed at least one lap over 225 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The tondo {{depicts a}} seated Virgin Mary {{with the baby}} Jesus {{dynamically}} sprawled across her <b>lap,</b> <b>turning</b> and looking back over his right shoulder towards the infant Saint John the Baptist, who stands before him looking down and holding a fluttering bird. Compositionally, {{the eye of the}} viewer is drawn diagonally along Christ's body, back up that of his mother, with her gaze across to John, and from his face back to Christ. John, patron saint of Florence, with his attribute of a baptismal bowl, crosses his arms, perhaps in allusion to the cross. Most likely it is a goldfinch not a dove that he holds - Christian symbolism sees in this bird a representation of the Passion - the piece of marble below might then have been intended as a crown of thorns.|$|R
5000|$|Practice summary: All 36 drivers {{today were}} {{separated}} by [...]7745 of a second. Fifteen drivers <b>turned</b> <b>laps</b> of 225 mph or faster today.|$|R
5000|$|Thursday May 7: breakups in {{the track}} surface were being repaired. Floyd [...] "Sparky" [...] Sparks practiced during the repair work, <b>turning</b> <b>laps</b> around 75-80 mph.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not evident}} that Hetty quite {{understood}} him, for she sat {{looking at the}} fire with hands crossed in her <b>lap,</b> and Sewell <b>turned</b> to Tomlinson.|$|R
50|$|The SAFER barrier {{was first}} tested by Brett Bodine on lap 11 and Kurt Busch, in which Jimmy Spencer spun out Busch on <b>lap</b> 36 in <b>turn</b> 3.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965: Scotland's Jim Clark leads 190 of 200 laps {{to become}} the first non-American winner since 1916. His Lotus-Ford is the first rear-engine winning car, and the first to average more than 150 miles per hour for the entire {{distance}} (150.686), just three years after the first single <b>lap</b> was <b>turned</b> at 150. Parnelli Jones finishes second and rookie Mario Andretti is third.|$|R
5000|$|Practice summary: At 1:55 p.m., Spencer Pigot {{suffered}} the first {{crash of the}} week. In turn one, Pigot did a half-spin, and slid into the outside wall with {{the left side of}} the car. Pigot climbed from the car uninjured, but the car was heavily damaged. No other accidents occurred on the day, but two mechanical failures would also bring brief halts to practice. Around 3:20 p.m., Matthew Brabham rolled to a halt in turn three with no power to his car. Just after 5:00 p.m., the second mechanical failure of the day occurred when the engine on Mikhail Aleshin's car failed and began spewing smoke down the backstretch. Aleshin rolled to a stop in turn three. While not as dominant as the Monday session, Andretti Autosport once again led the day, with Ryan Hunter-Reay setting the fastest lap at 228.202 mph. Josef Newgarden led the way in [...] "no-tow" [...] <b>laps,</b> <b>turning</b> a 224.541 mph lap late in the session.|$|R
60|$|Totty {{turned her}} face towards Dinah, {{and looked at her}} an instant, then lifted herself up, put out her little arms, and let Dinah lift her from her mother's <b>lap.</b> Hetty <b>turned</b> away without any sign of ill humour, and, taking her hat from the table, stood waiting with an air of indifference, to see if she should be told to do {{anything}} else.|$|R
6000|$|... "There sat Mother Jezebel, {{with the}} air of a woman resting on the high-road to heaven, dressed in a slate-colored gown, with gray mittens on her hands, a {{severely}} simple cap on her head, and a volume of sermons on her <b>lap.</b> She <b>turned</b> up the whites of her eyes devoutly at the sight of me, and the first words she said were--'Oh, Lydia! Lydia! why are you not at church?' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{marathon}} route starts part {{way along}} The Mall and, heading away from Buckingham Palace proceeds through Admiralty Arch and past Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. A slight {{turn to the}} right onto Northumberland Avenue which drops down to near river-level over a distance of 350 metres (a little under {{a quarter of a}} mile). On the first <b>lap</b> the runners <b>turn</b> right and continue along the Victoria Embankment, on subsequent <b>laps</b> they <b>turn</b> left and pass under the Hungerford Bridge and follow the River Thames on its downstream path. The Embankment is the longest [...] "straight" [...] stretch in the race, about 1,500 m (nearly a mile) on the outbound leg and 2,100 m on the return leg. It leads the runners past Cleopatra's Needle and the heraldic lions that symbolically defend the limits of the City of London.|$|R
50|$|Monday May 5 - Rookie OrientationA {{very light}} day of {{activity}} saw only four cars take {{a total of}} 80 <b>laps.</b> Kenny Bräck <b>turned</b> the fastest <b>lap</b> (205.597 mph), and Sam Schmidt passed his rookie test.|$|R
50|$|In the 1977 Indianapolis 500, Foyt {{ran out of}} fuel, and {{had to make a}} pit stop. He had to make {{up around}} 32 seconds on Gordon Johncock. Foyt made up 1.5 to 2 seconds per <b>lap</b> by <b>turning</b> up his turbo boost, which risked {{destroying}} the engine. Johncock's own engine expired just as Foyt had closed to within eight seconds back after both drivers' final pit stops, and Foyt passed for the win.|$|R
60|$|Whether Jet the spaniel, being a {{much more}} knowing dog than was suspected, wished to express his disapproval of the Countess's last speech, as not accordant with his ideas of wisdom and veracity, I cannot say; but at this moment he jumped off her <b>lap,</b> and, <b>turning</b> his back upon her, placed one paw on the fender, and held the other up to warm, as if {{affecting}} to abstract himself from the current of conversation.|$|R
50|$|Rookie Tony Adamowicz {{suffered}} {{bad luck}} during his attempt. On his first qualifying lap, the yellow light was {{turned on by}} error. He slowed down, and his first <b>lap</b> was <b>turned</b> in at 160.829 mph. The green light came back on moments later, and he completed the run. Though he had two laps over 166 mph, his first lap pulled his average down to 164.820 mph, and made him the second-slowest car {{in the field for}} the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was at {{this time}} that the strangest events of my life occurred. Sitting in an upper room, gazing out of the window, over the fields, through which I had walked so happily but two days before to meet the lady whom I had begun to think of as my Marie, I felt the head of a dog laid gently in my <b>lap.</b> Without <b>turning</b> my head I caressed the animal, and stroked the long hair on his neck.|$|R
