50|$|There {{are several}} {{arguments}} {{on whether or}} not free trade has a correlation to an increased activity in the illicit drug trade. Currently, the structure and operation of the illicit drug industry is described mainly in terms of an international division of labor. Free trade can open new markets to domestic producers who would otherwise resort to exporting illicit drugs. Additionally, extensive free trade among states increases cross-border drug enforcement and coordination between law enforcement agencies in different countries. However, free trade also increases the sheer volume of legal cross-border trade and provides cover for drug smuggling—by providing ample opportunity to conceal illicit cargo in legal trade. While international free trade continues to expand the volume of legal trade, the ability to detect and interdict drug trafficking is severely diminished. Towards the late 1990s, the top ten seaports in the world processed 33.6 million containers. Free trade has fostered integration of financial markets and has provided drug traffickers with more opportunities to launder money and invest in other activities. This strengthens the drug industry while weakening the efforts of law enforcement to monitor the flow of drug money into the legitimate economy. Cooperation among cartels expands their scope to distant markets and strengthens their abilities to evade detection by local law enforcement. Additionally, criminal organizations work together to coordinate money-laundering activities by having separate organizations handle specific stages of <b>laundering</b> <b>process.</b> One organization structures the process of how financial transactions will be laundered, while another criminal group provides the “dirty” money to be cleaned. By fostering expansion of trade and global transportation networks, free trade encourages cooperation and formation of alliances among criminal organizations across different countries.The drug trade in Latin America emerged in the early 1930s. It saw significant growth in the Andean countries, including Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. The underground market in the early half of the 20th century mainly had ties to Europe. After World War II, the Andean countries saw an expansion of trade, specifically with cocaine.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare two different <b>laundering</b> <b>processes</b> {{in terms of}} soiling removal, chemical contaminant removal, and effects on key firefighter protective clothing properties. The first process (“Esporta”) represents a unique machine and chemical approach, {{which is designed to}} provide large throughput but in a manner where potential damage to the clothing is minimized while providing a comprehensive cleaning process. The second process (“conventional”) was representative of a generic industrial laundering method and in fact was based on the garment conditioned specified in NFPA 1971, which set the minimum performance requirements for firefighter protective clothing. To carry out the study, two different fabric systems were chosen for evaluation that represented a range of fabric use by the fire service. For soiling removal, a synthetic soil was applied to outer shell fabrics using a Launder-Ometer based process using techniques established by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC). Three different methods were used for comparing soiling removal that included visual comparisons, the application of AATCC Gray Scale color and staining ratings, and spectrophotometric measurements of color and color changes.

40|$|Various {{exterior}} {{factors have}} perpetual effects on textile materials during wear, use and laundering in everyday life. In {{accordance with their}} frequency of use, textile materials are required to be laundered at certain intervals. The medium in which the <b>laundering</b> <b>process</b> takes place have inevitable detrimental physical and chemical effects on textile materials caused by the unique parameters of the process inherently existing. Connatural structures of various textile materials result in many different physical, chemical and mechanical characteristics. Because of their specific structures, these materials have different behaviors against several exterior factors. By modeling the behavior of commercial and test textiles as group-wise against <b>laundering</b> <b>process,</b> {{it is possible to}} disclose the relation in between these two groups of materials, which will lead to better understanding of their behaviors in terms of similarities and differences against the washing parameters of the laundering. Thus, the goal of the current research is to examine the behavior of two groups of textile materials as commercial textiles and as test textiles towards the main washing machine parameters during <b>laundering</b> <b>process</b> such as temperature, load quantity, mechanical action and level of water amount by concentrating on shrinkage, pilling, sewing defects, collar abrasion, the other defects other than sewing, whitening and overall properties of textiles. In this study, cotton fabrics were preferred as commercial textiles {{due to the fact that}} garments made of cotton are the most demanded products in the market by the textile consumers in daily life.

40|$|Background: Several major {{outbreaks}} {{in healthcare}} facilities have occurred {{with the emergence}} of multi-resistant bacteria. A possible route for dissemination is the hospital textiles and inadequate laundering of them. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an easy-to-use method for simulating the <b>laundering</b> <b>process</b> of hospital textiles, and thereafter apply the method when evaluating the decontaminating efficacy of two different washing temperatures. Methods: The <b>laundering</b> <b>process,</b> including tumble drying, took place at two professional laundries. Enterococcus faecium was used as bioindicator. Results: The results showed that a lowering of the washing temperature from 70 °C to 60 °C did not affect the decontamination efficacy; the washing cycle alone reduced the number of bacteria with 3 – 5 log 10 CFU, whereas the following tumble drying reduced the bacterial numbers with another 3 – 4 log 10 CFU, yielding the same final result independent of washing temperature. Without tumble drying, there was an obvious risk of adding non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria to the fabric. These bacteria originated from the washing cycle. Conclusion: A simple method to simulate hospital laundering was developed. To save energy, it is possible to use a washing temperature of 60 °C, but the washing cycle should be followed by tumble drying, and the whole <b>laundering</b> <b>process</b> needs to be monitored to maintain sufficient textile hygiene...|$|E

40|$|In {{domestic}} textile <b>laundering</b> <b>processes,</b> {{mass transfer}} and mass transport are often rate limiting. Therefore, these processes require a long processing time, {{large amounts of}} water and chemicals, and they are energy consuming. In most of these processes, diffusion and convection in the inter-yarn and intra-yarn pores of the fabric are limiting mass transport mechanisms. Intensification of mass transport, preferentially in the intra-yarn pores, is {{the key in the}} improvement of the efficiency of wet textile processes. Conventional methods of intensification of mass transport (e. g. operation at elevated temperatures) are not always feasible due to the undesired side effects such as fabric damage. Increasing the flow rate does not deliver the desired effect due to the multi-porous complex structure of textile materials. Van der Donck et al. [Tenside Surf. Det. 35 (1998) 119; 36 (1999) 222] reported that the deformation of yarns by placing a fabric in a pulsating flow or repeated mechanical elongation of the yarns improved mass transport. However, the additional mass transport caused by deformation is limited in practice. Power ultrasound is a promising technique to accelerate mass transport in textile materials. Several papers appeared in this field, which report an improvement in energy efficiency and processing time of the wet textile processes in the presence of ultrasound. In this paper, the different time and length scales are discussed in the intensification of the mass transport in laundry processes in the presence of ultrasound and compared with more conventional processes. It has been concluded that the characteristic mass transport rates in textiles can be increased by a factor of 6 applying ultrasound...|$|R
