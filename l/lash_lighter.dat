5000|$|Another related {{system was}} the Sea Bee, {{which had a}} lifting system located at {{the stern of the}} carrier ship. The lift, known as a [...] "Syncrolift" [...] was a {{platform}} that could be lowered below the water surface. Two lighters weighing up to 1,000 metric tons are maneuvered onto the now-underwater platform and raised to the height of the deck, where special rails engage and transport the lighters {{down the length of the}} ship to their berthings. The lighters used in the Sea Bee system are considerably larger than the <b>LASH</b> <b>lighter,</b> and the loading hardware is also stronger, with a lifting force of more than 2,000 Mp.|$|E

It was unthinkable that they should sacrifice a scrap of the provisions. Then, when each man had <b>lashed</b> a <b>light</b> load upon his shoulders with a portion of the cut-up traces, they set out again, and it rained upon them heavily all that day.|$|R

5000|$|Wyatt Earp, a {{man whose}} trigger finger had {{considerable}} to do in making the border history of the West, was in Denver for several days last week. He is tall and athletic. His eyes are blue and fringed with <b>light</b> <b>lashes</b> and set beneath blonde eyebrows. His hair, which was once as yellow as gold, is beginning to be stranded with white. A heavy, tawny mustache shades his firm mouth and sweeps below his strong, square chin. He wore ... a neat gray tailor-made suit, immaculate linen and fashionable neckwear.

6000|$|On {{the first}} yearly {{anniversary of the}} great strike at Excelsior there were {{some changes in the}} settlement, notably the {{promotion}} of Mr. Marsh to a more important position in the company, and the installation of Miss Cassie Marsh as manageress of the hotel. As Miss Marsh read the official letter, signed by the president, conveying in complimentary but formal terms this testimony of their approval and confidence, her lip trembled slightly, and a tear trickling from her <b>light</b> <b>lashes</b> dimmed her eye-glasses, so that she was fain to go up to her room to recover herself alone. When she did so she was startled to find a wire dummy standing near the door, and neatly folded upon the bed two elegant dresses. A note in the president's own hand lay beside them. A swift blush stung her cheek as she read,-- ...|$|R
40|$|Iris {{recognition}} {{plays an}} important role in the Biometric authentication. The eye lids, <b>lashes</b> and flash <b>light</b> impressions are hazard, which in turn reduces successive iris recognition rate. The proposed method includes the preprocessing of images such as image filter, morphological operations, and edge detection, which finds the exact pupil part. The proposed method uses the MLRP algorithm, to identify the exact iris layers rather than the existing methods. The key feature is extracted in iris layer. The method is applied on both left and right iris, which gives unique key between left and right eye for every person. The extracted key feature identifies the eye even in the different eye position, which gives the repeatability. The proposed method is tested with the CASIA data base iris images, which consists of left and right eye set for the different human. The proposed method reduces th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIris {{features}} {{provides a}} unique biometric identification in the eye. The uniqueness is maintained for {{left and right}} eye, twins. Even during the eye transportation, the natures of iris parameters are varied by nature. The eye lids, <b>lashes</b> and flash <b>light</b> impressions are the crucial hazards, during the localization of iris region. The proposed method is used to detect the iris boundary, by eliminating the hazards. The eye image is pre-processed by using the filter with suitable coefficients. The flash image is eliminated in the pre-processing stage. The morphological operation is imposed on the pre-processed image, which results the exact pupil area. The edge detection technique is applied to find the visible iris region, either on {{the left or right}} side. The radius is calculated from the pupil centre to the iris visible boundary. The circle is formed on the iris region, which exactly fits on iris boundary. The iris region curve formed over the eye lashes and eye lids. The proposed method is tested with CASIA Ver 3. 0 image, which eliminates the iris hazards to identify the unique radius as a feature in the eye image...|$|R
60|$|The casual glimpses {{which the}} {{ordinary}} population bestowed upon that wondrous world of sap and leaves called the Hintock woods {{had been with}} these two, Giles and Marty, a clear gaze. They had been possessed of its finer mysteries as of commonplace knowledge; {{had been able to}} read its hieroglyphs as ordinary writing; to them {{the sights and sounds of}} night, winter, wind, storm, amid those dense boughs, which had to Grace a touch of the uncanny, and even the supernatural, were simple occurrences whose origin, continuance, and laws they foreknew. They had planted together, and together they had felled; together they had, with the run of the years, mentally collected those remoter signs and symbols which, seen in few, were of runic obscurity, but all together made an alphabet. From the <b>light</b> <b>lashing</b> of the twigs upon their faces, when brushing through them in the dark, they could pronounce upon the species of the tree whence they stretched; from the quality of the wind's murmur through a bough they could in like manner name its sort afar off. They knew by a glance at a trunk if its heart were sound, or tainted with incipient decay, and by the state of its upper twigs, the stratum that had been reached by its roots. The artifices of the seasons were seen by them from the conjuror's own point of view, and not from that of the spectator's.|$|R
6000|$|The d'Humières {{have just}} been lunching with me, and that has so reknotted the silver cord that {{stretched}} so tense from {{the first days of}} last March to the first of those of May--wasn't it?--that I feel it a folly in addition to a shame not yet to have written to you (as I have been daily and hourly yearning to do) ever since my return from Italy about a month ago. You flung me the handkerchief, Edith, just at that time--literally cast it at my feet: it met me, exactly, bounding--rebounding--from my hall-table as I recrossed my threshold after my long absence; which fact makes this tardy response, I am well aware, all the more graceless. And then came the charming little picture-card of the poor Lamb House hack grinding out his patient prose under your <b>light</b> <b>lash</b> and dear Walter B.'s--which should have accelerated my production to the point of its breaking in waves at your feet: and yet it's only to-night that my overburdened spirit--pushing its way, ever since my return, through the accumulations and arrears, in every sort, of absence--puts pen to paper for your especial benefit--if benefit it be. The charming d'Humières both, as I say, touring--training--in England, through horrid wind and weather, with a bonne grace and a wit and a Parisianism worthy of a better cause, amiably lunched with me a couple of days since on their way from town to Folkestone, and so back to Plassac (don't you like [...] "Plassac," [...] down in our dear old Gascony?) the seat of M. de Dampierre--to whom, à ce qu'il paraît, that day at luncheon we were all exquisitely sympathetic! Well, it threw back the bridge across the gulfs and the months, even to the very spot where the great nobly-clanging glass door used to open to the arrested, the engulfing and disgorging car--for we sat in my little garden here and talked about you galore and kind of made plans (wild vain dreams, though I didn't let them see it!) for our all somehow being together again.... But oh, I should like to remount the stream of time much further back than their passage here--if it weren't (as it somehow always is when I get at urgent letters) ever so much past midnight. It was only with my final return hither that my deep draught of riotous living came to an end, and as the cup had originally been held to my lips all by your hands I somehow felt in presence of your interest and sympathy up to the very last, and as if you absolutely should have been avertie from day to day--I did the matter that justice at least. Too much of the story has by this time dropped out; but there are bits I wish I could save for you.... But I must break off--it's 1.15 a.m.! ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Ferris {{took his}} way through the devious footways where the shadow was chill, and through the broad campos where the sun was tenderly warm, and the towers of the church rose against the speck-less azure of the vernal heaven. As he went along, he frowned in a {{helpless}} perplexity with the case of Don Ippolito, whom he had begun by doubting for a spy with some incomprehensible motive, and had ended by pitying with a certain degree of amusement and a deep sense of the futility of his compassion. He presently began to think of him with a little disgust, as people commonly think of one whom they pity and yet cannot help, and he made haste to cast off the hopeless burden. He shrugged his shoulders, struck his stick on the smooth paving-stones, and let his eyes rove up and down the fronts of the houses, {{for the sake of the}} pretty faces that glanced out of the casements. He was a young man, and it was spring, and this was Venice. He made himself joyfully part of the city and the season; he was glad of the narrowness of the streets, of the good-humored jostling and pushing; he crouched into an arched doorway to let a water-carrier pass with her copper buckets dripping at the end of the yoke balanced on her shoulder, and he returned her smiles and excuses with others as broad and gay; he brushed by the swelling hoops of ladies, and stooped before the unwieldy burdens of porters, who as they staggered through the crowd with a thrust hero, and a shove there forgave themselves, laughing, with [...] "We are in Venice, signori;" [...] and he stood aside for the files of soldiers clanking heavily over the pavement, then muskets kindling to a blaze in the sunlit campos and quenched again in the damp shadows of the calles. His ear was taken by the vibrant jargoning of the boatmen as they pushed their craft under the bridges he crossed, and the keen notes of the canaries and the songs of the golden-billed blackbirds whose cages hung at lattices far overhead. Heaps of oranges, topped by the fairest cut in halves, gave their color, at frequent intervals, to the dusky corners and recesses and the long-drawn cry of the venders, [...] "Oranges of Palermo!" [...] rose above the clatter of feet and the clamor of other voices. At a little shop where butter and eggs and milk abounded, together with early flowers of various sorts, he bought a bunch of hyacinths, blue and white and yellow, and he presently stood smelling these while he waited in the hotel parlor for the ladies to whom he had sent his card. He turned at the sound of drifting drapery, and could not forbear placing the hyacinths in the hand of Miss Florida Vervain, who had come into the room to receive him. She was a girl of about seventeen years, who looked older; she was tall rather than short, and rather full,--though it could not be said that she erred in point of solidity. In the attitudes of shy hauteur into which she constantly fell, there was a touch of defiant awkwardness which had a certain fascination. She was blonde, with a throat and hands of milky whiteness; there was a suggestion of freckles on her regular face, where a quick color came and went, though her cheeks were habitually somewhat pale; her eyes were very blue under their level brows, and the <b>lashes</b> were even <b>lighter</b> in color than the masses of her fair gold hair; the edges of the lids were touched with the faintest red. The late Colonel Vervain of the United States army, whose complexion his daughter had inherited, was an officer whom it would not have been peaceable to cross in any purpose or pleasure, and Miss Vervain seemed sometimes a little burdened by the passionate nature which he had left her together with the tropical name he had bestowed in honor of the State where he had fought the Seminoles in his youth, and where he chanced still to be stationed when she was born; she had the air of being embarrassed in presence of herself, and of having an anxious watch upon her impulses. I do not know how otherwise to describe the effort of proud, helpless femininity, which would have struck the close observer in Miss Vervain.|$|R
