5|$|Minimum {{processing}} requirements {{also became}} {{an issue in the}} Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). Dunderdale announced {{in a speech to the}} St. John's Board of Trade in May 2013, that the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the Muskrat Falls project nearly fell apart because of MPRs. She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the {{development}} of {{the first phase of the}} Lower Churchill Project—Muskrat Falls. Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> for Muskrat Falls. The <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would reduce the cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development. During a campaign stop in St. John's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b> On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b> While Oliver stated the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would be in place by the end of November 2011, it was not until November 30, 2012 that the <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> was finalized. In a simultaneous news conference held in St. John's and Halifax on December 17, 2012, Dunderdale and Emera Inc. announced they had both officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls hydro development.|$|E

Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority (GEDCA) gave a $800,000 <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> to producer John F. S.

5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b> The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of {{producer}} John F.S. Laing and director Albert Pyun, the Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority gave an $800,000 <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> to Laing and his company Guam Motion Pictures Company (GMPC) to secure a third party loan from Comerica Bank in order to finance the film. GMPC was created by Laing on Guam to produce Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon, while Laing's stateside company, Rigel Entertainment, was to handle distribution. GMPC was also supposed to produce a further theatrical film and two travel documentaries. In June 2006, Laing defaulted on the loan to Comerica and the guarantee was forfeited. The rights to the film were subsequently auctioned by Comerica. A newly formed Canadian company, Up North Entertainment, Inc., bought the film for $83,000. Laing was listed as one of three directors of Up North Entertainment. Guam's share of the foreclosure sale money was $9,090.|$|E

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the recession, the UK {{government}} lead calls to stimulate aggregate demand. Throughout 2008, a number of fiscal measuresincluding a £145 tax cut for basic rate (below £34,800 pa earnings) tax payers, a temporary 2.5% cut in Value Added Tax (VAT), £3billion worth of spending brought forward from 2010 and a £20billion Small Enterprise <b>Loan</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Schemewere introduced. The cost of these measures, most of which were announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees. Further measures worth £5billionincluding training for the young unemployed and a car scrappage scheme which offered a £2,000 subsidy for the purchase of a new car in exchange for the scrapping of a car more than 10 years oldwere announced in the 2009 budget.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E
5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's authorization of a $535million <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth. The company ceased all business activity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.|$|E
