5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in <b>light</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E

40|$|Capsule When {{moonlight}} {{levels are}} low, shearwaters and storm-petrels {{are attracted to}} artificial lighting at night at St Kilda and may be killed, but impacts are lessened by deliberate light reduction measures. Aims To determine the scale and impacts of attraction of petrels to artificial lights at St Kilda, investigate influences of the lunar cycle, and assess effects of reducing artificial <b>light</b> <b>emissions.</b> Methods Nightly numbers of Manx Shearwaters Puffinus puffinus, Leach's Storm-petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa and European Storm-petrels Hydrobates pelagicus attracted by artificial lights were recorded in September and October from 2005 to 2008. Effects of experimental reductions to <b>light</b> <b>emissions</b> in 2007 and 2008 were assessed, together with variation in annual moonlight, mortality rates, and age of birds found. Results Reductions to <b>light</b> <b>emissions</b> caused a decrease in numbers of Leach's Storm-petrels attracted, but had less effect on attraction of Manx Shearwaters. Only juveniles were found, the majority after nights {{with little or no}} moonlight, and mortality was extremely infrequent. Only one European Storm-petrel was found, and Leach's Storm-petrel and Manx Shearwater totals were small compared with estimated breeding totals at St Kilda. Conclusions Numbers of petrels attracted to artificial lights on St Kilda were low. However, reductions to <b>light</b> <b>emissions</b> were still beneficial in reducing numbers of young that became disorientated, grounded, or died during fledging periods. Therefore, reductions to <b>light</b> <b>emissions</b> should be encouraged. A review of this phenomenon across the UK found it to be rare in breeding areas away from St Kild...|$|R

5|$|Mycena polygramma, {{commonly}} known as the grooved bonnet, is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. The inedible fruit bodies are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical caps, pinkish gills. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally coniferous trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M.polygramma contains two uncommon hydroxy fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose intensity of <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> follows a diurnal pattern.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of <b>light</b> <b>emission.</b> SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E

Second, we compared the text output with that of "Angry Birds" - a popular top 100 "App Store" game. Finally, we measured the impact of two strategies that attempt to reduce the output of short-wavelength <b>light</b> <b>emissions.</b> The first strategy employed an inexpensive commercially available pair of orange-tinted "blue-blocking" glasses.

Both the orange-tinted glasses and the "sleep-aware" app significantly reduced short-wavelength emissions. CONCLUSION: The LE devices tested were all bright and characterized by short-wavelength enriched emissions. Since this type of light is likely to cause the most disruption to sleep as it most effectively suppresses melatonin and increases alertness, {{there needs to be}} the recognition that at night-time "brighter and bluer" is not synonymous with "better.

25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage of}} neon for instructional laboratories {{is that the}} tube can be used at room temperature. However, the wavelength of the visible emission is much longer than predicted by the Bohr relation and the 18.7 V interval. A partial explanation for the orange light involves two atomic levels lying 16.6 eV and 18.7 eV above the lowest level.

25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous <b>light</b> <b>emission</b> of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of Zeeman's discovery soon became apparent. It confirmed Lorentz's prediction about the polarization of light emitted {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field.

25|$|Cathodoluminescence, the {{emission}} of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons {{return to their}} ground state, is analogous to UV-induced fluorescence, and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena.
