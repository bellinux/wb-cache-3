Digital badges might be particularly useful as part of a formative assessment process, providing constant feedback and tracking of what has been learned and what the next step might be. Massive online open courses (MOOCs) and e-assessments, can be used to deliver content at scale, while providing structured points for formative assessment, connections to learning communities, and new possibilities for strengthening individual agency in the learning process.

40|$|There is now {{a plethora}} of Massive Open On-line courses (MOOCs) offered worldwide. Whilst many MOOCs focus on discipline-specific content, little {{attention}} has been paid to how MOOCs can explicitly help participants develop generic employability skills such as communication, digital literacy, global citizenship and the like. Similarly little attention been paid to explicitly assuring the quality of MOOCs with respect to alignment with regulatory body standards. Deakin University 2 ̆ 7 s first MOOC, DeakinPrimer, is an introduction to humanitarian responses to 21 st century disasters. It has been designed to assist participants to explicitly evidence generic or employability skills, some of Deakin 2 ̆ 7 s eight Graduate Learning Outcomes (GLOs) including communication, digital literacy, critical thinking and global citizenship. Other key features of DeakinPrimer include opportunities for networking with fellow participants and experts within the humanitarian field, and the opportunity to apply for credit towards the Graduate Certificate in International Community Development (level 8 in the Australian Qualifications Framework [AQF]) and for those with a prior Bachelor degree, the Masters in Humanitarian Assistance or the Masters of International Community Development (level 9 in the AQF). DeakinPrimer is designed as a test bed for a learning innovation, particularly micro-credentialing GLOs using digital badges to enable self and peer endorsement of evidence of <b>learning.</b> <b>Badging</b> is integrated in two ways. Firstly, DeakinPrimer participants build portfolios of learning artefacts associated with learning activities, then assess their work against a set of holistic, generic learning outcomes standards rubrics. If they judge their evidence as meeting the required standard, they can claim a badge (self endorsement) associated with particular GLOs. Secondly, participants can request and provide peer feedback and endorsement (using peer badges). The integration of self and peer review in the assessment tasks helps participants develop important employability skills, the ability to critically self-reflect on their own work and critically analyse the work of others and provide evidence-based feedback. DeakinPrimer is scheduled to commence in July 2013. This paper explains the way in which the course curricula has been designed to use technologies to enable participants to curate evidence of learning, and self and peer endorse such learning against defined standards...|$|R

The observed data consists of pairs (yi,θi), where each yi represents the (` 2 -normalized) tf-idf vector for the content of document i, and θi is an approximate badge vector for the users who share document i. Specifically, we approximate θi by taking each of the readers of document i, and assume a uniform distribution over the badges each of them declares {{in his or her}} profile. We then estimate θi by aggregating over document i’s readers. For example, we consider an article i that was shared on Twitter by two users: • Alice’s Twitter profile contains the badges “liberal ” and “feminist”; • Bob’s Twitter profile contains the badges “liberal, ” “football ” and “German. ” In this case, we would assume Alice is half-liberal and half-feminist, while Bob is one third each: liberal, football and German.

50|$|Online or digital badges are not {{dissimilar}} to {{the concept}} of the Europass CV. Open badges do however challenge the existing practices in a more radical manner, in that the process is much more decentralized and removed from the traditional quality assurance bodies:A digital badge is an online representation of a skill you’ve <b>learned.</b> Open <b>Badges</b> take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations. And because the system is based on an open standard, you can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell the complete story of your achievements - both online and off. Display your badges wherever you want them on the web, and share them for employment, education or lifelong learning.A key criticism of open badges, such as those developed by Mozilla, is that they lack a credible quality assurance component. On the positive side, open badges are free and allow for the inclusion of various forms of learning, including non-formal and informal learning.|$|R

50|$|Merit badges are awards {{earned by}} youth {{members of the}} Boy Scouts of America (BSA), based on {{activities}} within an area of study by completing a list of periodically updated requirements. The purpose of the merit badge program is to allow Scouts to examine subjects {{to determine if they}} would like to further pursue them as a career or vocation. Originally, the program also introduced Scouts to the life skills of contacting an adult they hadn't met before, arranging a meeting and then demonstrating their skills, similar to a job or college interview. Increasingly, though, merit badges are earned in a class setting at troop meetings and summer camps.Each merit badge has a pamphlet (booklet) published by the Boy Scouts of America associated with it; the pamphlet contains information on completing the requirements for the badge.

30|$|Most {{students}} {{who took part in}} the online survey rated themselves to be competent in all three dimensions of OLR (social competencies with their teachers, with their fellow students and technical competencies). They considered themselves to be active and believed that they would take the initiative in starting conversations or sharing ideas with their fellow students. They found themselves to be competent in online written communication with their instructors. These results are in line with previous researches (Hung et al., 2010; Roper, 2007; Salaberry, 2000). Despite the high levels of OLR, some students in the amotivated group reported that they felt unable to start friendships or initiate conversations in online environments. They behaved appropriately to their categorized regulation type and acted rather passively. A lower assessment for the dimensions of communication was associated with less autonomous motivation. The dimension of technical competencies was confirmed as a variable associated with autonomous motivation. These findings are in line with results of Kim and Frick (2011) or Sølvberg (2003). To summarize, a certain level of OLR is necessary for satisfactory results in regards to learning in a gamified online <b>learning</b> environment with <b>badges</b> and progress bars.|$|R

I reviewed the requirements for each badge and discussed potential changes that could improve their quality. This was accomplished through a series of steps within the reviewing process. I looked at completion time, necessary education level, and relevance of information for each merit badge. The requirements may have parts changed or requirements may be added to the badge to improve their content. The field of wildlife biology covers nine of the 132 obtainable merit badges. My thesis covers five of these nine: Plant Science, Mammal Study, Bird Study, Reptile and Amphibian Study, and Fish and Wildlife Management.

40|$|Awarding badges to {{recognise}} {{achievement is}} nothing new. Of late, badging has gone digital, offering {{new ways to}} recognise learning and motivate learners, providing evidence of skills and achievements both within and beyond formal <b>learning</b> contexts. <b>Badging</b> (or ‘soft accreditation’) has been piloted in various forms by the Open University (OU) in 2013, both in discrete projects and elsewhere on open courses and employer-led initiatives. This paper outlines what the OU has learned from its pilot projects and details how the University is subsequently developing a suite of badges for informal and formal students that align with employability and the OU’s existing skills-related open educational resources (OER). The OU’s badging pilots are informed by recent research (Perryman, Law and Law, 2013; Law, Perryman and Law, 2013) into the motivations and demographic profile of learners using the free educational resources which the OU makes available through its OpenLearn and iTunes U platforms. The research findings had indicated that {{a substantial number of}} informal learners using the OU’s free content do so for work and/or professional development and that learners are eager to have their informal learning achievements recognised in some way. The research also provided evidence that OpenLearn is providing a bridge to formal learning in several different respects, suggesting that the addition of badging could strengthen this bridge. The evaluation of the 2013 pilots indicated that learners who achieved badges were highly motivated by the experience and that the badged courses attracted learners who were particularly inclined to become students. The evaluation has subsequently informed the development of a further project to deliver a suite of free, open courses of 24 -hours learning, each of which are assessed through the deployment of a set of Moodle quizzes. To mitigate perceived risks to the sector and the University of providing a badged OU curriculum on a bite-sized scale, badges are limited to employability and skills development. The badged courses will be provided free of charge to the learner and those achieving badges will be encouraged to display them through their public-facing profile on the OpenLearn website. The badged content will be evaluated for its efficacy to motivate and develop informal learners and to provide employability skills for OU students. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate academic interest in the topic and will be of interest to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) globally and open up the discussion around developing a known currency of non-accredited learning...|$|R
30|$|Surprisingly, {{although}} {{more than three-quarters}} of the participants could be attributed to autonomous motivation, low values in overall affinity towards online and computer games were observed in this sample. Even though learners indicated that they do not particularly enjoy playing online or computer games, this does not seem to necessarily imply that these students do not enjoy gamification. However, this is surprising, since gamification is per definition the use of game-like elements in non-game settings as discussed earlier. The significant correlation that was found between the affinity for online and computer games and study-satisfaction in the dimension of coping might be explained by the three basic needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness of the SDT. These psychological needs are fulfilled in the autonomous forms of motivation (intrinsic and identified motivation) which facilitates students’ self-regulated learning, performance and well-being (Niemiec & Ryan, 2009). However, these needs accomplish the same effect when playing video games (Rigby & Ryan, 2011) and therefore, it might be explained that autonomously perceived motivation is associated with study satisfaction in the dimension of coping in the context of <b>learning</b> with <b>badges</b> and progress bars. None {{of the students in the}} survey could be matched to extrinsic motivation, since the participation in the gamification concept was a voluntary activity and there were no external pressure on the students to participate in the gamification concept. This fact shows that the construct of regulation types worked as expected in the study and hence, only autonomous motivation or amotivation types were found to be applicable. Autonomous motivation could be noted in more than three-thirds of the participants. This motivation type represents a high-quality learning and was supported with badges and progress bars. In revealing the students’ different motivation types, it was possible to explain the motivational behavior for self-regulated learning in the gamified learning environment at hand. These important findings underline the fact that motivational aspects are important key requirements for meaningful online learning. There was a high to very high agreement of all types of motivational regulation to study-satisfaction within the gamified learning environment. Hence, the surveyed students are satisfied with their academic studies and their online learning. Study-satisfaction is a relevant factor for universities as it raises the attractiveness of higher education institutions (Gremler & McCollough, 2002). It is also a major outcome variable in assessing teaching interventions associated with student persistence (Park & Choi, 2009; Lee & Choi, 2013). A high level of satisfaction with studies increases the persistence of learners in achieving their intended learning goals (Deci & Ryan, 1993) or in completing their studies.|$|R
40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) {{education}} can positively impact {{the success of}} an ERP implementation. Incorporating new tools and technologies into the learning process can potentially alleviate the evident problems with ERP education. Blended learning and e-learning environments both offer opportunities for improvement in education. However, there are various factors and components {{that need to be}} in place for such an environment to be successful. The aim of this research is to provide an ERP e-Learning Environment (ERPeL) that can assist with ERP education in terms of creating an integrated and comprehensive learning environment for novice ERP users. In order to achieve this aim, this study followed the Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology which is specific to educational technology research and was applied in iterative cycles where various components of the environment were evaluated by different participants. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected by means of field studies (interviews, focus groups and questionnaires). The proposed ERPeL underwent several iterations of feedback and improvement. In order to determine the success of e-learning, various critical success factors and evaluation criteria were investigated. Field studies were conducted in order to validate the theory in a real-world context. An initial field study was conducted with third year Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) students who were enrolled in the 2014 ERP systems’ module in the Department of Computing Sciences. Many of the problems identified in theory were found to be prevalent in the real-world context. One of the DBR process cycles involved the implementation of specific components of the ERPeL at the Developing and Strengthening Industry-driven Knowledge-transfer between developing Countries (DASIK) introduction to ERP systems course. Participants were either NMMU students, academic staff or industry delegates. The components evaluated included videos, <b>learning</b> content, <b>badges,</b> assessment and the SYSPRO Latte m-learning application. Additional components of a leader board, live chats, peer reviewing, expert reviews, user generated content, consultancy with experts and SYSPRO ERP certification were implemented in the subsequent cycle where participants were 2015 third year NMMU ERP systems students. The criteria used to evaluate the success of the ERPeL and its e-learning components were adapted from literature and a new set of evaluation criteria for e-learning was proposed. The ERPeL is made up of Moodle, the SYSPRO ERP System, the SYSPRO e-Learning System, the SYSPRO Latte m-learning application, learning content and components. Overall the ERPeL was positively received by the various sample groups. The research results indicate that the use of an e-learning environment for ERP systems was positively received. The most positive aspects reported were the implementation of e-learning components such as the interactive videos, simulations and m-learning.

40|$|Abstract Background Badges enable {{academic}} and non-academic learners {{to collect and}} display their achievements and to enhance their training and qualification repertoire. To support engagement in class-based and online modules we have introduced badge ecosystems backed up by University quality assurance procedures. This paper presents two case studies which exemplify the application of badges at the University of Derby and the possibilities for future developments of badge ecosystems. Class-based: Forensic anthropology/Osteology A sequence of badges in the Forensic Anthropology module was implemented to support students as they develop their understanding of osteology and anatomy. In this context, the implementation of badges relies {{on the use of}} learning outcomes that support learning and the assessment of practical knowledge as well as student’s ability to observe key features in the subject. Online MOOCs The University of Derby (UoD) have incorporated badges in a series of MOOCs that include: “Bridging the Dementia Divide: Supporting People Living with Dementia (2015); Digital. Me: Managing your Digital Self (2015); Operations Management (2016); a re-run of Supporting People Living with Dementia (2016) and Autism, Asperger’s and ADHD (2016). Throughout these, badges were used to reward degrees of completion and have an association with a favourable average completion rate across four of the MOOCs. The use of badges at the University has been led by academics staff and the Innovation Hub as part of a Badges Working Group. The innovative approaches to badges and badge ecosystems have been supported by the development of a University infrastructure for badge development including: •	Schema to back-up micro-credentialing •	Quality assurance processes and •	University badge server The UoD Working Badges Group and Quality Assurance The use of digital badges supported by the University’s quality framework means that we are rewarding meaningful <b>learning,</b> have increased <b>badge</b> credibility with our own badge server for issuing badges. In this way we have assured the integrity of the badges not just being University of Derby by branding but through the University as the issuing organization. Conclusion The UoD has incorporated badges to provide recognition for the learning, achievements and contributions of our class-based and MOOC learners, and the credibility of our badges will increase further as we move towards further implementation by academics and departments through the use of the badge framework. This could allow our digital credentials to be used by partners and other educational institutions and will act as an incentive for the UoD to continue its focus on badge development, quality and credibility...|$|R
