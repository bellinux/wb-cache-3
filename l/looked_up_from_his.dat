2500|$|At first {{all went}} well. Panjandrum {{rolled into the}} sea and began {{to head for the}} shore, the Brass Hats {{watching}} through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began to lurch ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Santa Claus {{had three}} tiny, poorly {{maintained}} A-frame buildings painted to represent peppermint candies. American writer Mark Winegardner described Santa Claus {{at that time}} as being on its last legs. Additionally, Winegardner noted in his 1988 book Elvis Presley Boulevard: From Sea to Shining Sea, Almost, that"Styrofoam silver bells, strands of burned-out Christmas lights and faded plastic likenesses of Old Saint Nick garnished this little village. A lopsided, artificial twenty-foot tree whistled in the wind beside a broken Coke machine and an empty ice freezer. Two of the three buildings were padlocked; through their windows, encrusted with layers of sand and decade-old aerosol snow, ... I saw dusty, overturned fiberglass statuettes of elves and reindeer. Alongside the SANTA CLAUS, ARIZONA/ESTABLISHED 1937 sign was another: FOR SALE BY OWNER/$52,500/INQUIRE AT GIFTSHOP. An arrow pointed the way.""The gift shop stocked no seasonal items. Its shelves were littered with flea-market [...] at antique-shop prices. Battered paperbacks cost a buck. What little money the place generated must {{have come from the}} short-ordered grill and the soft-drinks cooler. On a stool behind the countertop cash register, a haggard, fiftyish man <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> circle-the-word puzzle and asked if we needed anything." ...|$|E
