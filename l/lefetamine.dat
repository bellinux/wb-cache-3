50|$|UWA-001 is {{structurally}} {{related to}} the diarylethylamines <b>lefetamine</b> (a stimulant and opioid) and the dissociative anesthetic ephenidine, which acts as a NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Some related pyrrylphenylethanones had analgetic {{activity}} {{comparable to}} morphine. Some pyrrole analogues {{were reported to}} have analgesic effects comparable to <b>lefetamine</b> and being devoid of neurotoxic properties.|$|E
5000|$|Dioxaphetyl {{butyrate}} (INN; {{trade names}} Amidalgon, Spasmoxal) is an opioid analgesic {{which is a}} diphenylacetic acid derivative, related to other open-chain opioid drugs such as dextropropoxyphene, levacetylmethadol (LAAM), <b>lefetamine</b> and dimenoxadol.|$|E
50|$|Ephenidine (also {{known as}} NEDPA and EPE) is a dissociative {{anesthetic}} {{that has been}} sold online as a designer drug. It is illegal in some countries as a structural isomer of the banned opioid drug <b>lefetamine,</b> but has been sold in countries where {{it is not yet}} banned.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was amended in 2016 {{to include}} the {{substance}} as a Schedule III substance. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 3 years imprisonment. Further, Health Canada amended the Food and Drug Regulations in May, 2016 to classify <b>Lefetamine</b> as a controlled drug.|$|E
50|$|MT-45 (IC-6) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug invented in the 1970s by Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. It is chemically a 1-substituted-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine derivative, which is structurally unrelated to most other opioid drugs. Racemic MT-45 has around 80% {{the potency of}} morphine, with almost all opioid activity residing in the (S) enantiomer (the opposite stereochemistry from the related drug <b>lefetamine).</b> It {{has been used as}} a lead compound from which a large family of potent opioid drugs have been developed, including full agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists at the three main opioid receptor subtypes.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, <b>lefetamine,</b> levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|A case of <b>lefetamine</b> abuse (0. 9 - 1. 8 g/day in 15 - 30 i. m. divided doses) is reported. In this patient, the {{administration}} of naloxone precipitated a mild opiate-like withdrawal syndrome, characterized by mydriasis, piloerection, yawning and a slight increase of blood pressure. The complete withdrawal of <b>lefetamine,</b> substituted by a placebo regimen, aggravated these symptoms. Furthermore, experimental results showed that <b>lefetamine</b> induced a naloxone-reversible inhibition of the guinea-pig ileum contractile response to electric field stimulation, and that naloxone pretreatment of mice prevented <b>lefetamine</b> antinociceptive activity in the hot-plate test. The clinical and experimental findings suggest that <b>lefetamine</b> has an opiate-like activity...|$|E
40|$|In mice <b>lefetamine,</b> at {{the dose}} of 50 mg/kg {{produces}} motor hyperactivity {{and at the}} dose of 60 mg/kg produces analgesia. Both effects are abolished by naloxone. Displacement studies by using [3 H]-Naloxone (Nx), [3 H]-D-Ala-Met-Enkephalinamide (DAMA) and [3 H]-Ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) showed that <b>lefetamine</b> competes with all these opiates with an affinity 50 times {{lower than that of}} morphine. The displacing capacity of <b>lefetamine</b> is decreased in the presence of 50 mM Na+. It is concluded that <b>lefetamine</b> is an opioid agonist...|$|E
40|$|With the aim {{to split}} the {{pharmacological}} properties of <b>lefetamine</b> (CAS 14148 - 99 - 3), some structural modifications of this compound have been studied. The basic group of <b>lefetamine</b> has been shifted from the alkyl chain to the vicinal phenyl ring and the N-substitution has been changed. The dimethylaminomethyl derivatives and chiefly the o-morpholinometyhl exhibited a strong anti-visceral chemical antinociception activity stripped of thermal antinociception properties and physical dependence liability. Furthermore, through {{the introduction of a}} diethylaminomethyl group in the <b>lefetamine</b> structure some derivatives were selected exhibiting besided {{a significant increase in the}} anti-visceral chemical antinociception activity, remarkable local anesthetic properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of various pyrrylphenylethanones resembling cathinone and <b>lefetamine</b> is described starting from 2 -chloro- 1 -(1 -methyl- 1 H-pyrrol- 2 -yl) - 2 -phenylethan- 1 -one. Some derivatives showed good antinociceptic activity, {{comparable to that}} of morphine. The neuropsychopharmacological profile of title compounds has been also studied to explore their action on C.
