Methods All 665 active male workers of a metal processing factory were the study population. Semi-quantitative measures of exposure were estimated from a job exposure matrix constructed with industrial hygienist scoring and job titles. Ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa were identified with standardized clinical dental exams. Results Past exposure to acid mists were positively associated with ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa but only among workers without <b>lip</b> <b>sealing</b> (age- and alcohol consumption-adjusted prevalence ratio (PR), PRadjusted¼ 3. 40; 90 % CI: 1. 48 – 7. 85). Also in this worker group, the mixture of acid mists and acid gases was associated with ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa limited to exposure in the past (PRadjusted¼ 2. 83; 90 % CI: 1. 12 – 7. 17).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} certain facial {{and dental}} characteristics by comparing individuals with labial incompetence and individuals withpassive labial sealing. Method: The study analyzed fifty lateral teleradiographs of which 25 were of subjects with labial incompetence, with minimum opening of 4 mm, and 25 of subjects with labial sealing, {{none of the}} subjects having undergone orthodontic treatment, all being between 15 and 30 years of age, irrespective of gender and malocclusion, with slight tendency towards vertical growth. The following cephalometric variables were used: Nfp – Nfa {{with the objective of}} determining the width of the upper airway, Sn – St to measure the length of the upper lip, Sn –IIs for the vertical length of the maxilla and 1. NA to determine the inclination of the maxillary incisor. Results: The measurements obtained in the group of passive <b>lip</b> <b>sealing</b> (G 1) and labial incompetence (G 2) respectively, were as follows: 14. 12 mm (G 1) and 12. 76 mm (G 2) for width of the upper airway; 24. 24 mm (G 1) and 23. 80 mm (G 2) for the length of the upper lip; 26. 92 mm (G 1) and 28. 64 mm (G 2) for the vertical length of the maxilla and 26. 76 º (G 1) and 30. 76 º (G 2) for the inclination of themaxillary incisor.

40|$|Drooling is the {{uncontrolled}} leakage {{of saliva}} outside the mouth, generally {{as a result}} of difficulty in swallowing the saliva produced. Many factors contribute to drooling, though it is more commonly seen in children with brain paralysis - particularly those receiving anticonvulsivant medication. Drooling is also often seen in patients with <b>lip</b> <b>sealing</b> problems or malocclusions such as anterior open bite. Clinically, the affected patients can develop skin irritation or abrasions, problems of hygiene, unpleasant smell and - in the more severe presentations - the need to wear protectors or frequently change clothing. Treatment of this disorder is complex, and should be addressed from a multidisciplinary perspective, with planning on an individualized basis. Among the different existing managements, myofunctional therapy, behavioral change programs and drug treatments are the most widely used options, though there are also more invasive surgical techniques designed to reduce or cause submandibular saliva secretion to be rerouted towards posterior zones of the oral cavity. In any case, no scientific evidence-based management protocol has yet been established capable of affording favorable results in the majority of cases.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the inter-rater agreement for the clinical dysphagia scale (CDS). Method Sixty-seven subjects scheduled {{to participate in}} a video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) were preexamined by two raters independently within a 24 -hour interval. Each item and the total score were compared between the raters. In addition, we investigated whether subtraction of items showing low agreement or modification of rating methods could enhance inter-rater agreement without significant compromise of validity. Results Inter-rater agreement was excellent for the total score (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) : 0. 886). Four items (<b>lip</b> <b>sealing,</b> chewing and mastication, laryngeal elevation, and reflex coughing) did not show excellent agreement (ICC: 0. 696, 0. 377, 0. 446, and κ: 0. 723, respectively). However, subtraction of each item either compromised validity, or did not improve agreement. When redefining ‘history of aspiration ’ and ‘lesion location’ items, the inter-rater agreement (ICC: 0. 912, 0. 888, respectively) and correlation with new videofluoroscopic dysphagia score (PCC: 0. 576, 0. 577, respectively) were enhanced. The CDS showed better agreement and validity in stroke patients compared to non-stroke patients (ICC: 0. 917 vs 0. 835, PCC: 0. 663 vs 0. 414).

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence of facial alterations, dental malocclusions, and deleterious oral habits (DOH) among adolescents in a developing area in northeastern Brazil and {{to test the hypothesis}} that the occurrence of DOH in infancy is associated with DOH during adolescence. The study included a probabilistic population-based sample of 2, 060 Brazilian students aged 12 - 15 years. Facial characteristics (type of facial profile, facial symmetry, and passive <b>lip</b> <b>sealing)</b> and malocclusions (Angle and Dental Aesthetic Index, DAI) were evaluated. DOH in infancy and adolescence were evaluated by interviews with the parents and adolescents. Most adolescents presented with normal facial characteristics. The malocclusion prevalence (Angle) was 83 %. The DAI ranged from 13 to 69 (mean ± SD: 25. 9 ± 7. 7). Orthodontic treatment was necessary in 45. 1 % of the sample. The most prevalent DOH in adolescents were nail biting, object biting, cheek/lip biting, and bruxism, which were associated with finger sucking during infancy (P < 0. 05). We conclude that malocclusions and DOH are common among Brazilian adolescents and that finger sucking during infancy may be a good predictor of DOH occurrence during adolescence...|$|E

40|$|The rotary <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> is {{the most}} widely used dynamic seal. It is used {{extensively}} in the automotive and appliance industries. Experimentally, {{it is well known that}} the microasperities on the shaft surface can significantly affect the performance of a <b>lip</b> <b>seal,</b> even though the shaft roughness, after run-in, is much smaller than the lip roughness. In the present study, several deterministic numerical models are developed to investigate the effect of shaft surface finish on rotary <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> behavior, through an understanding of the basic physics of <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> operation. This project is performed in a step by step manner with gradually increasing complexity. Four models are included in this study: hydrodynamic analysis, elastohydrodynamic analysis for full film lubrication, mixed-EHL model for mixed lubrication with asperity contact, and transient dynamic mixed-EHL model for startup and shutdown processes. Those analyses allow the examination of some important seal characteristics, such as the load support sharing between hydrodynamic and contact pressure, contact and cavitation area ratio, reverse pumping rate, liftoff speed for tracing the liftoff process and average film thickness. The development of fluid, contact and cavitation areas as a result of the changing operation condition is also examined. The results of the present deterministic modeling indicate that shaft surface roughness can produce significant desirable effects on <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> behavior. An appropriate shaft surface profile could improve the sealing ability and prevent seal failure. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Richard F.

Our objectives were to establish feasible methodologies of eating capability assessment, examine correlations between hand and oro-facial muscle strengths and grade elderly subjects into groups based on their eating capabilities. This study was performed with 203 elderly subjects living in UK (n= 103, 7 community centres, 2 sheltered accommodation) and Spain (n= 100, 3 nursing homes, 1 community centre). Hand gripping force, finger gripping force, biting force, <b>lip</b> <b>sealing</b> pressure, tongue pressing pressure and touching sensitivity were measured for elderly subjects. Measured parameters were normalised and scored between 1 to 5, with 1 being the weakest. Subjects were then grouped into 4 groups based on their eating capability scores, being participants of cluster 1 the weakest group and 4 the strongest. Perception of oral processing difficulty was assessed by showing food images. Hand gripping force showed a strong linear correlation with tongue pressure (UK: 0. 35; Spain: 0. 326) and biting force (UK : 0. 351; Spain: 0. 427). Biting force was strongly dependent on the denture status. Elderly {{of the first three}} groups perceived food products with more hardness and/or fibrous structure as difficult to process orally. The objective measurements of various physiological factors enabled quantitative characterisation of the eating capabilities of elderly people.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityAccording to the Department of Energy (DOE), there exist many challenges in the commercialization of all fuel cells related to among other things the cost of manufacturing components, of particular interest, polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM). Unfortunately, due to variations in material properties, stringent quality requirements (e. g. dimensional accuracy, no holes), and non-standardized geometry, conventional manufacturing approaches may not be suitable for newer membrane solutions. Implementation of new, innovative, and/or customized conventional manufacturing processes to fuel cell membrane production can offer significant cost reductions, flexibility and repeatability to the fuel cell industry. This research presents a design methodology, the science, and technology to develop a PEM membrane casting system, The unique design methodology to develop a manufacturing casting system entails: 1) receiving input from material developer and end users; 2) gathering chemical, mechanical, and physical fluid properties 3) understanding the material's characteristics and behavior; 4) developing and evaluating system concepts; 5) prototyping and modeling (analytically and numerically) individual components and the system; 6) developing a detailed system design; 7) building and testing the system to compare analytical models to experimental data and; 8) optimizing the hardware and system based on comparison results. Using the aforementioned methodology, a case study involving development of a closed membrane casting system to cast high temperature PEM membrane solutions for an industrial proprietor has been performed. It was found that novel membrane solutions can be made into film uniformly and continuously using slot die casting.

40|$|Die Standardlösung zur Abdichtung von Wellen im Maschinenbau sind Radial-Wellendichtringe (RWDR) aus Elastomeren. Allerdings stoßen Elastomer-Werkstoffe in vielen Anwendungen an ihre Belastungsgrenzen. Durch Einsatz von PTFE-Compounds als Dichtungswerkstoff können die Einschränkungen von Elastomeren weitgehend überwunden werden. Daher werden in der Dichtungstechnik immer häufiger Manschettendichtungen aus PTFE-Compounds (PTFE-MD) eingesetzt. Im Gegensatz zu Elastomer-RWDR sind bei PTFE-MD Rückförderstrukturen (RS) erforderlich, um die dynamische Dichtheit zu gewährleisten. Für Anwendungen mit festgelegter Drehrichtung der Welle gehören PTFE-MD mit Spiralrille zum bewährten Stand der Technik. Die Spiralrille als RS ist aber nur für eine Drehrichtung der Welle geeignet. Bei wechselnder Wellendrehrichtung werden andere RS verwendet. Es gibt zwar bereits funktionierende PTFE-MD mit RS für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, allerdings sind diese noch im Erforschungsstadium und weisen Optimierungspotenziale auf. Trotz des hohen potenziellen Nutzens für Dichtungsanwender durch die Verfügbarkeit von optimierten PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, gibt es kaum Fortschritte seitens der Dichtungshersteller. Dies liegt im Wesentlichen daran, dass die entsprechenden Funktionsmechanismen nicht hinreichend bekannt sind. Ohne Kenntnis der genauen Funktionsmechanismen ist eine gezielte Optimierung nicht möglich. Daher muss mit hohem experimentellem Aufwand durch „Versuch und Irrtum“ optimiert werden. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es einen Beitrag zum besseren Verständnis der dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, zu leisten. Dabei liegt das Hauptaugenmerk der Arbeit auf der numerischen Untersuchung der nachfolgenden Zusammenhänge. • Analyse des Strömungsverlaufs und der Druckverteilung um RS und im Dichtspalt. Dies dient einem besseren Verständnis der Vorgänge im Bereich des Dichtspalts. • Untersuchung unterschiedlicher Einflüsse auf das Umlenk- und Fördervermögen von RS. Ziel ist dabei die Identifikation von relevanten Einflussgrößen auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. • Analyse des Förderverhaltens durch den hydrodynamischen Dichtspalt und durch lokale Erhöhungen des Dichtspalts. • Betrachtung der Einflüsse der Dichtspaltgeometrie auf den Förderwert einer PTFE-MD mit RS. • Untersuchung der Auswirkungen von Geometrievariationen am Übergang einer RS in den geschlossenen Ring auf das Druckaufbauvermögen und damit auch indirekt auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. Durch ein besseres Verständnis der obigen Zusammenhänge können die dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS besser nachvollzogen werden. Hieraus lassen sich besonders wirkungsvolle Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Fördervermögens und damit der dynamischen Dichtsicherheit von PTFE-MD mit RS ableiten. Damit ist eine effektivere Optimierung möglich, wodurch der experimentelle Aufwand bei der Weiterentwicklung von PTFE-MD mit RS reduziert werden kann. The common {{solution}} for sealing shafts {{in mechanical engineering}} is the usage of radial shaft seals made of elastomers. However elastomers encounter load limits in many applications. Through the application of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) compounds as sealing material, the limitations of elastomers can be largely overcome. Therefore the usage of <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE compounds is becoming more common in sealing technology. In contrast to the elastomeric radial shaft <b>seals</b> PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> require special pumping structures to ensure their dynamic tightness. For applications with a fixed direction of shaft rotation PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with a spiral groove as pumping structure are established as state of the art. The spiral groove as pumping structure is only suitable for one direction of shaft rotation. For alternating directions of shaft rotation other pumping structures are used. Although functioning PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures for both directions of shaft rotation are already in existence, these {{are still in the}} research stage and there is potential for optimization. Despite the high potential benefit for users through the availability of optimized PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation, there is little progress by the seal manufacturers. The main reason for lack in progress is deficient knowledge about the functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Without knowing the exact functional mechanisms targeted optimization is hardly possible. Therefore optimization of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures requires high experimental effort and is accomplished by "trial and error". The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation. The focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of the following topics. • Analysis of the flow pattern and pressure distribution around pumping structures and in the sealing gap. This serves a better understanding of the processes in the region of the sealing gap. • Investigation of various influences on the deflection and pumping ability of pumping structures. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters for the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. • Analysis of the pumping behaviour through the hydrodynamic sealing gap and through local elevations of the sealing gap. • Exploration of the influences of the sealing gap geometry on the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. • Investigation of the effects of geometry variations in the transitional area between pumping structures and the continuously closes ring, which is necessary for static tightness. The geometry of this area is crucial for pressure build-up and thus indirectly for the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Through a better understanding of the above topics, the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures are described more accurately than before. This allows to identify especially effective measures to improve the pumping ability and thus the dynamic sealing reliability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. The mentioned measures imply a more efficient optimization, whereby the experimental effort in the advancement of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} methodology is described, conceived {{to support}} the design of an air-lubricated <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> for pneumatic actuators. The aim of the work was to measure the very narrow gap occurring between a new radial sealing device and the counterpart during working conditions, when compressed air in the sealed volume detaches the mating surfaces, causing a small and controlled leakage flow. A spring energized <b>lip</b> <b>seal,</b> suitably assembled, was chosen as case on study and a Fizeau interferometer was employed to measure the leakage path thickness. In order to compare leakage data, numerical simulations were carried out {{by means of a}} commercial CFD code on the gap geometries defined during experiments. The achieved results are presente...|$|R

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the rotary union is the seal. The seal {{prevents}} the medium from leaking outside the rotary union while in operation. Seal types can vary from pusher-type end face mechanical seal, non-pusher type end face mechanical <b>seal,</b> <b>lip</b> <b>seals,</b> and o-ring seals.

50|$|Radial shaft seals, {{also known}} as <b>lip</b> <b>seals,</b> are used to seal rotary elements, such as a shaft or {{rotating}} bore. Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump seals, axle seals, power steering seals, and valve stem seals. Early radial shaft seals utilized rawhide as the sealing element, and many elastomeric seal companies today once were tanneries. The advent of modern elastomers replaced rawhide, industry also added a garter spring which helps the <b>sealing</b> <b>lip</b> compensate for lip wear and elastomer material changes.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} radial force (interface) {{produced}} by interference on the static contact properties and frictional {{characteristics of a}} radial <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> are investigated by experimentally. For this reason, a test system has been developed. In this test system, a cylinder is placed on four load cells in order to monitor the friction torque generated between seal and counter face. A group of experiments are carried out with thermoplastic polyurethane radial <b>lip</b> <b>seals.</b> Three different inner diameters (40, 39. 80 and 39. 60 mm) are selected and the seals are tested under 0. 5 and 0. 3 bar for a short period. The frictional torque was measured and compared for different inner diameters. As a result, {{it is observed that}} the amount of interference effects seal friction torques based on seal material and seal design in different ratios. ...|$|R
