5|$|Coatbridge is {{especially}} {{noted for its}} historical links with Ireland. This is <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> large scale immigration into the town from Ulster (especially from County Donegal) in the 19th century and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century. Indeed, the town has been called 'little Ireland'.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{much to the}} nation's surprise, the Hanshin Tigers {{faced the}} Seibu Lions and took their first and only victory in the Japan Series, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the efforts of star slugger Randy Bass (presently State Senator from Oklahoma), an American playing for the team.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Forbes named PewDiePie as the highest-earning YouTuber {{with his}} annual income {{reaching}} $15 million.

5|$|Under Aleksandr I, the {{administration}} of the merchant-controlled company was transferred to the Imperial Navy, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the alarming reports by naval officers of native abuse; in 1818, the indigenous peoples of Alaska were granted civil rights equivalent to a townsman status in the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|About 100 tonnes of {{dysprosium}} {{are produced}} worldwide each year, with 99% of that total produced in China. Dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010. The price increased to $1,400/kg in 2011 but fell to $240 in 2015, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste is <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated {{by refusing to}} sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis. The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Sea was {{released}} in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey's work on the film.

5|$|Blue's Clues premiered in the U.S. on September 8, 1996. It was a smash hit, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the producers'extensive research, {{and became}} crucial to Nickelodeon's growth. Within 18 months of its premiere, Blue's Clues was as {{well-known}} as more established children's {{shows such as}} the 30-year-old Sesame Street. It became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television. By 2002, 13.7 million viewers tuned in each week.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{lost the}} 1925 election, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his stance on {{industrial}} relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign.

5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns.

5|$|During World War II, {{the defense}} buildup in Mobile shipyards {{resulted}} in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, <b>largely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the massive influx of workers coming {{to work in the}} shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.|$|E

Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province.
