50|$|From its {{designation}} in 1957 until 1972, I-95 in Portsmouth did not {{connect to}} I-95 in Kittery, Maine. Instead, the expressway ended at the Portsmouth Circle. From there motorists {{had to use}} US 1 Bypass and go over the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge to the junction near the Kittery Circle with US 1. This bridge was what connected the New Hampshire and Maine Turnpikes. It is a drawbridge over the Piscataqua waterway, which would create an obvious problem. Not only would this be an obstacle to traffic, but the bridge was a narrow three-lane undivided roadway where the center lane could either {{be used in the}} direction of the greatest traffic flow or left closed for greater safety. <b>Lane</b> <b>identification</b> was accomplished via repeated banks of three traffic lights, one over each lane, and is the reason for the third (center) traffic light that is no longer used on the now two-lane bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} {{aspect of}} the system runs on standard home computer hardware and {{can be linked to}} other applications or databases. It first uses a series of image manipulation techniques to detect, normalize and enhance the image of the number plate, and then optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the alphanumerics of the license plate. ANPR systems are generally deployed in one of two basic approaches: one allows for the entire process to be performed at the lane location in real-time, and the other transmits all the images from many lanes to a remote computer location and performs the OCR process there at some later point in time. When done at the lane site, the information captured of the plate alphanumeric, date-time, <b>lane</b> <b>identification,</b> and any other information required is completed in approximately 250 milliseconds. This information can easily be transmitted to a remote computer for further processing if necessary, or stored at the lane for later retrieval. In the other arrangement, there are typically large numbers of PCs used in a server farm to handle high workloads, such as those found in the London congestion charge project. Often in such systems, there is a requirement to forward images to the remote server, and this can require larger bandwidth transmission media.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the safety of driving under {{different}} visibility meteorological conditions on the expressway, this paper analyses the composition and operation principle of the expressway lane departure warning and navigation system based on machine vision. And an effective <b>lane</b> mark <b>identification</b> algorithm suiting for different visibility situations is proposed. Firstly the image contrast between the expressway lane and its background is increased by using histogram equalization technology, improving detecting range of lanes and accuracy. Secondly the edges in the lane directions are detected by utilizing specific Sobel operator. In order to suit for different visibility situations and improve detecting efficiency, the method of maximum classes square error is applied to threshold segmentation. Finally, lane is abstracted according to expressway lane features after image Hough transform. Based on <b>lanes</b> <b>identification,</b> this paper designs a navigation algorithm of driving direction. This algorithm performs driving direction navigation decisions according to two characteristic parameters which are deviation angle and deviation distance.

40|$|Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is {{a popular}} Global Positioning System (GPS) {{processing}} strategy, thanks to its high precision without requiring additional GPS infrastructure. Single-Frequency PPP (SF-PPP) takes this one step further by no longer relying on expensive dual-frequency GPS receivers, while maintaining a relatively high positioning accuracy. The use of GPS-only SF-PPP for <b>lane</b> <b>identification</b> and mapping on a motorway has previously been demonstrated successfully. However, the performance was shown to depend strongly {{on the number of}} available satellites, limiting the application of SF-PPP to relatively open areas. We investigate whether the applicability can be extended by moving from using only GPS to using multiple Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Next to GPS, the Russian GLONASS system is at present the only fully functional GNSS and was selected for this reason. We introduce our approach to multi-GNSS SF-PPP and demonstrate its performance by means of several experiments. Results show that multi-GNSS SF-PPP indeed outperforms GPS-only SF-PPP in particular in case of reduced sky visibility. </p...|$|E

The study was developed at the Alt Penedès region, in Barcelona, during the 2006 and 2007 (on 3, 22, 69 fields respectively). The quality sensors set-up in year 2007, mounted on a New Holland SB 55 grape harvester, were: two load cells, one refractometer, an ambient temperature prove and a GPS antenna, while in 2006 only the load cells and the GPS performed properly. The method used for this study is as follows: 1. Data recording from GPS and Logger (the latter is use for according and digitalising the sensor signal); 2. Wireless download of data to a PC; 3. Automatic data integration in a single file; 4. <b>Lane</b> automatic <b>identification</b> based on trajectory angles, machine forward speed determination, effective time calculation, masic flow, kg/m, and total amount harvested, kg/hopper, computation of characteristic soluble solid content and temperature during harvest; 5.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) {{are used}} widely in the {{provision}} of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services. Today, there is an increasing demand on GNSS to support applications at lane level. These applications required at lane level include lane control, collision avoidance and intelligent speed assistance. In lane control, detecting irregular driving behaviour within the lane is a basic requirement for safety related lane level applications. There are two major issues involved in lane level irregular driving identification: access to high accuracy positioning and vehicle dynamic parameters, and extraction of erratic driving behaviour from this and other related information. This paper proposes an integrated algorithm for lane level irregular driving identification. Access to high accuracy positioning is enabled by GNSS and its integration with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) using filtering with precise vehicle motion models and <b>lane</b> information. The <b>identification</b> of irregular driving behaviour is achieved by algorithms developed for different types of events based on the application of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS).

40|$|Number of lanes {{is a basic}} roadway {{attribute}} that {{is widely}} used in many transportation applications. Traditionally, number of lanes is collected and updated through field surveys, which is expensive especially for large coverage areas with a high volume of road segments. One alternative is through manual data extraction from high-resolution aerial images. However, this is feasible only for smaller areas. For large areas that may involve {{tens of thousands of}} aerial images and millions of road segments, an automatic extraction is a more feasible approach. This dissertation aims to improve the existing process of extracting number of lanes from aerial images automatically by making improvements in three specific areas: (1) performance of lane model, (2) automatic acquisition of external knowledge, and (3) automatic <b>lane</b> location <b>identification</b> and reliability estimation. ^ In this dissertation, a framework was developed to automatically recognize and extract number of lanes from geo-rectified aerial images. In order to address the external knowledge acquisition problem in this framework, a mapping technique was developed to automatically estimate the approximate pixel locations of road segments and the travel direction of the target roads in aerial images. A lane model was developed based on the typical appearance features of travel lanes in color aerial images. It provides more resistance to “noise” such as presence of vehicle occlusions and sidewalks. Multi-class classification test results based on the K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms showed that the new model provides a high level of prediction accuracy. ^ Two optimization algorithms based on fixed and flexible lane widths, respectively, were then developed to extract number of lanes from the lane model output. The flexible lane-width approach was recommended because it solved the problems of error-tolerant pixel mapping and reliability estimation. The approach was tested using a lane model with two SVM classifiers, i. e., the Polynomial kernel and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The results showed that the framework yielded good performance in a general test scenario with mixed types of road segments and another test scenario with heavy plant occlusions. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{advanced}} motorway {{traffic control}} requires lane-specific observations, and provide vehicles with lane-specific control measures. Single-Frequency Precise Point Positioning (SF-PPP) was previously demonstrated to provide sub-meter accurate positions in real-time using a low-cost mass-market receiver and patch antenna. Next to an accurate current {{position of the}} vehicle, accurate maps of the lanes of the motorway are also needed to identify in which lane the vehicle is actually driving. Theoretical derivations indicate that the lanes of the motorway can in fact be mapped using the same SF-PPP results {{from a number of}} previous runs over the motorway. In this paper the proposed technique is tested in practice and a map of the lanes of a motorway is created. To this end, a vehicle equipped with a mass-market GPS device runs 100 times up and down a stretch of the A 13 motorway between Delft and Rotterdam in the Netherlands (approximately 5. 5 km each direction, in total for 100 runs about 17 hours of driving). A detailed assessment {{of the quality of the}} SF-PPP solution is presented in this paper. The errors in each of the horizontal directions are smaller than 1. 1 meters in 95 % of the epochs. The root-mean-square error (rmse) in these directions is in the order of 50 cm. A moderate bias in the cross track direction is observed, which could be a result of multipath from the vehicle itself (given the fact that the antenna is located asymmetrically on the roof, close to the right side of the vehicle). However, despite this bias, and given the fact that lanes on Dutch motorways are 3. 5 meters wide, the availability of a SF-PPP <b>lane</b> <b>identification</b> system would be about 99 % for this dataset.

40|$|With {{little to}} no {{experience}} using a Document Management System (DMS), Brunswick management is concerned that adopting a DMS will increase development and maintenance time, thereby increasing our time to market with new releases, bug-fixes, and/or service packs. It is {{the intent of this}} project to prove that the extra amount of time documenting our systems will ultimately provide a benefit to Brunswick by saving time during the maintenance phase which, will last for many years after the initial launch. And as an added benefit of this project, a specific DMS tool has been identified and evaluated throughout this project that will fulfill our immediate needs or can at least serve as a benchmark for another vendor. The Scorer Configuration Utility project was chosen to highlight the benefits of a DMS. In part, because this is a typical case where knowledge of the processing that must take place has been lost as personnel have left the organization. This loss of knowledge has cost Brunswick an indeterminable amount of money over the years and will continue to increase cost as long as a DMS is not a part of our culture. The Scorer Configuration Utility project provides a means to format the scorer registry settings, via a USB connection, before they are installed. This will speed up the replacement time by pre-configuring the hard-drive prior to installation. Now, the pinsetter type, overhead display type, console password, <b>lane</b> <b>identification,</b> IP Address, and Server name can all be configured prior to installing a hard-drive. I describe in detail how the Vector Plus server interacts with the scorers registry which control/manage eight lanes of bowling each. I go on to describe how the registry settings specify how the scorers interact with peripheral devices such as the pinsetters, overhead displays, and the lane consoles and that incorrect registry settings render these devices non- functional. I used a DMS tool from Aligned Elements to create all of the documents that I would like to see in future projects. I created Specifications, Requirements, Use Cases, and Test Cases. I also recorded all of the registry settings for each condition/combination of specific peripheral devices. The Aligned Elements tool offers a clear advantage in terms of document management. The tool is easy to use, intuitive, and it provides a structure that makes sense when grouping information like requirements, specifications, use cases, test cases, etc. I wrote the application using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with the C# programming language.
