5000|$|... 1880-1920 — The [...] "Oil and Whiting" [...] {{method of}} crack {{detection}} {{is used in}} the railroad industry to find cracks in heavy steel parts. (A part is soaked in thinned oil, then painted with a white coating that dries to a powder. Oil seeping out from cracks turns the white powder brown, allowing the cracks to be detected.)

50|$|Welds may {{be tested}} using NDT {{techniques}} such as industrial radiography or industrial CT scanning using X-rays or gamma rays, ultrasonic testing, <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing,</b> magnetic particle inspection or via eddy current. In a proper weld, these tests would indicate a lack of cracks in the radiograph, show clear passage of sound through the weld and back, or indicate a clear surface without penetrant captured in cracks.|$|E
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the weld bead {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a weld bead that does not start {{at the root of}} the weld groove. Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, electrode angle, and electrode manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. Slag inclusions, undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and slag inclusions are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by <b>Liquid</b> <b>Penetrant</b> <b>Testing</b> (Dye check). Slag inclusions and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|E

50|$|NDT methods may {{rely upon}} use of {{electromagnetic}} radiation, sound, and inherent {{properties of materials}} to examine samples. This includes some kinds of microscopy to examine external surfaces in detail, although sample preparation techniques for metallography, optical microscopy and electron microscopy are generally destructive as the surfaces must be made smooth through polishing or the sample must be electron transparent in thickness. The inside of a sample can be examined with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons or terahertz radiation. Sound waves are utilized {{in the case of}} ultrasonic testing. Contrast between a defect and the bulk of the sample may be enhanced for visual examination by the unaided eye by using liquids to penetrate fatigue cracks. One method (<b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing)</b> involves using dyes, fluorescent or non-fluorescent, in fluids for non-magnetic materials, usually metals. Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either liquid or dry dust) that are applied to a part while it is in an externally magnetized state (magnetic-particle testing). The particles will be attracted to leakage fields within the test object, and form on the objects surface. Magnetic particle testing can reveal surface & some sub-surface defects within the part.Thermoelectric effect (or use of the Seebeck effect) uses thermal properties of an alloy to quickly and easily characterize many alloys. The chemical test, or chemical spot test method, utilizes application of sensitive chemicals that can indicate the presence of individual alloying elements. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical fatigue crack sensors, utilize the tendency of metal structural material to oxidize readily in order to detect progressive damage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> (PT) methods {{represent}} a multi-process procedure and require substantial time costs, which decrease the testing efficiency. Therefore the both problems, the optimization of all technological stages of PT {{and the search}} for additional possibilities to increase the efficiency of PT, are of principal importance. Some results of investigations, which enable increasing the efficiency of PT are presented: development of up-to-date means for quantitative evaluation of product families ’ sensitivity; thermal actions to intensify PT; optimization of PT technological stages and others. The widely used <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> is a reliable, high-sensitive non-destructive method to detect surface discontinuities. The method is based on a whole complex of physical processes. Therefore, both to optimize the technological process of PT and to develop new, high-sensitive product families (penetrant, remover and developer) one needs to establish quantitative description of physical correlation between these processes.

40|$|AbstractSpent fuel {{reprocessing}} for Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) requires a dissolver {{made of a}} material which is resistant to corrosion as the process involves nitric acid as the process medium. The focus was {{on the use of}} advanced materials with high performance in high concentrations (greater than 8 N) and high temperatures of nitric acid employed in the dissolver. The commercially available materials like SS 316 l, titanium, Ti – 5 % Ta, and Ti – 5 % Ta – 1. 8 % Nb were tried and the corrosion behavior of these materials was studied in detail. It was also decided to try out Zircaloy – 4 as the material of construction due to its excellent corrosion resistance in nitric acid environment. The specifications were stringent and the geometrical configurations of the assembly were very intricate. On accepting the challenge of fabricating the dissolver, NFC made different fixtures for electron beam (EB) welding and TIG welding. Trials were carried out for optimization of various operating parameter for EB welding & TIG welding process es, which were qualified by radiography, <b>liquid</b> dye <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing,</b> and metallographic, mechanical and chemical analys es. Finally the dissolver was subjected to helium leak test. The tests conducted at IGCAR with Zircaloy dissolver assembly revealed that Zircaloy- 4 exhibited the superior corrosion resistance over all other materials tried out so far for this purpose. The results clearly indicates that Zircaloy – 4 is a near-zero corrosion material in comparison to the other materials. It is thus demonstrated that the dissolver assembly for spent {{fuel reprocessing}} for Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) can be manufactured from Zircaloy - 4 on an industrial scale, with long life expectancy with near zero corrosion, employing EB & TIG welding processes...|$|R
