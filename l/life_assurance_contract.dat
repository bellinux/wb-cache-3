Many {{types of}} public goods can be {{produced}} privately by profit seeking entrepreneurs using a modified form of <b>assurance</b> <b>contract,</b> called a dominant <b>assurance</b> <b>contract.</b> I model the dominant <b>assurance</b> <b>contract</b> as a game and show that the pure strategy equilibrium has agents contributing to the public good as a dominant strategy. The game is also modelled under incomplete information as a Bayesian-Nash game. Economics gives invisible hand explanations for complex phenomena. Economics explains how Paris is fed {{without the aid of}} central planning and bureaucratic direction. Many economists argue, however, that central planning and bureaucratic direction are necessary to produce public goods. I show that at least some types of public goods {{can be produced}} privately by profit seeking entrepreneurs. Section one introduces the idea of an <b>assurance</b> <b>contract</b> and discusses, without making rigorous, the set of equilibria in an <b>assurance</b> <b>contract</b> game. A new and more powerful form of <b>assurance</b> <b>contract,</b> called a dominant <b>assurance</b> <b>contract,</b> is introduced and analyzed in section two. I show that an entrepreneur can design a contract where the equilibrium ha...|$|R

40|$|In naming his satirical {{version of}} a <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> company The Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and <b>Life</b> <b>Assurance</b> Company Dickens was aiming at an already {{well-established}} tendency for <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> companies to stress in their promotional enterprises the altruistic character of their business. So disinterested was the Anglo-Bengalee that 'nobody can run any risk by the transaction except the office, which, in its great liberality is pretty sure to lose' (1994 : 419). While few <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> companies would have pushed the claim that far it is certainly {{the case that the}} idea of 'disinterestedness' played a peculiar role in the nineteenth century <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> industry. This paper explores how <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> companies sought to overcome concerns about the safety and propriety of their business by promulgating particular ideas about <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> as a pious, self-ï¿½disinterested' form of conduct. Throughout the nineteenth century <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> operated as an exemplary technique of liberal government by offering a means of market-based self-rule that depended heavily on an emergent form of knowledge which blended together impartiality, self-interest and disinterestedness (Poovey, 1998) ...|$|R

5000|$|In Cases E-15/15 and 16/15, Vienna Life and Swiss Life, the Court {{ruled on}} the {{interpretation}} of Directive 2002/83/EC concerning <b>life</b> <b>assurance.</b> It held that Article 36(1) of the Directive does not address legal transactions according to which an existing unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> policy is transferred via a purchase agreement {{from one person to}} another where the insured risk, namely the insured person, under the assurance policy remains the same. Furthermore, a transfer of a unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> policy does not constitute a change in the policy conditions under Article 36(2) unless the terms of an assurance policy are also amended, thereby altering the balance of rights and obligations of the parties to an <b>assurance</b> <b>contract.</b> With regard to the referring court’s further questions on specific information duties under the Directive, the Court found, first, that if a “change in the policy conditions” within the meaning of the Directive has taken place, the referring court needs to consider whether the information listed in Annex III(B)(b)(2) was provided to the second-hand policy holder in a clear, accurate and complete manner and in an official language of the EEA State of commitment. Second, it is of no significance for the information obligation of the assurance undertaking whether the former policy holder was an undertaking and the new policy holder is a consumer, unless this difference has led to an amendment to the terms of the <b>assurance</b> <b>contract.</b> Neither is it of significance whether or not the original policy holder disclosed information about himself so that his own risk or investor profile could be assessed. As to the referring court’s question whether Annex III to the Directive has been correctly transposed into Liechtenstein law, the Court held that directives must be implemented into the national legal order of the EEA States with unquestionable binding force and the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty. Furthermore, national courts are bound to interpret national law in conformity with EEA law. Under Article 34 SCA, the Court has jurisdiction to give advisory opinions on {{the interpretation of}} the EEA Agreement upon the request of national courts. After the Court has rendered its judgment, it falls to the referring court to interpret national law in light of the Court’s findings. In cases where a harmonious interpretation of national law is not sufficient to achieve the result sought by the relevant EEA rule, that matter can be brought before the Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 31 SCA.|$|R

40|$|Life Insurance {{contract}} is that under which one party pays a certain {{sum of money}} referred to as premium to another party in return on the happening of specified contingency (ices). These contingencies include: deaths, maturity, surrender lapsed and paid-up. These however, operate simultaneously as mutually exclusive events that impinge negatively on the <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> portfolio. Most <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> policyholders complain of the adverse effect of inflation on the policy values {{at the time of}} payment on the happening of the contingencies. This has resulted in a high rate of lapse, surrender and conversion to paid-up status. This study therefore, investigates the effects of these multiple decrements on <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> portfolios, which resulted in the hypothesis propounded and tested in this research. Based on the findings, the study recommends that life insurance companies should enlighten the public more on the benefits of <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> and evolve some incentives so as to avoid the negative impact of these modes of decrement on <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> portfolios. </p...|$|R
