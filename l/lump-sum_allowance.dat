30|$|The third {{scheme is}} the {{full-time}} time-credit (crédit temps à temps plein). People {{of all ages}} can interrupt their career {{for a period of}} one year if they have worked for the same employer for at least 12 months out of the 15 last months. The period of full-time time-credit can be extended up to 5 years by means of collective agreements at the sectoral level. People on full-time time-credit receive a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>allowance</b> from the National Office for Employment to compensate partially the loss of salary. Workers {{at the end of their}} career can then use this scheme right before being eligible for other routes toward early withdrawal. It should be mentioned that a specific scheme, the part-time time-credit, allows workers above the age of 50 and with 5 years full-time within the same firm, to reduce working time either by 20 % or by 50 % until the age of statutory retirement. The resulting loss of salary is partially offset by a lump-sum (generous) allowance from the National Office for Employment.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, Labor Standards Act (Act No. 49 of 1947) {{provides}} that an employer must provide an expectant mother worker with maternity leave for 6 weeks (14 weeks for multiple pregnancy beyond twins) before her child birth and 8 {{weeks after the}} child birth. Article 9 of Equal Employment Opportunity Act between Men and Women (Act No. 113 of July 1, 1972) prohibits unequal employment condition for the reasons of marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave provided in Article 65 of Labor Standards Act and other reasons related childbirth. These unequal employment conditions includes retirement, dismissal. In addition, Act on the Welfare of Workers Who Take Care of Children or Other Family Members Including Child Care and Family Care Leave (Act No. 76 of 1991) {{provides that}} employees {{has the right to}} take unpaid child care leave for one year, and Article 10 prohibits for an employer to dismiss or disadvantageously treat a worker who have taken or is about to take Child Care Leave. asAlthough Maternity Leave and Child Care Leave are basically unpaid leave, Basic Childcare Leave Benefits are provided based on Employment Insurance Act during Child Care Leave and Maternity <b>Allowance</b> and <b>Lump-sum</b> Childbirth <b>Allowance</b> are given based on Health Insurance Act (Act No.70 of 1922). Basic Childcare Leave Benefit is 50% of the employee's wage, and Maternity Allowance is two thirds of the wage. As of 2013, <b>Lump-sum</b> Childcare <b>allowance</b> is ¥420,000 (US$4,075).|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} established European Globalization Fund (EGF) is {{an attempt}} to better share the benefits of globalisation at the EU-level, targeting workers who loose their job due to trade-induced mass lay-offs. We find that the typical income shock for trade displaced workers is a serious one. However, workers displaced not through trade suffer a similar income shocks. We argue that the trade focus and the centralization at EU level may be justified on political economy grounds because trade policy is also decided at the EU level. But current EGF rules leave too much room for discretionary decisions. Therefore, we propose that the EGF focus on two simple active labour market schemes: a wage insurance scheme and <b>lump-sum</b> mobility <b>allowances.</b> JEL Classification: F 00, F 16, J 62. globalization, unemployment, European Globalization Fund...|$|R
