My husband, his uncle, and I know not how many more, were already on the steps. M. de Nidemerle solemnly embraced me and bade me welcome, presenting me {{at the same time}} to a gentlemen, in crimson velvet and silver, as my brother. My foolish heart bounded for a moment as if it could have been Eustace; but it was altogether the face of a stranger, except for a certain fine smile <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> It was, of course, my half-brother, M. le Baron de Solivet, who saluted me, and politely declared himself glad to make the acquaintance of his sister.|$|R

50|$|Commenting on 12+3 Paul Hoover said: The {{poetry of}} Thanh Thao deals beautifully in {{the mystery of}} {{presence}} and absence, of past and present: “I come again / to the well / its perfectly rounded sky / and the tree’s oblique shadow / <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>mothers</b> shape.” He writes with great intensity and longing about his experience of childhood, the war with the United States, and the passing of time. A boat floats to an empty space; stars crowd into a puddle of water. But despite all the terror and exhaustion of life, {{there is always the}} promise of homecoming and restoration, as leaf after leaf is added to its branch. His poetry is a lesson to me of the eternal and existential condition of life beyond the supposed limits language and culture. We are always getting lost, and poetry, like love, is a light in that darkness.|$|R

6000|$|What Selina {{had said}} {{of me and}} my mother's portrait, other friends had said.

6000|$|In reading, nothing goes to {{my heart}} like any true account of a mother and son's love for one another, such as we find in that true book I have already spoken of in a former chapter, Serge Aksakoff's History of my Childhood.

Reading the {{incidents}} he records of his mother's love and pity for all in trouble and her self- sacrificing acts, I have exclaimed: [...] "How <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother!</b> It is just how she would have acted!"
