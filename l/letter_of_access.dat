Methods Australian GPs (n = 14, 000) were randomly selected and assigned to seven intervention groups, with each receiving a different letter. Seven different strategies were used to encourage GPs to accept an offer of two years free access to an online evidence-based resource (BMJ Clinical Evidence). The first group received a standard <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> offer with no experimental demands. Groups two to seven received a standard <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> offer outlining {{the requirements of the}} study. They were asked to complete an initial online questionnaire, agree to complete a 12 -month follow-up questionnaire, and agree to having data about their usage of the online evidence-based resource provided to researchers. Groups three to seven also had additional interventions included in the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> offer: <b>access</b> to an online tutorial in use of the resource (group three); provision of a pamphlet with statements from influential opinion leaders endorsing the resource (group four); offer of eligibility to receive professional development points (group five); offer of eligibility for a prize of $ 500 for registration at a medical conference of their choice (group six); and a combination of some of the above interventions (group seven). Results In the group with no research demands, 27 % accepted the offer. Average acceptance across all other groups was 10 %. There was no advantage in using additional strategies such as financial incentives, opinion leader support, offer of professional development points, or an educational aid over a standard <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> offer to increase acceptance rates. Conclusion This study showed low acceptance rates of the offer <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the online resource when there was an associated requirement of response to a short online questionnaire and non-obtrusive monitoring of GP behaviour in terms of accessing the resource. If we are to improve care and encourage evidence-based practice, we need to find effective ways of motivating doctors and other health professionals to take part in research that can inform our implementation efforts. </p...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> credit as {{a method}} of {{smoothing}} international payment is a conditional security and obligation to pay the customer bank (issuing bank) to seller (applicant). For this purpose, the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit may be considered as the most usual method of payment of goods price in international trade. The classic form <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit is the commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit whose financial obligation is rooted in the documents that demonstrates the making of transaction by the beneficiary and it is used as a mechanism of payment and financial security in international transaction of goods. Contrary to commercial <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit which is a payment document, standby <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit has been taken into account for protection of beneficiary in case of default of payment to perform obligation or payment. Standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit are equal to bank guarantee and issued as performance and obligation security and in the form <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit. This article with cmparison <b>of</b> commercial <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit and standby <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> credit is to review the similarities and differences of these two documents and the most important legal aspects of both are compared in order to answer this question that when and in which form each of these means are used in international trade by the parties...|$|R
