The consensus of their evidence was that the stricken plane was lower than usual compared with other aircraft approaching East Midlands, and that it was losing altitude as well as oscillating in both pitch and roll.

40|$|I will {{criticize the}} current logical {{analysis}} of attitudes due to J. Hintikka (1971) {{according to which}} human agents are either perfectly rational or completely irrational. I will present the principles of a general logic of first <b>level</b> <b>attitudes</b> and actions that accounts for our intentionality and imperfect but minimal rationality. First <b>level</b> <b>attitudes</b> and actions are attitudes and actions of individual agents at a single moment of time. In my approach psychological modes of propositional attitudes have other components than their basic Cartesian category of cognition and volition. I will formulate a recursive definition of the set of all psychological modes. I will also analyze the nature of complex first <b>level</b> <b>attitudes</b> such as conditional attitudes and sums and denegations of attitudes which are irreducible to propositional attitudes. My primary purpose here will be first to explicate inductively conditions of possession and of satisfaction of all first <b>level</b> <b>attitudes</b> and to integrate my logic of attitudes within a general theory of first level actions explicating the primacy of intentional actions, their conditions of success and fundamental laws of action generation. For that purpose I will use a non classical predicative propositional logic and consider subjective as well as objective possibilities. Agents of voluntary actions and illocutionary acts have intentions and other first <b>level</b> <b>attitudes.</b> I will explain why logically equivalent propositions are not {{the content of the}} same attitudes and intentional actions and why human agents are neither logically omniscient nor perfectly rational but always remain minimally rational in the exercise of thought and the use of language.

2500|$|Tanker 130 had {{departed}} the Minden, Nevada {{air attack base}} at 2:29p.m. PDT with [...] of fire retardant for its sixth drop of the day, and arrived at the fire at 2:45p.m. The crew, Steven Ray Wass, Pilot, 43 years; Craig LaBare, Co-Pilot, 37 years; Mike Davis, Engineer, 59 years, made an initial spotting pass over the drop zone, then flew back for the drop, {{which was to be}} a 1/2 salvo, dispensing half of the onboard retardant. The drop run required the aircraft to make a perpendicular crossing of a ridgeline and then descend into a valley. A video of the accident shows the aircraft crossing the ridge and then pitching down to begin its drop of the retardant. Near the end of the drop, the nose of the aircraft began to pitch up to <b>level</b> <b>attitude</b> as the descent was arrested. The nose continued to pitch up past <b>level</b> <b>attitude,</b> {{and at the end of}} the drop, the right wing began to fold upwards, followed less than one second later by the left wing. Two debris fields were found, one [...] in length and the other [...] in length. A post-impact fire in the first debris field consumed major portions of the wing and engine components; there was no fire in the second debris field, which included the fuselage and empennage.|$|E
