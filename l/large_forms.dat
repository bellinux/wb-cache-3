5|$|The {{discovery}} of Iguanodon {{has long been}} accompanied by a popular legend. The story goes that Gideon Mantell's wife, Mary Ann, discovered the first teeth of an Iguanodon in the strata of Tilgate Forest in Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, Sussex, England, in 1822 while her husband was visiting a patient. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients. Furthermore, he admitted in 1851 that he himself had found the teeth. Not everyone agrees that the story is false, though. It is known from his notebooks that Mantell first acquired large fossil bones from the quarry at Whitemans Green in 1820. Because also theropod teeth were found, thus belonging to carnivores, he at first interpreted these bones, which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton, as those of a giant crocodile. In 1821 Mantell mentioned the find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in the strata. However, in his 1822 publication Fossils of the South Downs he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very incomplete skeleton, presuming that his finds presented two <b>large</b> <b>forms,</b> one carnivorous ("an animal of the Lizard Tribe of enormous magnitude"), the other herbivorous. In May 1822 he first presented the herbivorous teeth to the Royal Society of London but the members, among them William Buckland, dismissed them as fish teeth or the incisors of a rhinoceros from a Tertiary stratum. On 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell showed some to Georges Cuvier, during a soiree in Paris, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros. Though the very next day Cuvier retracted, Lyell reported only the dismissal to Mantell, who became rather diffident about the issue. In 1824 Buckland described Megalosaurus and was on that occasion invited to visit Mantell's collection. Seeing the bones on 6 March he agreed that these were of some giant saurian— though still denying it was a herbivore. Emboldened nevertheless, Mantell again sent some teeth to Cuvier, who answered on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore. In a new edition that year of his Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles Cuvier admitted his earlier mistake, leading to an immediate acceptance of Mantell, and his new saurian, in scientific circles. Mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern-day parallel among extant reptiles. In September 1824 he visited the Royal College of Surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth. However, assistant-curator Samuel Stutchbury recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared, albeit twenty times longer.|$|E
25|$|With {{the high}} {{atmospheric}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} pressure, particularly during the Carboniferous, the primitive throat sac breathing would have been sufficient for obtaining oxygen even for the <b>large</b> <b>forms.</b> Getting rid of carbon dioxide would present a greater problem on land, and the larger labyrinthodonts probably combined a high tolerance for blood carbonic acid with returning to the water to dissipate the carbon dioxide through the skin. The loss of the armour of rhomboid scales of their piscine ancestors allowed for this as well as additional respiration through the skin as in modern amphibians.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the process}} of {{developing}} his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method. The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles as sharp as 45°, collectively allowing for the construction of very <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes goes far beyond traditional ceramics.|$|E
40|$|In many human tissues {{adenosine}} deaminase exists {{as a large}} molecular weight complex (<b>large</b> <b>form)</b> composed of {{adenosine deaminase}} and an adenosine deaminase binding protein. The molar ratio of adenosine deaminase to binding protein in this <b>large</b> <b>form</b> complex appears to be 2 : 1, respectively, based on several observations. Scatchard-type analysis of the binding of 125 I-labeled adenosine deaminase to purified binding protein indicates that 2. 15 mol of adenosine deaminase are bound to 1 mol of binding protein. Chemical cross-linking of 125 I-labeled adenosine deaminase-binding protein complex (<b>large</b> <b>form)</b> with glutaraldehyde produces 6 cross-linked species with molecular weights consistent with the proposed 2 to 1 stoichiometry. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses reveal a native molecular weight of 300 890 for the adenosine deaminase-binding protein complex (<b>large</b> <b>form),</b> 37 500 for small form adenosine deaminase, and 213 300 for the binding protein. A 2 : 1 molar ratio of adenosine deaminase and binding protein in the <b>large</b> <b>form</b> complex is most consistent with these molecular weight estimates...|$|R

25|$|With {{the close}} of the Palaeozoic, most of the Permian groups disappeared, with the {{exception}} of the Mastodonsauroid and Metoposaurid families and the curious Plagiosauridae, who continued into the Triassic. In the early Triassic these families enjoyed a brief renaissance in the waterways of continental shallows, with <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> like Thoosuchus, Benthosuchus and Eryosuchus. Their ecological niches were probably similar to those of modern-day crocodiles, as fish hunters and riverside carnivores. All groups developed progressively weaker vertebrae, reduced limb ossification and flatter skulls with prominent lateral line organs, indicating the late Permian/early Triassic temnospondyls rarely if ever left the water. An extremely large Brachyopid (likely a plagiosaur or a close relative) is estimated to have been 7 meters long, and probably just as heavy as the Permian Prionosuchus.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw {{something}} of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, {{as well as the}} hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.|$|E

He is surpassed only in melody, as are the others, by Walton, but not even by him in harmonic richness, nor by Tippett in contrapuntal originality and the expressive power of rather austere musical thought, nor by Rawsthorne in concise, compelling utterance and telling invention, nor by Rubbra in handling <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> well." ...|$|E

500|$|Bach {{used some}} musical forms which {{reappear}} in later cantatas. [...] For example, {{two of the}} choral movements have a fugue, a style of composition in which Bach excelled. Also, the two movements for soloists are developed {{as a type of}} chorale fantasia with the soloist singing the psalm text and an upper voice singing the chorale in long notes as a cantus firmus. [...] Craig Smith called the chorale settings [...] "a window on the future". However, he criticised the structure of the cantata, saying that it offers evidence that at this stage in his career the composer had difficulty with <b>large</b> <b>forms.</b> On the other hand, the musicologist Julian Mincham regards the piece as being different from later cantatas rather than inferior to them.|$|E
500|$|As temnospondyls {{continued}} to flourish and diversify in the Late Permian (260.4 - 251.0 Mya), a major group called Stereospondyli became {{more dependent on}} life in the water. The vertebrae became weak, the limbs small, and the skull large and flat, with the eyes facing upwards. During the Triassic period, these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems, evolving {{in a range of}} both small and <b>large</b> <b>forms.</b> During the Early Triassic (251.0 - 245.0 Mya) one group of successful long-snouted fish-eaters, the trematosauroids, even adapted to a life in the sea, the only known batrachomorphs to do so {{with the exception of the}} modern crab-eating frog. Another group, the capitosauroids, included medium- and large-sized animals [...] in length, with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as Mastodonsaurus. These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators, catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals.|$|E
500|$|Lundomys molitor {{is among}} the largest living oryzomyines, rivaled only by some <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> of Holochilus and Nectomys, but it is {{substantially}} smaller {{than some of the}} recently extinct Antillean species, such as [...] "Ekbletomys hypenemus" [...] and Megalomys desmarestii. Unlike in Holochilus brasiliensis, which occurs in the same area, the tail is longer than the head and body. It is sparsely haired and dark, and there is no difference in color between the upper and lower side. The coat, which is long, dense, and soft, is yellow–brown at the sides, but becomes darker on the upperparts and lighter on the underparts. The large hindfeet are characterized by conspicuous interdigital webbing, but they lack tufts of hair on the digits and several of the pads are reduced. As in some other semiaquatic oryzomyines, fringes of hair are present along the plantar margins and between some of the digits. The forefeet also lack tufts on the digits and show very long claws, a character unique among oryzomyines. The female has four pairs of teats, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of oryzomyines. The head and body length is , averaging , the tail length is 195 to 255mm (7.68 to 10.04mm), averaging , and the length of the hindfoot is , averaging [...]|$|E

2500|$|In an {{analysis}} of Parry's compositional process, Michael Allis draws attention to a widely held but inaccurate belief that Parry was a facile composer who dashed off new works without effort. He quotes the mid-20th century critics H C Colles and Eric Blom as equating Parry's supposed facility with superficiality. Allis also quotes Parry's diary, which regularly recorded his difficulties in composition: [...] "struggled along with the Symphony", [...] "thoroughly terrible and wearing grind over the revisions", [...] "stuck fast" [...] and so on. Parry himself is partly responsible for another belief about his music, that he was neither interested in nor good at orchestration. In a lecture at the RCM he was censorious of Berlioz who, in Parry's view, disguised commonplace musical ideas by glittering orchestration: [...] "When divested of its amazingly variegated colour [...] the ideas themselves do not convince us or exert much fascination." [...] Bax and others took this to mean that Parry (and Stanford and Mackenzie) [...] "regarded sensuous beauty of orchestral sound as not quite nice". [...] In 2001, the American writers Nicholas Slonimsky and Laura Kuhn took the view: [...] "In his orchestral music, Parry {{played a significant role}} in the fostering of the British symphonic tradition. While his orchestral works owe much to the German Romanticists, particularly Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, he nevertheless developed a personal style notable for its fine craftsmanship and mastery of diatonic writing. His 5 [...] reveal a growing assurance in handling <b>large</b> <b>forms.</b> He also wrote some effective incidental music and fine chamber pieces." ...|$|E

60|$|The most {{conspicuous}} instance of local modification of form, however, is {{exhibited in the}} island of Celebes, which in this respect, as in some others, stands alone and isolated in the whole archipelago. Almost every species of Papilio inhabiting Celebes has {{the wings of a}} peculiar shape, which distinguishes them at a glance from the allied species of every other island. This peculiarity consists, first, in the upper wings being generally more elongate and falcate; and secondly, in the costa or anterior margin being much more curved, and in most instances exhibiting near the base an abrupt bend or elbow, which in some species is very conspicuous. This peculiarity is visible, not only when the Celebesian species are compared with their small-sized allies of Java and Borneo, but also, and in an almost equal degree, when the <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> of Amboyna and the Moluccas are the objects of comparison, showing that this is quite a distinct phenomenon from the difference of size which has just been pointed out.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have my own}} {{very strong}} preconceptions here, and since my {{temperament}} is sanguine they necessarily colour my view. I believe that this impulse to collective service can satisfy itself only under the formula that mankind is one state of which God is the undying king, and that the service of men's collective needs is the true worship of God.

I do perceive a search for <b>large</b> <b>forms</b> into which the prevalent impulse to devotion can be thrown. But the organised religious bodies, with their creeds and badges and their instinct for self-preservation at any cost, stand between men and their spiritual growth in just the same way the forestallers stand between men and food. Their activities at present are an almost intolerable nuisance. One cannot say [...] "God" [...] but some tout is instantly seeking to pluck one into his particular cave of flummery and orthodoxy. What a rational man means by God is just God. The more you define and argue about God the more he remains the same simple thing. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, modern Hindu religious thought, all agree in declaring that there is one God, master and leader of all mankind, in unending conflict with cruelty, disorder, folly and waste. To my mind, it follows immediately {{that there can be no}} king, no government of any sort, which is not either a subordinate or a rebel government, a local usurpation, in the kingdom of God. But no organised religious body has ever had the courage and honesty to insist upon this. They all pander to nationalism and to powers and princes. They exists so to pander. Every organised religion in the world exists only to exploit and divert and waste the religious impulse in man.|$|E
