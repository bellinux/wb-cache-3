25|$|DMCA Title II, the Online Copyright Infringement <b>Liability</b> <b>Limitation</b> Act ("OCILLA"), {{creates a}} safe harbor for online service {{providers}} (OSPs, including ISPs) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements. OSPs must adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to alleged infringing material (or remove such material from their systems) when they receive notification of an infringement claim from a copyright holder or the copyright holder's agent. OCILLA {{also includes a}} counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of subpoenas against OSPs to provide their users' identity.|$|E
25|$|Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised Flickr for its heavy-handed {{implementation}} of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Online Copyright Infringement <b>Liability</b> <b>Limitation</b> Act (OCILLA). Under OCILLA, a service provider such as Flickr is obliged to delete or disable access to content {{as soon as they}} receive an official notice of infringement, to maintain protection from liability. After having one of his own pictures taken down following an incorrect DMCA claim, British comedian Dave Gorman researched the issue and concluded that if the Flickr user was not based in the United States – or they were but the person filing the notice of infringement was not – Flickr deleted the disputed content immediately. Even if the user could successfully demonstrate that the content did not infringe upon any copyright, Flickr did not, according to Gorman, replace the deleted content. He argued that this was contrary to its obligations in responding to a counter-notice. Shortly afterward, Flickr changed its policy.|$|E

YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement <b>Liability</b> <b>Limitation</b> Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted. Organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material. Viacom, demanding $1billion in damages, said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed [...] "an astounding 1.5billion times". YouTube responded by stating that it [...] "goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works".|$|E

50|$|Two years {{following}} the Torrey Canyon spill, an oil platform eruption in the Santa Barbara Channel made national headlines and thrust oil pollution into the public spot light.

The FWPA set specific <b>liability</b> <b>limitations.</b> For example, vessels transporting oil were liable only up to $250,000 or $150 per gross ton.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which online service {{providers}} can {{be held liable for}} copyright infringement committed by users of their services {{is one of the more}} complicated and contentious copyright issues of our day. Courts have struggled with how to apply common-law doctrines of secondary liability to online activity. Congress has enacted, in section 512 of the Copyright Act, <b>limitations</b> on the <b>liability</b> of service providers, but conditioned those limitations on a fairly complicated set of conditions. And technology continues to evolve and to raise new questions. This Essay examines one relatively new issue concerning the interaction between Congressional and judicial developments: how do the statutory <b>liability</b> <b>limitations</b> apply to the developing cause of action for inducing copyright infringement? Part I briefly introduces both the statutory regime and inducement liability, and then examines one court’s suggestion that the statute’s limits simply do not apply to claims for inducement. Part II argues that it is too early in the evolution of the law of inducement to categorically deny the possibility that the statute might limit liability for at least some claims of inducement...|$|R
