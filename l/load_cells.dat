40|$|In this paper, a bulk micromachined silicon <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> is presented, {{designed}} for loads up to 1000 kg. ANSYS simulations {{were used to}} determine the <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> dimensions and strain gauge positions. The <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> consists of two parts, which are bonded to each other using Low Temperature Silicon Direct Bonding processes (LTSDB). To isolate the membrane with the sensors from lateral displacements within the <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> (e. g. expansion due to compression) thin silicon springs are incorporated in the design. To make these springs, a cryogenic RIE process with a high selectivity for resist was developed.

50|$|Strain gauge <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> are {{the most}} common in industry. These <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> are {{particularly}} stiff, have very good resonance values, and tend to have long life cycles in application. Strain gauge <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> work on the principle that the strain gauge (a planar resistor) deforms/stretches/contracts when the material of the <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> deforms appropriately. These values are extremely small and are relational to the stress and/or strain that the material load cell is undergoing at the time. The change in resistance of the strain gauge provides an electrical value change that is calibrated to the load placed on the load cell.|$|E

A gas-filled pack on the lower conveyor (8) passes under and is compressed by {{the first and second}} conveyors (10 A, 10 B), in succession, the pack being detected by sensors (16) connected to a control unit (6) which causes the force required to displace the pack lid to be measured by a respective <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> (12 A, 12 B) at regular intervals of travel. A microprocessor determines from a comparison of the two force/displacement relationships so generated whether the pack leaks. In an alternative arrangement using just one <b>load</b> <b>cell,</b> the lid of the pack is displaced by a vertically reciprocal <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> whilst the <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> is moved along the packaging line by a chain drive moved at the speed of a pack by a stepper moter.

Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> and/or <b>loading</b> <b>cell</b> construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells.</b> Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines. Then, the use of the new high pressure double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> in production testing of instrumented shafts was described, and the efficacy of the new <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> was illustrated. The new <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> provided the profession with a <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> alternative for conducting BDLTs and should serve to help reduce the risk of post-test grouting defects in drilled shaft foundations...|$|R
