5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at {{the feet}} of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra merged with the image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra <b>longed</b> <b>for.</b> Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E
5|$|When Black's car is searched, it {{is clear}} it was never rigged with anything—Dees had planned the whole thing, knowing {{that he would be}} killed. As news reports spread {{concerning}} the bomber's identity and his death {{at the hands of the}} police, Black sees that Dees has achieved the fame he <b>longed</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Newton {{transferred}} to No.5 Service Flying Training School at Uranquinty. He found instruction frustrating, as he <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> a combat assignment. His fortunes changed in February 1942, {{when he was}} selected for the navigation course on Ansons at the General Reconnaissance School based at Laverton. From there {{he was sent to}} No.1 Operational Training Unit at Sale, Victoria, for conversion to Lockheed Hudson twin-engined light bombers during March and April.|$|E

5|$|The estate at Wierzchownia was isolated. Hańska {{was bored}} by {{visits to the}} court at St. Petersburg, and even more bored by noble guests in her own home. She found {{nothing in common with}} the ladies of high society, and <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> the {{stimulating}} discussions she had enjoyed with her brother Henryk. She spent her time reading the books her husband imported from faraway lands.|$|E
5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gang Toi was {{the first}} set-piece action between Australian and Viet Cong forces in the Vietnam War. Australian {{casualties}} included two missing (presumed killed) and six wounded, and {{despite the efforts of}} their comrades, the bodies of the Australian dead were unable to be recovered. Against these losses the Viet Cong had suffered at least six killed, one wounded and five captured. Confronted by an equal sized force, dug-in in well-prepared defences, the Australians had performed creditably enough even if they had been forced to withdraw, leaving the battlefield to the Viet Cong. Despite inflicting heavier casualties on the communists than they had suffered themselves, many of the Australians were depressed at having left two soldiers behind, and they <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> the opportunity to return to Gang Toi. In 2007, more than 40 years after the fighting, an Australian Vietnam veteran—Jim Bourke, MG—and a team of volunteers successfully located the remains of both Parker and Gillson. They had been hastily buried together in a weapon pit the day after the battle by Viet Cong soldiers, and {{with the assistance of the}} Australian and Vietnamese governments they were subsequently returned to Australia for burial.|$|E

But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|In 1887 Zitkála-Šá {{returned}} to the Yankton Reservation {{to live with her}} mother. She spent three years there. She was dismayed to realize that, while she still <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> the native Sioux traditions, she no longer fully belonged to them. In addition, she thought that many on the reservation were conforming to the dominant white culture.|$|E
25|$|As a young man, Russell had {{a decidedly}} {{religious}} bent, himself, {{as is evident}} in his early Platonism. He <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> eternal truths, as he makes clear in his famous essay, , widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.|$|E

25|$|Over-expansion without {{sufficient}} vetting {{of ownership}} groups {{was a huge}} factor {{in the death of}} the league. Once the league started growing, new franchises were awarded quickly, and it doubled in size in a few years, peaking at 24 teams.

25|$|Crowhurst {{was born}} in 1932 in Ghaziabad, British India. His mother was a school teacher and his father worked on the Indian railways. During her pregnancy, his mother had <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> a daughter, and Crowhurst was raised as a girl {{until the age of}} seven. After India gained its independence, his family moved back to England.

25|$|Devastated after Shelley's death, Mary {{returned}} to England. She paid for Clairmont {{to travel to}} her brother's home in Vienna where she stayed for a year, before relocating to Russia, where {{she worked as a}} governess from 1825 to 1828. The people she worked for treated her almost {{as a member of the}} family. Still, what Clairmont <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> most of all was privacy and peace and quiet, as she complained in letters to Mary Shelley.|$|E
25|$|Catherine <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> {{recognition}} as an enlightened sovereign. She pioneered for Russia {{the role that}} Britain later played {{through most of the}} 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war. She acted as mediator in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79) between the German states of Prussia and Austria. In 1780, she established a League of Armed Neutrality, designed to defend neutral shipping from the British Royal Navy during the American Revolution.|$|E

25|$|Fresh out of Cambridge, Maclean {{joined the}} Foreign Office {{and spent a}} couple of years at the Paris embassy. He loved the pleasures of life in the French capital, but {{eventually}} <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> adventure. Against the advice of his friends (and to the delight of his London bosses), he requested a posting to Moscow, which he received right away; once there, he began to learn Russian. Travelling within the Soviet Union was frowned upon by the authorities, but Maclean managed to take several trips anyway.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, McLane finally {{received}} the appointment {{he had so}} <b>longed</b> <b>for.</b> When U.S. President Andrew Jackson decided he needed to purge his Cabinet of supporters of U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun, the always helpful Martin Van Buren was able to convince the president to appoint McLane to be the Secretary of the Treasury. He returned from England and served as Secretary from August 8, 1831 to May 28, 1833. The major issues confronting McLane in this new role were the tariffs rates {{and the status of}} the Second Bank of the United States.|$|E
25|$|An audacious {{plan was}} {{formulated}} whose {{goal was to}} lay siege on the Sassanid capital city of Ctesiphon and definitively secure the eastern border. Yet the full motivation for this ambitious operation is, at best, unclear. There was no direct necessity for an invasion, as the Sassanids sent envoys {{in the hope of}} settling matters peacefully. Julian rejected this offer. Ammianus states that Julian <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> revenge on the Persians and that a certain desire for combat and glory also played a role in his decision to go to war.|$|E
