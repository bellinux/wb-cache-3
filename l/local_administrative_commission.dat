5000|$|The first {{recorded}} mention of Pelhřimov was in 1377, {{during the period}} of colonization carried out by Olomouc Bishop Bruno in the mid-13th century. Until the end of World War II, the town was a pure Sudeten German community. The 1930 census recorded 217 inhabitants. Most of the houses were heavily damaged during the second World War. In July and August 1946, the local Sudeten German population was displaced. Beginning at the end of February 1946, new settlers arrived. Among them were Slovaks and later mainly Volhynian Czechs. After February 1948, the Ministry of the Interior banned settlement within 300 meters of the state border on ideological grounds. From 1949 - 1950, the village was demolished. On 2 February 1950, MNV Slezské Rudoltice was handed over to the <b>local</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>commission,</b> which has overseen the municipality since 1945. The formerly independent municipality officially became part of the Silesian Rudoltice on 22 August 1951. [...] Of the original 70 residential houses only two remain, which are used for recreation and have house numbers 113 and 114, respectively.|$|E
