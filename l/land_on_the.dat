Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups.

5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F.

Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.|$|E

5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights.

5|$|By December 1942, with Allied forces {{advancing}} through Tunisia {{after landing}} there {{the month before}} in Operation Torch, the North African Campaign was coming to a close; with victory there imminent, discussions began among the Allies regarding {{the nature of their}} next objective. Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of Northern France, while the British, as well as then-Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, argued that the island of Sardinia was the best subsequent target of the Allied forces. In January 1943 the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt settled at the Casablanca Conference on the island of Sicily, whose invasion and occupation could potentially provide the Allies with Mediterranean shipping routes and airfields nearer to mainland Italy and Germany. The codename Operation Husky was decided upon for the Allied invasion of Sicily, and planning for Husky began in February. Initially the British Eighth Army, under the command of General Sir Bernard Montgomery, were to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south-eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse. Two days later the U.S. Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, would <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western corner of the island and move towards the port of Palermo.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942, with Allied forces {{advancing}} through Tunisia, the North African {{campaign was}} coming to a close; victory in North Africa being imminent, discussions began between the Allies over what their next objective should be. Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of France, while the British believed {{that it should be}} the island of Sardinia, as did General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In January 1943 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, met at the Casablanca conference and settled the debate: the island of Sicily would be the Allies' next objective. The invasion and occupation of Sicily would benefit the Allies by opening Mediterranean sea routes for Allied shipping and allowing Allied bombers to operate from airfields that were much closer to mainland Italy and Germany. The codename Operation Husky was eventually decided on for the invasion, and planning began in February.
