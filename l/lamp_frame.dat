50|$|A large, newly {{constructed}} choir loft looms {{above and}} over the narthex and entrance to the nave, which has a high ceiling with decorative hanging <b>lamps.</b> The <b>framing</b> of the ceiling, {{as well as the}} altar reredos, are made from Narra (Pterocarpus indices), wood donated by Brother Edward Tan, an avid sympathizer of the Church. The pulpit, lectern, pews and transept balconies have richly-carved woodwork with the same theme.|$|R

For example: a library is decorated with set dressing such as the furniture, books, desk <b>lamp,</b> blotter, <b>framed</b> photos, personal effects, letter trays, letter opener, papers, paper files. The Propmaster provides the props - the letter the actor is opening and reading, the pen he writes with, and the ink into which he dips his pen.|$|R

The rear taillamps are round and the bumpers have been restyled to yield a more unified look for the F512 M. This car featured a different front lid with twin NACA ducts.|$|R

In this paper, the {{real-time}} deformations {{and failures}} of LY 12 samples loaded by an SHTB are investigated by an optical system, {{which consists of}} a high-speed camera, a flash <b>lamp,</b> a <b>frame</b> grabber and a synchronization device with the controlling accuracy of 1 microsecond. The deformation history of LY 12 is obtained with a time interval of 10 µs {{and the result is}} compared with that acquired by classic Hopkinson method at the same time. Besides, two different failure modes and the crack propagation velocity of LY 12 specimen are detected in impact tensile process. The fracture textures after working are also surveyed by SEM and it shows that the dynamic fracture mode is affected by the microstructure of materials...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{recently}} developed HID <b>lamp</b> model <b>frame,</b> a semi-empirical fluorescent lamp model optimized by genetic algorithms and easily implemented in PSpice is presented. This model {{does not require}} any lamp data from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under ac operation. With {{the same set of}} parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results can be achieved when the lamp power is reduced to 60 % of rated power and when the lamp is operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of tubular and compact fluorescent lamps agree well with their experimental results. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The man on the ladder was placing some <b>lamps</b> on a <b>frame</b> over the door of a large and beautiful mansion, as if for an illumination. The lamps were disposed in such a manner as to form a great star, with the letters [...] "V. R." [...] on a very large scale, one on each side of it.|$|R
40|$|Low-pressure {{discharge}} lamps obey {{a set of}} physical laws that {{are different from those}} of high-pressure {{discharge lamps}}. In this paper, these differences are addressed. Based on a recently developed HID <b>lamp</b> model <b>frame,</b> a semi-theoretical fluorescent lamp model that can be determined by genetic algorithms and simple electrical measurements is presented. This model does not require any lamp data from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under ac operation at mains frequency. With the same set of parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results were achieved when the lamp power was reduced to 60 % of rated power and when the lamp was operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of tubular and compact fluorescent lamps agree well with their experimental results. Particularly, the differences between simulation results and experimental results under rated power are less than 10 %. Hence, the proposed model shows a good degree of accuracy: 1) for different types of fluorescent lamps; 2) at different operating frequencies; 3) under different dimming levels; and 4) during step-up and step-down transient processes. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Teatralnaya Station has fluted pylons {{faced with}} {{labradorite}} and white marble {{taken from the}} demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Crystal <b>lamps</b> in bronze <b>frames</b> attached {{to the center of}} the room give the central hall a festive appearance. The vault of the central hall is decorated with caissons and majolica bas-reliefs by Natyla Danko on the theme of theatre arts of the USSR, manufactured by Leningrad Porcelain Factory. These bas-reliefs are a series of fourteen different figures, each representing music and dance from various nationalities of the Soviet Union. Seven male and seven female figures attired in their national costumes are either performing an ethnic dance or are playing a distinctively ethnic musical instrument. The series included Armenia, Byelorussia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Each figure is reproduced four times for a total of 56 figures. Initially, the floor was of black-and-yellow granite patterned as a chessboard; however in 1970, the yellow panels were replaced with gray.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{her return}} to Dublin, Cranwill set up her studio on Suffolk Street, which was known as [...] "a joyous haven". She would produce special order pieces of {{individual}} orders, primarily in gold and silver with semi-precious stones and minerals. These included Irish Achill amethyst, and other native materials when possible. These pieces drew on Celtic design as inspiration, incorporating symbols from Irish mythology or contemporary poetry. Cranwill {{was a member of}} George William Russell's theosophy circle, receiving a commission to design a ring for the Gaelic League member Charlotte Dease inspired by her horoscope. Her main source of income were regular orders from Mundie's, a Manchester firm, however these ended after the Irish War of Independence, during which she hid republican guns in her workroom. After this she considered closing the studio, but a commission from Count John McCormack to create a pectoral cross for the Archbishop Carbery of Baltimore, USA, changed her mind. In 1921 she {{became a member of the}} Guild of Irish Artworkers. She exhibited with the Royal Dublin Society, the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1917 and 1921, and the Royal Miniature Society in 1920. At the Galerie Barbazanges in Paris her work was featured in an exhibition of Irish applied art in January 1922, and later at the Manchester City Art Gallery exhibition of jewellery by local craftworks in July 1923. In the 1920s, she was commissioned to produce numerous items, including a monstrance, tabernacle, sanctuary <b>lamp,</b> and <b>frames</b> for altar cards for St Patrick's catholic church, San Francisco, USA. The monstrance was produced in collaboration with Newland Smith, and was exhibited in the National Museum of Ireland (NMI) in July 1927, before being shipped to San Francisco.|$|R
