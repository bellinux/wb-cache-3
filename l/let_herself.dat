5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know {{that no matter what}} they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a little more to gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E

Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.|$|E

500|$|The Paris stage—at {{that time}} in dynamic {{conflict}} between traditional and experimental production styles—was inspirational for Bosse and convinced her that the low-key realistic acting style {{in which she was}} training herself was the right choice. Returning to Scandinavia, she was hesitant as to whether she should carve out a career in Stockholm, with its greater opportunities, or in Kristiania, to which she had closer emotional ties. In spite of the disadvantage of speaking Swedish with a Norwegian accent, Bosse <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> be persuaded by her opera-singer sister Dagmar to try her luck in Stockholm. [...] She applied for a place at the Royal Dramatic Theatre ("Dramaten"), the main drama venue of Stockholm, governed by the conservative tastes of King Oscar II and his personal advisors. After working hard at elocution lessons to improve her Swedish, which was Dramaten's condition for employing her, Bosse was eventually to become famous on the Swedish stage for her beautiful speaking voice and precise articulation. [...] Having trained her Swedish to a high level, she was engaged by Dramaten in 1899, where the sensation of the day was the innovative play Gustaf Vasa by August Strindberg.|$|E

[...] He gets a job, and then helps to lift the family's spirits by organising a fireworks display, on which Sharma said, [...] "AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own, dysfunctional way." [...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her.

500|$|... "Melt Away" [...] was a song Carey {{produced}} on her own, and co-wrote with Babyface. The song's writing and production were [...] "superb". with each verse gliding into its chorus. According to Chris Nickson, [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] was as [...] "strong as any slow jam {{released in the}} nineties, and one that would {{find a lot of}} flavor late at night with dancers." [...] Another song that brought back reminders of older decades was [...] "Forever". The throwback was featured through the chord changes and in the way the guitar arpeggios [...] "stayed {{at the forefront of the}} music." [...] The song displayed subtle vocals from Carey, as well as an undeniable richness. [...] "Daydream Interlude (Sweet Fantasy Dub Mix)" [...] was one of the liveliest tracks on the album. The song was a club remix of [...] "Fantasy", which was tuned and remixed by famed house music producer David Morales. The song was directed to be a dance-club song, further broadening Carey's [...] "musical horizon". The song incorporated Carey's vocals, and added them to a thumping house beat, something he would do for many of her future singles. [...] "Looking In" [...] was the final song on the album. Written in 15 minutes, it was Carey's most personal song at the time, one in which she <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> appear [...] "naked" [...] and [...] "stripped down; it was written by her and Afanasieff.|$|E
500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's all about her newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date and she still performs with the passion and the energy she always has done. If you went to the show then get your copy of this and treat it like a souvenir. If you didn't you need to check it out as it's one of the best shows she's ever done." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{concept for}} Faith's {{character}} was [...] "the road not taken", a Slayer {{who makes the}} wrong choices in life. She {{is intended to be}} a reflection of Buffy, and what Buffy could have become were it not for her support system of friends and family. The question the writers wanted to answer was, despite being made from the same [...] "raw materials," [...] how would upbringing and environment affect the type of people they would become later in life? Joss Whedon describes her as everything Buffy would never <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith's approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself. Some fans argued that the show developed a lesbian subtext between Faith and Buffy; Jane Espenson states that Whedon says he didn't intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{are divided}} {{when it comes}} to {{evaluating}} the actual appeal of Cantacuzino's nationalist feminism. Bucur writes that [...] "most feminists, like Alexandrina Cantacuzino, were also aggressive, even jingoistic nationalists". Contrarily, Petrescu notes: [...] "Alexandrina Cantacuzino is the interwar's only feminist to have <b>let</b> <b>herself</b> be seduced by authoritarianism." [...] The AECPFR and other organizations repudiated Cantacuzino, declaring themselves for emancipation within the format of liberal democracy. Occasionally, Cantacuzino herself still showed interest in the development of democratic societies: a guest of the Friends of America society on Washington's Birthday, 1932, she lectured about [...] "Different Aspects of American Life and Culture". Although no longer serving as ICW Vice President in 1936, she was made Convener of its Fine and Applied Arts Committee, as well as delegate to the Joint Conference of the International Council of Women and the International Council of Women in Calcutta, British India. In January 1934, Dimitrie Gusti's Romanian Social Institute elected her on its steering committee.|$|E

Thelma is mildly attracted until she realizes that Ella can see her. There are other anomalies: Ella's tuition is paid by a corporation and her family background is unknown. She also seems to know entirely too much about Cassie... and Azazeal.|$|E
