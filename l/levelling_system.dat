Taking a [...] "massive stride forward for first-person games", the game emphasised its adventure elements rather than shooting and was credited by journalist Chris Kohler with [...] "breaking the genre free from the clutches of Doom".|$|E
60|$|I know, too, that, besides this vain, contradictory, and self-destructive {{security}} {{which some}} men {{derive from the}} habitual attachment {{of the people to}} this Constitution, whilst they suffer it with a sort of sportive acquiescence to be brought into contempt before their faces, they have other grounds for removing all apprehension from their minds. They are of opinion that there are too many men of great hereditary estates and influence in the kingdom to suffer the establishment of the <b>levelling</b> <b>system</b> which has taken place in France. This is very true, if, in order to guide the power which now attends their property, these men possess the wisdom which is involved in early fear. But if, through a supine security, to which such fortunes are peculiarly liable, they neglect the use of their influence in the season of their power, on the first derangement of society the nerves of their strength will be cut. Their estates, instead of being the means of their security, will become the very causes of their danger. Instead of bestowing influence, they will excite rapacity. They will be looked to as a prey.|$|E
60|$|We had {{now come}} {{in full view}} of the old family mansion, partly thrown in deep shadow, and partly lit up by the cold moonshine. It was an {{irregular}} building of some magnitude, and seemed to be of the architecture of different periods. One wing was, evidently very ancient, with heavy stone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy, from among the foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass glittered with the moonbeams. The rest of the house was in the French taste of Charles the Second's time, having been repaired and altered, as my friend told me, by one of his ancestors, who returned with that monarch at the Restoration. The grounds about the house were laid out in the old formal manner of artificial flower-beds, clipped shrubberies, raised terraces, and heavy stone balustrades, ornamented with urns, a leaden statue or two, and a jet of water. The old gentleman, I was told, was extremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its original state. He admired this fashion in gardening; it had an air of magnificence, was courtly and noble, and befitting good old family style. The boasted imitation of nature in modern gardening had sprung up with modern republican notions, but did not suit a monarchical government; it smacked of the <b>levelling</b> <b>system.</b> I could not help smiling at this introduction of politics into gardening, though I expressed some apprehension that I should find the old gentleman rather intolerant in his creed. Frank assured me, however, that it was almost the only instance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with politics; and he believed that he had got this notion from a member of Parliament who once passed a few weeks with him. The Squire was glad of any argument to defend his clipped yew-trees and formal terraces, which had been occasionally attacked by modern landscape gardeners.|$|E

As such, educators are constantly seeking interventions that are effec-tive in assisting students with EBD {{to manage their}} own behavior and achieve success in school. One behavioral management approach that educators frequently recommend is the <b>level</b> <b>system.</b> As a first step to better understand <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> we conducted a large-scale survey {{to determine the extent}} of <b>level</b> <b>system</b> use, the characteristics of teacher and students who use <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>level</b> <b>system</b> char-acteristics and procedures, teacher perceptions of <b>level</b> <b>system</b> effectiveness, and teacher satisfaction with <b>level</b> <b>systems.</b> Analysis of data revealed extensive use of <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> similarities and differences between <b>level</b> <b>system</b> users and nonusers, characteristics common to <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> and inconsistencies in perceptions of effectiveness and satisfaction. Finally, we offer implications of our findings for edu-cators and provide suggestions for further <b>level</b> <b>system</b> research.

40|$|The <b>level</b> <b>system</b> is a {{behavioral}} procedure that alters {{the status of}} a participant contingent on his or her behaviors; within each level the amount of reinforcement is different.

In the current study, the effectiveness of a <b>level</b> <b>system</b> with a built in token economy was evaluated within three intensive residential group homes with 3 male participants. Each participant was diagnosed with mental retardation and behavioral issues. The <b>level</b> <b>system</b> was comprised of 5 different levels, each having different privileges and reinforcers. Each participant received token dollars for displaying replacement behaviors and the tokens were used to purchase items from a token store.

40|$|Noise {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a nuisance. Here we argue that it can be a useful probe of fluctuating two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> in glasses. It can be used to: (1) shed light on whether the fluctuations are correlated or independent events; (2) determine if there is a low temperature glass or phase transition among interacting two <b>level</b> <b>systems,</b> and if the hierarchical or droplet model can be used to describe the glassy phase; and (3) find the lower bound of the two <b>level</b> <b>system</b> relaxation rate without going to ultralow temperatures.

40|$|Noise and {{decoherence}} {{are major}} obstacles {{to the implementation}} of Josephson junction qubits in quantum computing. Recent experiments suggest that two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> (TLS) in the oxide tunnel barrier are a source of decoherence. We explore two decoherence mechanisms in which these two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> lead to the decay of Rabi oscillations that result when Josephson junction qubits are subjected to strong microwave driving. (A) We consider a Josephson qubit coupled resonantly to a two <b>level</b> <b>system,</b> i. e., the qubit and TLS have equal energy splittings. As a result of this resonant interaction, the occupation probability of the excited state of the qubit exhibits beating. Decoherence of the qubit results when the two <b>level</b> <b>system</b> decays from its excited state by emitting a phonon. (B) Fluctuations of the two <b>level</b> <b>systems</b> in the oxide barrier produce fluctuations and 1 /f noise in the Josephson junction critical current I_o. This in turn leads to fluctuations in the qubit energy splitting that degrades the qubit coherence. We compare our results with experiments on Josephson junction phase qubits.

50|$|The Malaysian {{economy grew}} {{at an average}} of 8% each year between the late 1980s and {{the first half of the}} 1990s. Proton {{identified}} the need for a larger, more luxurious D-segment car after the launch of the B-segment Proton Saga and C-segment Proton Wira in 1985 and 1993 respectively. On 26 January 1995, the Proton Perdana became Malaysia's first car to compete alongside the established Perdana's rival such as Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Cefiro. The Perdana was the third car developed under Proton's extensive collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors. It is based on the seventh generation Mitsubishi Eterna platform and shared a vast majority of parts with the JDM-spec Eterna, receiving only minor internal and external changes for the Malaysian market. The Perdana features Mitsubishi's 4G63 16-valve 2.0 litre I4 multi-point fuel injected engine which is capable of producing 135 hp at 6000 rpm and 176 Nm of torque at 4750 rpm. It was initially offered with a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual transmissions, but the manual variant was discontinued in 1996. The Perdana sported an extremely low drag coefficient of just 0.29 Cd, allowing for improved fuel efficiency and a top speed in excess of 200 km/h. The Perdana also became Proton's first car to be offered with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and cruise control, and among the earliest of Protons to be equipped with all-round power windows, power folding mirrors and a headlight <b>levelling</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Some preliminary measurements to calibrate the Zeiss DiNi 12 system have been carried out and the effect of the single non-typical line correction was discussed...|$|E
