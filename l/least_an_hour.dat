The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures for at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E

5|$|After the {{announcement}} and {{release of the}} third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance {{difference between the two}} variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned {{to the front desk}} after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued for at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about {{half of his}} brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves {{in the midst of}} an intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.|$|E

25|$|Horses needed attendants: {{hitching}} a six-horse {{field artillery}} team, for example, required six men working for at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Horse health deteriorated after only ten days of even moderate load, requiring frequent refits; recuperation took months and the replacement horses, in turn, {{needed time to}} get along with their teammates and handlers. Good stables around the front line were scarce, makeshift lodgings caused premature wear and disease. Refit of front-line horse units consumed eight to ten days, slowing down operations.|$|E

Attackers in two pickup trucks fired rocket propelled grenades at an Ethiopian and government convoy. One man known to have been killed was thought to be deaf and therefore did not respond when soldiers ordered him to go back. The same day, the TFG closed the radio stations for Shabelle Radio, Horn Afrik, IQK, and the television station Al-Jazeera in Mogadishu without explanation.|$|E

25|$|To {{begin with}} the anti-tour {{movement}} was committed to non-violent civil disobedience, demonstrations and direct action. As protection for the Springboks, the police created two special riot squads, the Red and Blue Squads. These police were, controversially, the first in New Zealand to be issued with visored riot helmets and long batons (more commonly the side-handle baton). Some protesters were intimidated and interpreted this initial police response as overkill and heavy-handed tactics. After early disruptions, police began to require that all spectators assemble in sports grounds at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before kick-off.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides {{argued that}} time was {{required}} between meat and dairy produce because meat can become stuck in the teeth, a problem he suggested would last for about six hours after eating it; this interpretation was shared by Solomon ben Aderet, a prominent pupil of his, and Asher ben Jehiel, who gained entry to the rabbinate by Solomon ben Aderet's approval, {{as well as by}} the later Shulchan Aruch. By contrast, tosafists argued that the key detail was just the avoidance of dairy produce appearing at the same meal as meat. Therefore, it was sufficient to just wait until a new meal—which to them simply meant clearing the table, reciting a particular blessing, and cleaning their mouths. Some later rabbinic writers, like Moses Isserles, and significant texts, like the Zohar (as noted by Vilna Gaon and Daniel Josiah Pinto), argued that a meal still did not qualify as new unless at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> had passed since the previous meal.|$|E
500|$|Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, who {{had been}} chairing COBRA during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a {{function}} he had been attending in Slough, roughly [...] away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Mike Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were {{in a position to}} assault the embassy at ten minutes' notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from a local mosque at 18:20, fearing that a [...] "crisis point" [...] had been reached, and asked him to talk to the gunmen. Three further shots were fired {{during the course of the}} imam's conversation with Oan. Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani's body was dumped out of the front door. Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead for at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.|$|E

500|$|Sinatra's {{split with}} Gardner {{in the fall}} of 1953 had a {{profound}} impact on the types of songs he sang and his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a [...] "brooding melancholy", such as [...] "I'm a Fool to Want You", [...] "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", [...] "My One and Only Love" [...] and There Will Never Be Another You", which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was [...] "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt". Author Granata considered Sinatra to have been a [...] "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio [...] "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it by spending at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. During his Columbia years Sinatra would use an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as [...] "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he would use a bullet-shaped RCA 77. At Capitol he used a Neumann U47, an [...] "ultra-sensitive" [...] microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electric}} eel {{is unique}} among the Gymnotiformes in having large electric organs {{that can produce}} potentially lethal discharges {{that allow them to}} stun prey. Larger voltages have been reported, but the typical output is sufficient to stun or deter virtually any animal. Juveniles produce smaller voltages (about 100 V). [...] They can vary the intensity of the electric discharge, using lower discharges for hunting and higher intensities for stunning prey or defending themselves. They can also concentrate the discharge by curling up and making contact at two points along its body. When agitated, they can produce these intermittent electric shocks over at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> without tiring.|$|E

2500|$|For some {{northbound}} travelers on I-15, the Montana Department of Transportation {{had failed}} to make similar plans to those in Idaho, scheduling a road construction project to begin on August 21 that narrowed {{a section of the}} highway to a single northbound lane, near the exit to Clark Canyon Dam south of Dillon. Though that stretch of highway generally has a traffic count of less than 1,000 vehicles per day, {{on the day of the}} eclipse there were over a thousand vehicles per hour at peak times. As a result, traffic backed up as far as Lima, creating a delay of at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> for travelers heading northward. Further, as construction had not yet begun, drivers observed cones set up but no workers present on the road.

2500|$|The 1981 Springbok Tour, or [...] "The Tour", {{went down}} {{as one of}} the most {{controversial}} rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. [...] Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at <b>least</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. These images were beamed around the world, and looked as though a civil crisis had engulfed New Zealand. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year.|$|E
