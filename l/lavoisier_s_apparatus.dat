40|$|The Gram-negative {{bacteria}} Chlamydia trachomatis is {{a common}} sexually transmitted pathogen that can cause severe sequelae including cause pelvic inflammatory disease and sterility. This obligate intracellular pathogen effectively manipulates host cellular functions by secreting virulence factors across its membrane bound vacuole. Identifying these virulence components and how they help in establishing an environment conducive for bacterial growth is central to understanding chlamydial pathogenesis. This is experimentally challenging {{due to a lack}} of tools to perform molecular genetic studies. In the absence of genetic tools, we developed a yeast model system to identify and characterize chlamydial proteins involved in virulence mechanisms. In this study we describe the identification of twenty-eight proteins potentially involved in modulating host cellular functions and the secretion of virulence factors into the host. Since the delivery of virulence proteins by a type three secretion (T 3 S) system is a critical step for Chlamydia, we identified the proteins that interacted with the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> by yeast two-hybrid analysis. We discovered several novel interactions between and determined that the C. trachomatis T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> displayed a similar architecture to that of other T 3 S systems.

VirB 6 is essential for DNA transfer and is a polytopic integral membrane protein with at least four membrane-spanning domains. VirB 6 is postulated to function in T-pilus biogenesis {{and to be a}} component of the T 4 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus.</b> To identify amino acids required for VirB 6 function, random mutations were introduced into virB 6, and mutants that failed to complement a deletion in virB 6 in tumour formation assays were isolated. Twenty-one non-functional mutants were identified, eleven of which had a point mutation that led to a substitution in a single amino acid. Characterization of the mutants indicated that the N-terminal large periplasmic domain and the transmembrane domain TM 3 are required for VirB 6 function. TM 3 has an unusual sequence feature in that it is rich in bulky hydrophobic amino acids. This feature is found conserved in the VirB 6 family of proteins. Studies on the effect of VirB 6 on other VirB proteins showed that the octopine Ti-plasmid VirB 6, unlike its nopaline Ti-plasmid counterpart, does not affect accumulation of VirB 3 and VirB 5, but has a strong negative effect on the accumulation of the VirB 7 -VirB 7 dimer. Using indirect immunofluorescencemicroscopy the authors recently demonstrated that VirB 6 localizes to a cell pole in a VirB-dependent manner. Mutations identified in the present study did not affect polar localization of the protein or the formation of the VirB 7 -VirB 7 dimer. A VirB 6 -GFP fusion that contained the entire VirB 6 ORF did not localize to a cell pole in either the presence or the absence of the other VirB proteins. IMF studies using dual labelling demonstrated that VirB 6 colocalizes with VirB 3 and VirB 9, and not with VirB 4, VirB 5 and VirB 11.

40|$|The Type II {{secretion}} (T 2 <b>S)</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{is required}} for the survival and fitness of Vibrio cholerae both in the human host as well as its natural aquatic environment due to its ability to secrete proteins such as cholera toxin and hydrolytic enzymes. This apparatus, which is widely distributed among Gram negative pathogens, is composed of at least 12 proteins and spans the entire cell envelope. The energy to support secretion through the T 2 S system is provided by an ATPase associated with this complex, EpsE. EpsE is homologous to many ATPases involved with other molecular trafficking machineries and is comprised of three distinct subdomains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the C-terminal domain (CTD), and a tetracysteine coordinating zinc binding domain (CM). These studies demonstrate that the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis requires oligomerization of EpsE, which allows for the realignment of specific arginine residues from the NTD, CTD and the CTD of a neighboring subunit to form the active site. Replacement of any of these arginine residues in the active site or of residues within the subunit interface halts the activity of EpsE, suggesting conformational changes associated with the binding, hydrolysis and release of nucleotide must be precise. An additional arginine from the CM domain is also required to complete the active site, suggesting a role for all three domains in ATP hydrolysis and energizing the T 2 S machinery. Previous work has shown EpsE to interact with the T 2 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> through its NTD with another T 2 S component, EpsL. The movement of the NTD in association with EpsL likely provides a means of transforming the energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work to support T 2 S. This work provides further evidence that the CM domain may be involved in additional protein-protein contacts with either EpsL or another protein associated with the T 2 S machinery. It is conceivable that the CM domain may play a direct role in the regulation of ATPase activity as it is in prime position to connect the nucleotide binding pocket to other components of the T 2 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> through protein-protein interactions...|$|R

In the present study, Cpn 0712 (CdsD), Cpn 0704 (CdsQ), and Cpn 0826 (CdsL), three C. pneumoniae genes encoding yersiniae T 3 S YscD, YscQ, and YscL homologs, respectively, were cloned and expressed as histidine- and glutathione S-transferase (GST) -tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant proteins were used to raise hyper-immune polyclonal antiserum and were used in GST pull-down and copurification assays to identify protein-protein interactions. CdsD was detected in both EB and RB lysates by Western blot analyses, and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated the presence of CdsD within inclusions. Triton X- 114 solubilization and phase separation of chlamydial EB proteins indicated that CdsD partitions with cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting it is not an integral membrane protein.

Using an ex vivo infection model, {{the goal of the}} present study was to determine whether the chlamydial T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> also modulates the host inflammatory response. Infections of mouse peritoneal macrophages were performed with Chlamydia muridarum, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines was monitored by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Since there is no current genetic system for Chlamydia spp., blockade of T 3 S was accomplished pharmacologically using a T 3 S inhibitor called INP 0007. It has been previously shown that INP 0007 also blocks chlamydial growth in vitro and that the addition of exogenous iron completely reverses this deficit. The addition of iron to INP 0007 -treated C. muridarum-infected macrophages not only restored chlamydial growth deficit caused by INP 0007 but also led to a multi-inclusion phenotype. Overall, T 3 S inhibition led to decreased interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 1 β, and CXCL 10, whereas the tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were unchanged. Rescue of chlamydial growth by addition of iron sulfate did not restore cytokine production, implying that the decreased expression of many cytokines during infection was dependent on T 3 S and not solely on growth. In addition, the observation that the greatest effects of INP 0007 were seen at late time points during infection suggests that a temporally regulated T 3 S effector protein(s) may be triggering the host cytokine response...|$|R

We investigated the function of MxiC, the member of the YopN/InvE/SepL family in the Shigella flexneri T 3 S system. Inactivation of mxiC led specifically to a deregulated secretion of effectors (including IpaA, IpgD, IcsB, IpgB 2, OspD 1 and IpaHs), but not of translocators (IpaB and IpaC) and proteins controlling the T 3 SA structure or activity (Spa 32 and IpaD).

Here we report the identification of multiple protein substrates of VirB, which, upon translocation into HEC, mediate all known VirB-dependent cellular changes. These Bartonella-translocated effector proteins (Beps) A-G are encoded together with the VirB system and the T 4 S coupling protein VirD 4 on a Bartonella-specific pathogenicity island. The Beps display a modular architecture, suggesting an evolution by extensive domain duplication and reshuffling. The C terminus of each Bep harbors at least one copy of the Bep-intracellular delivery domain and a short positively charged tail sequence. This biparte C terminus constitutes a transfer signal that is sufficient to mediate VirB/VirD 4 -dependent intracellular delivery of reporter protein fusions. The Bep-intracellular delivery domain is also present in conjugative relaxases of bacterial conjugation systems. We exemplarily show that the C terminus of such a conjugative relaxase mediates protein transfer through the Bartonella henselae VirB/VirD 4 system into HEC.

EBs posses a unique outer envelope where rigidity {{is achieved by}} disulfide bonding among cysteine-rich envelope-associated proteins. Conversely, these disulfide bonds become reduced in RBs to accommodate vegetative growth, thereby linking the redox status of cysteine-rich envelope proteins with progression of the developmental cycle. We investigated the potential role of disulfide bonding within the chlamydial type III secretion system (T 3 SS), since activity of this system is also closely linked to development. We focused on structural components of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> that contain an unusually high number of cysteine residues compared to orthologs in other secretion systems. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE revealed that EB-localized apparatus proteins such as CdsF, CdsD, and CdsC form higher-order complexes mediated by disulfide bonding.

Significantly, disulfide bonding patterns shifted during differentiation of developmental forms and were completely reduced in RBs. Furthermore, at later time points during infection following RB to EB conversion, we found that CdsF is reoxidized into higher-order complexes. Overall, we conclude that the redox status of specific T 3 SS apparatus proteins is intimately linked to the developmental cycle and constitutes a newly appreciated aspect of functionally significant alterations within proteins of the chlamydial envelope...|$|R

Também abordaram-se outras ideias envolvendo as transformações da matéria do século XVIII, com base em estudos atuais de historiadores da química. Com isso, foi possível analisar os aspectos da construção dessas ideias recorrentes sobre o papel de Lavoisier no nascimento da química moderna. Este trabalho foi desenvolvido como parte do projeto História da ciência e ensino: abordagens interdisciplinares no Ensino Superior (diagnóstico, formação continuada e especializada de professores), apoiado pelo Programa Observatório da Educação OBEDUC (CAPES/INEP processo no. 23038. 002603 / 2013 - 47) This work {{takes as}} its starting point {{the observation that}} the High School Chemistry textbooks suggested by the PNLD (Textbooks Brazilian National Program) often relate, Lavoisier, the Mass Conservation Law and the origins of Modern Chemistry. With {{the main purpose of}} analyzing this relation, the textbooks statements were confronted with studies developed by historians of science in the current historiographical perspectives. Besides, the Elementary Treatise of Chemistry was used as a research original source, focusing mainly on the ideas about the caloric that were undertaken by Lavoisier and Laplace, which had a major role in <b>Lavoisier</b> <b>s</b> conceptions about matter and its transformations. Other ideas were also approached involving the transformations of the matter in the eighteenth century, based on current studies of historians of chemistry. Thus, it was possible to analyze the aspects of the construction of these recurrent ideas on the role of Lavoisier in the birth of modern chemistry.

30|$|To {{address this}} lacuna, we have {{performed}} transcriptional profiling of rice gene expression {{changes that occur}} following cell-wall damage initiated by treatment with X. oryzae pv. oryzae ClsA. In our experiments, we have infiltrated 5  μg of ClsA protein into approximately 1  cm 2 of leaf area although we find that infiltration of even 4  μg of enzyme is sufficient to induce a HR like response. In the laboratory, approximately 4  μg of ClsA is secreted per milliliter of a saturated culture (approx. 1 [*]×[*] 109 cell) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. During infection, 1  cm 2 of leaf area supports 1 [*]×[*] 109 cells of X. oryzae pv. oryzae, and we expect that these cells would secrete about 4  μg of ClsA. As {{a number of other}} cell-wall-degrading enzymes, besides ClsA, are secreted by X. oryzae pv. oryzae, we expect that the total amounts of cell-wall-degrading enzymes secreted by X. oryzae pv. oryzae is going to be much higher than that used in this experiment. Besides the above, there is evidence that secretion by T 2 S of V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa occurs in a polar manner because the T 2 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> is localized to one pole of the cell, possibly at the point of attachment to host surface (Scott et al. 2001; Senf et al. 2008). If the T 2 S of X. oryzae pv. oryzae is similarly localized, the local concentrations of cell-wall-degrading enzymes are likely to be quite high during infection.|$|R
40|$|YscD is an {{essential}} component of the plasmid pCD 1 -encoded type III secretion system (T 3 SS) of Yersinia pestis. YscD has a single transmembrane (TM) domain that connects a small N-terminal cytoplasmic region (residues 1 to 121) to a larger periplasmic region (residues 143 to 419). Deletion analyses established that both the N-terminal cytoplasmic region and the C-terminal periplasmic region are required for YscD function. Smaller targeted deletions demonstrated that a predicted cytoplasmic forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is also required to assemble a functional T 3 SS; in contrast, a predicted periplasmic phospholipid binding (BON) domain and a putative periplasmic “ring-building motif” domain of YscD could be deleted with no significant effect on the T 3 S process. Although deletion of the putative “ring-building motif” domain did not disrupt T 3 S activity per se, the calcium-dependent regulation of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> was affected. The extreme C-terminal region of YscD (residues 354 to 419) was essential for secretion activity and had a strong dominant-negative effect on the T 3 S process when exported to the periplasm of the wild-type parent strain. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that this region of YscD mediates the interaction of YscD with the outer membrane YscC secretin complex. Finally, replacement of the YscD TM domain with a TM domain of dissimilar sequence had no effect on the T 3 S process, indicating that the TM domain has no sequence-specific function in the assembly or function of the T 3 SS...|$|R
40|$|Type III {{secretion}} systems (T 3 SSs) {{are essential}} virulence devices for many gram-negative bacteria that are pathogenic for plants, animals, and humans. They serve to translocate virulence effector proteins directly into eukaryotic host cells. T 3 SSs {{are composed of}} a large cytoplasmic bulb and a transmembrane region into which a needle is embedded, protruding above the bacterial surface. The emerging antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens urges the development of novel strategies to fight bacterial infections. Therapeutics that rather than kill bacteria only attenuate their virulence may reduce the frequency or progress of resistance emergence. Recently, a group of salicylidene acylhydrazides were identified as inhibitors of T 3 SSs in Yersinia, Chlamydia, and Salmonella species. Here we show that these are also effective on the T 3 SS of Shigella flexneri, where they block all related forms of protein secretion so far known, {{as well as the}} epithelial cell invasion and induction of macrophage apoptosis usually demonstrated by this bacterium. Furthermore, we show the first evidence for the detrimental effect of these compounds on T 3 SS needle assembly, as demonstrated by increased numbers of T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatuses</b> without needles or with shorter needles. Therefore, the compounds generate a phenocopy of T 3 SS export apparatus mutants but with incomplete penetrance. We discuss why this would be sufficient to almost completely block the later secretion of effector proteins and how this begins to narrow the search for the molecular target of these compounds...|$|R

Shigella invasion requires actin polymerization {{dependent on the}} Src tyrosine kinase and a functional bacterial type III secretion (T 3 <b>S)</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Using dynamic as well as immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that the T 3 S translocon component IpaC allows the recruitment of the Src kinase required for actin polymerization at bacterial entry sites during {{the initial stages of}} Shigella entry. Src recruitment occurred at bacterial-cell contact sites independent of actin polymerization {{at the onset of the}} invasive process and was still observed in Shigella strains mutated for translocated T 3 S effectors of invasion. A Shigella strain with a polar mutation that expressed low levels of the translocator components IpaB and IpaC was fully proficient for Src recruitment and bacterial invasion. In contrast, a Shigella strain mutated in the IpaC carboxyterminal effector domain that was proficient for T 3 S effector translocation did not induce Src recruitment. Consistent with a direct role for IpaC in Src activation, cell incubation with the IpaC last 72 carboxyterminal residues fused to the Iota toxin Ia (IaC) component that translocates into the cell cytosol upon binding to the Ib component led to Src-dependent ruffle formation. Strikingly, IaC also induced actin structures resembling bacterial entry foci that were enriched in activated Src and were inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP 2. These results indicate that the IpaC effector domain determines Src-dependent acti...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{responsible}} for high-morbidity infections of cystic fibrosis patients and is a major agent of nosoco-mial infections. One of its most potent virulence factors is a type III secretion system (T 3 SS) that injects toxins directly into the host cell cytoplasm. ExsB, a lipoprotein localized in the bacterial outer membrane, {{is one of the}} components of this machinery, of which the function remained elusive until now. The localization of the exsB gene within the exsCEBA regulatory gene operon suggested an implication in the T 3 SS regulation, while its similarity with yscW from Yersinia spp. argued in favor of a role in machinery assembly. The present work shows that ExsB is necessary for full in vivo virulence of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the requirement of ExsB for optimal T 3 SS assembly and activity is demonstrated using eukaryotic cell infection and in vitro assays. In particular, ExsB promotes the assembly of the T 3 SS secretin in the bacterial outer membrane, highlighting the molecular role of ExsB as a pilotin. This involvement in the regulation of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> assembly may explain the localization of the ExsB-encoding gene within the regulatory gene operon. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium thatthrives in a variety of environments (1, 2) and can colonize diverse hosts, from invertebrates to humans (3, 4). It represents a real threat to human health, being responsible for the most fre-quent hospital-acquired infections along with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in France (5). Moreover, it is the first caus...|$|R
40|$|Many gram-negative {{plant and}} animal {{pathogenic}} bacteria employ a type III secretion (T 3 S) system to inject effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. The membrane-spanning T 3 <b>S</b> <b>apparatus</b> is associated with an ATPase that presumably provides the energy for the secretion process. Here, we describe {{the role of the}} predicted ATPase HrcN from the plant pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pathovar vesicatoria. We show that HrcN hydrolyzes ATP in vitro and is essential for T 3 S and bacterial pathogenicity. Stability of HrcN in X. campestris pv. vesicatoria depends on the conserved HrcL protein, which interacts with HrcN in vitro and in vivo. Both HrcN and HrcL bind to the inner membrane protein HrcU and specifically localize to the bacterial membranes under T 3 S-permissive conditions. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that HrcN also interacts with the T 3 S substrate specificity switch protein HpaC and the global T 3 S chaperone HpaB, which promotes secretion of multiple effector proteins. Using an in vitro chaperone release assay, we demonstrate that HrcN dissociates a complex between HpaB and the effector protein XopF 1 in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting that HrcN is involved in the release of HpaB-bound effectors. Effector release depends on a conserved glycine residue in the HrcN phosphate-binding loop, which is crucial for enzymatic activity and protein function during T 3 S. There is no experimental evidence that T 3 S can occur {{in the absence of the}} ATPase, in contrast to recent findings reported for animal pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
