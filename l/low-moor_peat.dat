40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to study the process of {{phosphorus}} release from peat soils under flooded conditions and to specify the time and conditions in which this process takes place. Studies were conducted on samples of peat soils collected in the Ã…ÂÃ„Â™czyÃ…Â„sko-WÃ…Â‚odawskie Lake District, from high-moor peat and from <b>low-moor</b> <b>peat.</b> The peat soil samples (from depths of 0 - 20, 20 - 40 and 40 - 60 cm) was placed in plastic containers. 500 ml of water was added to each sample and the containers were tightly closed. The incubation was conducted in darkness for 126 days, at room temperature. The Eh and pH of peat soils were measured each week and filtrate was collected for determination of the P-PO 43 - and Fe 2 + concentrations. Phosphorus release was the highest in the surface layer (depth of 0 - 20 cm) of both sites in the high-moor and in the <b>low-moor</b> <b>peat.</b> The maximum phosphorus released (50. 5 mg P-PO 43 -dm- 3) from <b>low-moor</b> <b>peat</b> was 7. 5 times higher than the maximum phosphorus released from <b>low-moor</b> <b>peat...</b>|$|E
40|$|Six {{palsa mire}} in Usa River valley and in Vorkuta area in North-eastern part of European Russia were studied in detail. In total 75 new  14 C dates from {{different}} palsa sections were obtained. In palsa mire near Bugry Settlement 3. 2  m high palsa dated from 8. 6 to 2. 1  ka BP. The permafrost and palsa began 2. 1  ka BP. In palsa mire near Usa Settlement low moor peat in 2  m high palsa dated 3690  BP, palsa began to heave at least 3700  BP. A <b>low-moor</b> <b>peat</b> of 2. 5  m high palsa indicates {{the change in}} the hydrological-mineral regime during 7. 1 to 6. 3  ka BP, heaving commenced 6  ka BP. A number of 8   14 C dates from 5. 6 to 2. 7  ka BP obtained from peat of 3  m high palsa. Near Abez’ Settlement palsa development began about 2. 8  ka BP. There are both large and smaller palsas. <b>Low-moor</b> <b>peat</b> of 3. 5  m high palsa is dated between 9180  BP to 6730  BP near Nikita Settlement. In Vorkuta area near Khanovey Settlement the northern most palsa is found. The  14 C age of peat at slope of the palsa is much younger, than in an axial part, there is inversion of the dates: the date 3. 5  ka BP is between dates 2. 9 and 2. 8  ka BP. It is probably caused by creep of peat downwards from a summit. This evidenced this frozen mound is real palsa, but not a residual form as a result of erosion. </span...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the years}} 2002 – 2003, in a foil tunnel, {{vegetation}} {{experiment in the}} growing of two eggplant cultivars ‘Epic F 1 ’ and ‘Solara F 1 ’ were carried out. Plants were grown in cylinders of 6 dm 3 capacity filled with substrate which consisted of: 1) raised peat (from Lithuania), 2) pine bark + <b>low-moor</b> <b>peat</b> (v: v = 1 : 1). In the vegetation period, top-dressing with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was applied. Fruit harvest was carried out many times. The total fruit yield was determined. Index parts of plants were sampled for analyses in which the following values were identified: in ‘Epic ’ cultivars: 1. 12 – 3. 40 % N; 0. 42 – 1. 14 % P; 1. 80 – 4. 81 % K. In ‘Solara ’ cultivars, the following values were found: 1. 17 – 3. 50 % N; 0. 53 – 1. 27 % P; 1. 96 – 4. 00 % K, depending on the substrate and the fertilization level. Differences {{were found in the}} total yield and in the nutritional status of plants, depending on the substrate, fertilization level, cultivar and term of sam-pling.
