5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last <b>larval</b> <b>instar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tsetse first become {{separate}} {{from their mothers}} during the third <b>larval</b> <b>instar,</b> during which they have the typical appearance of maggots. However, this life stage is short, lasting at most a few hours, and is almost never observed outside of the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The larva {{feeds on}} dead or {{necrotic}} tissue for 3 to 10 days, depending on temperature {{and the quality}} of the food. During this period the larva passes through three larval instars. At a temperature of 16°C, the first <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> lasts about 53 hours, the second about 42 hours and the third about 98 hours. At higher temperatures (27°C) the first <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> lasts about 31 hours, the second about 12 hours, and the third about 40 hours. Third-instar larvae then drop off the host onto soil, where available, where they enter a pupal stage which usually lasts from 6 to 14 days. However, if the temperature is suitably low, a pupa might overwinter in the soil until the temperature rises. After emerging from the pupa, the adult feeds opportunistically on nectar or other suitable food, such as carrion, while it matures. Adults usually lay eggs about 2 weeks after they emerge. Their total lifecycle typically ranges from 2 to 3 weeks, but this varies with seasonal and other circumstances. L. sericata usually completes three or four generations each year in cold, temperate climates, and more in warmer regions.|$|E
40|$|For {{determination}} {{of the number of}} <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> of Stromatium longicorne Newman, head width and head length were measured.

Comparing with the first <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> and the fifth <b>larval</b> <b>instars,</b> they are extremely different in size-the head size of those of the fifth <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> is 10 to 12 times larger than that of the first <b>larval</b> <b>instars.</b> Although the three experimental formulae on larval growth of Dyer, Gaines-Empbell and Tokunaga did not show good results, Tokunaga's formula was comparatively adaptable.

25|$|Larvae are {{not easily}} {{distinguished}} from the larvae of other tortricid leafrollers; only DNA testing is a certain identification method. The first <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> has a dark brown head; all other instars have a light fawn head and prothoracic plate. Overwintering larvae are darker.

25|$|Holometabolus, or {{complete}} metamorphosis. These insects {{have a different}} form in their immature and adult stages, have different behaviours and live in different habitats. The immature form is called larvae and remains similar in form but increases in size. They usually have chewing mouthparts even if the adult form mouth parts suck. At the last <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> phase the insect forms into a pupa, it doesn’t feed and is inactive, and here wing development is initiated, and the adult emerges e.g. Order: Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths).|$|E

40|$|As a {{first step}} towards the {{development}} of an ecologically rational control strategy against western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Europe, we compared the susceptibility of the soil living larvae and pupae of this maize pest to infection by three entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) species. In laboratory assays using sand-filled trays, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar and H. megidis Poinar, Jackson & Klein (both Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) caused comparable mortality among all three <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> and pupae of D. v. virgifera. In soil-filled trays, H. bacteriophora was slightly more effective against third <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> and pupae, and H. megidis against third <b>larval</b> <b>instars,</b> compared to other developmental stages. In both sand and soil, Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (Rh. : Steinernematidae) was least effective against second instars. In conclusion, all <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> of D. v. virgifera show susceptibility to infection by all three nematodes tested. It is predicted that early application against young <b>larval</b> <b>instars</b> would be most effective at preventing root feeding damage by D. v. virgifera. Applications of nematodes just before or during the time period when third instars are predominant in the field are likely to increase control efficacy.

2500|$|A {{week after}} the egg has been laid, the larva hatches and begins to feed on the leaf bud tissue. This {{activity}} stimulates (in a way not yet understood) the development by the host plant of enlarged 'nutritive' cells {{in the area around}} the growing larva. [...] These are fed on by the larva and are continually replaced by new cells. [...] Further concentric layers of tissues develop around the core nutritive tissue and come to form the structure known as the bedeguar, complete with the outermost and characteristic fibrous outgrowths that give the gall its alternative name of Robin's pincushion. [...] As the larva feeds and grows within this gall, it probably undergoes five <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> stages (the growth stages between moults). [...] The final instar stage is reached by late October. [...] The larva ceases feeding. It now passes into the prepupal stage, in which form it overwinters inside the gall. [...] In the following February or March, the prepupa undergoes a final moult and becomes a pupa. Through the thin, transparent skin of the pupa, it is possible to see the fully formed antennae, legs, wings and body segments of the adult wasp. [...] As stated earlier, the adult wasps which start to emerge from the rose bedeguar will be mostly female, and these females will go on to lay eggs through parthenogenesis. The adults begin to emerge from the old galls, which are still attached to the rose, in May. Emergences may continues through to August. No alternation of generation exists in this species.|$|E

5000|$|Juvenile hormone (JH) {{controls}} insect metamorphosis [...] High JH titers {{maintain the}} larval state while {{a decrease in}} the JH titer initiates the pupation sequence [...] as well as a change in tissue commitment away from synthesis of larval tissues to pupal tissues at the pupal stage [...] The drop in JH titer {{at the beginning of the}} last <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> in the Lepidoptera appears to be due to a combination of increased metabolism [...] and decreased synthesis. In the Lepidoptera, JH is initially metabolized by ester hydrolysis; [...] esterases capable of hydrolyzing JH are detectable in the hemolymph at times during the last <b>larval</b> <b>instar</b> that appear to coincide with reported drops in the JH titre. The JHE's are also selective for the 2E methyl ester of the naturally occurring JH's. These studies suggest that the JHE's may be important in the regulation of the JH titre and therefore involved in the initiation of and the commitment to the pupal stage. JHE's appear to be produced by the fat body [...] and this production can be stimulated by exogenous JH in Hyalophora pupae, a stage devoid of JHE activity. Stimulation of JHE activity by JH has also been noted recently in adults of Leptinotarsa decemlineata [...] and pupae of Galleria mellonella.

S. perflavum larvae were collected in five streams in Central Amazônia (Manaus and Presidente Figueiredo counties, State of Amazonas), in Sept. /Oct. 1996 (dry season) and Feb. /Mar. 1997 (rainy season).
