Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy <b>live</b> <b>loads,</b> such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of loads that {{structure}} engineering must encounter in the design. First type of load is called Dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of load is <b>Live</b> <b>Loads</b> which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of <b>live</b> <b>loads</b> like building loads, highway bridge Loads, railroad bridge Loads, impact loads, wind loads, snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.|$|E
25|$|The {{wind loading}} on a {{skyscraper}} is also considerable. In fact, the lateral wind load imposed on super-tall structures is generally the governing {{factor in the}} structural design. Wind pressure increases with height, so for very tall buildings, the loads associated with wind are larger than dead or <b>live</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|E

Therefore, the design <b>live</b> <b>load</b> for multiple story column can be reduced in proportion to the number of floor supported by the column. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a <b>live</b> <b>load</b> reduction factor for multiple story column. A stochastic <b>live</b> <b>load</b> model for multiple story column is presented using the <b>live</b> <b>load</b> survey results for office buildings.

40|$|<b>Live</b> <b>load</b> {{models are}} {{essential}} to assess the safety of highway bridges. To determine the maximum permissible load, Rhode Island currently uses legal <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models developed for a national level application based on federal weight restrictions. However, the state has allowable limits higher than those mandated federally, therefore, the models are not entirely representative of the truck traffic in the state. Furthermore, the state 2 ̆ 7 s transportation agencies may issue permits for the operation of trucks {{in excess of the}} weight restrictions. To assist in permitting decisions, permit <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models developed from previous applications are introduced in the evaluation of bridges. Changes in the characteristics of permit applications diminishes the effectiveness of the permit <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models. A database of approved permit applications was utilized to analyze the models through their ability to exceed, or envelope, the structural responses due to the applicant trucks. As a results, state-specific 3 - and 5 -axle legal <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models were developed. A validation of the permit <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models was also performed and revealed that they did not perform adequately.

25|$|The {{bridge with}} the {{greatest}} load capacity – as far as can be determined from the limited research – was the Alcántara Bridge the largest arch of which can support a load of 52t, followed by the Ponte de Pedra (30t), Puente Bibei (24t) and Puente de Ponte do Lima (24t) (all in Hispania). According to modern calculations, the Limyra Bridge, Asia Minor, can support a 30t vehicle on one arch plus a load of 500kp/m² on the remaining surface of the arch. The load limit of Roman arch bridges was thus far {{in excess of the}} <b>live</b> <b>loads</b> imposed by ancient traffic.|$|E
25|$|In the {{cable-stayed}} bridge, {{the towers}} {{are the primary}} load-bearing structures which transmit the bridge loads to the ground. A cantilever approach {{is often used to}} support the bridge deck near the towers, but lengths further from them are supported by cables running directly to the towers. This has the disadvantage, compared to the suspension bridge, that the cables pull to the sides as opposed to directly up, requiring the bridge deck to be stronger to resist the resulting horizontal compression loads; but has the advantage of not requiring firm anchorages to resist the horizontal pull of the main cables of the suspension bridge. By design all static horizontal forces of the cable-stayed bridge are balanced so that the supporting towers do not tend to tilt or slide, needing only to resist horizontal forces from the <b>live</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, <b>live</b> <b>loads,</b> moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E
40|$|Historically, bridges are {{evaluated}} using allowable stress and load factor rating methods. Load rating made in these traditional methods does {{not correspond to}} any standard and quantifiable measure of safety and the resulting ratings are often quite conservative. The newly emerging AASHTO load & resistance factor rating (LRFR) method can lead to consistent and uniform safety. But its factors are derived from conservative traffic and multiple presence assumptions, and not based on site-specific information (although the LRFR manual does discuss the derivation of <b>live</b> <b>load</b> factors based on WIM data). This paper presents a <b>live</b> <b>load</b> probabilistic model based on site-specific data, which allows the elimination of {{a substantial portion of}} <b>live</b> <b>load</b> effect modeling uncertainty, as well as a substantial portion of structural analysis modeling error. Random occurrence rate of peak loads and Bayesian updating of measurement uncertainties are considered. Gumbel distribution is found to fit the projected maximum <b>live</b> <b>load</b> very well. Sensitivity studies show the projected maximum <b>live</b> <b>load</b> is not sensitive to the threshold strain above which events are recorded, as long as the threshold is sufficiently high.

40|$|The "Live Loading " of valve packing {{has been}} the topic of many {{articles}} and papers {{over the past few}} years. It has been highly recommended by some, and claimed to have no value by others. The truth is both statements can be correct. It all depends on the individual application. The problem is determining if a valve is a candidate for "Live Loading". In most cases this can be decided by answering a few questions! Is it a packed valve?! Does the valve cycle frequently?! Is it motor operated?! Is the valve difficult to get at?! Is the valve subject to high temperatures & pressures?! Is the valve in a critical application?! Does the valve have a history of packing leaks?! Does the valve have to be monitored under the new EPA regulations? If the answer to the first question and any of the others is yes, there is a good possibility that the valve in question is a candidate for <b>live</b> <b>loading.</b> Many different packing materials can and have been <b>live</b> <b>loaded,</b> but since the graphite based materials are the most commonly used in <b>live</b> <b>load</b> applications, the data referred to has been based on these materials.

40|$|In the {{doctoral}} dissertation a <b>live</b> <b>load</b> model for long span structures was derived. The <b>live</b> <b>load</b> model is valid for spans between 600 ft and 5000 ft {{and it is}} intended to reflect current traffic patterns, quantities of trucks and their weights. The <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models available were developed for short and medium span bridges. Those models were not appropriate for long span bridges due to different types of structure and critical traffic patterns. <b>Live</b> <b>load</b> on long spans depends on traffic mix. One heavily overloaded truck does not have significant influence. Moreover, the continuous {{increase in the number of}} the trucks, their weights, and high percentage of overweight trucks led to a search for the newest traffic data. The database includes variety of sites within many different states. A numerical procedure was developed to process the database and simulate traffic jam situations. From the simulation the values of uniformly distributed load were derived. Trucks were kept in actual order, as recorded in the WIM surveys. Results of the simulations were plotted as a cumulative distribution function of uniformly distributed load for considered span lengths. For longer spans, uniformly distributed load decreases and is closer to the mean value. The bias factors were calculated for the heaviest 75 -year combination of vehicles. The 75 -year uniformly distributed loads were derived from extrapolated distributions. It was stated that for most of the bridges current <b>live</b> <b>load</b> HL- 93 is appropriate. It was also noticed that some bridges, characterized by high ADTT and increased percentage of overloaded loaded vehicles, require special attention and application of increased design <b>live</b> <b>load.</b> The developed <b>live</b> <b>load</b> model is recommended to be taken into consideration in the bridge design code. ...|$|R

But little is known about the effect of <b>live</b> <b>load</b> on seismic response and this report describes an experimental and analytical project that investigates this behavior. The experimental work included shake table testing of a 0. 4 -scale model of a three-span, horizontally curved, steel girder bridge loaded with a series of representative trucks.

40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Civil Engineers {{and can be found}} at: [URL] AASHTO-LRFD specifications use many disparate design provisions to establish <b>live</b> <b>load</b> demands in bridge decks. As an example, approximately 17 % of Chapter 4 addresses the analysis of decks. One of the AASHTO-LRFD analysis methods for decks uses an orthotropic plate model. The present AASHTO-LRFD orthotropic plate model has a single formulation for the plate torsional stiffness, and this is not generally applicable to all deck types. In this paper, new analytical expressions are developed for moment in bridge decks subjected to arbitrary patch loading considering each of the three cases of orthotropy: (1) relatively torsionally stiff, flexurally soft decks; (2) relatively uniformly thick decks (such as a reinforced concrete deck); and (3) relatively torsionally soft, flexurally stiff decks. Using these newly developed expressions, the AASHTO-LRFD notional <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models were combined with impact, multiple presence, and <b>live</b> <b>load</b> factors to determine maximum strong direction <b>live</b> <b>load</b> moments for the Strength I design limit state. Design equations were developed to estimate the maximum strong direction <b>live</b> <b>load</b> moments without performing cumbersome moving load analysis for common deck orientations. Using the proposed formulations, bridge deck strength design demands can now be treated in a unified way across different deck types using only four equations. Application of these methods can significantly reduce and simplify the analysis of decks and allow bridge engineers to make comparisons across different deck design alternatives...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{uses the}} axle weights and axle {{spacings}} of heavy vehicles recorded by weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors {{to calculate the}} load effects on single lane, simply supported structures spanning up to 30 m. The main objective was to compare the load effects caused by the recorded vehicles with those calculated using TMH 7 Part 2 and the alternative <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models proposed in subsequent research. Through the probabilistic analysis of the truck survey data, the thesis predicts the magnitude of extreme events that may occur within a bridge structure's design life. The results reinforce the deï¬ ciencies of TMH 7 Part 2 's NA loading curve to cater for normal traffic conditions on spans of 10 m and less. They also highlight the conservative assumptions made in the conï¬ guration of vehicle convoys used to simulate serviceability loads in 20 m to 30 m spans. The ï¬ ndings of the thesis support {{the need for the}} rational calibration of the partial factors used in limit state design. The WIM data was analysed to highlight the extent of overloading. The results provide evidence that the overloading of individual axles and axle sets is prevalent and that overloading has a greater impact on 5 m and 10 m spans than 30 m spans. Research was carried out into the basis of the bridge <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models in TMH 7 Part 2 and those recently developed in Europe, the United States and Canada.

30|$|At present, bridges are {{designed}} {{based on the}} use of a <b>live</b> <b>load</b> model present in the respective codes, uniformly applied to all bridges. Therefore, some bridges carrying a relatively small volume of traffic {{are designed}} to carry the loads of heavy vehicles that are unlikely to act during their service life, resulting in uneconomical design. In other cases, non-standard bridges, as long-span bridges (cable-stayed, arches,…), may be subject to very high levels of <b>live</b> <b>load</b> that the bridge most probably will never experience. This is because the <b>live</b> <b>load</b> model in the code is normally calibrated for short- and medium-span bridges, and the direct application to very long spans derives on the overestimation of the loading. If it was possible to design a bridge so that it can carry the design load equivalent to the loads of vehicles that usually travel and control bridge performance to structurally offset the loads of heavy vehicles that may be hazardous to the bridge, safety and reliability of the bridge may be ensured against such unexpected heavy loads (Kim et al. 2000). Reducing the design <b>live</b> <b>load</b> may also lead to the reduction of the volume of materials used. This approach should therefore be taken actively also from a viewpoint of resource saving (Holnicki-Szulc and Rodellar 1998).|$|R
