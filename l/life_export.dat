After resulting in a negative but weak correlation, we further alter this model by adding multiple independent variables including HIV/AIDS deaths, arable land per capita, labor force, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) percentage, <b>life</b> expectancy, <b>exports,</b> imports, and people living with HIV.

40|$|Early in <b>life,</b> thymic <b>export</b> {{establishes}} {{the size and}} {{the diversity of the}} human naive T-cell pool. Yet, on puberty thymic activity drastically decreases. Because the over-all size of the naive T-cell pool decreases only marginally during ageing, peripheral postthymic expansion of naive T cells has been postulated to account partly for the maintenance of T-cell immunity in adults. So far, the analysis of these pro-cesses had been hampered by the inabil-ity to distinguish recent thymic emigrants from proliferated, peripheral, naive T cells.

Samples were collected along the processing line; the general microbiological quality (mesophylic and psychrotrophic aerobic plate counts), total Vibrio species and common fish spoilage bacterial counts were performed. The results constantly showed relatively high counts for the psychrotrophic and spoilage bacteria, indicating that most of these bacteria already formed part of the incoming fish. Hake is headed and gutted on board of fishing vessels and delivered to the factory only after 7 – 8 days for final processing. It is likely that this practise of heading and gutting the hake may have a negative effect on microbiological quality of the final product. A sharp increase in the mesophilic and sucrose fermenting Vibrio species counts were observed after filleting. It has been suggested that this contamination could be due to biofilms present in the distribution system for the treated sea-water used during processing. Although, sea-water could be an alternative source of water for marine fish processing plants, the treatment and the quality of the water needs to be carefully managed.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that mRNA-associated events occurring in the nucleus can regulate {{the fate of the}} mRNA in the cytosol. We address the hypothesis that the nuclear history of HIV gag-pol RNA can alter the activity of the encoded protein. In human cells, HIV unspliced RNA normally uses the Crm 1 nuclear export pathway in an RRE/Rev-dependent manner. Routing gag containing RNA nuclear export to another pathway disrupts Gag assembly and particle production for several independent constructs. However, in the context of four tandem copies of the M-PMV CTE (4 × CTE), gag-pol RNA using the NXF 1 nuclear export pathway is translated into Gag protein that can productively assemble. Murine cells are notable for their inability to support normal assembly of HIV particles and we show that altering the RNA nuclear export element used by HIV gag-pol mRNA from the RRE to the 4 × CTE restores both the trafficking of Gag to cellular membranes and efficient particle production in these cells. These results suggest that two phases of the HIV <b>life</b> cycle, RNA <b>export</b> and capsid assembly, that have hitherto been regarded as distinct are, in fact, linked.

In contrast, during adult life the thymus has been thought to play {{only a minor}} role in T cell homeostasis. As individuals age there is an increasing proportion of peripheral T cells bearing a memory phenotype, {{as well as a}} corresponding {{decrease in the number of}} naive T cells. The change in the composition of the peripheral T cell pool with age is thought to occur as a result of reduced or completely curtailed thymic export following thymic involution at puberty together with the antigen-driven expansion of naive T cells in the periphery. We examined thymic <b>export</b> throughout <b>life</b> in fetal, neonatal and aged sheep. We found that the thymus in adult animals showed an efficiency of production and export on a per gram basis equivalent to that observed for much younger animals, and continued to export substantial numbers of T cells long after puberty. The data demonstrate that naive T cells constantly enter the peripheral T cell pool at the same rate throughout fetal, neonatal and adult life, and that one in every 50 T cells in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of aged sheep had emigrated from the thymus in the previous 24 h. The data suggest that restoration by the thymus of a normal peripheral T cell repertoire in chronic T cell-depleting conditions should be possible in adult patients, provided the thymus is not damaged by disease or therapy.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND & AIMS: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) {{syndrome}} is the best-characterized {{form of a}} rare entity called autoimmune enteropathy (AIE). IPEX {{syndrome is}} due to mutations in the FOXP 3 gene, a transcription factor essential for the development and function of the natural regulatory CD 25 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells. We studied a female patient with a polyautoimmune AIE syndrome resembling a mild form of IPEX syndrome but associated with recurrent bacterial infections and mild hypogammaglobulinemia. We hypothesized that this syndrome combined a deficit of FOXP 3 (+) cells and other lymphocyte populations. METHODS: We analyzed the major lymphocyte subsets and the FOXP 3 (+) regulatory system in blood samples obtained during the 2 -year period that followed the last autoimmune manifestation. RESULTS: The patient had severe na? T lymphopenia and a major deficit of FOXP 3 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells, both in circulation and in the highly inflamed intestinal mucosa, but mutations in the FOXP 3 locus were excluded. The blood FOXP 3 (+) pool was devoid of CD 25 (high) cells, but the few regulatory CD 25 (+) cells were functional. Intrinsic defects in the expression of CD 25, FOXP 3, and interleukin 2 were excluded. Upon activation, a small subset of cells, presumably committed to regulatory function, sustained expression of CD 25 and FOXP 3. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral T lymphopenia of both na? and natural regulatory T cells might be the consequence of defective thymic production or the short <b>life</b> span of <b>exported</b> T cells.

Under the pretext of a training exercise, Kotoka, moved his troops from Kumasi to Accra for the coup. Afrifa was his right-hand man in the coup exercise. It turned out later that, unhappy with Nkrumah's strengthening ties with Russia, China and other communist states, the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States had been kept updated about preparations for this coup and may have helped create difficulties for the Nkrumah government to facilitate this. The coup plotters struck while Nkrumah was on a trip to Hanoi, then the capital of North Vietnam. Afrifa's brief was to take the Broadcasting House, the base from which the national radio station broadcast its news and programmes. This succeeded after heavy fighting, allowing Kotoka to go on air to announce the coup d'état to the whole nation.|$|R
40|$|Foreign Minister Bob Carr {{has said}} Australia needs to “know Asia” {{in order to}} prosper, writes Susan Leong and Catherine Gomes for The Conversation.. Delivering {{a speech to the}} Asia Society on behalf of Prime Minister Julia Gillard in New York he argued that “we’ll need Asia-literate {{policies}} and Asia-capable people”. Ken Henry, who heads the Asian century taskforce, has also argued that Australians should, from their earliest years, acquire the cultural and linguistic literacy to “operate more effectively in an Asian-centred world”. So how do we prepare Australians who attend universities today for this new world? A large decline in the uptake of Asian language courses has prompted some experts and public figures to argue for a greater emphasis on studying languages. Without a fluent population they argue, we can’t reach Australia’s full potential in the Asian century. But while learning a foreign language undoubtedly improves one’s cultural awareness, it represents only one part of the puzzle. What we need is to incorporate Asia into curricula more broadly, not just compartmentalise it into separate areas of study. More than Asian Languages Despite its proximity, Asia is a foreign continent to most Australian tertiary students. Its cuisine may be regularly sampled, its people part of everyday <b>life</b> and its <b>exports</b> a fact of life, but Asia as a natural avenue for our aspirations is an alien concept. We don’t advocate that Australia emulates the Asian style of education, dominated by rote learning, especially in maths, science and reading. As Education expert Stephen Dinham argues, this approach does not necessarily translate to greater innovation and creativity. But universities can play a greater role in helping Australians feel comfortable with our place in and relationship to Asia. Understanding Asia But you might ask, is that not exactly what courses teaching Asian languages and Asian history already do? Yes, but it needs to move beyond compartmentalisation of knowledge about Asia and include Asian topics into all kinds of courses, whether discussing the way Asia is represented in mainstream advertising, or becoming more familiar with Asian languages 2 ̆ 7 cadences in a class on community radio. Students need help to move beyond the clichés. A class on the Indian media and movie industry, for example, needs to present a full picture. One that doesn’t just examine Bollywood but looks at shows like Satyamev Jayante, a popular talk show that highlights social issues in India. Lessons on communism and nation-states need to include comparative analyses of how these ideologies and concepts are and were lived in Asia as well as Europe. When discussing the relationship between music and identity, non-English pieces can be used to open up discussions on how technology enables the exploration of both music and culture. The Asia within Australia has some important assets for this task – the many thousands of students at undergraduate and post-graduate level from Asia trained in our higher education institutes. When tapped into and shared in our classrooms their experiences become part of our shared repository of knowledge about the many Asias, from many perspectives. The key to all this is the notion of initiating and recognising Asia as part of everyday life in Australia. Far beyond exotic holiday destinations, Asia is where a significant part of Australia’s future lies and our university students need to become accustomed to and informed on the region’s diversity and many contradictions if we are to make sense of our place in our time within an Asian-centred world.

40|$|Financial markets play an {{important}} role in an economy performing various functions like mobilizing and pooling savings, producing information about investment opportunities, screening and monitoring investments, implementation of corporate governance, diversification and management of risk. These functions influence saving rates, investment decisions, technological innovation and, therefore, have important implications for welfare. In my PhD dissertation I examine the interplay of financial and product markets by looking at different channels through which financial markets may influence an economy. My dissertation consists of four chapters. The first chapter is a co-authored work with Martin Strieborny, a PhD student from the University of Lausanne. The second chapter is a co-authored work with Melise Jaud, a PhD student from the Paris School of Economics. The third chapter is co-authored with both Melise Jaud and Martin Strieborny. The last chapter of my PhD dissertation is a single author paper. Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis analyzes the effect of financial development on growth of contract intensive industries. These industries intensively use intermediate inputs that neither can be sold on organized exchange, nor are reference-priced (Levchenko, 2007; Nunn, 2007). A typical example of a contract intensive industry would be an industry where an upstream supplier has to make investments in order to customize a product for needs of a downstream buyer. After the investment is made and the product is adjusted, the buyer may refuse to meet a commitment and trigger ex post renegotiation. Since the product is customized to the buyer's needs, the supplier cannot sell the product to a different buyer at the original price. This is referred in the literature as the holdup problem. As a consequence, the individually rational suppliers will underinvest into relationship-specific assets, hurting the downstream firms with negative consequences for aggregate growth. The standard way to mitigate the hold up problem is to write a binding contract and to rely on the legal enforcement by the state. However, even the most effective contract enforcement might fail to protect the supplier in tough times when the buyer lacks a reliable source of external financing. This suggests the potential role of financial intermediaries, banks in particular, in mitigating the incomplete contract problem. First, financial products like letters of credit and letters of guarantee can substantially decrease a risk and transaction costs of parties. Second, a bank loan can serve as a signal about a buyer's true financial situation, an upstream firm will be more willing undertake relationship-specific investment knowing that the business partner is creditworthy and will abstain from myopic behavior (Fama, 1985; von Thadden, 1995). Therefore, a well-developed financial (especially banking) system should disproportionately benefit contract intensive industries. The empirical test confirms this hypothesis. Indeed, contract intensive industries seem to grow faster in countries with a well developed financial system. Furthermore, this effect comes from a more developed banking sector rather than from a deeper stock market. These results are reaffirmed examining the effect of US bank deregulation on the growth of contract intensive industries in different states. Beyond an overall pro-growth effect, the bank deregulation seems to disproportionately benefit the industries requiring relationship-specific investments from their suppliers. Chapter 2 of my PhD focuses on the role of the financial sector in promoting exports of developing countries. In particular, it investigates how credit constraints affect the ability of firms operating in agri-food sectors of developing countries to keep exporting to foreign markets. Trade in high-value agri-food products from developing countries has expanded enormously over the last two decades offering opportunities for development. However, trade in agri-food is governed by a growing array of standards. Sanitary and Phytosanitary standards (SPS) and technical regulations impose additional sunk, fixed and operating costs along the firms' <b>export</b> <b>life.</b> Such costs may be detrimental to firms' survival, "pricing out" producers that cannot comply. The existence of these costs suggests a potential role of credit constraints in shaping the duration of trade relationships on foreign markets. A well-developed financial system provides the funds to exporters necessary to adjust production processes in order to meet quality and quantity requirements in foreign markets and to maintain long-standing trade relationships. The products with higher needs for financing should benefit the most from a well functioning financial system. This differential effect calls for a difference-in-difference approach initially proposed by Rajan and Zingales (1998). As a proxy for demand for financing of agri-food products, the sanitary risk index developed by Jaud et al. (2009) is used. The empirical literature on standards and norms show high costs of compliance, both variable and fixed, for high-value food products (Garcia-Martinez and Poole, 2004; Maskus et al., 2005). The sanitary risk index reflects the propensity of products to fail health and safety controls on the European Union (EU) market. Given the high costs of compliance, the sanitary risk index captures the demand for external financing to comply with such regulations. The prediction is empirically tested examining the export survival of different agri-food products from firms operating in Ghana, Mali, Malawi, Senegal and Tanzania. The results suggest that agri-food products that require more financing to keep up with food safety regulation of the destination market, indeed sustain longer in foreign market, when they are exported from countries with better developed financial markets. Chapter 3 analyzes the link between financial markets and efficiency of resource allocation in an economy. Producing and exporting products inconsistent with a country's factor endowments constitutes a serious misallocation of funds, which undermines competitiveness of the economy and inhibits its long term growth. In this chapter, inefficient exporting patterns are analyzed through the lens of the agency theories from the corporate finance literature. Managers may pursue projects with negative net present values because their perquisites or even their job might depend on them. Exporting activities are particularly prone to this problem. Business related to foreign markets involves both high levels of additional spending and strong incentives for managers to overinvest. Rational managers might have incentives to push for exports that use country's scarce factors which is suboptimal from a social point of view. Export subsidies might further skew the incentives towards inefficient exporting. Management can divert the export subsidies into investments promoting inefficient exporting. Corporate finance literature stresses the disciplining role of outside debt in counteracting the internal pressures to divert such "free cash flow" into unprofitable investments. Managers can lose both their reputation and the control of "their" firm if the unpaid external debt triggers a bankruptcy procedure. The threat of possible failure to satisfy debt service payments pushes the managers toward an efficient use of available resources (Jensen, 1986; Stulz, 1990; Hart and Moore, 1995). The main sources of debt financing in the most countries are banks. The disciplining role of banks might be especially important in the countries suffering from insufficient judicial quality. Banks, in pursuing their rights, rely on comparatively simple legal interventions that can be implemented even by mediocre courts. In addition to their disciplining role, banks can promote efficient exporting patterns in a more direct way by relaxing credit constraints of producers, through screening, identifying and investing in the most profitable investment projects. Therefore, a well-developed domestic financial system, and particular banking system, would help to push a country's exports towards products congruent with its comparative advantage. This prediction is tested looking at the survival of different product categories exported to US market. Products are identified according to the Euclidian distance between their revealed factor intensity and the country's factor endowments. The results suggest that products suffering from a comparative disadvantage (labour-intensive products from capital-abundant countries) survive less on the competitive US market. This pattern is stronger if the exporting country has a well-developed banking system. Thus, a strong banking sector promotes exports consistent with a country comparative advantage. Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis further examines the role of financial markets in fostering efficient resource allocation in an economy. In particular, the allocative efficiency hypothesis is investigated in the context of equity market liberalization. Many empirical studies document a positive and significant effect of financial liberalization on growth (Levchenko et al. 2009; Quinn and Toyoda 2009; Bekaert et al., 2005). However, the decrease in the cost of capital and the associated growth in investment appears rather modest in comparison to the large GDP growth effect (Bekaert and Harvey, 2005; Henry, 2000, 2003). Therefore, financial liberalization may have a positive impact on growth through its effect on the allocation of funds across firms and sectors. Free access to international capital markets allows the largest and most profitable domestic firms to borrow funds in foreign markets (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). As domestic banks loose some of their best clients, they reoptimize their lending practices seeking new clients among small and younger industrial firms. These firms are likely to be more risky than large and established companies. Screening of customers becomes prevalent as the return to screening rises. Banks, ceteris paribus, tend to focus on firms operating in comparative-advantage sectors because they are better risks. Firms in comparative-disadvantage sectors finding it harder to finance their entry into or survival in export markets either exit or refrain from entering export markets. On aggregate, one should therefore expect to see less entry, more exit, and shorter survival on export markets in those sectors after financial liberalization. The paper investigates the effect of financial liberalization on a country's export pattern by comparing the dynamics of entry and exit of different products in a country export portfolio before and after financial liberalization. The results suggest that products that lie far from the country's comparative advantage set tend to disappear relatively faster from the country's export portfolio following the liberalization of financial markets. In other words, financial liberalization tends to rebalance the composition of a country's export portfolio towards the products that intensively use the economy's abundant factors...|$|R
