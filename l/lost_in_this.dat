5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island, the Battle of the Solomons, the Battle of Friday the 13th, or, in Japanese sources, the , took place from 12–15 November 1942, and was the decisive engagement in a series of naval battles between Allied (primarily American) and Imperial Japanese forces during the months-long Guadalcanal Campaign in the Solomon Islands during World War II. The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days, most near Guadalcanal and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island. The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, South Dakota, and cruiser , but all {{of their}} torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.|$|E

5|$|In March 1942 the {{squadron}} moved to RAF Redhill, Surrey where it assumed No. 452 Squadron's front line duties {{as part of}} No. 11 Group RAF. These included shipping protection patrols, escorting bombers, conducting fighter sweeps over northern France and contributing to the air defence of southern England. Fighter Command had received authorisation to launch a full-scale offensive campaign against German air units shortly before No.457 Squadron arrived at Redhill, and it became part of this effort. The squadron first saw action on 26March when Brothers shot down a Bf109 during a multi-squadron fighter sweep over France, though one of its Spitfires was <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> action. By {{the end of its}} first week of operations No.457 Squadron had shot down three German aircraft and inflicted damage on several others and it went on to conduct 32 operations over German territory by 26April. These operations often encountered fierce opposition, and German Fw190 fighters proved superior to the Spitfire Mark Vs that No.457 Squadron was equipped with. The squadron scored its last victory over Europe on 29April, though fighter sweeps over France continued until almost the end of May.|$|E

25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then mix it with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net thrust. The limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E

25|$|No. 93 Squadron {{saw only}} limited combat {{before the end}} of the war. The first {{aircraft}} to arrive at Labuan began flying combat sorties on 26 July in conjunction with No. 1 Squadron. On 7 August, eight Beaufighters attacked and sank what was believed to be an 800-ton oil tanker in the Tabuan River. It was later determined that the ship was the Rajah of Sarawak's private yacht. One aircraft was <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> attack, but its crew bailed out and made contact with the 9th Division on 20 August after being assisted by civilians. The squadron flew its last combat missions on 13 August, when four aircraft made an armed reconnaissance of Kuching aerodrome and another eight attacked Tromboul Airfield.|$|E
25|$|The third tale, Guardian of the Solar System, {{finds the}} house and Sara finally separating. She trades places with a man named Robert, to whom she had told stories and granted wishes for many years. The trade, Robert's final wish, gives him {{the ability to do}} almost anything, {{although}} it necessitates sacrificing his body. Sara is suddenly reborn in a new version of her original body, albeit slightly older and with a thousand years of memories. However, she has no idea what happened to the real Sara after she left the house. This new Sara feels <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> new world, so Robert grants her final wish. The TARDIS materializes in front of her; inside it, the Doctor (implied to be an incarnation other than the first) wonders what force dragged it down to Earth.|$|E
25|$|When {{the pasta}} leaves the dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12% which helps the pasta to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. Drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to lose the excess moisture in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and {{one third of the}} excess moisture is <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the spiral-can {{system was}} {{essentially}} a rotating version of a conventional A-scope display. In the A-scope, a time base generator pulls the CRT beam across the screen horizontally, and blips indicate the range to the target along the line the radar is currently pointed. For spiral-scan the only difference was that the line was no longer always horizontal, but was rotating around {{the face of the}} display at the same speed as the dish. Blips on the screen now indicated two values, the angle of the target relative to the centreline, and the range to the target represented by the distance from the centre. What was <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> display was a direct indication of magnitude of the angle from the centre; a blip to the upper right indicated the target was in that direction but did not directly indicate if it was five, ten or twenty degrees off.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the females}} {{incubate}} the eggs. Once the female has laid the eggs, the male stops displaying {{and leaves the}} breeding grounds. This is unlike {{other members of the}} calidris genus where incubation is shared between males and females; therefore, the trait of male incubation has been independently <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species. There are only three documented species who have been known to share this behaviour. This development seems bizarre since experiments have shown that a decrease in the amount of male care is linked to a decrease in male fitness by lowering the number of male descendants that survive. One explanation for this evolution is that a decrease in male care allows the males to explore other breeding options. This hypothesis ties in {{with the fact that the}} white-rumped sandpiper is polygynous; males will mate with several females but females will only mate with one male.|$|E
25|$|The Prussian army of 200,000 men now besieged {{the city}} of Metz, where 3 French marshals, 50 generals, 135,000 men, and 600 guns were encircled. Bazaine {{attempted}} to break the siege at Noisseville on 31 August but the French were repulsed, losing 3,500 men in the attempt. There were supplies in Metz to last {{no more than a}} month, such that by early September the order was given for work horses to be slaughtered for food. By mid September, cavalry horses also began to be slaughtered. Without cavalry and horses to pull the guns, Bazaine's ability to mount effective attempts to break out rapidly diminished. On 7 October, hungry and immobilised, Bazaine dispatched two 40,000 man foraging parties along both banks of the Moselle, but the Prussian guns blew the French wagons off the road and the Prussian infantry cut swathes through the desperate French soldiers with Chassepots captured at Sedan. Over 2,000 men were <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> operation. Typhus and smallpox was spreading and by 10 October, it is estimated that 19,000 of the French troops in Metz were hospitalised. A further attempt was made to break the siege on 18 October at Bellevue, but again the French troops were repulsed, with the loss of 1,250 men. The city was on its knees, the troops and inhabitants on the point of starvation.|$|E
