He briefly co-hosted Candid Camera with creator Allen Funt, but that relationship, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> ended acrimoniously; Godfrey hosted at least one broadcast without Funt. Godfrey also made various guest appearances, and he and Lucille Ball co-hosted the CBS special 50 Years of Television (1978). He also made a cameo appearance in the 1979 B-movie Angels Revenge.|$|E
25|$|Hoffecker was {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Whig Party, but <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> became a Republican in 1856. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1876 and 1884. He was also president of the Smyrna town council from 1878 until 1898. Elected to the State House in 1888, he served in the 1889/90 session and was chosen to be the Speaker. He ran for Governor in 1896 as the candidate of the Union (Addicks) Republicans and the National Prohibition Party. However, enough votes went to the Regular Republican candidate, John C. Higgins, that the Democrat, Ebe W. Tunnell was elected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> Étienne was {{eventually}} {{forced to flee}} Paris because of {{his opposition to the}} fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.|$|E

25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
25|$|The next {{victim was}} a young nomadic Sephardic Jew, Vitali Hakim, whose burnt body {{was found on the}} road to the Pattaya resort, where Sobhraj and his growing clan were staying. Dutch {{students}} Henk Bintanja, 29, and his fiancée Cornelia Hemker, 25, were invited to Thailand after meeting Sobhraj in Hong Kong. They, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> were poisoned by Sobhraj, who then nurtured them back to health in order to gain their obedience. As they recovered, Sobhraj was visited by his previous victim Hakim's French girlfriend, Charmayne Carrou, who had come to investigate her boyfriend's disappearance. Fearing exposure, Sobhraj and Chowdhury quickly hustled the couple out. Their bodies were found strangled and burned on 16 December 1975. Soon after, Carrou was found drowned and wearing a similar-styled swimsuit to that of Sobhraj's earlier victim, Teresa Knowlton. Although the murders of both women were not connected by investigations at the time, they would later earn Sobhraj the nickname The Bikini Killer.|$|E
25|$|Lady Isle was at {{one time}} {{connected}} with an ancient ecclesiastical establishment near Adamton, called Lady Kirk, and situated about four miles north of Ayr. As stated, a chapel was built, here dedicated to the Virgin Mary and endowed by John Blair in 1446 with the common land of Adamton. John Adair's map indicates a religious building as being located in {{the centre of the}} island and Pont also indicates a structure of some sort, well before any beacons were built. John Adair uses the name Mary Isle for the island, suggesting that this pre-reformation (c.1560s) 'chapel', <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> was dedicated to Saint Mary. It is more than likely that the beacons were built using stones from this chapel or 'cell' and no signs now remain of this ecclesiastical structure. When the bird observatory and warden's post was being built, the architect noted that there were signs of some sort of ancient ecclesiastical building on the island.|$|E

With all this, however, Mr. Pound, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E

[...] By 1924, Greyhound {{had been out of}} service for many years, and all that remained was her hull. [...] She was still in good enough shape to warrant hauling her out in Tacoma in 1924, for repair, caulking and painting.

Not {{everything}} is permitted against these men and women, against these fathers and mothers. They {{are part of the}} human species. They are our brothers <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> A Christian should not forget this". The words encouraged other clerics like the Capuchin monk Père Marie-Benoît, who saved many Jews in Marseille and later in Rome where he became known among the Jewish community as [...] "father of the Jews". Marie-Rose Gineste transported a pastoral letter from Bishop Théas of Montauban by bicycle to forty parishes, denouncing the uprooting of men and women [...] "treated as wild animals", and the French Resistance smuggled the text to London, where it was broadcast to France by the BBC, reaching tens of thousands of homes.|$|E
2500|$|Testament to {{the extent}} of the carnage and {{suffering}} during the battle was the story of Richard Rowland Kirkland, a Confederate Army sergeant with Company G, 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry. Stationed at the stone wall by the sunken road below Marye's Heights, Kirkland had a close up view to the suffering and <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> was appalled at the cries for help of the Union wounded throughout the cold winter night of December 13, 1862. After obtaining permission from his commander, Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw, Kirkland gathered canteens and in broad daylight, without the benefit of a cease fire or a flag of truce (refused by Kershaw), provided water to numerous Union wounded lying on the field of battle. Union soldiers held their fire as it was obvious what Kirkland's intent was. Kirkland was nicknamed the [...] "Angel of Marye's Heights" [...] for these actions, and is memorialized with a statue by Felix de Weldon on the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park where he carried out his actions. Details of this story (first recorded in 1880) conflict with multiple after-action reports and may have been embellished and personalized for effect.|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, Rameau's music {{remained}} unplayed, {{known only}} by reputation. Hector Berlioz investigated Castor et Pollux and particularly admired the aria [...] "Tristes apprêts," [...] but [...] "whereas the modern listener readily perceives the common ground with Berlioz' music, he himself was more conscious of the gap which separated them." [...] French humiliation in the Franco-Prussian War brought about a change in Rameau's fortunes. As Rameau biographer J. Malignon wrote, [...] "...the German victory over France in 1870–71 was the grand occasion for digging up great heroes from the French past. Rameau, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> was flung into the enemy's face to bolster our courage and our faith in the national destiny of France." [...] In 1894, composer Vincent d'Indy founded the Schola Cantorum to promote French national music; the society put on several revivals of works by Rameau. Among the audience was Claude Debussy, who especially cherished Castor et Pollux, revived in 1903: [...] "Gluck's genius was deeply rooted in Rameau's works... a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that Gluck could replace Rameau on the French stage only by assimilating the latter's beautiful works and making them his own." [...] Camille Saint-Saëns (by editing and publishing the Pièces in 1895) and Paul Dukas were two other important French musicians who gave practical championship to Rameau's music in their day, but interest in Rameau petered out again, {{and it was not}} until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works. Over half of Rameau's operas have now been recorded, in particular by conductors such as John Eliot Gardiner, William Christie, and Marc Minkowski.|$|E
