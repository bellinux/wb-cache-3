40|$|Commercial banks emerged at a {{time when}} {{contracts}} were quite incomplete and property rights insecure. They typically offered demand deposits, made <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> and were regulated. Each of these aspects of the institutional structure were essential in helping the bank provide the twin functions of liquidity and safety. I argue that recent theories of banking, which I collectively refer to as “Incomplete Contract ” theories of banking, explain well the origins of banking. I also claim that they can explain recent changes in banking; as the informational, legal, and property rights environment has improved, there appear to be fewer synergies between various aspects of the traditional institutional structure of the bank. It is now time to think whether there is anything special about the institutional form of the bank, or whether all that is special is that it is regulated. 1 Prepared for the conference on Comparative Financial Systems at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland i...|$|E
40|$|I {{develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework for analyzing {{the effect of the}} availability of institutional <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> firms' <b>demand</b> for supplier (trade) finance. I test for the existence of credit constraints and their effect on corporate financing policies. My empirical results support the hypothesis that trade credit is taken up by firms as a substitute for institutional finance at the margin when they are credit constrained. Further, in line with studies on the credit channel of monetary policy transmission, I find an increased reliance on trade credit by financially constrained firms during periods of tight money.

5000|$|This contribution, {{called the}} [...] "cumulative process," [...] implied {{that if the}} natural rate of {{interest}} was not equal to the interest rate <b>on</b> <b>loans,</b> investment <b>demand</b> and savings would differ. If the interest rate is beneath the natural rate, an economic expansion occurs, and prices, ceteris paribus, will rise. This gave an early theory of endogenous money - money created by the internal workings of the economy, rather than external factors, and various theories of endogenous money have since developed.|$|R
40|$|Poverty {{remains a}} {{pervasive}} problem {{all over the}} world, {{but the problem is}} worst in underdeveloped areas like Africa. While microfinance is supposed to address this problem through the promotion of viable businesses, it has not been very successful in helping survival microenterprises, i. e., businesses that the very poor with limited human capital have access to, in sectors with low barriers to entry and selling undifferentiated products. In this paper, I examine the role of market structure in mediating the impact of micro-lending to such survival enterprises. While there have been many evaluations of microfinance institutions (MFIs), there have been very few that look at market conditions as an input into the success of micro-lending. My theoretical analysis suggests that when introducing an extensive program of microcredit in undeveloped and relatively isolated rural areas, it is important to look at how the market structure mediates the impact of the provision of <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> the <b>demand</b> and supply for the end-product or service. I present some empirical evidence, which provides partial confirmation that MFIs are not currently taking these considerations into account...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{estimated}} {{using data from}} INSEEs 1996 Housing survey and 1997 Assets survey to measure {{the effect of the}} no-interest <b>loan</b> (NIL) <b>on</b> housing <b>demand</b> (this estimate concerns the effect of the NIL before the recent change in January 2005). The findings show that the no-interest loan definitely boosted home ownership and that this effect concerned mainly the most modest households among the homeowners. Most of these households have purportedly stayed, in the absence of assistance, in the dwelling they occupy until such time as they build the savings necessary for a down payment. However, the NIL suffers from substantial windfall effects. A full 85 % of beneficiaries in a given period are reported to have chosen to move to become homeowners regardless of the absence of the no-interest loan. The NIL does necessarily contribute to the general improvement in the quality of new housing put on the market. Housing, Borrowing Constraints, Tenure Choice, Mobility, Homeownership...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the impact of Federal Reserve membership on the price of bank services, mainly average loan rates service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and average deposit rates. In addition, this research investigated the influence of the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market on member banks pricing policies. ^ The research design involved the formulation of a system of equations incorporating bank inputs, output and the pricing of bank services. The system was estimated for all the sampled states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska) as a group and for individual states (after the necessary modifications) using Three Stage Least Squares. ^ The data were secured from three sources: First, the balance sheets and income statements for insured commercial banks in the four sampled states from 1972 - 1977 were obtained from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Second: total population, retail sales, effective buying income and median household effective buying income were obtained from various issues of Sales and Marketing Management magazine. Finally, the adjusted monetary base (seasonally adjusted) figures were obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ^ Within the context of the theoretical framework that bank input, output, and the pricing decisions are simultaneously determined, the statistical results indicated that, on the average, member banks in the four states as a whole, had charged their customers lower average rates <b>on</b> <b>loans,</b> and lower service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits. In addition, the findings suggested that the higher the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market, the higher the service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and the lower average rates on time and savings deposits. However, the statistical results indicated that the effect of FRS was contingent on the state where member banks were located. For individual state, the findings were as follows: (1) Illinois member banks charged their customers higher average rates <b>on</b> <b>loans</b> and lower service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits than nonmember banks. (2) Iowa member banks charged their customers higher average rates <b>on</b> <b>loans,</b> higher service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the higher the average loan rate and the service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits. (3) Kansas member banks charged their customers higher service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the concentration ratio of member banks in the market the lower the service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and average deposits rate. (4) Nebraska member banks charged their customers lower average rates <b>on</b> <b>loans,</b> lower service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the lower the service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits. ^ Including the interaction term between FRS membership and the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market yielded no statistically significant results for the sample as a whole. However, it was found that member banks in markets dominated by member banks charged their customers higher service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits (in the state of Illinois), lower service charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits (in the state of Kansas) and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits (in the state of Nebraska). ...|$|R
