The chargers are all off-board, and capable of active power <b>line</b> <b>conditioning</b> and bi-directional power flow to compensate local utilities during peak power loads. The active power <b>line</b> <b>conditioning</b> capability is important, since an increase of battery chargers based on ordinary diode rectifiers would increase the low order harmonic content in grid currents. The battery chargers studied are one hard switched with a voltage-stiff dc link, and three soft switched with quasi-resonant dc links. Performance characteristics and energy conversion efficiency were evaluated from simulations. Indeed, the results imply that quasi resonant topologies have higher efficiency than hard switched. The drawback with the soft switched dc links studied is the additional components, active and passive, needed for quasi-resonant operation.

40|$|Abstract — The {{multilevel}} converter {{has drawn}} tremendous {{interest in the}} power industry. The general structure of the multilevel converter is to synthesize a sinusoidal voltage from several levels of voltages. Multilevel voltage source converters are emerging as {{a new breed of}} power converter options for high power applications. These converter topologies can generate high-quality voltage waveforms with power semiconductor switches operating at a frequency near the fundamental. Among the available multilevel converter topologies, the cascaded multilevel converter constitutes a promising alternative, providing a modular design that can be extended to allow a transformer less connection. A three-phase, seven level cascaded multilevel voltage source inverter with reduced number of switches based DSTATCOM for power <b>line</b> <b>conditioning</b> to improve power quality in the distribution network is used which will compensate the distorted line current harmonics and reactive power.

40|$|The goal of many human disease-oriented {{studies is}} to detect {{molecular}} mechanisms different between healthy controls and patients. Yet, commonly used gene expression measurements from any tissues suffer from variability of cell composition. This variability hinders {{the detection of}} differentially expressed genes and is often ignored. However, this variability may actually be advantageous, as heterogeneous gene expression measurements coupled with cell counts may provide deeper insights into the gene expression differences on the cell type-specific level. Published computational methods use linear regression to estimate cell type-specific differential expression. Yet, they do not consider many artifacts hidden in high-dimensional gene expression data that may negatively affect the performance of linear regression. In this dissertation we specifically address the parameter space involved in the most rigorous use of linear regression to estimate cell type-specific differential expression and report under which conditions significant detection is probable. We define parameters affecting the sensitivity of cell type-specific differential expression estimation as follows: sample size, cell type-specific proportion variability, mean squared error (spread of observations around linear regression <b>line),</b> <b>conditioning</b> of the cell proportions predictor matrix, {{and the size of}} actual cell type-specific differential expression. Each parameter, with the exception of cell type-specific differential expression (effect size), affects the variability of cell type-specific differential expression estimates.

To this end we have published an R package, LRCDE, available in GitHub ([URL] which outputs observed statistics of cell type-specific differential expression, including two-sample t- statistic, t-statistic p-value, and power calculated from two-sample t-statistic on a genomic site- by-site basis...|$|E
40|$|Environmental aspects have {{during the}} last years made {{electric}} vehicles an interesting competitor to the present internal combustion engine driven vehicles. For a broad introduction of pure electric vehicles, a battery charging infrastructure is deemed necessary. However, to build and maintain such an infrastructure is costly. Active power <b>line</b> <b>conditioning</b> capabilities could {{be included in the}} battery charger, making the infrastructure advantageous from the distribution network point of view. Another option is that the battery charger could be able to support the grid with peak power during periods of stability problems or emergency situations. This means that energy is borrowed from the batteries of vehicles connected to a charger. The price for energy supplied by the batteries is likely to be several times higher than the normal electric energy price, due to the wear costs of the batteries. Therefore, the battery charger losses also represents a high cost. It is often stated that resonant converters have a high efficiency compared to hard switched. Since carrier based pulse width modulation is employed, quasi resonant DC link converters are of interest. Four of the most promising quasi resonant DC link topologies reported in the literature are compared. A fair comparison is obtained by designing them to meet certain common design criteria, in this case the duration of the zero voltage interval and the maximum output voltage time derivative. The derivation of the design expressions are given, and also the simulation results, by means of efficiency. A 10 kW battery charger, equipped with one of the quasi resonant DC links investigated is implemented. A hard switched battery charger with the same rating is also tested to compare the measured efficiency with the simulated. Both the simulations and measurements shows that the efficiency decrease for quasi resonant battery chargers compared to the hard switched case. Furthermore, low frequency harmonics appear in the battery charger input and output currents. However, full control of the output voltage derivatives is obtained...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{pollution}} issues created in power systems {{are due to}} the non-linear characteristics and fast switching of power electronic equipment. Power quality issues are becoming stronger because sensitive equipment will be more sensitive for market competition reasons, equipment will continue polluting the system more and more due to cost increase caused by the built-in compensation and sometimes {{for the lack of}} enforced regulations. Efficiency and cost are considered today almost at the same level. Active power filters have been developed over the years to solve these problems to improve power quality. Among which shunt active power filter is used to eliminate and load current harmonics and reactive power compensation. The active power filter (APF) is implemented with PWM based current controlled voltage source inverter (VSI). This VSI switching signals are generated through proposed three-level hysteresis current controller (HCC) that achieves significant reduction in the magnitude and variation of the switching frequency; it is indicating improved performance compared to 2 -level HCC. The shunt APLC system is modeled and investigated under different unbalanced non-linear load conditions using MATLAB programs. The simulation results reveal that the active power filter is effectively compensating the current harmonics and reactive power at point of common coupling. The active power line conditioner system is in compliance with IEEE 519 and IEC 61000 - 3 recommended harmonic standards. Due to non-linear characteristics the load current gets distorted which causes undesirable effects like heating, equipment damages, EMI effects etc. in power network. The active power filter (APF) is the best solution for eliminating the harmonics caused by the non-linear loads.
