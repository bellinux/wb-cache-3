25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by history, {{environmental}} conditions, auscultation of the ventral abdomen, radiographs, ultrasound, or fecal examination (See Diagnosis). Historically, medical {{treatment of the}} problem is with laxatives such as <b>liquid</b> <b>paraffin</b> or oil and psyllium husk. More recently veterinarians treat cases with specific synbiotic (pro and prebiotic) and psyllium combinations. Psyllium is the most effective medical treatment. It works by binding to the sand to help remove it, although multiple treatments may be required. Mineral oil is mostly ineffective since it floats {{on the surface of the}} impaction, rather than penetrating it. Horses with sand or dirt impaction are predisposed to Salmonella infection and other Gi bacteria, so antibiotics are often added to help prevent infection. Medical management usually resolves the colic, but if improvement doesn't occur within a few hours then surgery must be performed to flush the colon of any sand, which procedure that has a 60–65% survival rate. Horses that are not treated, or treated too late after the onset of clinical signs, are at risk of death.|$|E

Unlike the thick-cased Mark 83 bombs filled with Composition H6, the AN/M65A1 bombs were thin-skinned and filled with Composition B, an older explosive with greater shock and heat sensitivity. Composition B also had the dangerous tendency to become more powerful (up to 50% by weight) and more sensitive if it was old or improperly stored. Forrestal's ordnance handlers had never even seen an AN/M65A1 before, and to their shock, the bombs delivered from Diamond Head were in terrible condition; coated with [...] "decades of accumulated rust and grime" [...] and still in their original packing crates (now moldy and rotten); some were stamped with production dates as early as 1953.

This study deals {{with the effects of}} scale and the presence of internals on hydrodynamic characteristics, for scale-up purposes based on experiments in cold mockups. Our study shows that the liquid recirculation intensity depends strongly on the column diameter whereas the gas holdup is slightly affected. Two methods are proposed to predict scale effect on liquid velocity: an empirical correlation proposed in the literature and a phenomenological model. Internals guide liquid: the large scale recirculation increases but fluctuations of liquid velocity decrease. Therefore the mixing of liquid is significantly affected by the presence of internals and is not well described by the standard mono dimensional axial dispersion model. A two-dimensional model, taking into account a radially dependent axial velocity profile and both axial and radial dispersion, is therefore developed to describe the liquid mixing in a bubble column with internals...|$|R
