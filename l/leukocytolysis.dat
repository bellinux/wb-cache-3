40|$|<b>Leukocytolysis</b> was {{determined}} {{under conditions of}} hypokinesia of 10 days to 1 month duration in healthy persons and in experiments on albino rats of 1 month duration. It was found that prolonged restriction of movement resulted, both in clinical and experimental conditions, in a considerable increase of <b>leukocytolysis</b> (by two-three-fold). <b>Leukocytolysis</b> also continued for several days after cessation of hypokinesia...|$|E
40|$|Salivary fluids of Blaberus craniifer, {{a common}} pest species of cockroach, {{were found to}} produce <b>leukocytolysis</b> and {{hemagglutination}} reactions of human blood cells under in vitro conditions. Blood sera from these insects produced similar reactions, {{as well as the}} capacity to lyse human erythrocytes. The cockroach is known to regurgitate while feeding. These findings suggest the potential of the insect to induce adverse effects on human blood cells as a consequence of persons being bitten or having lesions that serve as skin sites for cockroach feeding...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral blood leukocytes from {{guinea pigs}} {{infected}} with Coccidioides immitis 5 weeks previously were lysed significantly when incubated at 37 C for 3. 5 hr with a concentrated C. immitis culture filtrate, {{but not with}} a concentrated Aspergillus fumigatus or Blastomyces dermatitidis culture filtrate. Mononuclear leukocytes and presumably granulocytes were both lysed. Characterization of the factor responsible for this <b>leukocytolysis</b> reaction revealed that it was contained in plasma and serum but not in leukocytes from infected guinea pigs. It was complement-dependent, active after heating at 56 C, and stable after storage at − 20 C {{for as long as}} 14 months...|$|E
40|$|Njoku-Obi, Augustine N. (School of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee Institute, Ala.), Edward M. Jenkins, Jessie C. Njoku-Obi, Joanne Adams, and Verdell Covington. Production {{and nature}} of Listeria monocytogenes hemolysins. J. Bacteriol. 86 : 1 – 8. 1963. —Hemolysin {{produced}} by various strains of Listeria monocytogenes varied in quality and quantity, depending on medium, incubation temperature and time, and biological variations in the organisms. The hemolysin was inactivated by filtration (through Seitz, Selas, or sintered-glass filters), heat, oxygen, and formalin. Sodium thiosulfate reactivated hemolysin inactivated by filtration and oxygen. The hemolysin was protein in nature, migrating electrophoretically as a gamma-globulin, and highly antigenic in the rabbit. Although no toxicity was observed in intact mice injected with hemolysin, a possible <b>leukocytolysis</b> was noted with isolated mice peritoneal exudate cells. Due to the high antihemolytic activity of normal sera from various species, the possible use of an antilisteriolysin test in serological diagnosis is questioned...|$|E
40|$|Islet allografts are {{particularly}} vulnerable to rejection, and current immunosuppressive agents are deleterious to their function. They are, however, highly suitable for 'immunomodulation', i. e., the removal or inactivation of passenger leukocytes to reduce their immunogenicity. For this purpose we have used 3 rat anti-dog monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) which are synergistic for <b>leukocytolysis</b> {{in the presence of}} autologous dog serum. Spleen cells or purified islets treated with these Mabs together with autologous serum were tested in mixed leukocyte and islet co-culture assays. The stimulatory properties of the Mab-pretreated splenocytes or islets were markedly reduced; moreover, the Mab cytolytic activity was shown to be confined to the leukocyte target cells and did not affect islet secretory function upon glucose stimulation. We conclude that this method of modifying the immunogenicity of dog islets could lead to successful islet grafting in vivo, allowing the reduction of conventional immunosuppression. Successful in vivo studies in this model, which are currently in progress, could have implications for clinical islet transplantation...|$|E
40|$|The binding of 125 I-labeled S {{component}} to rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes {{was found to}} be concentration dependent and saturable at 37 °C. Scatchard analysis of the binding curve gave a straight line, indicating that S component binds to a single population of sites. The dissociation constant, KD, derived from the Scatchard plot was 5. 57 × 10 − 9 M, and the number of binding sites per leukocyte was calculated to be approximately 5, 300. Unlabeled S component (10 − 8 M) or subunit B of cholera toxin (10 − 7 M) readily competed with 125 I-labeled S component binding, and the labeled S component, preincubated with ganglioside GM 1 at equimolar proportions for 5 min, lost the binding capacity to the leukocyte membranes. The binding number of 125 I-labeled F {{component to}} leukocidin-sensitive cells, such as rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the established human myelocytic leukemia cells, in the absence and {{in the presence of the}} unlabeled S component (2. 1 nM), was calculated to be 50 and 1, 300 molecules per cell, respectively. This increased binding of the labeled F component was time and temperature dependent. The binding number of labeled F component to other cell types comparatively insensitive to leukocidin, such as erythrocytes, adipocytes, intestinal cells, and HeLa cells, was calculated to be less than 50 molecules per cell in spite of the sufficient amount of unlabeled S component bound to their cells. These observations are consistent with the view that in rabbit leukocyte the S component, preferentially bound to the cell surface at 5, 300 molecules per cell, contributes to enhance the F component binding up to about 1, 300 molecules per cell and may thus play a role of synergistic action of both leukocidin components on the cell membranes in the <b>leukocytolysis...</b>|$|E
