5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} <b>Laser</b> <b>Interferometer</b> Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Laser</b> <b>Interferometer</b> Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century much {{progress}} was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by <b>laser</b> <b>interferometer</b> techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.|$|E

40|$|The {{observed}} {{microwave background}} anisotropies {{in combination with}} the theory of quantum mechanically generated cosmological perturbations predict a well measurable amount of relic gravitational waves in the frequency intervals tested by LISA and ground based <b>laser</b> <b>interferometers.</b> ∗Based on a talk presented at the First International LISA Symposium, 9 - 12 July 1996, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire, UK 1 At the first glance, the ground-based and space [1] <b>laser</b> <b>interferometers</b> for gravity wave observations, as well as the Weber bar technique, do not have much in common with the ongoing and planned radio-astronomical measurements of the microwave background anisotropies [2].

25|$|If {{the optics}} {{of the eye}} were {{otherwise}} perfect, theoretically, acuity would be limited by pupil diffraction, {{which would be a}} diffraction-limited acuity of 0.4 minutes of arc (minarc) or 6/2.6 acuity. The smallest cone cells in the fovea have sizes corresponding to 0.4 minarc of the visual field, which also places a lower limit on acuity. The optimal acuity of 0.4 minarc or 6/2.6 can be demonstrated using a <b>laser</b> <b>interferometer</b> that bypasses any defects in the eye's optics and projects a pattern of dark and light bands directly on the retina. Laser interferometers are now used routinely in patients with optical problems, such as cataracts, to assess the health of the retina before subjecting them to surgery.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sensitive}} class of detector uses laser interferometry to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses. This allows the masses {{to be separated}} by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage {{is that it is}} sensitive {{to a wide range of}} frequencies (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is LIGO — the <b>Laser</b> <b>Interferometer</b> Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana, one at the Hanford site in Richland, Washington and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to India. Each observatory has two light storage arms that are 4kilometers in length. These are at 90degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive.|$|E

25|$|According {{to general}} relativity, {{gravitational}} radiation is generated {{in situations where}} the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such {{as is the case}} with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the Solar System is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as PSR B1913+16. It is believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the <b>Laser</b> <b>Interferometer</b> Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. The event confirms that binary black holes exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang and what happened after it.|$|E

500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local {{gravitational}} acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon <b>laser</b> <b>interferometer.</b> The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E

A significant aspect of his research is developing the mathematics necessary to analyze these objects.
