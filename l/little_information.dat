5|$|UB-9 was {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} Baltic Flotilla, and was joined by UB-2 and UB-5 in early 1916. All three became training boats at Kiel in 1916, joining UB-11 in that duty. <b>Little</b> <b>information</b> is available about the Type UBI boats operating in the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Very <b>little</b> <b>information</b> exists {{about the}} rule of Przemysł II over Poznań. From the period 1273–1279, are known only four {{documents}} issued by the prince, including two issued jointly with his uncle Bolesław the Pious.|$|E
5|$|As {{regards the}} line of battle, we are given a <b>little</b> <b>information</b> by Ammianus. He reports that the right flanks of each line, front and reserve, were held by two auxilia regiments and {{the centre of the}} reserve line was held by the Primani legion.

5|$|As {{with most}} fungi, <b>little</b> <b>information</b> is {{available}} on the threat of extinction for Russulaceae species, and they have not been assessed in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List. However, national lists contain some species of Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula, indicating that they have small populations and are endangered, e.g. in Great Britain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but <b>little</b> <b>information</b> is {{available}} on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>little</b> <b>information</b> {{regarding}} Issac Perrins' early life, but he {{was probably}} born in about 1751. His father, also called Isaac, worked for Boulton and Watt erecting stationary steam engines in the West Midlands {{until his death in}} 1780. In that year Isaac junior was offered work in Cornwall by the business but turned it down. He subsequently accepted a Birmingham-based job with the firm in 1782.|$|E

5|$|There is very <b>little</b> <b>information</b> as to {{the effects}} of Pauline on Mexico, but during the passage of the {{hurricane}} over Magdalena Bay, a boat disappeared with its five occupants. Despite a large-scale search for the boat or any possible remnants, no trace was ever found. The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Very <b>little</b> <b>information</b> exists {{about the}} {{education}} given to Przemysł II. Diplomatic sources have retained only {{the names of}} two of his teachers: Dragomir and Przybysław.

5|$|Wallace (1973) {{addressed}} {{a number of}} criticisms of the committee including that it provides too <b>little</b> <b>information</b> on the reasons for rarity rejection. Alan Vittery and Sara McMahon have both argued that the committee should inform observers whose records are rejected of the committee's reasons for doing so. This view also {{has the support of}} the editor of Birdwatch, Dominic Mitchell, who has made this the topic of editorials on a number of occasions.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 800 {{students}} from both Platte Canyon High School {{and the nearby}} Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request {{for the police to}} back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School. Parents were able to gain <b>little</b> <b>information</b> from authorities, who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed {{as a threat to the}} regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979. <b>Little</b> <b>information</b> about them or their creative output has survived.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a <b>little</b> <b>information</b> about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

The game {{takes place in a}} fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} {{publications}} of Leaves of Grass, Whitman had financial difficulties {{and was forced}} to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's Daily Times starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very <b>little</b> <b>information</b> about himself in the late 1850s.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. <b>Little</b> <b>information</b> was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E
