40|$|We studied {{interactions}} between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway in regulation of mitogenesis of mesangial cells (MC) determined by [3 H]thymidine incorporation, with or without added EGF. Forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP strongly (by 60 - 70 %) inhibited [3 H]thymidine incorporation into MC. Cilostamide, <b>lixazinone</b> or cilostazol selective inhibitors of cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozyme PDE-III, inhibited mitogenesis to similar extent as forskolin and DBcAMP and activated in situ PKA, but without detectable increase in cAMP levels. Cilostamide and cilostazol were {{more than three times}} more effective at inhibiting mesangial mitogenesis than rolipram and denbufylline, inhibitors of isozyme PDE-IV, even though PDE-IV was two times more abundant in MC than was PDE-III. On the other hand, when incubated with forskolin, rolipram-enhanced cAMP accumulation was far greater (10 - 100 x) than with cilostamide. EGF increased MAPK activity (+ 300 %); PDE isozyme inhibitors which suppressed mitogenesis also inhibited MAPK. PDE isozyme inhibitors also suppressed PDGF-stimulated MC proliferation. We conclude that cAMP inhibits the mitogen-dependent MAPK-signaling pathway probably by decreasing the activity of Raf- 1 due to PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation. Further, we surmise that minor increase in the cAMP pool metabolized by PDE-III is intimately related to regulation of mesangial proliferation. Thus, PDE isozyme inhibitors have the potential to suppress MC proliferation by a focused effect upon signaling pathways...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} reverse {{transcriptase}} PCR, platelet mRNA and degenerate primers based on platelet peptide sequences, to amplify {{a fragment of}} platelet cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (cGI-PDE; PDE 3). Sequence analysis of this clone established that both the platelet and the cardiac forms of PDE 3 were derived from the same gene (PDE 3 A). A RT-PCR product representing the C-terminal half of platelet PDE 3 cDNA and corresponding to amino acid residues 560 - 1141 of the cardiac enzyme, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli cGI-PDEDelta 1. Further deletion mutants were constructed by removing either an additional 100 amino acids from the N-terminus (cGI-PDEDelta 2) or the 44 -amino-acid insert characteristic of the PDE 3 family, from the catalytic domain (cGI-PDEDelta 1 Deltai). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to explore {{the function of the}} 44 -amino-acid insert. All mutants were evaluated for their ability to hydrolyse cAMP and cGMP, their ability to be photolabelled by [32 P]cGMP and for the effects of PDE 3 inhibitors. The Km values for hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP by immunoprecipitates of cGI-PDEDelta 1 (182 +/- 12 nM and 153 +/- 12 nM respectively) and cGI-PDEDelta 2 (131 +/- 17 nM and 99 +/- 1 nM respectively) were significantly lower than those for immunoprecipitates of intact platelet PDE 3 (398 +/- 50 nM and 252 +/- 16 nM respectively). Moreover, N-terminal truncations of platelet enzyme increased the ratio of Vmax for cGMP/Vmax for cAMP from 0. 16 +/- 0. 01 in intact platelet enzyme, to 0. 37 +/- 0. 05 in cGI-PDEDelta 1 and to 0. 49 +/- 0. 04 in cGI-PDEDelta 2. Thus deletion of the N-terminus enhanced hydrolysis of cGMP relative to cAMP, suggesting that N-terminal sequences may exert selective effects on enzyme activity. Removal of the 44 -amino-acid insert generated a mutant with a catalytic domain closely resembling those of other PDE gene families but despite a limited ability to be photolabelled by [32 P]cGMP, no cyclic nucleotide hydrolytic activities of the mutant were detectable. Mutation of amino acid residues in putative beta-turns {{at the beginning and end}} of the 44 -amino-acid insert to alanine residues markedly reduced the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyse cyclic nucleotides. The PDE 3 inhibitor, <b>lixazinone,</b> retained the ability to inhibit cAMP hydrolysis and [32 P]cGMP binding by the N-terminal deletion mutants and the site-directed mutants, suggesting that PDE 3 inhibitors may interact exclusively with the catalytic domain of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Excessive mesangial cell (MC) {{proliferation}} is {{a hallmark}} of many glomerulopathies. In our recent study on cultured rat MC (Matousovic, K., J. P. Grande, C. C. S. Chini, E. N. Chini, and T. P. Dousa. 1995. J. Clin. Invest. 96 : 401 - 410) we found that inhibition of isozyme cyclic- 3 ', 5 '-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) type III (PDE-III) suppressed MC mitogenesis by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and by decreasing activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). We also found that inhibition of another PDE isozyme, PDE-IV, suppresses superoxide generation in glomeruli (Chini, C. C. S., E. N. Chini, J. M. Williams, K. Matousovic, and T. P. Dousa. 1994. Kidney Int. 46 : 28 - 36). We thus explored whether administration in vivo of the selective PDE-III antagonist, <b>lixazinone</b> (LX), together with the specific PDE-IV antagonist, rolipram (RP), can attenuate development of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MSGN) induced in rats by anti-rat thymocyte serum (ATS). Unlike the vehicle-treated MSGN rats, rats with MSGN treated with LX and RP did not develop proteinuria and maintained normal renal function when examined 5 d after injection of ATS. In PAS-stained kidneys from PDE-antagonists-treated MSGN-rats the morphology of glomeruli showed a reduction in cellularity compared with control rats with ATS. Compared with MSGN rats receiving vehicle, the MSGN rats receiving PDE-antagonists had less glomerular cell proliferation (PCNA delta - 65 %), a significantly lesser macrophage infiltration (delta - 36 % ED- 1) and a significant reduction of alpha-smooth muscle actin expression by activated MC; in contrast, immunostaining for platelet antigens and laminin were not different. The beneficial effect of PDE inhibitors was not due to a moderate decrease (approximately - 20 %) in systolic blood pressure (SBP); as a similar decrease in SBP due to administration of hydralazine, a drug devoid of PDE inhibitory effect, did not reduce severity of MSGN in ATS-injected rats. We conclude that antagonists of PDE-III and PDE-IV administered in submicromolar concentrations in vivo to ATS-injected rats can decrease the activation and proliferation of MC, inhibit the macrophage accumulation, and prevent proteinuria in the acute phase of MSGN. We propose that PDE isozyme inhibitors act to block (negative "crosstalk") the mitogen-stimulated intracellular signaling pathway which controls MC proliferation due to activating of the cAMP-PKA pathway. These results suggest that antagonists of PDE- 111 and IV may have a suppressive effect in acute phases or relapses of glomerulopathies associated with MC proliferations...|$|E
