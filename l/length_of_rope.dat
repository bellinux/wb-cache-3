5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
25|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> or webbing with a clip at one or both ends, {{which the}} {{stand-by}} diver uses to clip the unresponsive diver to his harness to free up both hands during a recovery. This can be useful if he needs to climb a structure, shotline or topographical feature, and the umbilicals can not be safely used to lift the divers due to snags or sharp edges.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies were}} {{recovered}} later on 19 July after {{an order of}} the administration. This task was done by 21 men from Zermatt. Croz, Hadow and Hudson were buried near the Church of Zermatt. The body of Douglas has never been found and it {{was thought to be}} lost somewhere on the north face. After the accident John Tyndall conceived a complicated device, involving an enormous <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> for trying to recover the body of Douglas, but it was never used.|$|E

5000|$|In sailing, gaskets are <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> or fabric {{used to hold}} a stowed sail in place. In modern use, {{the term}} is usually {{restricted}} to square-rigged ships, the equivalent items on yachts being referred to by the more prosaic [...] "sail ties".|$|R

25|$|The {{first person}} Christie {{admitted}} to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old Austrian munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution. Christie {{claimed to have}} met Fuerst while she was soliciting clients in a snack bar in Ladbroke Grove. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her on his bed with a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath the floorboards of his living room, and buried her body in the back garden the following evening.|$|E
25|$|For {{the murders}} of his final three victims, Christie {{modified}} the gassing technique he had first used on Muriel Eady; he simply used a rubber tube connected to the gas pipe in the kitchen which he kept closed off with a bulldog clip. He seated his victims in the kitchen, released the clip on the tube, and let gas leak into the room. The Brabin Report pointed out that Christie's explanation of his gassing technique was not satisfactory because {{he would have been}} overpowered by the gas as well. Nevertheless, it was established that all three victims had been exposed to carbon monoxide. The gas made his victims drowsy, after which Christie strangled them with a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
25|$|The skin is held {{in place}} by being trapped between the top ring, called the crown ring, and the ring below it, called the flesh ring. A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem. The rings are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.|$|E
50|$|Beginners often learn using {{a simple}} pair of {{practice}} poi, which are typically constructed from soft {{materials such as}} socks or stockings that are weighted with soft household objects such as bean bags, juggling balls, balloons filled with legumes, or small toys. Simple poi can also be constructed from tennis balls and <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
60|$|The grizzled archer thus {{addressed}} {{took several}} <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> from his comrades, and knotting them firmly together, he stretched {{them out in}} the long shadow which the rising sun threw from the frowning keep.

25|$|Unlike top-rope {{climbing}} {{where the}} climber is always supported by an anchor located above the climber, lead climbing often has scenarios where the climber will {{be attached to}} a point under him or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much {{greater than that of}} top-rope {{and this is one of}} the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor is the ratio of the height a climber falls and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> available to absorb the fall. The higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead climbing on their own.|$|E
25|$|The WOSM emblem and {{membership}} badge is the World Scout Emblem, a purple, circular logo with a fleur-de-lis in the center, {{surrounded by a}} <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> tied with a reef knot (also called a square knot). Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts {{on the path to}} service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law. The bond {{at the base of the}} fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement.|$|E
25|$|Many of the victims' bodies bore {{evidence}} of mutilation {{to the eye}} sockets. Pathologists concluded the injuries were caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out {{the eyes of his}} victims. Chikatilo's adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim, such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut, a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> before stuffing mud or loam into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them. After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

5000|$|The double fisherman's knot or grapevine knot is a bend, or a knot used to join two <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> This knot and {{the triple}} fisherman's knot are the {{variations}} used {{most often in}} climbing, arboriculture, and search and rescue. The knot is formed by tying a double overhand knot, in its strangle knot form, with each end around the opposite line's standing part.|$|R
5000|$|Standing rigging is a {{structural}} element that {{holds up the}} masts, and loss of standing rigging puts them {{at risk of being}} sprung (cracked) or simply snapped off.

25|$|One of the {{purposes}} of bondage in BDSM is to restrain a person (typically called the bottom) in a BDSM position. This may involve simply tying the hands together in front or behind. Other positions involve the use of a waist belt to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the spread eagle, with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the hogtie, which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as bondage cuffs are recommended for this); the balltie, which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the crotch rope, which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the reverse prayer position (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an over-arm tie, in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.|$|E

[...] About 11:15pm the rear fuselage came to the surface a short distance off-shore. Donald Butler, one of the employees, feared the air hostess might still be trapped in her seat {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. [...] He took a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> swam out to the floating piece of structure, attached the rope to the tailwheel and then swam back to the beach. [...] A motor lorry was used to drag the rear fuselage ashore but there was no-one inside. The right tailplane, elevator and trim tab were almost undamaged. [...] The elevator trim tab was still set appropriately for a shallow climb after take-off.|$|E

2500|$|A rope gag {{consists}} of a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> wound multiple times through {{the mouth of the}} person being gagged – similar to a cleave gag. Soft rope, such as nylon, works well for the comfort of the person being gagged, but rougher rope, such as hemp, will scratch the lips quite a bit. Rope gags can be made into a part of a full-body tie as well, if the person tying the [...] "victim" [...] up uses the same <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> for the gag as they do for the tie.|$|E

[...] A special <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> 10 inches in {{circumference}} and 240 feet long was prepared for use in the tow. [...] This rope was to be used between the steel towing cables, because it was more elastic than steel, and would prevent jerking which could damage the towed steamer. [...] A two-way radio telephone was installed in the wheelhouse of the steamer to allow ready communication with the tug and other vessels {{during the course of the}} tow.|$|E

2500|$|In {{describing}} his victims, Chikatilo falsely {{referred to them}} as [...] " [...] elements" [...] whom he would lure to secluded areas before killing. In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, Chikatilo stated he would bind the victims' hands behind their back with a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> before he would proceed to kill them. He would typically inflict a multitude of knife wounds upon the victim; initially inflicting shallow knife wounds to the chest area before inflicting deeper stab and slash wounds—usually 30 to 50 in total—before proceeding to eviscerate the victim. He had, he stated, become adept at avoiding the spurts of blood from his victims' bodies as he inflicted the knife wounds and eviscerations upon them, and would regularly sit or squat beside his victims until their hearts had stopped beating, adding that the victims' [...] "cries, the blood and the agony gave me relaxation and a certain pleasure." [...] When questioned as to why most of his later victims' eyes had been stabbed and/or slashed, but not enucleated as his earlier victims had been, Chikatilo stated that he had initially believed in an old superstition {{that the image of}} a murderer is left imprinted upon the eyes of the victim. However, he stated, in [...] "later years", he had become convinced this was simply an old wives' tale and he had ceased to gouge out the eyes of his victims.|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion's {{signature}} special move {{throughout the}} series has him hurling a harpoon-like spear (described as a kunai) at his opponents, {{making him the}} only other character besides Kano to have a physical weapon in the original MK game. The spear, attached to a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> impales his opponents through the chest and sets them up for a free hit as Scorpion then jerks on the rope to pull them in to close range. His other incumbent special throughout the series, save for Deadly Alliance, has been his Teleport Punch, where he flies offscreen during battle and then reappears to strike his opponent from behind. Scorpion additionally gained a new leg-takedown maneuver in MKII that was not well-received (Sega Saturn Magazine called it a [...] "ridiculous" [...] move that [...] "no one ever used"). He was considered a lower-tier character by GamePro in their 1993 MKII character rankings, rating him eighth out of the game's twelve playables and describing both him and Sub-Zero as [...] "formerly a top-tier character [...] doesn’t {{have much of a}} chance in MKII since all of the male ninjas have some poor matchups," [...] with Scorpion faring the worst against Jax and Mileena. Ed Lomas of Sega Saturn Magazine described the character as having [...] "simple yet effective" [...] special moves in UMK3 that [...] "make him good for beginners, [...] doesn't stop him from being a useful character," [...] while his [...] "trusty" [...] spear was [...] "perfect for setting up combos." [...] GameSpy, in their Deception walkthrough, described the character as [...] "a well-rounded character that has strengths in combos as well as in special and normal moves." [...] They additionally described the spear as [...] "useful as ever" [...] in Armageddon, adding, [...] "Between [...] other special moves ... Scorpion pretty much has everything covered." [...] Prima Games' MK2011 strategy guide considered Scorpion to be well-balanced with no distinct weaknesses or advantages, while winning more than half of his fights against the game's other characters. He is also a playable character for both the versus and story modes in Shaolin Monks, where his movesets in this game are largely identical to Liu Kang's with some original techniques.|$|E
