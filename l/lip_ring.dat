50|$|Apart {{from the}} above examples, {{describing}} thumb ring designs from other time periods is difficult. For example, thumb rings are absent from the archaeological record between the Han and Ming dynasties (220-1368 CE) even though contemporary literature (such as Wang Ju's archery manual from the Tang dynasty) indicates that Chinese archers were still using the thumb draw. Moreover, evidence suggests a variety of ring shapes were popular during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE). Li Chengfen's archery manual advocated using rings with oval openings, and Gao Ying's archery manual described the use of <b>lipped</b> <b>rings</b> and contained illustrations depicting an archer using a <b>lipped</b> <b>ring.</b> To date, however, the only recovered rings that purport {{to be from the}} Ming dynasty have cylindrical designs that are different from Qing thumb rings.|$|R

500|$|Lip {{piercing}} and lip stretching were historically {{found in}} certain tribal cultures in Africa and the Americas. Pierced adornments of the lip, or labrets, were sported by the Tlingit {{as well as}} peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Amazon basin. Aztecs and Mayans also wore labrets, while the Dogon people of Mali and the Nuba of the Nile Valley wore rings. The practice of stretching the lips by piercing them and inserting plates or plugs was found throughout Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and South America as well as {{among some of the}} tribes of the Pacific Northwest and Africa. In some parts of Malawi, it was quite common for women to adorn their lips with a lip disc called a [...] "pelele" [...] that by means of gradual enlargement from childhood could reach several inches of diameter and would eventually alter the occlusion of the jaw.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{through a}} close reading of four novels [...] The Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities, and Great Expectations [...] {{the way in}} which masculinity and authorial subjectivity in Dickens's novels are bound to the figure of the circle, an image which functions both as a figure for an ideal narcissistic unity and {{as a sign of the}} individual's subjection to the metaphoric and metonymic movement of language within the symbolic order; what Jacques Lacan has identified as "symbolic necessity. " I demonstrate this double function of the circle by showing how orality in Dickens's work belongs to a chain of images that include pretty <b>lips,</b> <b>rings,</b> necklaces, fur ringed boots, as well as the grinding wheels and gears of the legal system. As Dickens's career progresses, the novels become more and more haunted by the sense that the magic circle of personal fantasy is inhabited by the violent, whirling motion of the law and language. My argument culminates in readings of A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations which show how male masochism in Dickens's novels is not so much a negation of paternal power and privilege as it is a consequence of the latter's introjection within the subject as fantasy, a fantasy in which the subject is fastened, as in Pip's fever dream, to "a vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf. ...|$|R

30|$|LiPs (E.C. 1.11. 1.14) were {{originally}} discovered in nitrogen- and carbon-limited cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium [32]. LiP possess high redox potential (700 to 1, 400  mV), low optimum pH  3 to 4.5, {{and the ability}} to catalyze the degradation of a wide number of aromatic structures such veratryl alcohol (3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl) and methoxybenzenes [32, 36, 38]. <b>LiP</b> oxidizes aromatic <b>rings</b> moderately activated by electron donating substitutes; in contrast, common peroxidases participate in the catalysis of aromatic substrates highly activated (ammine, hydroxyl, etc.). An explanation for this type of catalysis is the production of veratryl alcohol radicals. These radicals have higher redox potential than LiP’s compounds I and II and can participate in the degradation of compounds with high redox potential [40].|$|R
40|$|In the {{honeybee}} brain, {{two prominent}} tracts – the medial and the lateral antennal lobe tract – project {{from the primary}} olfactory center, the antennal lobes (ALs), to the central brain, the mushroom bodies (MBs), and the protocerebral lobe (PL). Intracellularly stained uniglomerular projection neurons were reconstructed, registered to the 3 D honeybee standard brain atlas, and then used to derive the spatial properties and quantitative morphology of the neurons of both tracts. We evaluated putative synaptic contacts of projection neurons (PNs) using confocal microscopy. Analysis of the patterns of axon terminals revealed a domain-like innervation within the MB lip neuropil. PNs of the lateral tract arborized more sparsely within the lips and exhibited fewer synaptic boutons, while medial tract neurons occupied broader regions in the MB calyces and the PL. Our data show that uPNs from the medial and lateral tract innervate both the core and the cortex of the ipsilateral MB lip but differ in their innervation patterns in these regions. In the mushroombody neuropil collar we found evidence for ALT boutons suggesting the collar as a multi modal input site including olfactory input similar to <b>lip</b> and basal <b>ring.</b> In addition, our data support the conclusion drawn in previous studies that reciprocal synapses exist between PNs, octopaminergic-, and GABAergic cells in the MB calyces. For the first time, we found evidence for connections between both tracts within the AL...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the cellular sources for tyramine and the cellular targets of tyramine via the Tyramine Receptor 1 (AmTyr 1) in the olfactory learning and memory neuropils of the honey bee brain. Clusters of approximately 160 tyramine immunoreactive neurons {{are the source of}} tyraminergic fibers with small varicosities in the optic lobes, antennal lobes, lateral protocerebrum, mushroom body (calyces and gamma lobes), tritocerebrum and subesophageal ganglion (SEG). Our tyramine mapping study shows that the primary sources of tyramine in the antennal lobe and calyx of the mushroom body are from at least two Ventral Unpaired Median neurons (VUMmd and VUMmx) with cell bodies in the SEG. To reveal AmTyr 1 receptors in the brain, we used newly characterized anti-AmTyr 1 antibodies. Immunolocalization studies in the antennal lobe with anti-AmTyr 1 antibodies showed that the AmTyr 1 expression pattern is mostly in the presynaptic sites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In the mushroom body calyx, anti-AmTyr 1 mapped the presynaptic sites of uniglomerular Projection Neurons (PNs) located primarily in the microglomeruli of the <b>lip</b> and basal <b>ring</b> calyx area. Release of tyramine/octopamine from VUM (md and mx) neurons in the antennal lobe and mushroom body calyx would target AmTyr 1 expressed on ORN and uniglomerular PN presynaptic terminals. The presynaptic location of AmTyr 1, its structural similarity with vertebrate alpha- 2 adrenergic receptors, and previous pharmacological evidence suggests that it has {{an important role in the}} presynaptic inhibitory control of neurotransmitter release...|$|R
40|$|T he {{growing trend}} for body {{jewellery}} is amatter {{of concern for}} all dental professionals. Strictly speaking, the term “body jewellery” refers to jewellery {{that is designed to}} go through the body, rather than simply on the body. Examples of dental relevance include <b>lip</b> studs and <b>rings,</b> tongue bars, and rings placed through the uvula. As will be discussed in this article, there are multiple compli-cations from intra-oral piercing and from an ethical standpoint, all dental professionals should dis-courage oral piercing because of these risks. Most dental professionals are well aware of the common long term risks of intra-oral body jew-ellery, such as damaging teeth on tongue barbells while eating, sleeping, talking or chewing. Certain problems such as speech impairment from oral jew-ellery 1 and swallowed jewellery 2 are obvious complications. Thus the emphasis herein will be on the broader list of less obvious but nevertheless doc-umented problems, summarized in Tables 1 and 2. It is doubtful whether such a comprehensive listing of complications is considered by every person contemplating undergoing or performing intra-oral piercing. In this author’s view, patients should be actively discouraged from having piercings involving the oral cavity, while patients with existing piercings should be informed of all the long term complications and encouraged strenuously to remove their intra-oral body jewellery and allow the hole to close. If patients will not do this, they should remove tongue bars every time before they eat, sleep or engage in strenuous physical activity. Missing the point: The risks of intra-oral piercin...|$|R
60|$|It {{was well}} {{that we had}} so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked {{out from under his}} {{covering}} a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his <b>lips.</b> Our pistols <b>rang</b> out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders {{that we were able to}} haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.|$|R
