25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} {{on how far}} to go in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation during his time in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} desire to go so far is just to see what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
500|$|Pool of Radiance was {{the first}} in a four-part series of {{computer}} D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as [...] "a value-added adventure for those who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> side trip while awaiting the sequel". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that [...] "you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game." ...|$|E

I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear {{friend of mine who}} is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2011 interview, Dan Houser of Rockstar Games {{said that}} {{despite what the}} general public might think, Rockstar likes to [...] "spend a bit of time" [...] {{at the end of}} {{projects}} before deciding what to do next.

[...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will see what we can do with Bully." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Cologne, the A 555 spur has the by-name [...] "Diplomatenrennbahn" [...] (Diplomat race track), {{seemingly}} because foreign {{diplomats and}} state visitors <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> spin from Bonn to Cologne and back when Bonn still was {{the capital of}} the Federal Republic of Germany. Bonn locals, however, use that term for the B 9 where diplomats regularly sped under protection of diplomatic immunity.|$|R

2500|$|The cover art {{painting}} {{is by the}} British artist Nic Dartnell. Although {{it has been said}} to be originally intended for the American group Spirit, and that the bald-headed man on the left of the cover is Spirit's drummer, Ed Cassidy, the artist denied this in an interview with Mike Goldstein of RockPoP: [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> moment and dispel a rumor that, according to Wikipedia, the image is somehow linked to the LA band Spirit. The fact is that, at the time I painted the ELP [...] "Bird", I also painted a portrait of Spirit which I sent to them in LA. A very similar bird was featured in the corner of that painting. I got a message from Spirit to say that if they had received their painting in time they would have put it on the back of Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. I became friendly with Randy California over the years and I took the photograph that is on his 1982 12" [...] EP All Along the Watchtower. The bald image in [...] "Bird" [...] has no connection to Ed Cassidy of Spirit and doesn't look anything like him. Ed still has the Spirit portrait – so I'm told." ...|$|E
