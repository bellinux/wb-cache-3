5000|$|The exact {{plight of}} the Twin-Amp during the months between January and May 1960 however, remains open to {{considerable}} speculation, debate and study. The prevailing explanation is that production was temporarily interrupted during these months as they coincide with the debut of Fender's new [...] "flagship" [...] or top of the <b>line</b> <b>amplifier,</b> the Fender Vibrasonic-Amp. Nonetheless, Fender Musical Instrument Co. kept {{the image of the}} Twin-Amp before potential consumers during this short period.

5000|$|In electronics, cutoff {{frequency}} or corner frequency is the frequency either {{above or below}} which the power output of a circuit, such as a <b>line,</b> <b>amplifier,</b> or electronic filter has fallen to a given proportion of the power in the passband. Most frequently this proportion is one half the passband power, {{also referred to as}} the 3 dB point since a fall of 3 dB corresponds approximately to half power. As a voltage ratio this is a fall to [...] of the passband voltage. Other ratios besides the 3 dB point may also be relevant, for example see Chebyshev Filters below.|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the design of}} a low-cost L-band <b>line</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Although this unit is intended to be used in conjunction with the LNA described in [1], it may also be useful in other applications. Specifically, this unit provides a 9 VDC bias through the RF input jack which can be used to power the LNA described in [1]. The intended configuration is for the <b>line</b> <b>amplifier</b> to be located within a few feet of the LNA, and used to drive a long section (e. g., 100 ft.) of coaxial cable. The completed <b>line</b> <b>amplifier</b> is shown in Figure 1 and its specifications are summarized in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Figure 5 shows a schematic of the <b>line</b> <b>amplifier,</b> with a parts list given in Figure 6. Components L 1 and C 1 form a bias-tee, setting the DC voltage at the input jack to 9 VDC, thereby powering the connected LNA. This part of the circuit also forms a high-pass filter with cutoff at about 200 MHz, which contibutes to the suppression of strong VHF-band interference, such as FM broadcast radio. MMIC amplifiers U 1 and U 2 provide gain and also serve to buffer the stripline bandpass filter, FL 1. Figure 7 shows the assembled circuit on its printed circuit board (PCB). FL 1 is a 3 -finger interfigital bandpass filter which was designed through a process of trial-and-error using the “Sonnet ” electromagnetic modeling software by Sonnet Software, Inc. The selected design was as shown in Figure 8. The predicted response of the filter is shown in Figure 9.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL) is performed in an Optical Recirculating Loop (RCL). The RCL enables to simulate the transmission through various optical links using just one optical fiber spool, one in <b>line</b> <b>amplifier,</b> some optical filters and devices in a low cost manner. The total amount of PDL in a Recirculating loop, due to its statistical nature, is different of the simple sum of each element of the recirculating loop because of the alignment variation of the PDL elements with time, depending on the environmental conditions such as fiber stress and temperature. In this paper theoretical studies are also performed using formalism of Jones and Mueller matrices in order to represent the different optical elements in the recirculating loop. The PDL must be correctly characterized in order to evaluate properly {{the impact on the}} performance of next generation DWDM systems. Theoretical and experimental results comparison shows that a depolarization of 7 % occurs in the experimental setup, probably by the optical amplifier due to the depolarized nature of the amplified spontaneous emission...|$|E
40|$|Optimization of both {{fiber and}} device design is {{essential}} for maximum performance from erbium doped optical fibers as either line, pre- or power amplifiers, with optimum fiber composition and geometry being unique for each application. The field is extensive but selected examples are reviewed to indicate the range of device configurations and fiber structure available. Key advances include, via fiber design the development of ultra high gain efficiency for reduced pump power requirements and hence increased reliability of practical systems. Further, use of a novel device configuration allows exploitation of high gain efficiencies without compromising noise levels for a pre- or <b>line</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Power amplifiers demonstrating high output powers even at elevated signal levels are sought for many communications systems including local area networks. Both amplifier configuration and fiber composition have been investigated {{in the pursuit of}} output signals in excess of 20 dBm. The relative merits of these systems are discussed and future direction indicated. In summary, it is shown that optical fiber fabrication {{plays a key role in}} optimizing performance while the versatility of fiber circuitry allows full exploitation of the fiber potentia...|$|E

40|$|This paper targets the lifetime-aware {{management}} {{of a set}} of optical <b>line</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (OLAs) in an optical network exploiting sleep mode (SM) in order to save energy. We first present a simple model to predict the OLA lifetime. We then provide different mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, which jointly consider energy saving and lifetime. The proposed MILP formulations are then solved on different realistic scenarios, by taking into account the spatial and temporal variations of traffic demands. Results show that our lifetime-aware approach outperforms classical energy saving ILP formulations, which instead tend to notably decrease the OLA lifetime. More important, the proposed approaches can achieve a good lifetime performance without consuming significantly more energy than purely energy-aware strategies...|$|R

This thesis deals with the development of a dynamic model of the <b>amplifier</b> <b>lines</b> and line orifice of a two stage servovalve.

The Twin-Amp of this period (late 1960-1963) was manufactured with a variety of speakers including Jensen, Oxford and JBL designs. This variation lends support to the idea that the 80-watt circuit was beyond the power handling capacity of the speakers of the late 1950s. After a slight change in appearance, from the rough blonde tolex and maroon grille appearance to a smooth blonde tolex with a gold grille cloth, the Twin-Amp was replaced with the Twin Reverb-Amp in 1963.|$|R
