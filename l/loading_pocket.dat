The objective {{of the project was}} to instrument and evaluate lining behavior and rock de-formation when a deep shaft is constructed in a high in situ stress field and anisotropic rock mass. Rock mass displacements were moni-tored with multiple-position borehole extensometers. Liner stress and strain were measured with concrete pressure cells and embedment strain gauges.

Liner stress and strain levels reflect the high in situ stress field as well as nearby station and raise construction. Maximum stresses measured in the lining, as a result of shaft excavation, are about one-third of its compressive strength.

40|$|Abstract—This paper compares {{methods for}} {{converting}} system limits into market signals. One classification of methods is according to reliability driven (TLR and similar) versus market driven (LMP and similar) methods. A second classification is according to direct versus indirect methods. Direct methods deal with individual limits and constraints. Indirect methods include various ways of converting {{one type of}} limit to another, equivalent limit for purposes of making {{the handling of the}} limit more expeditious. An example of an indirect method is the conversion of a voltage limit to either a flow limit or an interface limit. Another example is the use of flow limits on interfaces as surrogates for stability limits. These transformed limits are often represented by nomograms. Conversion of one type of limit to another and the construction of nomograms has the advantage of reducing the problem of imposing system limits within a market context to a “previously solved ” market problem. If a market already has learned how to cope with an import limit into a <b>load</b> <b>pocket,</b> conversion of a voltage limit into a <b>load</b> <b>pocket</b> import limit makes it easy for a market to react and respond to the condition.

40|$|The {{fluctuating}} global fuel prices, {{concerns with}} the depleting fossil fuel reserves and concerns relating {{to climate change}} has resulted in an increasing focus on renewable sources to satisfy rising global energy requirements. Wind power is in the fore front of renewable power generation technologies. Within the realm of wind generators, the Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is the preferred choice of installation worldwide. Large scale penetration of wind energy in the system raises significant concerns regarding the reliability implications of the inherent variability of wind. The work presented in this thesis provides a methodology to utilize the capability curve of the DFIG machine to enhance the voltage performance {{of the system and}} make the system more resilient to wind variations. The utilization of wind parks as reactive sources during low wind periods can help maintain balanced system voltages. Any wind park that has direct access to load centers or is on a transmission path carrying large amounts of power will provide a substantial system performance improvement.

40|$|Testing the {{performance}} of electricity markets using POWERWEB has already shown that relatively inexperienced players can identify and exploit market power in <b>load</b> <b>pockets.</b> When transmission constraints are not binding, however, auctions with six players {{have been shown to}} be efficient. There is evidence from operating electricity markets that prices can be driven above competitive levels when the largest supplier controls less than 20 % of total installed capacity. This is accomplished by causing price spikes to occur. In experiments, uncertainty about the actual load and paying standby costs regardless of whether or not a unit is actually dispatched contribute to volatile price behavior. The objective of this paper is to investigate characteristics of a market that affect price volatility. The tests consider three different sets of rules for setting price when there are capacity shortfalls, and the following four market structures: 1. Load is responsive to price 2. Price forecasts are made before market settlement 3 A day-ahead market and a balancing market auction 4. Suppliers are paid actual offers (a discriminatory auction) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present experimental results for testing the performance of different auction mechanisms related to the introduction of competitive markets for the generation of electricity. The research is based on the concept of smart markets introduced by Vernon Smith and a simulation model (PowerWeb) of a realistic bulk power system. There are unique physical aspects associated with the supply of electricity (e. g. required instantaneous matching of supply and demand, unintended congestion of parallel transmission routes and maintenance of system stability in response to disturbances). As a result, traditional theories of efficient markets and auction structures developed for other commodities may not be efficient if applied without alteration to markets for electricity. Conversely, current utility rules of operation developed for a centrally-planned regime may not be appropriate in a competitive environment. The research does not address the issues of multiperiod operations (unit commitment) and multidimensional markets (ancillary services), and considers only real power in a single time period. The main objective is to test three alternative auction mechanisms when market power is a potential problem. This situation occurs when limits on transmission lines are binding to form a <b>load</b> <b>pocket</b> in which demand is met by a few (in this case two) generators...|$|R

40|$|After the deregulation, the {{electricity}} markets have been restructured {{in a way}} to draw an end to “natural monopoly” of the players. However, by the virtue of the especial nature of electricity market, it gives the players instincts to exercise the market power. As a result of these market power exercise, electricity market becomes inefficient. The presence of market power can change the dispatch order of generators, pressure to over-build transmission networks in order to relieve <b>load</b> <b>pockets</b> in a market. Perhaps most importantly, the exercise of market power results in power price rises and substantial wealth transfers between electricity customers and generators. For these reasons, electricity market regulators around the world tend to be interested in mechanisms for predicting marker power ex ante and detecting and controlling the exercise of market power ex post. At present, there are some indicators, used to predict the market power exercise ability of suppliers. These common ex-ante market power indicators however, mostly disregard power transfer distribution factor, generation and transmission constraints in electric systems and merging effect of the supplier. Moreover, these indicators usually concern static measurement of market power, when electrical power system reflects stochastic nature regarding load and wind generation capacity variation in any system.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} limited infrastructure, many power systems are frequently operated close to critical, or bifurcation, points. While operating close to such critical points can be economically advantageous, doing so increases {{the probability of}} a blackout. With the continued deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), high sample rate data are dramatically increasing the real time observability of the power grids. Prior research has shown that the statistics of these data can provide useful information regarding network stability and associated bifurcation proximity. Currently, it is not common practice for transmission and distribution control centers to leverage the higher order statistical properties of PMU data. If grid operators have the tools to determine when these statistics warrant control action, though, then the otherwise unused statistical data present in PMU streams can be transformed into actionable information. In order to address this problem, we present two methods that aim to gauge and improve system stability using the statistics of PMU data. The first method shows how sensitivity factors associated with the spectral analysis of the reduced power flow Jacobian can be used to weight and filter incoming PMU data. We do so by demonstrating how the derived participation factors directly predict the relative strength of bus voltage variances throughout a system. The second method leverages an analytical solver to determine a range of 2 ̆ 2 critical 2 ̆ 2 bus voltage variances. The monitoring and testing of raw statistical data in a highly observable <b>load</b> <b>pocket</b> of a large system are then used to reveal when control actions are needed to mitigate the risk of voltage collapse. A simple reactive power controller is then implemented that pushes the stability of the system back to a stable operating paradigm. Full order dynamic time domain simulations are used in order to test this method on both the IEEE 39 bus system and the 2383 bus Polish system. We also compare this method to two other, more conventional, controllers. The first relies on voltage magnitude signals, and the second depends only on local control of a reactive power resource. This comparison illustrates how the use of statistical information from PMU measurements can substantially improve the performance of voltage collapse mitigation methods...|$|R

40|$|In July 2000, the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) {{was one of}} five {{recipients}} of a US Department of Energy contract under the Advanced Microturbine System (AMS) program managed by the Office of Distributed Energy (DE). The AMS program resulted from several government-industry workshops that recognized that microturbine systems could {{play an important role}} in improving customer choice and value for electrical power. That is, the group believed that electrical power could be delivered to customers more efficiently and reliably than the grid if an effective distributed energy strategy was followed. Further, the production of this distributed power would be accomplished with less undesirable pollutants of nitric oxides (NOx) unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), and carbon monoxide (CO). In 2000, the electrical grid delivered energy to US customers at a national average of approximately 32 % efficiency. This value reflects a wide range of powerplants, but is dominated by older, coal burning stations that provide approximately 50 % of US electrical power. The grid efficiency is also affected by transmission and distribution (T&D) line losses that can be significant during peak power usage. In some locations this loss is estimated to be 15 %. <b>Load</b> <b>pockets</b> can also be so constrained that sufficient power cannot be transmitted without requiring the installation of new wires. New T&D can be very expensive and challenging as it is often required in populated regions that do not want above ground wires. While historically grid reliability has satisfied most customers, increasing electronic transactions and the computer-controlled processes of the 'digital economy' demand higher reliability. For them, power outages can be very costly because of transaction, work-in-progress, or perishable commodity losses. Powerplants that produce the grid electrical power emit significant levels of undesirable NOx, UHC, and CO pollutants. The level of emission is quoted as either a technology metric or a system-output metric. A common form for the technology metric is in the units of PPM {at} 15 % O 2. In this case the metric reflects the molar fraction of the pollutant in the powerplant exhaust when corrected to a standard exhaust condition as containing 15 % (molar) oxygen, assuring that the PPM concentrations are not altered by subsequent air addition or dilution. Since fuel combustion consumes oxygen, the output oxygen reference is equivalent to a fuel input reference. Hence, this technology metric reflects the moles of pollutant per mole of fuel input, but not the useful output of the powerplant-i. e. the power. The system-output metric does embrace the useful output and is often termed an output-based metric. A common form for the output-based metric is in the units of lb/MWh. This is a system metric relating the pounds of pollutant to output energy (e. g., MWh) of the powerplant...|$|R

40|$|Long term {{supporting}} {{schemes for}} photovoltaic (PV) system installation {{have led to}} accommodating large numbers of PV systems within <b>load</b> <b>pockets</b> in distribution grids. High penetrations of PV systems can cause new technical challenges, such as voltage rise due to reverse power flow during light load and high PV generation conditions. Therefore, new strategies are required to address the associated challenges. Moreover, due to these changes in distribution grids, a different response behavior of the distribution grid on the transmission side can be expected. Hence, a new equivalent model of distribution grids with high penetration of PV systems is needed to be addressed for future power system studies. The thesis contributions lie in three parts. The {{first part of the}} thesis copes with the PV modelling. A non-proprietary PV model of a three-phase, single stage PV system is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC and PowerFactory. Three different reactive power regulation strategies are incorporated into the models and their behavior are investigated in both simulation platforms using a distribution system with PV systems. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, the voltage rise problem is remedied by use of reactive power. On the other hand, considering large numbers of PV systems in grids, unnecessary reactive power consumption by PV systems first increases total line losses, and second it may also jeopardize the stability of the network in the case of contingencies in conventional power plants, which supply reactive power. Thus, this thesis investigates and develops the novel schemes to reduce reactive power flows while still keeping voltage within designated limits via three different approaches: 1. decentralized voltage control to the pre-defined set-points 2. developing a coordinated active power dependent (APD) voltage regulation Q(P) using local signals 3. developing a multi-objective coordinated droop-based voltage (DBV) regulation Q(V) using local signals In the third part of the thesis, furthermore, a gray-box load modeling is used to develop a new static equivalent model of a complex distribution grid with large numbers of PV systems embedded with voltage support schemes. In the proposed model, variations of voltage at the connection point simulate variations of the model’s active and reactive power. This model can simply be integrated into load-flow programs and replace the complex distribution grid, while still keeping the overall accuracy high. The thesis results, in conclusion, demonstrate: i) using rms-based simulations in PowerFactory can provide us with quite similar results using the time domain instantaneous values in PSCAD platform; ii) decentralized voltage control to specific setpoints through the PV systems in the distribution grid is fundamentally impossible due to the high level voltage control interaction and directionality among the PV systems; iii) the proposed APD method can regulate the voltage under the steady-state voltage limit and consume less total reactive power in contrast to the standard characteristic Cosf (P) proposed by German Grid Codes; iv) the proposed optimized DBV method can directly address voltage and successfully regulate it to the upper steady-state voltage limit by causing minimum reactive power consumption as well as line losses; v) it is beneficial to address PV systems as a separate entity in the equivalencing of distribution grids with high density of PV systems.
