25|$|The librettos, {{that is the}} lyrics, for his vocal {{compositions}} {{played an}} important role for Bach: he sought collaboration with various text authors for his cantatas and major vocal compositions, eventually writing or adapting such texts himself to make them fit {{in the structure of the}} composition he was designing, when he could not <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> talents of other text authors. His collaboration with Picander for the St Matthew Passion libretto is best known, but there was a similar process to come to a multi-layered structure for his St John Passion libretto a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|A {{literary}} masterpiece {{from the}} 13th dynasty talking about Khufu {{is the famous}} Papyrus Westcar, where king Khufu witnesses a magical wonder and receives a prophecy from a magician named Dedi. Within the story, Khufu is characterised in a difficult-to-assess way. At one side he is depicted as ruthless when deciding to have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of Dedi. At the other side Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: He accepts Dedi's outrage and his subsequent alternative offer for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi's prophecy and rewards the magician generously after all. The contradictory depiction of Khufu {{is the object of}} great dispute between Egyptologists and historians to this day. Especially earlier Egyptologists and historians such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu's character as heartless and sacrilegious. They <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, who described an exaggerated negative character image of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians themselves had always taught.|$|E

2500|$|The wharf {{narrowly}} escaped destruction {{during the}} Second World War when its southern neighbour, Nicholson's Wharf, was flattened by a V-1 flying bomb. A regular passenger and cargo service between the wharf and the Canary Islands was maintained {{for a number}} of years after the war by the 10,123-ton MV Monte Ulia and its 7,723-ton sister ship MV Monte Urquiola, operated by Naviera Aznar SA. Such vessels were among the largest merchant ships ever to visit the Pool of London. Writing in 1963, James Harold Bird observed how [...] "during his lunch-hour the pale-faced London office worker can <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> downstream parapet of London Bridge and watch Canary Island produce being unloaded to New Fresh Wharf below from vessels up to 500 feet long and delivered to a ten-storey warehouse." [...] The warehouse was constructed in 1953 and provided four million cubic feet of storage space. By this time the wharf had five travelling cranes and two conveyors, capable of transporting loads of up to five tons. Its river frontage measured [...]|$|E
