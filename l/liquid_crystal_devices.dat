500|$|In this formalism, {{a liquid}} crystal {{material}} {{is treated as}} a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion {{is parallel to the}} director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>devices</b> [...] and lipid bilayers.|$|E

40|$|Fast {{response}} <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> display {{can improve}} motion picture quality and power efficiency. One {{of the most}} important applications is field-sequential-color display. The maximum relaxation time of such <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>device</b> must be less than a few milliseconds (i. e. < 3 ms). In this thesis, three different approaches, which are <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> configuration, alignment layer and driving method, are explored in order to enhance the optical response of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>device.</b> A <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> configuration called Stressed Splay Twist (SST) mode is investigated. It exhibits strong and fast optical bounce due to back-flow effect. It is also found that such fast optical transient effect, i. e. < 1. 5 ms, can be controlled by the two voltages driving method effectively. A SST mode field-sequential-color display with QVGA resolution is fabricated. In order to further improve the electro-optical properties of the SST mode, a stacked alignment layer is proposed as well. It is composed of 2 alignment layers which have different preferred alignment directions. Such alignment configuration is capable of generating multiple pretilt angles or azimuth angles on the same substrate. By using such alignment layers, the relaxation path of the SST mode is modified so that two voltages driving method can be avoided. Finally, a modified passive matrix display driving scheme is proposed. The typical response time of the passive matrix <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>device</b> is about 50 ms to 200 ms. The Alt-Pleshko driving method is modified. The response time of the passive matrix displays is promoted to less than < 5 ms.
