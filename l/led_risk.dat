40|$|In many industries, {{investment}} {{is part of}} the most important planning decisions. In past decades, mathe-matical programming models have been widely used in capacity planning and facility location to support investment decisions. Such initial techniques evolved to the use of enterprise portfolio management, very common in the energy industry. Increasing concern on risks <b>led</b> <b>risk</b> management to become considered one of the top priorities on the planning processes of companies nowadays. As a consequence, state of the art planning models are stochastic, and usually consider some kind of risk measure as well as financial instruments to hedge the investment portfolio. Several developments on Portfolio Theory were achieved on the last years, most of them related to the study of new risk measures. The most representative measure is Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), which not only belongs to the class of Coherent Risk Measures, but is also a Spectral Risk Measure. We propose a two stage stochastic investment model which incorporates CVaR as a constraint on risk. The model is applied to the case of an integrated company that invests on Oil, Gas and Energy. In order to reduce the need for computational resources, we make use of some decomposition techniques. The results for the case study are presented...|$|E

40|$|Catastrophe risk models allow insurers, reinsurers {{and governments}} {{to assess the}} risk of loss from catastrophic events, such as hurricanes. These models rely on {{computer}} technology and the latest earth and meteorological science information to generate thousands if not millions of simulated events. Recently observed hurricane activity, particularly in the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, in conjunction with recently published scientific literature has <b>led</b> <b>risk</b> modelers to revisit their hurricane models and develop climate conditioned hurricane models. This paper discusses these climate conditioned hurricane models and compares their risk estimates to those of base normal hurricane models. This comparison shows that the recent 50 year period of climate change has potentially increased North Atlantic hurricane frequency by 30 percent. However, such an increase in hurricane frequency would result {{in an increase in}} risk to human property that is equivalent to less than 10 years’ worth of US coastal property growth. Increases in potential extreme losses require the reinsurance industry to secure additional risk capital for these peak risks, resulting in the short term in lower risk capacity for developing countries. However, reinsurers and investors in catastrophe securities may still have a long-term interest in providing catastrophe coverage in middle and low-income countries as this allows reinsurers and investors to better diversify their catastrophe risk portfolios.

40|$|Resistant enterococci are {{recognized}} as important h ospital acquired pathogens. They are generally sensitive to ampicillin but intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and are known to acquire high level resistance to these drugs. High level resistance has serious implications for treatment of patients infected with lhese organisms and for infection control activities. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract is a prerequi,site to infection.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research reflects the great need to generate hazard maps and calculate risk in the basin Huahuatay Rosarito in Baja California Sur, Mexico. For the topography in the study area, it {{is associated with a}} basin with fast response to rainfall - runoff relationship, because of that is considered necessary to establish the cell size of 50 m side and a time increment of 0. 65 seconds. The estimate of the flow of water on the surface from the rain was based on the characterization of soils and vegetation cover, through the called number of the runoff curve proposed by the Soil Conservation Service. Flood areas calculated with a mathematical model of two-dimensional hydraulically from rain (FLUBIDI); they are sensitive {{to the quality of the}} input data. Thus, a digital terrain model with good resolution is undoubtedly necessary, and it depends on the path of the runoff. A good estimate of the effective rainfall, in time and space allows for a volume of runoff, flood areas and depths according to the hydraulic conditions of the study area. The size of the elements of the mesh used in the calculations generally is higher than the resolution of digital terrain models available, so that processing time would be suitable and which are related to cell size. The results successfully represent runoff within the watershed. Appropriate selection of the value of the friction coefficient of the Manning formula influences, largely, in the magnitudes of the velocities and depths of flow. Maps maximum depths, maximum speed and severity parameter (or multiplication deep drag velocity) for return periods of two, 5, 10, 50 and 100 years for river floods and storm were obtained. The maximum values that appear in the maps refer to the largest amount came to present at a certain point in each of the cells in the spreadsheet grid.

40|$|Executive SummaryThe Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims {{to achieve}} Good Environmental Status (GES) withinEuropean Commission waters through an ecosystem‐based approach. The MSFD {{requires}} Member Statessharing a marine region or sub‐region to cooperate {{to ensure that}} the Directive’s objectives are achievedWorking towards an ecosystem perspective: Proposals for the integration of pelagic, benthic and food web indicatorsand to coordinate their actions through Regional Seas Conventions e. g. the OSPAR Commission for theNorth‐East Atlantic. As part of the ‘applying an Ecosystem Approach to (sub) Regional Habitat Assessments’(EcApRHA) project, integration of indicators under Descriptor 1 (biodiversity), 4 (food webs) and 6 (seafloorintegrity), relating to pelagic and benthic habitats and food webs have been forwarded to work towards anecosystem’s approach in assessing habitats regionally. The content of this report covers differentapproaches developed to integrate indicators forwarded within the project. Five methods are described, four of which were developed to integrate indicators developed under theEcApRHA project. The fifth, OSPAR’s cumulative effect approach has also been summarised as an additionalapproach to integrate indicators. For each method, management implications; the advantages anddisadvantages in relation to being able to work toward assessment of GES; and the confidence in theassessments, are highlighted. The time it would take for the approach to become fully operational, itsfeasibility and costs are also discussed. From the five methods described, three main approaches are discussed:I. A quantitative method to draw links between indicators to assess pressures that have effectson the different aspects of the marine ecosystem (Chapters 3 ‐ 4). II. Use of the Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT) to integrate differentindicators to provide an overall assessment (Chapters 5 and 6). III. Use of an industry <b>led</b> <b>risk</b> assessment tool (Bow‐Ties) to assess cumulative effects (Chapter 7). The integration approaches outlined within this document demonstrate the developments made within theEcApRHA project to ensure the various indicators under the different descriptors are not only operational,but also integrated in a way which permits a more holistic assessment of the marine environment. Usingsuch a two‐tiered approach of individual indicator and integrated analysis, will enable an understanding ofwhy certain aspects of the marine environment may not be in good condition, and thereby recommendspecific management measures to ameliorate them. Although the approaches forwarded have been initiallytrialled in the North‐East Atlantic, they are able to be applied to other MSFD Regional seas areas. Eachmethod addresses different levels of integration (indicator, habitat or ecosystem) and requires furtherdevelopment and testing. They should be thus considered as complementary and gaps should beprogressed in parallel to ensure coherent progress towards an overall ecosystem approach. In addition,with some further comparative testing between the different methods outlined within this document,options to continue forwarding integrated assessment of OSPAR indicators could be proposed. Themethods outlined within this document are a first step in applying an ecosystem’s approach to assessingthe state of our seas...|$|E

Currently, the most effective method for preventing premature mortality and morbidity due to BC is the increased use of screening programs and adjuvant therapies (Berry et al. 2005). In particular, effective early detection strategies are preferred to adjuvant therapies because they result in less morbidity.|$|R
