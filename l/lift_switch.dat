40|$|Exchanges of {{switches}} is a {{time consuming}} and costly procedure that entails high risks for the contractor while the profit margin is low. The high cost is partly linked to the machine costs, where especially the cranes that lifts switchparts represent a major cost item. The cranes major drawback lies beyond the cost of these, in essence, the cranes can not perform any other activity than lifting, {{making it more difficult}} to reduce setup times. To reduce the cost of switch exchanges, this study intended to investigate the possibilities of using large construction machinery and, for the task specially adapted, a load distributing beam to <b>lift</b> the precast <b>switch</b> components. Construction machinery has historically been used to <b>lift</b> <b>switches</b> often without load distributing measures which can directly be contrary to the quality of deflection of the switch components, which the swedish transport administration regulations specify. Construction machinery can, unlike cranes, carry out other activities than just lifting where setup times are reduced and overall machine cost of the switch exchange should reduce. The study is thus designed to examine and clarify the conditions required for an alternative switch exchange method to be used. The conditions are based on the requirements that arise related to production, quality and contract aspects where the study also have included three traditionally utilized methods, gantry crane, rail-mounted crane and mobile crane. This is to enable to compare {{the pros and cons of}} the alternative method in comparison to the established switch exchange methods. The alternative method is also, along with the other switch exchange methods, tested against two real projects, the rebuilding of the meeting railyards Kaisepakte and RensjÃ¶n, with the intention to verify the studyâs theoretically generated demand profiles. The study shows that the overall premise of using an alternative transmission shift method is based on the ability of the contractor to plan and prepare for using the method. Projects based on the swedish transport administration regulations and standards must create a good enough opportunity for the contractor to plan and prepare for the method. Which can be created by:â¢ Continuity and sustainability of the clientâ¢ Clearer quality requirementsâ¢ Increased cooperation between client, contractor and construction plannerâ¢ Focus on planningThe study of comparative analyzes also show that the switch exchange project have a tendency to change and comes with a high level of complexity, which makes it very difficult to argue that a single switch exchange method is fitted to meet the demands of all types of projects. Clear however is that the methods complement each other in regards to being able to master each other's weaknesses. The exception is the alternate switch exchange method and mobile cranes which impose similar requirements on the projects. Which could lead to the alternative method could be able to acquire the mobile cranes place as switch exchange method. The alternate switch exchange method's most obvious drawbacks are associated with:â¢ Changes in the length of the switch partsâ¢ The presence of contact wireâ¢ The presence of slopes and ditchesâ¢ Transport limitations to/from the siteValiderat; 20140924 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} pilot project that creates an intelligent outage management System which accurately locates faults in real-time and send fault details to the relevant maintenance crew. Several measures of reliability indices have been developed by the electric utility industry to measure system performance. The reliability of supply is governed by the frequency and the duration of interruptions to supply {{and the number of}} customers affected by interruption. An Outage Management System (OMS) will certainly help utilities identify and restore outages sooner and more efficiently. A fault affected zone in the distribution network can be isolated from the healthy part of the network by disconnecting the affected sector using Air Break <b>Switches,</b> Drift down <b>Lift</b> Off <b>switches,</b> (D. D. L. O) or Autoreclosers. That equipment can be used to optimize the restoring process by isolating smallest possible section of the network affected by fault. Without confining merely to an Outage Management System (OMS), this can be further developed to a supervisory control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) that facilitate distribution automation function with communications, help to strengthen existing distribution systems and provide a strong foundation for building a fully implemented feeder scheme. But presently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) which is the national utility responsible for the major portion of distribution of electrical power in Sri Lanka is not taking maximum usage of automation facility of currently available equipment. There is no proper coordination between automated equipment. Also proper automatic reporting and recording system is not available. As a result of this, expected level of reliability improvement couldn't be achieved. Hence the automatic outage program can be used to overcome above shortage. Main objective of the project is to develop automatic outage reporting and controlling system for the North Western Province Branch of CEB, integrating all switching facilities like Auto recloses, GSM fault indicators, Non GSM fault indicators and Load break switch to improve distribution network reliability. The proposed outage management system has modern features such as Data acquisitioning from GSM fault indicators, storing the data for future analysis, indicating the fault location in network diagram, Generating the massage automatically and sending to nearest crew, and Capable of handling data base files. Since North Western Province has very complicated electrical network, Thulhiriya - Kuliyapitiy feeder which has large number of transformers and having long length is selected as pilot project considering distribution indices such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) using past outage data of year 2008 and 2009. Based on SynerGEE software reliability data, the locations to install new GSM type fault indicators, Non GSM type fault indicators were identified. So 10 number of GSM type fault indicators, 20 number of Non GSM type fault indicators, 08 number of DDLOs, were installed. The outage management system was developed using Visual Basic 6 for usage of at the Distribution Control Centre. Then program was installed in the control centre and executed for six months. Then the reported break down was compared with break down history of the feeder and Financial Feasibility Analysis was done. It was observed that the initial investment is paid back within first four years which indicates the implement of the Outage Management system is financially feasible.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Variable Valve Timing (VVT) presents a powerful tool in the relentless pursuit of efficiency improvements in the internal combustion engine. As the valves have such ultimate control over the gas exchange processes, extensive research effort in this area has shown how valve event timing can be manipulated to reduce engine pumping losses, fuel consumption and engine out emissions. Pumping losses may be significantly reduced by use of throttleless strategies, making use of intake valve duration for load control, while alternative cycles such as the Miller cycle allow modification of the effective compression ratio. More recently, the value of single valve operation in part load conditions is exploited, bringing with it the concept of asymmetric valve lifts. Work in this area found the side effect of asymmetric valve operation is {{a significant change in}} the behaviour of the in-cylinder flow structures, velocities and turbulence intensity. Work presented in this thesis exploits asymmetric valve strategies to modify the in-cylinder flow conditions. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a method employed in the fluids dynamics field to facilitate the separation of coherent motion structures from the turbulence. In the presented work, the application of POD to in-cylinder flow analysis is further developed by the introduction of a novel method for identifying the POD modes representative of coherent motion and those representative of the turbulence. A POD mode correlation based technique is introduced and developed, with the resulting fields showing evidence of coherence and turbulence respectively. Experimental tests are carried out using a full length optically accessible, single cylinder research engine equipped with a fully variable valve train (FVVT) to allow full control of both valve timing and lift. In-cylinder flow is measured through the use of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at several crank angle timings during the intake stroke whilst the engine is operated under a range of asymmetric valve strategies. The exhaust valves and one intake valve have their respective schedules fixed, while the second intake valve schedule is adjusted to 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, 20 %, 0 % lift. The resulting PIV fields are separated into coherent motion and turbulence using the developed technique, allowing for analysis of each constituent independently. The coherent element gives insight to large scale flows, often of the order of magnitude of the cylinder. These structures not only give a clear indication of the overall motion and allow assessment of flow characteristics such as swirl and tumble ratio, but the variation in the spatial location of these structures provides additional insight to the cyclic to cycle variation (CCV) of the flow, which would not otherwise be possible due to the inclusion of the turbulent data. Similarly, with the cyclic variation removed from the turbulent velocity field, a true account of the fluctuating velocity, u' and derived values such as the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) may be gained. Results show how manipulation of a one intake valve timing can influence both the large scale motions and the turbulence intensity. By the reduction of lift, the swirl ratio is increased almost linearly as the typical counter-rotating vortex pair becomes asymmetric, before a single vortex structure is observed in the lowest <b>lift</b> cases. A <b>switching</b> mechanism between the two is identified and found to be responsible for increased levels of CCV. With the reduction in lift, TKE is observed not only to increase, but change the spatial distribution of turbulence. Of course, the reduction in valve lift comes with the penalty of a reduced valve curtain area. However, it was identified both in literature and throughout this study that the reduction in lift did not negatively influence the engine breathing as the same trapped mass was achieved under all cases with no adjustment of manifold pressure. While literature shows both bulk motion and turbulence are key in liquid fuel break-up during the intake stroke, the mixing effects under port-injected natural gas were investigated experimentally using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF). The valve strategy was found to have no significant effect on the mixture distribution at the time of spark...|$|R
