5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, the <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> documents {{are placed in}} separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some of these materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E

5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized.

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifty years the American legal system {{has changed from}} a system {{dominated}} by case law to a system dominated by legislation. The expanding role that legislation has assumed is apparent, not only by the scholarly commentary precipitated by this change, but also by the new legislative research tools which have become commonplace in many law libraries. Well-established legal publishers and newer entrepreneurs are offering an array of computer-based systems that the researcher can use for searching <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> and pending and enacted legislation. For instance, with the computer-based products of Congressional Information Service, the Congressional Quarterly, and other services, the researcher can compile federal <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> more quickly than with manual tools. Moreover, researchers can perform online searches of pending legislation for a multitude of jurisdictions on the bill status and tracking systems such as the systems offered by Commerce Clearing House and Public Affairs Information.

40|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is {{the only}} federal policy that {{provides}} job-protected leave in the United States. However, FMLA leave is unpaid, and restrictive eligibility requirements preclude over 40 percent of the workforce from taking advantage of this law. Cognizant of the FMLA’s limitations, {{family and medical leave}} advocates supported the bill as moderate legislation that could be improved with later incremental changes. While such changes have not happened at the federal level, several states have passed their own leave laws that offer wage replacement, cover more workers, lengthen leave duration, and expand definitions of “family” for the purposes of leave. This report provides a comprehensive account of state <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> with regard to family and medical leave, pre- and post-FMLA, and considers whether such state action has realized the FMLA as incremental policy. State <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> suggest that, for most workers, family and medical leave has not been substantially expanded. However, recent increases in state legislative activity also suggest the issue is gaining momentum...|$|R

40|$|URL] Using an {{original}} dataset comprising {{thirty years of}} <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> of U.

She reiterated the concern that arbitration did not fully safeguard the rights of an unsophisticated investor, and noted that the right to sue was so well established by case law that an implied cause of action was not necessary.|$|E

The federal government considers the use of medical cannabis by probationers to be a violation.

25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E
40|$|How should courts handle interpretive choices, {{such as when}} {{statutory}} text strongly points to one statutory meaning but strong evidence of legislative intent suggests a contradictory statutory meaning? Courts have addressed this longstanding dilemma inconsistently. Sometimes courts follow {{statutory text}} over contradictory legislative intent; sometimes they do the exact opposite. Though reaching contradictory conclusions, many courts facing interpretive choices {{have argued that the}} law of interpretation provides definitive solutions. This Article argues that the opposite is true: the law of interpretation generates, rather than resolves, interpretive choices. When this occurs, legally unconstrained judicial discretion and extralegal factors, rather than the law of interpretation, determine legal meaning. While other scholars have focused on the role of judicial discretion in shaping legal meaning, their analyses invariably have centered on inherently ambiguous legal texts or <b>legislative</b> <b>histories.</b> This Article, by contrast, demonstrates how, in cases of interpretive choice, unique features of the law of interpretation turn unambiguous legal texts and <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> into ambiguous statutes. This Article also explores how courts facing interpretive choices misrepresent the nature and capacity of the law of interpretation. Rather than acknowledging the central role of judicial discretion and extralegal considerations, courts argue that the law of interpretation definitively resolves interpretive choices. Rule-of-law values and the consonant desire to preserve the legitimacy of judicial decisionmaking prompt courts to opt for this obfuscatory strategy. This Article, however, offers an alternative strategy—transparent justification—and explains why the case in favor of transparent justification is much stronger than most might imagine...|$|R

40|$|We examine three {{theories}} of Progressive Era regulation: public interest, industry capture, and information manipulation {{by the federal}} bureaucracy and muckraking press. Based on analysis of qualitative <b>legislative</b> <b>histories</b> and econometric evidence, we argue that {{the adoption of the}} 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act was due to all three factors. Select producer groups sought regulation to tilt the competitive playing field to their advantage. Progressive reform interests desired regulation to reduce uncertainty about food and drug quality. Additionally, rent-seeking by the muckraking press and its bureaucratic allies {{played a key role in}} the timing of the legislation. We also find that because the interests behind regulation could not shape the enforcing agency or the legal environment in which enforcement took place, these groups did not ultimately benefit from regulation in the ways originally anticipated. ...|$|R
