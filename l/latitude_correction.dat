40|$|FY- 2 C {{satellite}} data, {{with high}} temporal resolution and vast coverage range, have been applying for long-term and dynamic drought-monitoring, {{as well as}} for weather forecast, especially for forecasting disaster weather. Considering that the traditional remote sensing drought-monitoring models are easily influenced by cloud, a cloud index-based drought-monitoring model is presented in this paper. The parameters used in the model are: Max Continuous Cloudy Days (CCD), Max Continuous Cloud-Free Days (CCFD), Cloudy Days Ratio (CDR) and Temperature Difference from Day to Night (TD). As the important improvement, the <b>latitude</b> <b>correction</b> function to the three cloud parameters is introduced to the model. Finally, the 20 cm deep soil moisture data from Oct. 2005 to Sep. 2006 are used to validate the accuracy of this model. The result shows that the improved model is efficacious in the great extent drought detection and forecast. 1...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} Be- 10 (t(sub 1 / 2) = 1. 5 x 10 (exp 6) years) and Be- 7 (t(sub 1 / 2) = 53. 28 days) {{concentrations in}} water targets exposed for 1 to 2 years at Echo Lake, Colorado (elevation = 3246 m) and at La Jolla, California (140 m). Neutron monitor data {{were used to}} normalize the measured concentrations in order to calculate production rates equivalent to the cosmic ray flux averaged over four solar cycles (43 years). The Be- 7 production rates thus obtained correspond to 6. 03 +/- 0. 07 x 10 (exp - 6) atom/g. O/s at Echo Lake and 5. 06 +/- 0. 20 x 10 (exp - 7) atom/g. O/ s at La Jolla. The Be- 10 production rates correspond to 3. 14 +/- 0. 18 x 10 (exp - 6) atom/g. O/s at Echo Lake and 2. 68 +/- 0. 47 x 10 (exp - 7) atom/g. O/s at La Jolla. When compared with Be- 10 production rates determined in Be- 10 -saturated rocks from the Antarctic and with theoretical calculations based on meteorite and lunar sample data, {{we find that the}} million-year average production rate is about 14 - 17 % greater than the present production rate averaged over the last four solar cycles. Comparison with production rates determined by measuring glacially polished rocks from the Sierra Nevada in California indicates that average production (based on a revised 13, 000 -year deglaciation age and a geographic <b>latitude</b> <b>correction)</b> is a about 11 % greater than the average over the last four solar cycles. The measured Be- 10 /Be- 7 production ratio in oxygen is 0. 52 +/- 0. 03 at Echo Lake and 0. 55 +/- 0. 07 at La Jolla...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGeophysical {{tools such}} as magnetic, gravity and {{electric}} resistivity {{have been used to}} delineate subsurface structures, groundwater aquifer around Cairo–Belbies Desert road. A dipole–dipole section was measured at {{the central part of the}} study area with 2100 m length and electrode spacing 50 m for greater penetration depth. The results of the inverse resistivity data indicate that the study area includes two groundwater aquifers at different depths. The shallow aquifer water is near the surface and the deep aquifer lies at depth of about 115 m and exhibits low resistivity values ranging from 20 to 100 ohmm. One hundred and fifty-two gravity stations were measured using Autograv gravimeter (CG 3), different gravity corrections (drift, elevation and <b>latitude</b> <b>corrections)</b> were applied. The corrected data represented by Bouguer anomaly map were filtered into regional and residual gravity anomaly maps. The residual gravity map indicates that the area is dissected by many faults with NW-SE, N-S, E-W and NE-SW trends. One hundred and fifty-three ground magnetic measurements are collected using two Proton magnetometers (Envimag). The corrected magnetic data are represented by total magnetic intensity map that was reduced to the magnetic pole. 3 D magnetic modeling was applied to detect the depth of basaltic sheet and basement complex. The results indicated that the elevation of upper surface of basalt is ranging from 148 to − 153 m and the elevation of lower surface of basalt is ranging from 148 to 269 m...|$|R
40|$|Copyright (c) 2006 - 2007 Japan Science and Technology AgencyAirborne gravity {{measurement}} {{has long}} been a desirable goal for exploration geophysicists. Success of the air-borne gravity surveys mainly depends on determining the three-dimensional(3 -D) position of the moving platform(i. e. airplane/helicopter). Recent advances in technology, especially in Global Positioning System(GPS) have made it possible to determine the velocity and 3 -D position of the moving platform with greater accuracy. Taking these advantages of the GPS technology and using a gravimeter system newly developed, helicopter-borne gravity measurements were successfully carried out over the Kanto district of Japan during May, August and December 1999. This new gravimeter system is composed of a servo accelerometer sensor, a stabilized platform, an optical-fiber gyroscope to control the stabilized platform, a data processor & controller, onboard GPS receivers and a land-based GPS receiver. Gravity acceleration and GPS positioning data were collected at intervals of 0. 1 sec and 1 sec respectively. The GPS positioning data were used to compute helicopter vertical acceleration, Eoetvoes, altitude and <b>latitude</b> <b>corrections,</b> which were applied to the measured gravity acceleration. The gravity acceleration data collected were processed and necessary corrections were applied. Numerical filtering was carried out to remove high frequency noises present in the data. The observed free-air gravity anomalies were quite comparable with the upward continuation of the anomalies observed on the ground. Thus the preliminary analysis of the test data demonstrates the feasibility of helicopter-borne gravity measurements. (author abst. ...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal and <b>latitude</b> {{dependent}} <b>corrections</b> to {{the gravity}} and height anomalies are developed {{in order to}} account for the neglect of the atmospheric masses outside the geoid, when using Stokes' equation. It is shown that the atmospheric correction to gravity at sea level is almost constant, equal to 0. 871 mgals with a variation of 2 microgals whereas the height anomaly correction varies between - 0. 1 cm and - 1. 3 cm. Further, when the combined latitudinal/seasonal dependence is neglected in the atmospheric corrections, the maximum error introduced is on the order of 40 microgals for the gravity corrections and 0. 7 cm for the height anomaly corrections...|$|R
40|$|A far-ultraviolet {{spectrometer}} {{and several}} far-ultraviolet photometers {{have been carried}} to an altitude of 347 km to measure the spectrum of three regions at high galactic <b>latitudes.</b> After <b>correction</b> for O I airglow and for stars {{in the field of}} view, a nearly uniform residual intensity of 285 plus or minus 32 photons per (sq cm s sr A) is found over the spectral range 1230 - 1680 A, along with some evidence for a sharp rise in intensity longward of 1680 A. It is argued that the signal {{is not likely to be}} due to light scattering from interstellar dust. The flat spectrum could represent the integrated light of distance galaxies. The sharp rise must be due to some other phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-eight {{latitudinal}} {{cross sections}} of stratospheric ozone observed by the SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) and SBUV (Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet) satellite instruments {{on the same}} days in March and April 1979 and at approximately the same latitude are compared. Differences in the zonal-mean mixing ratios are found. At pressures less than 5 mbar, SAGE gives approximately 20 percent larger mixing ratios at tropical <b>latitudes</b> (after a <b>correction</b> has been applied for the expected diurnal variation of ozone). The uncorrelated portion of the SBUV variances are smaller than the SAGE noise variances at altitudes above 10 mbar, which indicates that the SBUV experiment should provide excellent detectability of longitudinal ozone variations...|$|R
40|$|A cosmic-ray {{telescope}} is described having an angular resolution of approximately ± 15 °. The {{distance between the}} two outermost trays, each containing 8 Geiger counters, is 1 meter. The area of each tray is approximately 24 × 24 cm^ 2. Triple coincidences modulate a transmitter and the signals, including those giving the air pressure and temperature of the instrument, are recorded on the ground. The counting rate is such that {{at the peak of}} the curve the relative probable error during a 4 minute interval is about 1. 5 percent. Accidental counts are found to be nearly negligible at all altitudes and <b>latitudes,</b> but some <b>correction</b> needs to be made for loss in efficiency because of the inherent dead time of the counters. An absolute determination of cosmic-ray intensity at the vertical at Pasadena was made in order to express the results as nearly as possible independently of the apparatus used...|$|R
40|$|Mean {{temperatures}} for {{the normal}} period (1961 - 90) from 513 stations in Sweden, {{together with their}} geographical positions, are used to derive temperature sums and average lengths of the growing season for different threshold values as functions of latitude and altitude. Maps are drawn showing the distribution of these temperature indices. Swedish regional average forest yield is well correlated with the temperature sums for the threshold value 5 °C (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0. 89). Solar radiation data for the period 1983 - 91 from 14 stations in Sweden are used to estimate global radiation reaching the earth's surface during clear days and during days irrespective of cloudiness. This data set {{is also used to}} derive global radiation sums expressed as functions of <b>latitude</b> and altitude. <b>Corrections</b> for an approximate adjustment of temperature indices to the soil surface level and with respect to local continentality/maritimity are proposed.

40|$|The Muenster Redshift Project (MRSP) {{is a large}} low-resolution galaxy-redshift survey, where {{pairs of}} film copies of direct and very low-dispersion objective-prism Schmidt plates are {{analysed}} fully automatically. This communication describes updated methods employed for the determination of galaxy redshifts z. For calibration, 1183 galaxies with z sO. 3 and rFs 18. 5 (bJ S 19. 5) are used. The spectra have the linear reciprocal dispersion 245 nm mm- 1 at H y. The random errors range between O"z=O. Ol 1 (best subsamples) and 0. 031 (total sample). For the total sample the redshift errors depend on redshift, magnitude, morphological type and galactic <b>latitude.</b> The corresponding <b>corrections</b> {{can be obtained from}} the measured error distributions given in this paper. The best subsamples are not contaminated by galaxies with large systematic errors, and can be used for cosmological investigations, taking into account only the magnitude-dependent effects. It should be noted that galaxy redshifts obtained with low-resolution spectra cannot be used individually. However, the large number of redshifts and the large survey volumes permit the determination of statistical quantities with high significance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{absolute}} accuracy {{and stability of}} the radiometric calibration of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) by analyzing {{the difference between the}} brightness temperatures measured at 2616 cm(exp - 1) and those calculated {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA), using the Real-Time Global Sea Surface Temperature (RTGSST) for cloud-free night tropical oceans between +/- 30 degrees <b>latitude.</b> The TOA <b>correction</b> is based on radiative transfer. The analysis of the first 3 years of AIRS radiances verifies the absolute calibration at 2616 cm(exp - 1) to better than 200 mK, with better than 16 mK/yr stability. The AIRS radiometric calibration uses an internal full aperture wedge blackbody with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable prelaunch calibration coefficients. The calibration coefficients have been unchanged since launch. The analysis uses very tight cloud filtering, which selects about 7000 cloud-free tropical ocean spectra per day, about 0. 5 % of the data. The absolute accuracy and stability of the radiometry demonstrated at 2616 cm(sup - 1) are direct consequences of the implementation of AIRS as a thermally controlled, cooled grating-array spectrometer and meticulous attention to details. Comparable radiometric performance is inferred from the AIRS design for all 2378 channels. AIRS performance sets the benchmark for what can be achieved with a state-of-the-art hyperspectral radiometer from polar orbit and what is expected from future hyperspectral sounders. AIRS was launched into a 705 km altitude polar orbit on NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) Aqua spacecraft on 4 May 2002. AIRS covers the 3. 7 - 15. 4 micron region of the thermal infrared spectrum with a spectral resolution of nu/Delta nu = 1200 and has returned 3. 7 million spectra of the upwelling radiance each day since the start of routine data gathering in September 2002...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{results from a}} series of {{observations}} conducted with the Westerbork telescope in the 140 [...] 160 MHz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimed at characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionization experiments. For the first time we have detected fluctuations in the Galactic diffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 MHz, in the low Galactic latitude area known as Fan region. Those fluctuations have an rms of 14 K. The total intensity power spectrum shows a power [...] law behaviour down to ℓ∼ 900 with slope β^I_ℓ = - 2. 2 ± 0. 3. The detection of diffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual point sources. We measured an rms confusion noise of ∼ 3 mJy beam^- 1. Diffuse polarized emission was also detected {{for the first time at}} this frequency. The polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially and along the line of sight. The polarization power spectrum shows a power [...] law behaviour down to ℓ∼ 2700 with slope β^P_ℓ = - 1. 65 ± 0. 15. The rms of polarization fluctuations is 7. 2 K on 4 arcmin scales. By extrapolating the measured spectrum of total intensity emission, we find a contamination on the cosmological signal of δ T= √(ℓ (ℓ+ 1) C^I_ℓ / 2 π) ∼ 5. 7 K on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding rms value of ∼ 18. 3 K at the same angular scale. The level of the polarization power spectrum is δ T ∼ 3. 3 K on 5 arcmin scales. Given its exceptionally bright polarized signal, the Fan region is likely to represent an upper limit on the sky brightness at moderate and high Galactic <b>latitude.</b> Comment: Minor <b>corrections</b> made to match the final version printed on A&A.
