40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and mass <b>lifted</b> on the peak low back load in terms of net moments, compression forces and anterior-posterior shear forces. Ten participants had to lift a box using four handle heights. Low back loading was quantified using a dynamic 3 -D linked segment model and a detailed electromyographic driven model of the trunk musculature. The effects of <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and <b>lifting</b> mass were quantified using a regression technique (GEE) for correlated data. Results indicate that an increase in <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and a decrease in lifting mass were related to a decrease in low back load. It is argued that trunk flexion is a major contributor to low back load. For ergonomic interventions it can be advised to prioritise optimisation of the vertical location of the load to be lifted rather than decreasing the mass of the load for handle heights between 32 cm and 155 cm, and for load masses between 7. 5 and 15 kg. <b>Lifting</b> <b>height</b> and load mass are important determinants of low back load during manual materials handling. This paper provides the quantitative effect of <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and mass <b>lifted,</b> the results of which can be used by ergonomists at the workplace to evaluate interventions regarding <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> and load mass...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. One {{of basic}} {{elements}} of band bucket elevators is their drive. For determination of power drive {{it is necessary to}} conduct calculations on standard by methods, in what it is needed to expend enough time. One of project parameters is productivity of elevator. It is necessary to build parametric dependence of power drive of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of load, <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of band buckets elevators, the parametric dependences of power drive of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of load and height of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> load type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator power drive are certain in a general view. As the example of application of the recived results the construction process of power drive dependence from design capacity of elevator of shotblasting room, which is intended for transporting of the metallic shot using for consolidating of carriage springs, is considered. For concrete type of load and <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> of such elevator graphic dependence of power drive on productivity was built. Originality. Parametric dependences of elevator power drive on its design capacity were first built, which take into account a type and physical and mechanical descriptions of load, <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} selects {{the lifting}} task {{to be the}} main subject. Four experiments were designed to measure which among <b>lifting</b> postures, <b>lifting</b> <b>heights,</b> waist-belt, and breathing control significantly influences intra-abdominal pressure (Gallagher, 1991; Lavender, Andersson and Natarajan, 1999). The experimental results were taken to be the recommendations of the manual materials handling work design. The research findings reveal that the symmetrical stoop posture is the most significant to the intra-abdominal pressure within all lifting postures. When the <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> is increased, the intra-abdominal pressure produced relatively goes up. Also, the combination of symmetrical stoop posture, waist-belt use, and inspiration and holding at the same time is the most efficient in carrying out lifting tasks. Simultaneously, the research discovers that for any posture, the volume of the intra-abdominal pressure is much bigger when using the waist-belt compared to when it is not used. Therefore, the waist-belt design for the lifting works might be the future research approach...|$|R

50|$|There {{are some}} {{shortcomings}} or difficulties {{when working with}} an MFM, such as: the recorded image depends {{on the type of}} the tip and magnetic coating, due to tip-sample interactions.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{signals from}} magnetite nanoparticle-labeled PC 12 cells were assessed by {{magnetic force microscopy}} by deploying a localized external magnetic field to magnetize the nanoparticles and the magnetic tip simultaneously so that {{the interaction between the}} tip and PC 12 cell-associated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles could be detected at <b>lift</b> <b>heights</b> (the distance between the tip and the sample) larger than 100 nm. The use of large <b>lift</b> <b>heights</b> during the raster scanning of the probe eliminates the non-magnetic interference from the complex and rugged cell surface and yet maintains the sufficient sensitivity for magnetic detection. The magnetic signals of the cell-bound nanoparticles were semi-quantified by analyzing cell surface roughness upon three-dimensional reconstruction generated by the phase shift of the cantilever oscillation. The obtained data can be used for the evaluation of the overall cellular magnetization as well as the maximum magnetic forces from magnetic nanoparticle-labeled cells which is crucial for the biomedical application of these nanomaterials...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the work was to {{describe}} the physical principles of impulse pumping and investigate its potential applications in petroleum engineering. Investigations of the potential applications of impulse pumping were based on analysis of head, flow rate and efficiency performances for pumping of hydrocarbon fluids. The secondary purpose of the work was to analyse pressure wave propagation and attenuation models in fluid-filled production tubings. Additionally, one dimensional numerical simulation methods were investigated for accurate modelling of pressure transient events in pipelines, such as water hammer phenomena. Pressure wave propagation, transmission and reflection characteristics were first studied. Finite volume methods were also studied for numerical simulation of one-dimensional pressure transient phenomena. Accuracy of pressure wave attenuation models was then analysed using a contradiction method, relying on analysis of numerical simulation tools for pressure transient events. Impulse pumping physical principles were next described using fundamentals of pressure wave propagation. A numerical simulation tool was then developed to reproduce impulse pumping physical principles, using a finite volume numerical scheme. Impulse pumping performances were modelled afterwards in terms of <b>lifting</b> <b>heights,</b> flow rates and efficiency, based on results from the developed numerical simulation tool. Potential applications of impulse pumping in petroleum engineering were then analysed using the performance model. Impulse pumping generates flow from bottomhole to wellhead using pressure waves generated at wellhead. Fluid can be transported from bottomhole to wellhead without theoretical <b>lifting</b> <b>height</b> limitations using impulse pumping. Impulse pumping performances were illustrated and a range of petroleum engineering applications was investigated. Impulse pumping greatest efficiency is obtained for artificial lift of water from shallow wells. Impulse pumping performances depend on pressure wave amplitude, wellhead pressure, <b>lifting</b> <b>height,</b> fluid compressibility and volume occupied in the production tubing.

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.

50|$|Manual {{handling}} {{refers to}} the use of a worker’s hands to move individual containers by lifting, lowering, filling, emptying, or carrying them. It can expose workers to physical conditions that can lead to injuries that represent {{a large percentage of the}} over half a million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported in the U.S. each year, and often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs. Ergonomic improvements can be used to modify manual handling tasks to reduce injury. These improvements can include reconfiguring the task and using positioning equipment like lift/tilt/turn tables, hoists, balancers, and manipulators to reduce reaching and bending. The NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) 1991 Revised Lifting Equation can be used to evaluate manual lifting tasks. Under ideal circumstances, the maximum recommended weight for manual lifting to avoid back injuries is 51 lb (23.13 kg). Using the exact conditions of the <b>lift</b> (<b>height,</b> distance lifted, weight, position of weight relative to body, asymmetrical lifts, and objects that are difficult to grasp), six multipliers are used to reduce the maximum recommended weight for less than ideal lifting tasks.|$|E
