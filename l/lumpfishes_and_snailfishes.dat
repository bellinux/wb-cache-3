40|$|February 20 - 21, 2012, BANGKOK, THAILANDHarbour seals are {{protected}} in Japan {{due to their}} restricted range, low population numbers and previous decimation by hunting, habitat damage and being caught incidentally in fishing nets.

With the rise in seal numbers, increased conflict with fisheries has occurred through depredation and the belief that seals compete with fisheries for prey. However, competition is unlikely if seals and fisheries take mostly different prey species and obtain fish from different areas or at different times. We studied the diet and foraging behaviour of harbour seals in Erimo, site of the largest population of harbor seals in Japan, from 2011 - 2012.

Health surveillance, carried out at regular intervals during the rearing period, revealed persistent and highly prevalent Kudoa infections of fish muscles which caused great financial losses due to post mortem myoliquefaction. In addition, during the traditional process of drying and smoking wild Atlantic lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, the muscles from some fish almost completely disappear and the fish have to be discarded. To describe the etiological agent responsible for these conditions, spotted wolffish, Atlantic wolffish Anarhichas lupus, northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus <b>and</b> Atlantic <b>lumpfish</b> were caught off the Icelandic coast and examined {{for the presence of}} Kudoa. We describe a novel myxosporean, Kudoa islandica n. sp., using morphological and molecular data, and show with histopathology that it causes extensive myoliquefaction in three different wild fish hosts, which all are commercially valuable species in Iceland. Although some spore dimensions varied significantly between fish species, the molecular analyses showed that the same parasite was responsible for infection in all fish. The northern wolffish was not found to be infected. Although robustly placed in the Kudoa clade in phylogenetic analyses, K. islandica was phylogenetically distinct from other kudoids. A single myxosporean, K. islandica, is responsible for the infections in the somatic muscles of <b>lumpfish</b> <b>and</b> wolffish, causing extensive post mortem myoliquefaction. This myxosporean is likely to infect other fish species and it is important to study its life cycle in order to evaluate any threat to salmonid culture via the use of lumpfish as a biocontrol for sea lice...|$|R
40|$|Small cetaceans, such as harbour porpoises, {{often become}} {{entangled}} in gillnets, and this anthropogenic mortality is a conservation concern. For years, harbour porpoises have been captured regularly in fisheries in waters of Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada), but defendable estimates have been lacking. Incidental catch of small cetaceans in nearshore and offshore gillnet fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador waters was studied {{for the years}} 2001, 2002 and 2003, using datasets from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, reports from fishers, and Fishery Observer records. Fisheries studied included those targeting Atlantic cod, lumpfish, Atlantic herring, monkfish, white hake, Greenland halibut, redfish and winter flounder. [...] A methodology was developed to estimate incidental catch, based on datasets currently available within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Confidence intervals were generated using resampling statistics, allowing an assessment of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Despite reductions in fishing effort since 1992, an estimated average of 1, 516 harbour porpoises were captured in various Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually between 2001 and 2003. Most captures occurred in nearshore fisheries for Atlantic cod <b>and</b> <b>lumpfish.</b> Several dolphin species were also captured in smaller numbers, mostly in the offshore monkfish fishery. The impact of this mortality on the population of harbour porpoise and other small cetaceans cannot be assessed until population estimates become available. [...] Using the same methodology, incidental catch assessments were compiled for numerous species of pinnipeds, seabirds, sharks and bony fish that had been reported as incidental catch. For most species, insufficient information exists {{to assess the impact}} of this mortality. However, catch rates of harbour seals, murres. shearwaters, various shark species and sturgeons appear to warrant concern.

50|$|Fisheries in Iceland and Greenland are {{the main}} {{contributors}} to the worldwide catch of <b>lumpfish.</b> Historically, Norway <b>and</b> Canada also contributed significant amounts but due to {{a decrease in the}} price of salted roe, and a severe population decline in Canada, the contribution from these countries has decreased.

Lumpfish are targeted close to the shore, where they come to spawn, using small fishing boats (generally less than 15 m) with large mesh gillnets.

40|$|This thesis uses {{studies of}} {{physiology}} and behaviour {{to better understand}} the foraging and predator-avoidance tradeoffs experienced by young marine fishes. It has previously been speculated that, due to their small size and high growth rates, larval and juvenile fish may have a limited aerobic capacity compared to adult individuals. This could be an important constraint influencing the behavioural ecology of young fishes, but has been difficult to evaluate because there has been no single study to examine changes in metabolic rate or aerobic scope for any fish species over their entire life history. Thus, an important first step in this thesis was to examine the standard (minimal) metabolism, maximal metabolism, and aerobic scope for three species of north Atlantic marine fish (shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpius, ocean pout Zoarces americanus, <b>and</b> <b>lumpfish</b> Cyclopterus lumpus) from the larval stage until adulthood. This research showed that young fish have a greatly increased mass-specific metabolic demand compared to adults, and that their aerobic scope is vastly diminished. The results also suggest that the relationship between aerobic scope and life history stage is greatly influenced by a species' developmental trajectory. [...] A second group of projects then investigated the effects of increased mass-specific metabolic demand on anti-predator behaviour in young marine fishes. It is known that most animals will reduce foraging while in the presence of predatory threat, but that individuals are often more risky (i. e. they will continue to forage) during times when they are hungry or have increased energetic requirements. However, despite their high mass-specific energy demands, it was observed that young ocean pout and larval shorthorn sculpin both display large foraging reductions when exposed to predators. Due to the high energetic requirements of these fishes, these results suggest that these foraging interruptions could be very costly. To support this view, these studies also found that frequent, prolonged exposures to a predatory threat caused reduced growth, decreased lipid stores, and reduced ability to acquire certain essential dietary fatty acids that are crucial for normal development. [...] A final study then examined how a limited aerobic scope may affect the choice of foraging strategy in young lumpfish - a species that can either actively forage by swimming, or use a "sit-and-wait" foraging strategy while clinging to the substrate using a ventral adhesive disc. Behavioural observations showed that lumpfish predominantly use the 'cling' foraging strategy when prey is abundant, but resort to the more costly 'swim' strategy to seek out food when prey is scarce. The metabolic cost of active foraging was also quantified using swim-tunnel respirometry, and a model was devised to predict the prey density at which lumpfish should switch between foraging modes to maximize energy intake. The results of this model do not agree with previous observations of <b>lumpfish</b> behaviour, <b>and</b> thus it appears that juvenile lumpfish do not try to maximize their net energetic gain. Instead, the data suggest that juvenile lumpfish forage in a manner that reduces activity and conserves space in their limited aerobic scope...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2008 As a {{first step}} towards {{evaluating}} the influence of oceanographic structure on the survival of larval fishes during the fall, winter and spring months off northern California, I examined the distribution of larval fishes, including larval rockfishes (Sebastes) and zooplankton, in relation to hydrographic structure along a transect extending due west of Trinidad Head, California from April 2006 to April 2007. Dominant taxa included the deep-sea smelts (Bathylagidae), northern lampfish (Stenobrachius leucopsarus), righteye flounders (Pleuronectidae), rockfishes (Sebastes), <b>and</b> slipskin <b>snailfish</b> (Liparis fucensis). Cross-shelf ichthyoplankton diversity patterns reflected adult spawning seasons and locations, {{and the distribution of}} coastal and offshore species agreed with ichthyoplankton assemblages identified in previous studies off California and Oregon. Liparids, some pleuronectids, most cottids, and the osmerids were consistently in the coastal assemblage. Sebastes, bathylagids, and myctophids were consistently in the offshore assemblage. These assemblages were relatively persistent across seasons. Although cross-shelf distributions differed among taxa, hydrographic structure appeared to affect distributions of larval fishes. Larval Sebastes were commonly observed at their greatest densities in the vicinity of fronts, while larvae of inshore taxa, including some flatfish, were rarely encountered offshore of fronts. Cross-shelf advection associated with upwelling conditions appeared to drive a general offshore displacement of larval fishes, while cross-shelf advection associated with downwelling caused a nearshore displacement of larvae. Hydrographic structure appeared to affect distributions of potential zooplankton prey throughout the winter and spring, and ichthyoplankton and zooplankton distributions were correlated in April 2007. These results suggest that fronts and related structures might affect larval survival and recruitment success in fishes for which the early life history stages exist in the plankton during the winter and spring, when coastal upwelling is at a seasonal minimum...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} long-term implications of Iceland’s nationwide Individual Transferrable Quota (ITQ) system on rural communities and small-boat fishing livelihoods drawing on {{two years of}} ethnographic research in Northwest Iceland, a nationwide mailed survey of small-boat fishermen, and the compilation of fisheries human dimension indicator data for the lumpfish fishery. Results from ethnographic interviews and participant observation show that {{while there is a}} wide range of complex political, social, and environmental changes affecting coastal communities, the changes brought on by the ITQ system are perceived to have been particularly significant. Survey results suggest that the majority of small-boat fishermen perceive the ITQ system as serving the goal of wealth accumulation over the goal of resource conservation. Survey respondents and interview informants report high cultural connections to fishing through family history, but express concern that future generations may be precluded from fisheries livelihoods due to the prohibitory cost of entry into the ITQ system. Furthermore, survey responses, ethnographic interviews, and indicator data suggest that non-ITQ fisheries like the <b>lumpfish</b> fishery <b>and</b> the strandveiðar season do not serve as substantial platforms to support newcomers to fisheries. These non-ITQ fisheries can make individuals and communities more resilient by providing extra income and, at the same time, can offer social flexibility to access a fishery of cultural and historical value. However, survey and interview data also suggest that the strandveiðar fishery has resulted in new rifts in communities as Icelandic society struggles with differing perceptions of equitable access to marine resources. Survey and interview data show how decision-making power lies {{in the hands of a}} few dominant interest groups, leaving smallboat fishermen and rural communities at a disadvantage with little power to meaningfully influence national politics. Finally, the compilation of human indicator data in the lumpfish fishery highlights concepts of multiple (social, economic, and biological) goals in fisheries management and the benefits of participatory governance structures. Conclusions from this dissertation underscore the complexity of fisheries systems and the important role equity plays in sustainable fisheries management and governance...|$|R

Extraction of pigments, odorous matter and {{free amino acids}} occurred during washings. The unacidified dispersions were highly viscous and stable to heat and centrifugal force. Over 90 % of the protein in the dispersions remained in solution after heating at 70 or 100 °C. However, on addition of acetic acid, viscosity of shark protein dispersion was lowered. Total amino acid composition of the dispersion virtually remained unchanged due to washing. The protein efficiency ratio (PER) values of washed meats, calculated by an amino acid scoring methodology, were {{comparable to those of}} unwashed meats. However, over 60 % of the free amino acids were extracted due to washing, thus producing a bland product. [...] Enzyme-assisted hydrolysis of shrimp heads <b>and</b> female <b>lumpfish</b> after roe extraction was carried out. Of the enzymes considered (Alcalase, Neutrase and Trypsin), Alcalase was the most efficient in producing protein hydrolysates with desired degree of hydrolysis (DH) and highest nitrogen recovery (NR). Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the hydrolysis conditions using Alcalase for shrimp heads <b>and</b> <b>lumpfish</b> proteins. A polynomial regression model was used to predict the optimum conditions for the process, these were 58 °C at pH 8. 1 and enzyme/substrate concentration ratio of 33. 1 AU/kg crude protein for shrimp protein hydrolysis for a predicted DH of 17. 8 %. The optimum hydrolysis conditions for lumpfish protein, as predicted by the regression model, were temperature, 63 °C; pH. 8. 1 : and enzyme/substrate concentration ratio. 28. 5 AU/kg crude protein for a DH of 18. 4 %. Nitrogen recovery in shrimp <b>and</b> <b>lumpfish</b> protein hydrolysates prepared under optimum hydrolysis conditions were 72. 2 and 79. 9 %, respectively. The regression coefficient (R²) values which were > 0. 95 and the close values of experimental hydrolysis results to those predicted, indicated the adequacy of the models employed. The total amino acid composition of the prepared shrimp <b>and</b> <b>lumpfish</b> protein hydrolysates were similar to those of their starting materials. However, over a 14 -fold increase in the content of free amino acids was noted in these protein hydrolysates. Furthermore unique functional characteristics of the hydrolysates with respect to moisture and fat adsorption, emulsifying capacity, emulsion stability, among others, were noted. Addition of 3 % (w/w) shrimp protein hydrolysate to mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) resulted in cooking yield and drip volume of 118 % and 5. 3 mL/ 100 g, respectively, as compared with 76 % and 10. 6 mL/ 100 g for the control. These effects of the addition of shrimp protein hydrolysates compare favourably with those obtained for commonly used phosphates (sodium tripolyphosphate, trisodium pyrophosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate) in food. The protein hydrolysates also displayed antioxidant activity in a meat model system by inhibiting the formation of 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and in a β-carotene/linoleate emulsion system by delaying the bleaching of β-carotene. Sephadex G- 15 column separation of the peptides of shrimp protein hydrolysate afforded 5 fractions based on their absorbance at 220 and 280 nm, with fraction IV being most antioxidatively active. All fractions were further separated using a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic system and afforded multiple peaks with different retention times based on the hydrophobic nature of the peptides. The eluates also had antioxidative activity when tested in a β-carotene/linoleate system. [...] The high level of free amino acids and peptides in the shrimp protein hydrolysates was exploited in the generation of volatile flavour compounds from the reaction involving shrimp protein hydrolysate and glucose via Maillard reaction. The compounds obtained included pyridines, pyrazines, aldehydes, furan derivatives, sulphur-containing compounds, among others. The number and concentration of volatile compounds from hydrolysate 1 (DH, 11. 2 %) and hydrolysate 2 (DH, 17. 1 %), only differed marginally. The major compounds formed were Strecker aldehydes and their corresponding substituted pyrazines. The most abundant volatile compound formed was 3 -methylbutanal which accounted for 28 % of the total amount of flavour compounds identified in hydrolysate 2. [...] Extraction of antioxidant components of shrimp was performed by employing various solvents which differed in their polarity. Ethanol was the most suitable extraction medium and afforded extracts which exhibited antioxidant activity in a β-carotene-linoleate emulsion system. The components of the extract were separated using a silica gel column and further isolation was performed by thin layer chromatography which afforded four components. Two low polarity compounds as well as two high polarity compounds were separated using n-hexane-acetone (3 : 1. v/v) and n-butanol-water-acetic acid (3 : 1 : 1, v/v/v), respectively, as developing solvents. Reversed-phase HPLC was used to purify the compounds followed by their structural elucidation using electrospray mass spectrometry. The compounds are 3 -membered ring phenolics and were identified as 7 -(3 -butenyl) - 2 -hydroxy- 6 -(1. 2. 5. 6 -tetrahydro-pyridin- 2 -yl) quinoline and 7 -(3 -butenyl) - 2 -hydroxy- 6 -(1. 2. 5. 6 -tertahydropyridin- 2 -yl) - 7. 8 -dihydroquinoline and their isomers...|$|R
40|$|Diet {{composition}} of grey seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Gulf) {{and around the}} coast of Newfoundland, Canada, was examined using identification of otoliths recovered from digestive tracts. Prey were recovered from 632 animals. Twenty-nine different prey taxa were identified. Grey seals sampled in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence fed mainly on capelin, mackerel, wolffish <b>and</b> <b>lumpfish</b> during the spring, but consumed more cod, sandlance and winter flounder during late summer. Overall, the southern Gulf diet was more diverse, with sandlance, Atlantic cod, cunner, white hake and Atlantic herring dominating the diet. Capelin and winter flounder were the dominant prey in grey seals sampled from {{the east coast of}} Newfoundland, while Atlantic cod, flatfish and capelin were the most important prey from the south coast. Animals consumed prey with an average length of 20. 4 cm (Range 4. 2 - 99. 2 cm). Capelin were the shortest prey (Mean = 13. 9 cm, SE = 0. 08, N = 1126), while wolffish were the longest with the largest fish having an estimated length of 99. 2 cm (Mean = 59. 4, SE = 2. 8, N = 63). In the early 1990 s most cod fisheries in Atlantic Canada were closed because of the collapse of the stocks. Since then they have shown limited sign of recovery. Diet samples from the west coast of Newfoundland indicate a decline in the contribution of cod to the diet from the pre-collapse to the postcollapse period, while samples from the southern Gulf indicate little change in the contribution of cod. </div...|$|R
40|$|There {{are more}} than ten {{different}} species of fishes in the Pacific Northwest with ventral adhesive organs that facilitate adhesion to marine substrates. The performance of these adhesive discs have been measured in three species. These include the Northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus), Pacific spiny lumpsucker (Eumicrotremus orbis), <b>and</b> tide pool <b>snailfish</b> (Liparis florae). While the clingfish that lives in the intertidal zone where waves continually crash down, it is the other two who {{have been shown to}} have stronger discs. Scanning electron microscopy and photography of cleared and stained individuals was used to look for differences in morphology that might explain these performance differences. High speed videography was used to determine the mechanism of detachment for E. orbis and L. florae because this is unknown. All three species have different disc morphology (Fig. 1); E. orbis and L. florae have much large papillae than G. maeandricus and a more rigid support to their disc which may help to explain the difference in disc performance. Papillae may increase friction which prevents the disc from slipping and rigid pelvic spines resist bending of the disc. Both E. orbis and L. florae seem to use abduction of their pelvic fins and operculum to brace themselves as they pull back the anterior edge of their disc, causing failure and allowing the disc to be peeled back in the anterior direction. Modeling discs based off these morphologies could be done to create a strong, bio-inspired suction cup for human use...|$|R
