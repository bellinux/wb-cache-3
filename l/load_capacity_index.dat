40|$|AbstractHeavy truck {{tires are}} one of the main sources of road traffic noise. However, the {{mechanism}} and propagation of the noise generated by these tires have not been systematically investigated. To determine the noise of heavy truck tires with different structures and patterns, and to analyze the correlation between the indoor tire noise and coast-by tire noise, an integrated tire indoor noise test and a coast-by noise test were designed and successfully implemented. The indoor test was conducted on a drum inside a semi-anechoic chamber to simultaneously measure the near field and far field noise of the tires. The outdoor measurements were carried out using a coast-by test on the new ISO 10844 surface. A formula for quantitative analysis with appropriate corrections was developed to analyze the data with reasonable errors, which can be used to predict the coast-by noise through the indoor tire noise test accurately and effectively. The analysis shows that when trying to build the relationship between indoor and outdoor heavy truck tire noise, care should be taken to differentiate the tires with a <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> in excess of 121 and without any dual fitting indication from ordinary tires, due to the specified test procedure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Fly ash or {{pulverized}} fuel ash is {{the residue of}} the combustion of finely ground coal used in thermal power plants. It is removed by the dust collection system as fine particle residue from the flue gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere. Use of Fly ash in concrete will not only {{solve the problem of}} disposal, but will also reduce the consumption of cement, which is a material whose production is energy intensive. Fly ash concrete has found extensive application in mass concrete, pre-cast concrete, concrete used for pavements, structural concrete and roller compacted concrete with the added advantages of increased workability, impermeability, resistance to chemical attack and increased durability in comparison to ordinary Portland cement concrete. Hence, this paper present the investigation of comparison between the flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with that of reinforced normal concrete beams and increase the confidence levels of designers and other beneficiaries in using reinforced Fly ash concrete as a structural material. The flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with different cement replacement levels (20 %, 35 % and 50 %) are compared with reinforced normal concrete beams (without containing Fly ash) under similar conditions. All the beams are reinforced as balanced sections, cured and tested at 28 days. These investigations were conducted with three grades of concrete i. e. M 30, M 40 and M 50. The flexural behaviour of these beams is discussed in terms of its cracking load and ultimate <b>load</b> carrying <b>capacity.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Fly ash, cement replacement material, concrete beams, flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete, cracking <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> and ultimate <b>load</b> <b>capacity.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Network {{reconfiguration}} of a {{power distribution}} system is an operation to alter the topological structure of distribution feeders by changing opedclosed status of sectionalising and tie switches. By transferring loads from the heavily loaded feeders to the lightly loaded ones, network reconfiguration can balance feeder loads and alleviate overload conditions of a network. The branch load-balancing index and the overall system load-balancing index are {{used to determine the}} loading conditions of the system and maximum system <b>loading</b> <b>capacity.</b> The <b>index</b> value has to be minimum in the optimal configuration of load balancing. For optimal load balancing condition the branch load-balancing indices in the network are to be more or less equal, and also approximately equal to the system load-balancing index. A general formulation of the network reconfiguration for load balancing is given for the optimal balancing of loads in distribution network and a solution approach is presented. The solution employs a search over different radial configurations, created by considering branch-exchange type switches. The proposed algorithm, called distance measurement technique (DMT) has been developed based on the two-stage solution methodology. The first stage finds a loop, whch gives the maximum improvement in load balancing in the network. In the second stage, a switching option is determined in that loop to obtain maximum improvement in load balancing. The DMT employs a graphical method in which dlfferent circles are drawn and the distances of various points from the centre of the loop circle are computed to achieve the optimal or near optimal configuration for load balancing. The solution algorithm of the proposed method can identify the most effective branch-exchange operations for load balancing with minimum computational effort. The algorithm has been tested with promising results on a 69 -bus radial distribution system...|$|R

The ROT is based on first principles and data available in the literature and it relates bearing <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> to the bearing size and speed through an empirically based <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient, D. It is shown that <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is a linear function of bearing surface velocity and bearing projected area.

40|$|This {{investigation}} elucidates the <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> {{of wooden}} shores and adjustable steel tube shores that {{are commonly used}} in construction. A series of loading tests was performed based on actual setups used on construction sites. Research results reveal that the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of an isolated wooden or an adjustable steel tube shore declines as its length increases, and the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of adjustable steel tube shores greatly exceeds that of wooden shores of the same length in isolated and multi-post shoring systems. A wooden shore fails by buckling under compression load. The failure of an adjustable steel tube shore in tests is due to buckling when the shore length exceeds 3. 96 m, and the failure will be resulted from damage of connecting tube lock if the shore length is less than 3. 96 m. When the top block of the adjustable steel tube shore is a wooden stringer, the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is remarkably less than when it is a steel block. Adjustable steel tube shores will be reduced in <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> after reuses. The <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of an isolated shore is reduced when the shore is placed on an inclined base. Reinforcing an isolated wooden shore with horizontal wooden bars and iron wires increases its <b>load</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, when an isolated wooden shore is reinforced with lateral cable bracings, the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is not affected.

40|$|Ball screw {{mechanisms}} (BSM) {{and planetary}} roller screw mechanisms (PRSM) belong to promising energy-saving mechanisms converting rotary motion into linear motion. To calculate and design these mechanisms the static and dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> are used. In case a standard {{size of the}} mechanism to be designed is available in manufacturer’s catalog, the specified <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> can be taken from the catalog, and if not, then the static load for the mechanism being designed can be calculated. To determine the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity,</b> long-term and costly experimental studies are to be conducted. Therefore, the crucial task is to forecast the BSM and PRSM dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> and, further, the service life of these mechanisms. As follows from the analysis of information provided in manufacturers’ catalogs, there were established correlative relationships of static and dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> for BSM and PRSM with the parameters determining their standard sizes. Using these relationships and methods of power regression enable us to obtain empirical dependences linking the factor equal to the ratio of static <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> to dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> with parameters defining standard sizes of the mechanisms. To predict BSM and PRSM service lives the said ratio is calculated using the empirical dependence, static <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of the mechanism being designed is determined by means of calculation using known procedures, and then dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is determined as the quotient of static <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> division by the said factor.

Two Generation III foil air bearings with the same design but possessing different initial radial clearances were tested at room temperature against an as-ground PS 304 coated journal operating at 30, 000 rpm. Increases in radial clearance were accomplished by reducing the journal's outside diameter via an in-place grinding system. From each <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> test the bearing <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient was calculated from the rule-of-thumb (ROT) model developed for foil air bearings.

Relative to this optimum value are two separate operating regimes that are governed by different modes of failure. Bearings operating with radial clearances less than the optimum exhibit <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficients that are a strong function of radial clearance and are prone to a thermal runaway failure mechanism and bearing seizure.
