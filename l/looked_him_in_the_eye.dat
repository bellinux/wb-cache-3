500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E

After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me. The next day I sought him out, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and said, 'Mr. Lubitsch, I'm willing {{to do my best}} but I just can't go on working on this picture if you're going to keep shouting at me.' 'I'm paid to shout at you', he bellowed. 'Yes', I said, 'and I'm paid to take it – [...] but not enough.' After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing. From then on we got along famously." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 1968, {{their first}} album Truth was released; by October it {{had risen to}} number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album {{featured}} Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs, and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again {{at the end of}} the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure. Stewart later recalled: [...] "It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> – I always looked at his shirt or something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} {{tried to get a}} picture with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E
6000|$|Calvin spurred {{his horse}} {{alongside}} Yarpe's and <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> with a glare {{which made the}} older man wince. [...] "You be decent before these women or I'll cut the heart out o' ye. You hear me!" ...|$|E

6000|$|That {{night he}} took Rosine under the mango tree by Goodwin's porch, and confessed everything. She <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and said: [...] "You {{are a very}} wicked man. Father and I will go back home. You {{say it was a}} joke? I think it is a very serious matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{thinking}} of going by skiff to the next town, Necharsteinach; so I ran to the riverside {{in advance of the}} party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire. I suppose I must have spoken High German--Court German--I intended it for that, anyway--so he did not understand me. I turned and twisted my question around and about, trying to strike that man's average, but failed. He could not make out what I wanted. Now Mr. X arrived, faced this same man, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and emptied this sentence on him, in the most glib and confident way: [...] "Can man boat get here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly {{natural and}} a {{frequent}} occurrence," [...] interposed the Colonel cheerfully. [...] "Only last year I met an old friend whom we'll call Stidger, of New Orleans, at the Union Club, 'Frisco. 'How are you, Stidger?' I said; 'I haven't seen you since we used to meet--driving over the Shell Road in '53.' 'Excuse me, sir,' said he, 'my name is not Stidger, it's Brown.' I <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> sir, and saw him quiver. 'Then I must apologize to Stidger,' I said, 'for supposing him capable of changing his name.' He came to me an hour after, all in a tremble. 'For God's sake, Star,' he said,--always called me Star,--'don't go back on me, but you know family affairs--another woman, beautiful creature,' etc., etc.,--yes, sir, perfectly common, but a blank mistake. When a man once funks his own name he'll turn tail on anything. Sorry for this man, Friezecoat, or Turncoat, or whatever's his d----d name; but it's so." ...|$|E

50|$|Robinson <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{and said}} they would pass soon enough, and more than that, he would tell Bruner when it was coming. With the ball on its own 25-yard line, first down, St. Louis called for a pass on the first down. Robinson went back into punt {{formation}} and shouted to Bruner {{that they were going}} to show him the pass and to warn the rest of his team, because they were going to see something.|$|E
50|$|In {{regards to}} His Holiness's intellective state, both Dr Costello and Dr Malik {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} of sound cognitive state, {{and that he was}} able to clearly communicate with his family and medical staff. In regards to the reports by the USA doctors, Dr Omar denied there was any evidence of a receptive speech problem. Dr Costello further expresses he felt a special connection with His Holiness as he often greet him with a smile of recognition, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> interacted in English, and even become lively at times.|$|E
50|$|However this {{happened}} twice more in similar circumstances and on being struck {{the third time}} she stood up to her full height, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and stated that their relationship was now over. She simply turned on her heel {{and walked out of}} their farm and as she crossed their land every sheep, lamb, cow, calf, hen, chick, duck, goose, pig and horse followed her. She ascended to the lake and wordlessly walked in once more, every animal following her beneath the cold still waters, leaving the man heart broken in the shallows, his pleas resounding around the mountains arms.|$|E

5000|$|Receiving top billing in Ernst Lubitsch's comedy Heaven Can Wait (1943), as Martha Strable Van Cleve, {{signaled}} {{an upward}} turn in Tierney's career.
