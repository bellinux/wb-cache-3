5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (<b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key).</b> The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key</b> model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by {{interactions with the}} substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>Key,</b> Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E

At home, Chippy suffers with a head cold, but Mrs. Hackee's lack of expression in the illustration leaves the reader wondering how she took his abrupt return. One wonders why Mrs. Hackee did not pursue Chippy once she learned of his whereabouts from a bird. After the reader discovers Goody is the happy mother of triplets and Timmy has made the decision to keep his nuts under <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key,</b> he may wonder what sort of fate the future holds for the Hackees.|$|E

25|$|The {{library was}} a major {{reference}} and research resource, but there were detractors.

On 19 December of that year, his sermon against bishops and the Book of Common Prayer attracted hostile attention from apprentices, who smashed the premises's windows.

25|$|During the Restoration era (February 1665 – August 1714) a soap tax was {{introduced}} in England, which meant that until the mid-1800's, soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. The soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure that soapmakers' equipment was kept under <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key</b> when not being supervised. Moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law which stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each boiling, which placed the process beyond reach of the average person. The soap trade was boosted and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.|$|E
25|$|Forced {{prostitution}} and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key</b> until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because {{they do not want to}} abandon their child.|$|E

25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is obviously a replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical frame members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key.</b> These are of modern origin.|$|E
500|$|Lafayette, in the meantime, {{was expecting}} the {{imminent}} arrival of long-delayed reinforcements. [...] Several battalions of Pennsylvania Continentals under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne {{had also been}} authorized by Congress for service in Virginia in February. [...] However, Wayne {{had to deal with}} the aftereffects of a mutiny in January that nearly wiped out the Pennsylvania Line as a fighting force, and it was May before he had rebuilt the line and begun the march to Virginia. [...] Even then, there was a great deal of mistrust between Wayne and his men; Wayne had to keep his ammunition and bayonets under <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key</b> except when they were needed. Although Wayne was ready to march on May 19, the force's departure was delayed by a day because of a renewed threat of mutiny after the units were paid with devalued Continental dollars. [...] Lafayette and Wayne's 800 men joined forces at Raccoon Ford on the Rappahannock River on June 10. [...] A few days later, Lafayette was further reinforced by 1,000 militia under the command of William Campbell.|$|E
500|$|Pathogens {{synthesize}} {{proteins that}} can serve as [...] "recognizable" [...] antigens; they may express the molecules on their surface or release them into the surroundings (body fluids). What makes these substances recognizable is that they bind very specifically and somewhat strongly to certain host proteins called antibodies. The same antibodies can be anchored {{to the surface of}} cells of the immune system, in which case they serve as receptors, or they can be secreted in the blood, known as soluble antibodies. On a molecular scale, the proteins are relatively large, so they cannot be recognized as a whole; instead, their segments, called epitopes, can be recognized. An epitope comes in contact with a very small region (of 15–22 amino acids) of the antibody molecule; this region is known as [...] the paratope. In the immune system, membrane-bound antibodies are the B cell receptor (BCR). Also, while the T cell receptor is not biochemically [...] classified as an antibody, it serves a similar function in that it specifically binds to epitopes complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The binding between a paratope and its corresponding antigen is very specific, owing to its structure, and is guided by various noncovalent bonds, not unlike the pairing of other types of ligands (any atom, ion or molecule that binds with any receptor with at least some degree of specificity and strength). The specificity of binding does not arise out of a rigid <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>key</b> type of interaction, but rather requires both the paratope and the epitope to undergo slight conformational changes in each other's presence.|$|E

50|$|Physical {{access control}} {{is a matter of}} who, where, and when.
