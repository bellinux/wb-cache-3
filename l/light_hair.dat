5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in <b>light</b> <b>hair.</b> Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by <b>light</b> <b>hair</b> (usually white or cream in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E

25|$|The MATP gene {{is highly}} conserved, {{especially}} among mammals. The human MATP gene is 82% {{identical to the}} mouse MATP gene, 79% identical to the rat MATP gene, 35% to the zebrafish version, and 30% identical to the fruitfly MATP gene. The gene is best known in humans as being {{the location of a}} mutation that results in human type IV oculocutaneous albinism (OCA4). Type IV oculocutaneous albinism, like other types of human albinism, results in hypopigmentation of the skin and eyes, with increased rates of skin cancer and reduced visual acuity. None of these effects are associated with the equine cream gene. Other human MATP polymorphisms result in normal pigment variations, specifically fair skin, light eyes, and <b>light</b> <b>hair</b> in Caucasian populations.|$|E

500|$|The comic, {{published}} monthly in Highlights for Children, {{consists of}} two panels depicting the actions of two children, Goofus and Gallant. Gallant's actions are always virtuous and respectful, in contrast to Goofus's, which are always rude and selfish. They are presented {{side by side with}} a brief caption (e.g. [...] "Goofus turns on the television when there are guests; whenever guests arrive, Gallant turns off the television at once.") though the direct results of their actions, good or bad, are never depicted. The strip's protagonists have varied in age and appearance over time, variously shown with long or short, or dark or <b>light</b> <b>hair</b> and aged twelve or eight or five years old. Goofus and Gallant have never appeared in the same panel of the comic.|$|E

500|$|Harald is {{described}} by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically [...] "larger than other men and stronger". He {{is said to have}} had <b>light</b> <b>hair</b> and beard, a long [...] "upper beard" [...] (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly had big hands and feet, and could measure five ells in height. It is not known whether Snorri's description of Harald's physical appearance actually represents historical facts. The tall stature of Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald [...] "six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men" [...] (according to Henry of Huntingdon) or [...] "six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men" [...] (according to Snorri Sturluson).|$|E

The woman in the photo was stated to resemble the victim's reconstruction and her physical description. The photograph {{is believed to have been}} taken between 1979 and 1981, also fitting the time frame in which Jane Doe was found. Kalhauser refused requests from the authorities to identify the woman in the photograph.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{the second}} oldest of the four Shuzen vampire sisters. She has <b>light</b> <b>hair</b> and a dark complexion. Although she {{exhibits}} a naive, childlike personality, she is a top assassin. Her fighting style is like {{a child with a}} tantrum: when she cries, she can kill without feeling. Her crucifix earrings act as power restraints, similar to Moka's rosario; when one is taken off, she can transform her arm into an array of a sharp bat wing. She can block out pain during a battle, but risks incurring fatal wounds because of it. When both off her earrings are removed, her body becomes a blood-like liquid where she can survive decapitations, transform both hands into razor wings, and discharge drops of herself as high velocity concussive projectiles. Kahlua first appears in the Land of the Snow Fairies to facilitate alliance negotiations between the Snow Fairies and Fairy Tale; but if the alliance is not accepted, she is to execute everyone. She decimates the Newspaper Club, and fights Moka with an earring removed until Miyabi intervenes and cancels the order. At the Fairy Tale headquarters, she supports her mother in fighting the Newspaper Club. After Koko fatally stabs her while she is paralyzed by holy water, Kahlua reveals that the chaos she and her mother has been causing was to win back their father's heart. In the final Season II volume, Miyabi infuses her with his First Ancestor blood, stating that she was [...] "too innocent to die"; in the epilogue bonus comics, she makes a miraculous recovery, and partners with Aqua to grow the Shuzen family's influence. Her name is based on Kahlúa, a coffee-flavored liqueur.|$|E
