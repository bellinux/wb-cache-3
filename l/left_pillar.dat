40|$|AbstractIn bariatric surgery, it is {{essential}} to completely release the Fundus {{in order to create a}} narrow gastric pouch. The upper part of the fundus is located above the omental bursa and is therefore retro-peritoneal. In order to release this completely, not only does the arterial supply to the fundus need to be divided to visualise the <b>left</b> diaphragmatic <b>pillar,</b> but the right attachment beginning at the <b>left</b> diaphragmatic <b>pillar</b> and running towards the fundus needs to be divided. This minimal dissection is compensated by further dissection at the level of the <b>left</b> diaphragmatic <b>pillar</b> and traction on the stomach from right to left during the final division stapling division process. The surgeon still has the impression of having released the posterior aspect of the Fundus, exposing the pillar of the diaphragm, although in fact part of the Fundus still remains adherent to the diaphragm and is therefore not released...|$|R
50|$|Two paintings, in opulent {{frames of}} the early 18th century, depict two figures of prophets in Carmelite robes: the prophet Elisha (on the right pillar) and the prophet Elijah (<b>left</b> <b>pillar),</b> with an angel {{indicating}} water and bread. They are both works of the Veronese painter Matteo Brida (1699-1745), and an expression of a late 17th-century taste.|$|E

5000|$|The trinity of Zach (either from Hebrew זְכַרְיָה Zechariah ′Yah has remembered′ or יִצְחָק Yitskhak Isaac 'he will laugh'), Jake (from Hebrew יַעֲקֹב Yaʿaqov Jacob {{from the}} root עקב ʿqb 'to follow', 'to be behind', 'to supplant', 'circumvent', 'assail', 'overreach') and Avi (Hebrew אֲבִי ′my father′) are {{representative}} of Kabbalistic right, centre and <b>left</b> <b>pillar</b> energies, respectively. Avi is {{a black man who}} is somewhat effeminate in his physical appearance, clothing and mannerisms. The 'left pillar' or 'left column' in Kabbalistic traditions is often associated with 'the feminine' and with the colour black. Jake's surname is [...] "Green", and the colour green is associated with the central column or pillar in Kabbalistic traditions. Zach is a hefty, gargantuan, white man who 'dresses down' in a very archetypically 'masculine' way. Both masculinity and the colour white are associated with right column or right pillar energies in Kabbalistic traditions.|$|E
5000|$|Located some 6 km {{from the}} city centre, the bridge spans the small {{mountain}} River Besletka, and {{dates back to the}} late 12th century. Thirty-five meters in overall length (the arch itself is 13.3 m) and eight meters high, this single-arch bridge {{is one of the most}} illustrative examples of the medieval bridge design popular during the reign of Tamar of Georgia (r. 1184-1213) who is traditionally credited to have commissioned the construction of the Beslet bridge. A contemporary inscription in the early Georgian asomtavruli alphabet reads: [...] "Christ the Lord, glorify in every possible way in both lives." [...] An engraved cross and the Greek Τ have survived in the lower part of the <b>left</b> <b>pillar</b> of the bridge. A stone stele with Georgian inscriptions stood at the head of the bridge, but was lost during the War in Abkhazia early in the 1990s. In the vicinity of the bridge are the ruins of medieval combat towers, a testimony to strategic importance of the locale.|$|E

50|$|Cardinal Gian Girolamo Albani, protonotary apostolic was an {{influential}} politician, jurist, scholar and diplomat in the papal court {{during the last}} decades of the 16th century. He served as an advisor to four successive popes {{until his death in}} 1591 at the age of 81 years. His finely crafted tomb is set against the <b>left</b> <b>pillar</b> by the entrance of the Costa Chapel. The Late Renaissance monument {{is one of the main}} works of Giovanni Antonio Paracca (also known as Il Valsoldo). The bust of the Cardinal, praying in the niche, is a realistic portrait of the old statesman. The signs of aging and the cardinal's rugged features are accentuated by the strong strokes of the chisel. The flanking pillars are herms with veiled heads; their shafts are decorated with thick garlands of fruits. There is a small winged angel above the niche, and the base is decorated with another winged head and shrouds. The monument is crowned with the coat-of-arms of the cardinal held by two putti.|$|E
50|$|Also, in its {{original}} state, the chapel had been enclosed laterally by two magnificent screens of stone, which were like enormous gates. The Pulpit, or Gospel side of the church, with its screen, was demolished {{to make room for}} the sepulchre of Cardinal Mendoza. The lectern, or Epistle side, remains as it was and by this it can be deduced that it was part of a larger work. Some art critics assure us that this stone screen is the most beautiful part of the cathedral. It is possible that its construction was completed during the tenure of Archbishop Pedro de Luna whose polychromatic shield and coat of arms of Castile and León are displayed here. It is adorned with abundant statuary including a sculpted choir of angels that appear to be flying. The two pillars that form the passage to the interior of the chapel were built to harmonize with this work of fretted stone. On the <b>left</b> <b>pillar</b> is a statue of Martín Alhaja, the famous shepherd who (according to legend) led King Alfonso VIII of Castile through the Despeñaperros Pass in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa; the other pillar is called Faqih's Pillar after its statue of Abu Walid who brought King Alfonso VI a message of tolerance (see this section).|$|E

50|$|The Ace of Coins is {{depicted}} as a hand holding a Pentacle or a coin, with a 5 pointed star on it, out of a cloud. There is a lush garden behind, suggesting plenty. It {{can also be seen}} as the Garden of Eden. Outside the garden can be seen two mountain peaks, suggesting the right and <b>left</b> <b>pillars</b> of the Qabalah. Both lead to higher amounts of wealth. The flowers in the garden are white- symbolizing innocence, perhaps innocent relationships such as the friendship shared by Adam and Eve before the fall. One of the flowers is {{in the shape of a}} cross, possibly representing self-sacrifice. This sacrifice could be as simple as suffering a natural death, as self-sacrifice is the only way into heaven. As with all the Aces, the Ace of Pentacles symbolises a beginning and something new coming being offered. This will often be a new source of money coming to someone. It is usually extra regular money of some description. It can indicate new opportunities leading to increased prosperity. The card indicates a change for the better financially, or at least, the opportunities are there to improve your financial situation. You will probably have to take some action in order to take advantage of this new flow of money. It can also point to improved cash flow through better money management.|$|R

50|$|Giles did {{not attempt}} an {{organised}} expedition until 1872, when with two other men he <b>left</b> Chambers <b>Pillar,</b> South Australia (now in the Northern Territory), on 22 August and traversed much previously untrodden country to the north-west and west. Finding their way barred by Lake Amadeus and that their horses were getting very weak, a return was made to the Finke River and then to Charlotte Waters and Adelaide, where Giles arrived in January 1873. Giles looked upon his expedition as a failure, but he had done well considering the size and equipment of his party.|$|R
