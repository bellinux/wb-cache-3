The mid-late Holocene highstand ceased prior to 500 BC and RSL fell from + 1. 3 ± 0. 1 m to 0. 45 ± 0. 15 m by 1000 AD at a rate of − 0. 5 mm/yr. The RSL minimum occurred during the late 1700 s to 1800 s AD at − 0. 2 m below present, before rising during the 1900 s. During the past 500 yr RSL fluctuated, including an abrupt fall at ~ 1750 AD following a sustained multi-decadal high anomaly. Similarly, low RSL anomalies and slow coral growth rates during the 950 to 1000 AD period are indicative of Pacific Basin-wide climate variability and are consistent with extreme La Niña-like climate anomalies previously reported around the Pacific basin. The fall in RSL during the first millennium AD crossed-over tidal thresholds for rapid coastal progradation, when ambient Mean High Water Neaps and Mean High Water Springs fell below the low tide level of the mid-late Holocene high stand.

These cores {{were collected in}} areas where depths ranged to 20 feet of water depth relative to the Mean Lower <b>Low</b> <b>Water</b> (MLLW) tidal <b>datum.</b> The primary goal of this work was to characterize the erosion properties of the sediments in the nearshore region. The Sedflume analysis determines sediment erosion rates, critical shear stress, particle size and wet bulk density at depth intervals down-core. Since critical shear stress is a difficult parameter to quantify exactly, two methods of estimating it are employed for comparison purposes: a power law fitting method and a linear interpolation method. Both methods determine the critical shear stress at which the erosion rate equals 10 - 4 cm/s. The power law fit follows the regression methods of Roberts et al. (1998) and is further described in this report. The linear interpolation solves for the critical shear stress directly, using Sedflume data from intervals prior to, and immediately following, sediment erosion. Oftentimes, {{the results of the}} two methods are similar values. Yet, since there are inherent differences in the two methods, an attempt is made to describe the potential reason for result discrepancies.

40|$|In April 2005, a SHOALS 1000 T LIDAR {{system was}} used as an {{efficient}} alternative for safely acquiring data to describe the existing conditions of nearshore bathymetry and the intertidal zone over an approximately 40. 7 km 2 (11. 8 nm 2) portion of hazardous coastline within the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS). Data were logged from 1, 593 km (860 nm) of track lines in just over 21 hours of flight time. Several islands and offshore rocks were also surveyed, and over 24, 000 geo-referenced digital still photos were captured to assist with data cleaning and QA/QC. The 1 kHz bathymetry laser obtained a maximum water depth of 22. 2 meters. Floating kelp beds, breaking surf lines and turbid water were all challenges to the survey. Although sea state was favorable for this time of the year, recent heavy rainfall and a persistent low-lying layer of fog reduced acquisition productivity. The existence of a completed VDatum model covering this same geographic region permitted the LIDAR data to be vertically transformed and merged with existing shallow water multibeam data and referenced to the mean lower <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (MLLW) tidal <b>datum.</b> Analysis of a multibeam bathymetry-LIDAR difference surface containing over 44, 000 samples indicated surface deviations from – 24. 3 to 8. 48 meters, with a mean difference of – 0. 967 meters, and standard deviation of 1. 762 meters. Errors in data cleaning and false detections due to interference from surf, kelp, and turbidity likely account for the larger surface separations, while the remaining general surface difference trend could partially be attributed to a more dense data set, and shoal-biased cleaning, binning and gridding associated with the multibeam data for maintaining conservative least depths important for charting dangers to navigation.
