So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.|$|E
500|$|Duke University {{basketball}} {{head coach}} Mike Krzyzewski, {{who had just}} completed his first season as Duke coach, was in town to evaluate Johnny Dawkins in a 1981 Washington D.C. summer league game, but was convinced {{to stay for a}} second game to see Amaker play. Krzyzewski met Amaker's mother and said, [...] "Mrs. Amaker, your son is going to <b>look</b> <b>great</b> in Duke blue." [...] At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the Maryland Terrapins because his sister Tami went to the University of Maryland, College Park and Amaker idolized Maryland star guard John Lucas. [...] He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach Chuck Swenson, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Hiddleston portrayed novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in writer-director Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. He then {{played the}} noble Captain Nicholls in War Horse, a film {{based on the}} 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo, {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg. The same year he starred as Freddie Page, a RAF pilot in the drama The Deep Blue Sea, alongside Rachel Weisz. In 2012, he reprised {{his role as the}} supervillain Loki in The Avengers. While filming a scene with Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, the film's director, Joss Whedon told the fighting duo that the scene did not look real enough, so Hiddleston told Hemsworth to really hit him for the fight scene. [...] "I said to Chris, 'Dude, just hit me. Just hit me because I'm protected here and it's fine.' He's like, 'Are you sure?' I was like, 'Yeah, it will <b>look</b> <b>great.</b> Just go for it.'" [...] He provided the voiceover the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead in 2011 and poetry for iF Poems and The Love Book on iTunes in 2012.|$|E

He <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in the clothes, and he <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in that hat that I put on him. And he could strut through Harlem, and he looked like the Godfather of Harlem." ...|$|R

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it <b>look</b> <b>great.</b> He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Jack's {{secretary}} tells Liz that Jack {{wants her}} to apologize, but {{that she has to}} pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would <b>look</b> <b>great</b> in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E
500|$|Commentators commended {{the first}} half of [...] "Space Race". The A.V. Club {{columnist}} Todd VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode—mainly its animation, character development, and dialogue. In his A grade review, VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space. [...] "Archer, of course, takes place in a weird blend of past and present," [...] he professed, [...] "but 'Space Race' goes {{out of its way to}} toss 'future' into the middle of that mix as well. There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti-gravity, for God's sake, including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam's breasts." [...] Commenting on the program's animation, The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals. VanDerWerff stated, [...] "Everything about this one gleams, and it makes for an Archer that will almost certainly <b>look</b> <b>great</b> in HD." [...] Furthermore, he adulated the episode's dialogue, avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor. Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that [...] "Space Race: Part I" [...] contained far too many one-liners and jokes, he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana. [...] "Usually, she’s the best agent ISIS has and can do pretty much anything," [...] explained Canales, [...] "so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don’t prioritize." [...] Cinema Blend's Jesse Carp—despite criticizing the show's [...] "nonsensical" [...] narrative—declared it to be hilarious.|$|E

500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal. Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but a bit on the dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year." [...] Fame magazine called the video [...] "a little edgier than anything Girls Aloud have done".|$|E
500|$|Azeem Ahmad of MusicOMH {{positively}} reviewed Good Girl Gone Bad Live {{giving it}} four stars and wrote that [...] "it isn't {{going to win}} over any new fans, but buying it won't disappoint the many that already exist". According to him the songs are different from their recorded versions and sound [...] "infectiously upbeat but in a more grown-up way than the album". Ahmad concluded that even the [...] "cringey" [...] American pronunciation of [...] "Manchester" [...] and associated drivel can't take away the vocal strength of [...] "Rehab". He further praised the interlude [...] "Scratch" [...] calling it [...] "impressive". Ahmad concluded that [...] "If anyone was still wondering, Rihanna isn't miming during this show but the DVD's audio might be little bit {{out of sync with}} the video." [...] A reviewer of Blu-ray.com was more critical stating that even though the transfer does not has serious technical flaws, the video can not pair to Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009) by American rock band The Killers. According to the reviewer there are few close-ups that look soft and also a lot of motion-judder that ranges from mild to strong. He stated that the camera positioning during a lot of acts in not [...] "overly convincing" [...] and some close-ups are too dark. However, according to him contrast levels are good. The reviewer concluded that [...] "all in all, consistency is definitely an issue with Good Girl Gone Bad; parts of the show <b>look</b> <b>great</b> in high-definition, but there are also certain parts of it that are far from convincing." [...] At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Good Girl Gone Bad Live received a nomination for Best Long Form Music Video, but lost to Runnin' Down a Dream (2007).|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} was very demanding, including an expensive wardrobe budget, which Hudlin felt was completely worth the price. [...] "The clothing {{in the movie}} is incredible, for both {{the men and the}} women. Eddie looks great, Robin and Halle <b>look</b> <b>great.</b> Great hair, great makeup work for all concerned, cause we wanted it to look fantastic. We wanted to give people a level of production value they hadn't seen for Eddie's first foray into true romantic comedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{graphics}} and loading times were generally criticized, however. [...] IGN wrote, [...] "there's {{a ton of}} loading everywhere you turn. Moving from one area to another means 2-5 second loads; initiating a battle means 7-10 second loads; winning a skirmish brings 4-6 second loads afterwards." [...] Game Revolution said of the graphics that [...] "Army battles and in-engine cut scenes look blocky and raw, but the CGI cut scenes are beautiful and detailed. Towns <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> but dungeons are horrid, bland, maze-like nightmares." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pinball {{tables in}} Zen Pinball {{received}} mixed commentary from critics. [...] Some reviewers felt that four tables was {{too little to}} be shipped in the game. [...] GamePros Sean Ely stated [...] "just four tables might seem bare at first" [...] but added that he had [...] "much hope for some DLC in the near future." [...] Destructoid's Brad Nicholson also agreed, stating [...] "With only four tables, {{all of which can}} be accessed from the very beginning, Zen Pinball feels a little light on variety." [...] Six additional tables were later released as downloadable content. [...] Nicholson, however, went on to praise solid table design and functionality. [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN echoed these comments and said the game's tables [...] "are all fun to play, <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> and are hiding all sorts of secrets you'll need to discover if you're going to rack up a high score." ...|$|E
2500|$|For lead actor Jeremy Irvine, {{starring}} {{in his first}} film role, the filming process was intense at times, in particular the scene where the British cavalry, 130 horses in total and many hundreds of extras, charged the German machine gun lines. He explained: [...] "It’s the weapons of the old world—our men on horses—meeting the absolute destruction of these tools of mass slaughter. There was this line of machine guns and there’s this wall of lead coming out of these guns. There were real explosions at my feet, bodies flying through the air, stunt men getting shot at. It was terrifying. The smoke and the smell and {{the taste of the}} guns firing. It’s not difficult to act scared in that situation. There’s no doubt this was deliberate: not only to have the film <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> but to have that effect on the actors. It was an eye-opening scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of the {{graphics}} were also mixed. AllGame's J.C. Barnes was critical, writing, [...] "pop in is extremely widespread in dungeons and towns. Also dungeon textures are bland and repetitive." [...] Game Revolution's Johnny Liu wrote [...] "Graphically, Dark Cloud is colorful if a bit bland. It simply {{looks like a}} first generation game." [...] On the other hand, Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote [...] "All of the models, effects, and textures are sumptuous." [...] IGN's Dave Zydrko was more ambivalent; [...] "Dark Cloud isn't a bad-looking game by any means. The character models actually look really good, completely with jag-free edges, lots of texture detail and really cool designs [...] What hurts Dark Cloud is its background graphics. There's a lot of flickering in the backgrounds, plus clipping problems can be found, there are some instances where you'll see seams in the textures, and the background textures are poorly designed in that they look like floor and wall tiles in the outside environments." [...] GameSpot's Shane Satterfield had similarly mixed views; [...] "Dark Clouds graphics can be both stunning and disappointing. All six characters <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> and it's obvious that {{a great deal of}} time was taken in crafting their personalities through animation [...] Graphical tricks like real-time shadows, depth blur, and particle effects are prevalent in most settings." [...] However, he also felt, [...] "By the third stage of each dungeon, things become undeniably monotonous due to constantly reused textures and objects. Other graphical problems include flickering textures and a camera that regularly gets stuck behind objects while your character is locked on to an enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameInformers Lix Lanier {{stated that}} no villain, male or female, has {{the charm of}} GLaDOS: [...] "If she's not trying to kill Chell, she's likely belittling her with passive-aggressive {{comments}} {{that would make a}} sorority girl proud. Even with her robotic voice, it's clear that 'You <b>look</b> <b>great</b> by the way, very healthy' is no compliment." [...] GamePros Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an [...] "archetypal villain", she is a [...] "prototypical bound woman". He added that [...] "A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not what is interesting to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself". He wrote [...] "GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society" [...] and that [...] "by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear" [...] and making her [...] "far more dangerous". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is [...] "dutiful and does every task assigned of her", GLaDOS is [...] "aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society". He also described Chell as a [...] "domestic icon" [...] while he described GLaDOS as a [...] "progressive, intelligent working woman" [...] and that by killing her, [...] "Chell {{can be seen as the}} dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices.|$|E

60|$|Oh! {{it was a}} {{grand and}} {{beautiful}} sight to behold a corporation in glass coaches, provided at the sole cost and charge of Nicholas Tulrumble, coming rolling along, like a funeral out of mourning, and to watch the attempts the corporation made to <b>look</b> <b>great</b> and solemn, when Nicholas Tulrumble himself, in the four-wheel chaise, with the tall postilion, rolled out after them, with Mr. Jennings on one side {{to look like a}} chaplain, and a supernumerary on the other, with an old life-guardsman's sabre, to imitate the sword- bearer; and to see the tears rolling down the faces of the mob as they screamed with merriment. This was beautiful! and so was the appearance of Mrs. Tulrumble and son, as they bowed with grave dignity out of their coach-window to all the dirty faces that were laughing around them: but it is not even with this that we have to do, but with the sudden stopping of the procession at another blast of the trumpet, whereat, and whereupon, a profound silence ensued, and all eyes were turned towards Mudfog Hall, in the confident anticipation of some new wonder.|$|E
