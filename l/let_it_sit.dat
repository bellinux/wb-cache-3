When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> for a while before finishing it.

50|$|A {{traditional}} Ayurvedic {{recipe for}} ghee is to boil raw milk, let it cool to 110 °F (43 °C). After letting it sit covered {{at room temperature}} for around 12 hours, add a bit of yogurt to it and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> overnight. This makes more yogurt. This is churned with water, to obtain cultured butter, which is used to simmer into ghee.|$|E

Do any of you know the answer? It is said that {{the sound of a}} thump is a ringing sound when the fruit is green, and a dull or dead one when ripe. The problem with thumping is that the dull-dead sound is also a sign of over-ripeness. A better sign is that in most varieties the 'ground spot' {{on the bottom of the}} melon turns from light straw to a richer yellow. Also most watermelons tend to lose the powdery or slick appearance of the top surface, becoming more dull when ripe. When {{can you tell}} that a watermelon is ripe in the field?

5000|$|Kushari tea (...) , {{popular in}} Lower Egypt, is {{prepared}} using the traditional method of steeping black tea in boiled water and <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> {{for a few}} minutes. It is almost always sweetened with cane sugar and often flavored with fresh mint leaves. Adding milk is also common. Kushari tea is usually light in color and flavor, {{with less than a}} half teaspoonful of tea per cup considered to be near the high end.|$|R
50|$|Acidified {{buttermilk}} is {{a related}} product made {{by adding a}} food-grade acid (such as lemon juice) to milk. It can be produced by mixing 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice per 1 cup of milk and <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> until <b>it</b> curdles, about 10 minutes. Any level of fat content for the milk ingredient may be used, but whole milk is usually used for baking.

50|$|Pig blood curd {{is solid}} pig blood. Manufacturers {{coagulate}} fresh blood by <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> {{in a clean}} container for around 10 minutes. The blood cube is cut into smaller pieces, then heated in a pot with medium heat with water. During the heating process, salt is added to solidify the blood cubes, and the pot is occasionally stirred to prevent the water from boiling. After 30 minutes, pig blood curd {{is ready to be}} served. Note that pig blood curds sold in markets should contain small air holes.|$|R
5000|$|Drucker's is {{an old-fashioned}} small town general store, the kind where the grocer {{retrieves}} {{many of the}} items from shelves behind the counter. Sam Drucker sells food and household goods, and at times sells such oddities as nail polish that's also a bathtub sealant and dehydrated chickens: [...] "Just add water and bones, and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> for a couple hours." [...] Customers are allowed to shop on credit, although Drucker frequently (and exasperatedly) reminds them of their outstanding bills. Drucker's Store {{is the closest thing}} Hooterville has to a social club. The locals often come in to chit-chat, or to play checkers, or to rant and rave about community issues. And, on election day, they cast their votes at Drucker's. Exterior shots of the store show a sign that says [...] "Sam Drucker's General Store", but everyone (including Sam Drucker) mostly calls the store either [...] "Drucker's Store" [...] or just [...] "Drucker's".|$|E
50|$|A new humidor {{requires}} seasoning {{and once}} seasoned {{needs to have}} its humidity maintained in some fashion. The inside of a humidor should be lined in dried Spanish cedar wood. The thicker the lining the better as it will provide the best environment for the cigars. The internal wood of a new humidor will not contain much moisture. The inside needs to be seasoned: allowing it to absorb moisture {{so that it can}} maintain the desired humidity level. There are many methods to season a humidor but the most common is to fill up a shot glass with distilled water, place it into the humidor, close it up, and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> for two weeks, checking on it every couple of days. Any method you use that consists of using water, you should use distilled water so that you are using something with the least amount of impurities. There are also seasoning packs that you can use from companies like Boveda if you choose to go that route instead of using water.|$|E
50|$|The Platte River in {{the future}} state of Nebraska and the North Platte River in Wyoming {{typically}} had many channels and islands. The waterways were often too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for a canoe to travel far. The Platte River valley provided an easily passable wagon corridor; it sloped gradually up in height as it went almost due west from the Missouri. The Platte route had access to water, grass, buffalo and buffalo 'chips,' which the Indians and emigrants used as fuel for fires. Long Native American use had created trails {{on both sides of}} the muddy, about 1 mi wide and shallow Platte River. The Platte's water was silty and bad tasting, but it was usable if no other water was available. Emigrants learned to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> in a bucket for an hour or so to settle most of the silt. The trail(s) through the Platte River Valley extended about 450 mi in the present state of Nebraska. Nearly all the trails from the Missouri converged on the Platte River at or before Fort Kearny in mid-state Nebraska. Historians have estimated about 400,000 emigrants followed the trails along the Platte.|$|E
50|$|Nick Kovalchick, {{president}} of Kovalchick Salvage, elected not to scrap the railroad right away, instead <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> in place. In 1960, the twin boroughs of Orbisonia and Rockhill Furnace—the latter being the operating hub for the railroad—celebrated their Bicentennial and asked Kovalchick {{to put a}} train out for display. Doing them one better, he rehabilitated four miles of track and two locomotives and operated tourist train rides for several months that summer. The new attraction was so successful that the ride, extended to five miles (8 km), opened as a regular tourist operation in 1961. The railroad operated tourist trains every summer through 2011, after which operations were suspended.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{research}} {{was to find a}} less expensive method for sampling isotopes from plants. By collecting plant xylem in a plastic, sealable bag, filling the bag with dry air, <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> for 24 hours and then running it through the laser spectrometer, the isotopes of the plants will be traced; specifically, deuterium and oxygen- 18. The bag method of this experiment comes from that of Hendry (2015) when he used it on soils. Once the raw data was collected it was transposed from vapor to liquid data. The values found match with previous isotopic collections that were done using IR mass spectrometry. This shows that this inexpensive method was comparable to previous methods and can allow for the study of isotopes to be more accessible to the scientific community...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the above standard recipe, {{it is common for}} individuals to add other ingredients such as cinnamon, raisins, strawberry, molasses, and lemon or lime juice. Some recipes are said to include grated tortoiseshell, or sea turtle penis shaft for aphrodisiac effect. The concoction is usually kept at room temperature and served in a shot glass. As with many other alcoholic drinks the longer the maker <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> the better <b>it</b> tastes. It is also recommended that when making your own at home from a pre-packaged bark/root mix, you first cure the dry ingredients with white rum. Discard the liquid after a few days and then follow your rum, wine, and honey recipe. By doing this, the initial bitterness is released from the bark/roots, making for a more drinkable first batch.|$|R
50|$|In Q&A for Ain't It Cool News in December 2006, Sylvester Stallone {{was asked}} why the film didn't get a wide release and then answered:It’s very simple why D-TOX landed in limbo. A film is a very {{delicate}} creature. Any adverse publicity or internal shake-up can upset the perception of - and studio confidence in - a feature. For some unknown reason the original producer pulled out and right away the film was considered damaged goods; {{by the time we}} ended filming there was trouble brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the director and the studio. The studio <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> on the shelf for many months and after over a year it was decided to do a re-shoot. We screened it, it tested okay, Ron Howard was involved with overseeing some of the post-production… but the movie had the smell of death about it. Actually, if you looked up, you could see celluloid buzzards circling as we lay there dying on the distributor’s floor. One amusing note: It was funny, when we were met at the airport by the teamsters they’d have a sign in front of them saying DETOX, and all these actors like Kris Kristofferson, Tom Berenger and myself looked like we were going into rehab rather than a film shoot.|$|E
5000|$|Dead Rising 2 {{has been}} met with mainly {{positive}} reviews upon release. IGN, Eurogamer, and GamesRadar {{have given the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the story, combat, and huge numbers of enemies on screen, while complaining about long loading times. GameZone gave the Xbox 360 version of the game a 6 out of 10, stating, [...] "the lackluster presentation, uninspired story, outright broken multiplayer, and atrocious amount of glitches makes Dead Rising 2 less of a flawed gem {{and more of a}} somewhat polished pile that incrementally smells worse the longer you <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> in your disc drive." [...] Game Informer gave the game a 9.5 out of 10, stating, [...] "Even after playing for dozens of hours, you'll still find new things in Dead Rising 2. I won't spoil anything, but there's a lot of variety {{to be found in the}} game beyond obvious things like the number of objects that can be used as bludgeons. This game is designed for multiple playthroughs, and I'm looking forward to each and every one of them." [...] Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw listed Dead Rising 2 in second place in his Top 5 games of 2010, praising it for its correcting all of Dead Risings issues such as high difficulty and poor AI and for the Combo Weapons mechanic. In February 2011, Capcom announced that the title had sold more than 2.2 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|In January 16, 1919, the American Government {{passed the}} Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It had three sections: Section 1. After one {{year from the}} {{ratification}} of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as {{an amendment to the}} Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress. Congressman Andrew John Volstead {{was one of the main}} promoters of the Eighteenth Amendment. The Volstead Act of 1920 defined intoxicating liquor as any liquor containing more than 0.5% alcohol. It permitted the manufacture of non-intoxicating cider and fruit juices for home use, as well as permitting households to ferment wine for private consumption; and it allowed the sale of alcoholic beverages for medicinal, sacramental, and industrial purposes. The Volstead Act allowed breweries to produce [...] "near beer" [...] with an alcohol content of up to 0.5%. To make the near beer, distilleries produced beer and then <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> to allow most of its alcoholic content to evaporate. This allowed breweries to produce virtually unlimited amounts of beer. Even though Ontario had their own prohibition, called the Temperance Act which lasted from 1919 through 1923, it was still legal to distill alcohol. This loophole led to a great deal of alcohol smuggling via the Detroit River between Windsor and Detroit, the largest U.S. city on the Canada-US border.|$|E
5000|$|Ricotta ( [...] in Italian) is an Italian {{whey cheese}} made from sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk whey {{left over from}} the {{production}} of cheese. Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin. [...] Ricotta (literally meaning [...] "recooked") protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation (by <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> for 12-24 hours at room temperature). Then the acidified whey is heated to near boiling. The combination of low pH and high temperature denatures the protein and causes it to precipitate, forming a fine curd. Once cooled, it is separated by passing the liquid through a fine cloth, leaving the curd behind.|$|R

Over twenty years ago, Calvin Mooers commented: "An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it. " Mooers was involved with information storage and retrieval systems in science, but his words are just as appropriate for management information systems (MIS). The problem with having information in Mooer's view is that you can't just <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>sit</b> there if it indicates that something must be done. If that something is hard to do or involves difficult social consequences (such as disrupting the faculty's habits of library use, or the student's timing of meeting his date), it will only cause ulcers, sleepless nights or unemployment if you don't make the adjustment. Of course there is one way to avoid all of the trouble, and that is not to have the information in the first place. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
