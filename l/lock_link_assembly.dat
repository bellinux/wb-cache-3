40|$|AbstractThe virtual {{hair cell}} we have {{proposed}} utilizes {{a set of}} parameters related to its mechanoelectric transduction. In this work, we observed the effect of such channel gating parameters as the gating threshold, critical tension, resting tension, and Ca 2 + concentration. The gating threshold {{is the difference between}} the resting and channel opening tension exerted by the tip <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> on the channel. The critical tension is the tension in the tip <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> over which the channel cannot close despite Ca 2 + binding. Our results show that 1), the gating threshold dominated the initial sensitivity of the hair cell; 2), the critical tension minimally affects the peak response, (I), but considerably affects the time course of response, I(t), and the force-displacement, F-X, relationship; and 3), higher intracellular [Ca 2 +] resulted in a smaller fast adaptation time constant. Based on the simulation results we suggest a role of the resting tension: to help overcome the viscous drag of the hair bundle during the oscillatory movement of the bundle. Also we observed the three-dimensional bundle effect on the hair cell response by varying the number of cilia forced. These varying forcing conditions affected the hair cell response...|$|R
40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by split pins. This means that split pins were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with split pins prior to the accident. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes two {{new methods}} for the {{identification}} of static stiffnesses of multi degrees of freedom heavy industrial robots. They {{are based on a}} <b>locked</b> <b>link</b> joint procedure obtained with an end-effector fixed to the environment. The first method requires only measurements of motor positions and motor torques data computed from motor current measurements and manufacturer's drive gains. The second one needs a torque sensor to measure the interaction wrench between the clamped end-effector and the environment. These methods are being experimentally validated and compared on the 2 first joints of a 6 degrees of freedom heavy 500 Kg payload industrial Kuka KR 500 robot. AN...|$|R

The <b>locks</b> <b>link</b> {{the tidal}} Bow Creek to the River Lee Navigation, which is a canalised river. These locks were first built in 1850 and then rebuilt in 1930, {{at the same time as}} the Prescott Channel was cut nearby. At high tide, the tide from Bow Creek formerly flowed through Bow Locks, to raise the level of the canals, such as the Limehouse Cut. In 2000, these locks were modified to keep the tide out, to reduce silting in the canal system.|$|R

The lock was refurbished in 1992 and was managed by Waveney District Council, but there were discussions taking place in 2009 to transfer it to the Broads Authority, who manage the rest of the Broads. Since 2011, day-to-day management has been handled on behalf of the council by Sentinel Enterprises, which is part of Sentinel Leisure Trust. They also operate Oulton Broad Yacht Station.|$|R

50|$|However, the investigation, {{released}} in August 2012, {{found that the}} probable cause of the crash were reused single-use locknuts in the left elevator trim tab system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an attachment screw and allowed the trim tab to flutter. This flutter caused the trim tab <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> to fail which led to loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right trim tab had been fixed in place. Had both trim tabs been operational, {{the loss of the}} left trim tab alone may not have caused loss of control. When the trim tab failed, Leeward was exposed to 17Gs which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.|$|R
