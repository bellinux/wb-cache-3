By the 1970s, and {{under pressure from the}} Bell operating companies wanting to modernize their cable plant and lower the adjacent circuit noise that these telex circuits sometimes caused, Western Union migrated customers to a third option called F1F2.

The simulations for the residual carrier case were run for <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratios of 13 dB, 15 dB and 17 dB with a loop bandwidth of 10 Hz.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Survivin, a bifunctional protein, acts as {{suppressor}} of apoptosis and has {{an essential}} role in mitosis. Survivin is physically phosphorylated on Thr 34, and other important sites such as Thr 117, Ser 20, Thr 48 and Ser 81. Our previous report has shown that Ser 81 of survivin plays role in cytoprotection. In order to investigate the underlying mechanism, all motifs with medium stringency were scanned. We found that site of survivin at Ser 81 was correlated to PKA, which is well reported to many cell signal machineries, including cell survival. Therefore, we focused our current investigation in finding possible correlation and interaction between survivin’s Ser 81 site and PKA. METHODS: Wild-type survivin (Survivin), antisense survivin (Survivin-AS), mutated-survivin and mutated-survivin Ser 81 Ala (Survivin-S 81 A) were constructed. Each retroviral product was produced. Some cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated. For analysis, we performed immunoblotting and PKA’s activity assays. RESULTS: In our current results, phosphorylated-PKA was correlated with survivin. Infection of survivin could lead to acceleration of PKA’s activity in a viral particle dependent manner. This positive back loop induction by survivin was shown to be correlated to Ser 81 site, since survivin-mediated PKA activity was not resulted by mutated form of survivin at Ser 81 to nonphosphorylatable Ala (S 81 A). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested a possible back loop of survivin to activate PKA, and Ser 81 could be an important site to mediate the survivin-PKA back <b>loop</b> <b>signaling.</b> Survivin-induced activation of PKA might be related to cytoprotection.

Evidence points to interleukin 6 (IL- 6) differing in its effects by tumor type, in some cancers {{acting as a}} positive growth factor, increasing anti-apoptotic signaling, and increasing migration and invasion properties. We are investigating the combinatorial effects of IL- 1 β and Ah receptor ligands in tumor cell lines and their synergistic induction of IL- 6 production. Co-treatment of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells and ECC- 1 endocervical cancer cells with IL- 1 β and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for 2 hours was shown via quantitative RT-PCR {{to result in a}} synergistic induction of IL- 6 mRNA transcription and a decrease in CYP 1 A 1 mRNA levels. Quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA assay revealed continuous increases in both mRNA and serum protein levels throughout a 72 hour time course of treatment, with no signs of abating. Additional AhR ligands, including benzo[a]pyrene, similarly show synergistic activity in conjunction with IL- 1 β, with regard to IL- 6 induction. Although the promoters for IL- 6 and IL- 8 have marked similarities in containing NFκB, C/EBPβ and c-Jun regulatory binding sites, IL- 8 transcription does not follow the pattern of synergistic increase seen with IL- 6. Therefore, the combination of pro-inflammatory IL- 1 β and AhR ligands shows a context-specific ability to up-regulate cellular IL- 6 output for a sustained period of time. This event could lead to instigation of both autocrine and paracrine <b>loop</b> <b>signaling</b> within the tumor microenvironment. These results would suggest a mechanism that could in part explain the tumor promoting properties of certain AhR ligands (e. g benzo[a]pyrene) ...|$|E

40|$|A phase {{relationship}} is identified between sequential edge localized modes (ELMs) occurrence {{times in a}} set of H-mode tokamak plasmas to the voltage measured in full flux azimuthal loops in the divertor region. We focus on plasmas in the Joint European Torus where a steady H-mode is sustained over several seconds, during which ELMs are observed in the Be II emission at the divertor. The ELMs analysed arise from intrinsic ELMing, in that there is no deliberate intent to control the ELMing process by external means. We use ELM timings derived from the Be II signal to perform direct time domain analysis of the full flux loop VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals, which provide a high cadence global measurement proportional to the voltage induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux. Specifically, we examine how the time interval between pairs of successive ELMs is linked to the time-evolving phase of the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals.</b> Each ELM produces a clear early pulse in the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals,</b> whose peak time is used to condition our analysis. The arrival time of the following ELM, relative to this pulse, is found to fall into one of two categories: (i) prompt ELMs, which are directly paced by the initial response seen in the flux loop signals; and (ii) all other ELMs, which occur after the initial response of the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> has decayed in amplitude.

Toroidally integrating, full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> provide a global measurement proportional to the voltage induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux; they are electromagnetically induced by the dynamics of spatially integrated current density. We perform direct time-domain analysis of the high time-resolution full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> VLD 2 and VLD 3. We analyze plasmas where a steady H-mode is sustained over several seconds during which all the observed ELMs are intrinsic; there is no deliberate intent to pace the ELMing process by external means. ELM occurrence times are determined from the Be II emission at the divertor. We previously [Chapman et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 062302 (2014); Chapman et al., in 41 st EPS Conference on Plasma Physics, Europhysics Conference Abstracts (European Physical Society, 2014), Vol. 38 F, ISBN 2 - 914771 - 90 - 8] found that the occurrence times of intrinsic ELMs correlate with specific temporal analytic phases of the VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals. Here, we investigate how the VLD 2 and VLD 3 temporal analytic phases vary with time in advance of the ELM occurrence time. We identify a build-up to the ELM in which the VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals progressively align to the temporal analytic phase at which ELMs preferentially occur, on a ∼ 2 − 5 ms timescale. At the same time, the VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals become temporally phase synchronized with each other, consistent with the emergence of coherent global dynamics in the integrated current density. In a plasma that remains close to a global magnetic equilibrium, this can reflect bulk displacement or motion of the plasma. This build-up signature to an intrinsic ELM can be extracted from a time interval of data that does not extend beyond the ELM occurrence time, so that these full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> could assist in ELM prediction or mitigation...|$|R
