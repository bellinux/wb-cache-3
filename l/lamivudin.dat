Ev-ery year, there is a significant increasing number of HIV/AIDS patients in DharmaisCancer Hospital, therefore successfully of therapy is needed to be carried out regularly for the optimum result to the patients. One of methods to evaluating therapy is by reviewing efficacy of ARV combinations toward escalation of immunity respond (es-calation of CD 4). The ARV combinations give a good efficacy if increasing CD 4 > 50 cell/mm 3. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the efficacy of four ARV combina-tion (each type consists of two Nucleosides Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor and one Non-Nucleosides Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor) base on increasing CD 4 mean HIV/AIDS patients after 6 – 12 months treatment in Dharmais Cancer Hospital from 2005 – 2006, and to compare the efficacy of four ARV combinations. The four ARVcombinations are combination I (<b>Lamivudin</b> + Zidovudin + Efavirenz), combina-tions II (<b>Lamivudin</b> + Zidovudin + Nevirapin), combination III (<b>Lamivudin</b> + Stavudin + Efavirenz), and combination IV (<b>Lamivudin</b> + Stavudin + Nevirapin). This study was analytical, cross-sectional design. Samples for this study were taken by total sampling using all data of HIV/AIDS patients in Dharmais Cancer Hospital from the year 2005 – 2006. The inclusion criteria were patients of fifteen years of age or more, baseline count CD 4   < 200 cell/mm 3, received ARV treatment for 6 – 12 months, received treatment of either one of the four ARV combination, and had dataof CD 4 from laboratory result before and after the treatment.

40|$|Introduction. Reactivation {{of chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection often occurs in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients undergoing immunosuppressive or chemotherapy, {{but can also}} occur in HBsAg negative, anti-HB core positive patients. Treatment of HBV reactivation with <b>lamivudin</b> results in favourable outcome {{in the majority of}} patients. The aim of the authors was to show the effect of <b>lamivudin</b> therapy to HBV reactivation caused by immunosuppressive therapy. Outline of Cases. The first patient was a 35 -year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B virus infection who underwent prednisolone therapy for pulmonal sarcoidosis. Four months after the beginning of the therapy she presented with jaundice and a significant increase in serum aminotransferase level. Liver biopsy showed chronic viral B hepatitis of strong activity in the stage of rapidly developed cirrhosis. The patient was treated with lamivudine with slow reduction of prednisolone doses, which resulted in full clinical and biochemical recovery. The second patient was a 40 -year-old HBsAg negative female with a previous history of resolved acute B hepatitis who received chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After the third cycle of chemotherapy a significant increase in aminotransferase level occurred, chemotherapy was discontinued, but aminotransferase level still increased. At that moment she was found to be HBsAg positive, and PCR analysis detected a high viral load. Lamivudine treatment resulted in the patient’s recovery and allowed further chemotherapy. Conclusion. In case of the reactivation of chronic HBV infection during immunosuppressive therapy, it should be stopped and antiviral therapy should be immediately initiated. The use of lamivudine results in rapid suppression of serum HBV DNA, improves the outcome and enables the continuation of immunosuppressive and chemotherapy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Strategies for {{prevention}} of liver graft reinfection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{have been developed}} during recent years. Initially, passive immunoprophylaxis with high titre HBV immunoglobulin (HBIg), followed by lamivudine prophylaxis, and then the combination of lamivudine and HBIg have been employed. However, suboptimal use of the combination {{may be associated with}} failure of prophylaxis reflected by the emergence of HBV species with genetic changes that confer resistance to lamivudine and HBIg. Reinfection of the graft by HBV can be associated with rapid development of liver failure.  CASE REPORT—A 43  year old HBV infected man received lamivudine before transplantation, and lamivudine and HBIg after transplantation. Despite prophylaxis, graft reinfection and severe hepatitis were observed. The observed serological evolution and genetic sequencing of the emergent HBV species suggested selection of lamivudine resistant and surface antigen escape mutants consecutively. Adefovir treatment began after the devlopment of graft failure.  OUTCOME—A rapid exponential decline in serum HBV titre was observed. Liver function tests normalised and signs of liver failure resolved.  CONCLUSION—The use of HBIg and lamivudine permits prevention of graft reinfection by HBV for the majority of patients. Adefovir, a potent inhibitor of lamivudine resistant HBV, should be used when failure of prophylaxis is associated with graft hepatitis.    Keywords: hepatitis B virus; adefovir; liver graft; <b>lamivudin...</b>|$|E

The decline in HBV DNA levels from baseline to month 3 was higher in 22 responders than in 13 nonresponders (, vs. log 10 copies;), whereas no differences weremean SD 4. 16 1. 06 2. 88 1. 77 Pp. 002 observed in patients with and without YMDD variants at 1 year of therapy.

40|$|CASE REPORT—A {{patient is}} {{described}} who developed hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection five months following liver transplantation. Failure of hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis {{was associated with}} the emergence of mutations. HBV gene sequencing identified nucleotide substitutions associated with amino acid changes, one within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the HBV surface antigen at amino acid position 144  and one outside the MHR. Because of the overlapping reading frames of surface and polymerase genes, the latter surface antigen change was associated with an amino acid change in the polymerase protein. The patient developed significant allograft hepatitis and was treated with lamivudine (3 TC) 100  mg daily. Rapid decline of serum HBV DNA was observed with loss of HBV e antigen and HBV surface antigen from serum. There was normalisation of liver biochemistry, and liver immunohistochemistry showed a reduction in HBV core and disappearance of HBs antigen staining.  CONCLUSION—Surface antigen encoding gene mutations associated with HBIg escape may be associated with alteration of the polymerase protein. The polymerase changes may affect sensitivity to antiviral treatment. Selection pressure on one HBV reading frame (for example, HBIg pressure on HBsAg, or nucleoside analogue pressure on polymerase protein) may alter the gene product of the overlapping frame. Such interactions are relevant to strategies employing passive immune prophylaxis and antiviral treatment.    Keywords: liver transplantation; prophylaxis; escape mutants; <b>lamivudin...</b>|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, patients were selected, the required information about them was recorded, and adherence to anti-retroviral drugs (including Ziduvudin, <b>Lamivudin</b> and Efavirens) was determined based on self-report by the patients. Eighty-nine exposed patients were followed monthly for 4 months, and in the case of low-adherence (less than 95 %) they were asked for the reason(s) for noncompliance. Results: Of the 89 patients, 55 were men (61. 8 %) and 34 (38 / 2 %) were women with a mean age of 30. 16 ± 8. 39 years; 47 participants (52. 8 %) were single and 42 (47. 1 %) married; 27 subjects (30. 3 %) were physicians, 35 (39. 3 %) nurses and 27 (30. 3 %) had occupations outside the healthcare system.

40|$|SUMMARY Background: Administration of {{immunosuppressive}} {{treatment in}} hepatitis B virus carriers with malignancies {{is associated with}} the risk of hepatitis B reactivation. This complication is more frequent in patients with hematologic malignancies because administration of corticosteroids, the mainstay of treatment of these patients, is an independent risk factor for hepatitis B reactivation. When lamivudine is given prior to chemotherapy, it prevents the viral replication during the immunosuppression period; therefore, it might reduce the risk of hepatitis B exacerbation. Aim: To assess the efficacy of prophylactic administration of lamivudine in this setting. Methodology: Ten hepatitis B virus carriers with hematologic malignancies were included in the study; seven were HBsAg positive and three had isolated antiHBc and detectable HBV-DNA levels. Nine patients were given corticosteroids after the administration of lamivudine. Lamivudine was given per os at a dose of 100 mg once daily. In four patients who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy, lamivudine was started 19 days (median) (range, 0 - 35 days) prior to the onset of chemotherapy. The administration of lamivudine has not been stopped since in any of our patients. Results: After a median follow-up of 15 months (range 6 - 38 months) no hepatitis B reactivation was observed. HBV-DNA levels were decreased in all six patients who had detectable HBVDNA at baseline. Lamivudine was well tolerated. Chemotherapy regimens were administered as planned and their effectiveness was not compromised by lamivudine. Conclusion: Prophylactic administration of lamivudine is a safe and effective method to reduce the frequency of hepatitis B reactivation in hepatitis B virus carriers with hematologic malignancies, who are being treated with chemotherapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{natural history}} and {{treatment}} outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are influenced by genotypes and viral load. Information about factors determining HBV genotype distribution and viraemia in HIV/HBV-co-infected patients is scarce. METHODS: All HIV-positive patients living in Europe and Argentina recruited in EuroSIDA (1994 - 2006) were tested for serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Chronic carriers were further characterized virologically at one central laboratory. Variables influencing HBV genotype distribution and viraemia were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: From 16 505 HIV patients enrolled in EuroSIDA, 1179 (7. 1 %) were HBsAg positive, of whom 474 had specimens that allowed inclusion in the virological substudy. Overall 293 (62 %) were treated with anti-HBV active antiretroviral drugs {{at the time of}} testing. Hepatitis delta virus superinfection was recognized in 14 % and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies in 27 %. Serum HBV DNA was detectable in 315 (66. 5 %) and HBV genotyping gave results in 170 (35. 9 %) patients. HBV genotype distribution was as follows: A (72. 9 %), D (17. 1 %), G (1. 8 %), E (1. 2 %), F (1. 2 %) and C (0. 6 %); another 5. 9 % were co-infected with multiple HBV genotypes. In the multivariate analysis, the best predictor of HBV genotype A infection was risk exposure other than intravenous drug use, whereas predictors for detectable HBV viraemia were lower CD 4 counts and lack of HCV antibodies. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B show detectable HBV viraemia despite being treated with anti-HBV active antiretroviral drugs (mainly lamivudine). Low CD 4 counts were associated with an independent higher risk of detectable HBV viraemia, which supports an earlier introduction of antiretroviral therapy, including anti-HBV drug(s) more potent than <b>lamivudin...</b>|$|E

Diese retrospektive Kohortenstudie untersucht die Dynamik von Nukleos(t) id-Analoga (NA) -Resistenzvarianten im HBV-Polymerasegen mit Fokus auf ADV-Resistenzvarianten bei 18 chronisch HBV-infizierten Patienten mit Therapieversagen auf eine vorangegangene <b>Lamivudin</b> (LAM) - und ADV-Therapie, sowie nur partiellem Therapieansprechen auf eine TDF-Monotherapie. Zur Detektion von NA-Resistenzvarianten wird eine HBV-Genomsequenzierung mit Tiefenpyrosequenzierung (Genome Sequencer FLX, Roche Diagnostics, Germany) (UDPS), direkte Sequenzierung (TRUGENETM HBV Genotyping Kit, OpenGeneTM DNA Sequencing Sys-tem, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic, USA) (TG) und Line Probe Assay (INNO-LiPa DRv 2 und v 3, Innogenetics, Belgium) (INNO-LiPA) durchgeführt. Unter TDF kommt es zu einer quantitati-ven Shift zugunsten der ADV-Resistenzvarianten mit konstant bleibendem Anteil und deutlich höher persistierender Virämie zu Monat 12 im Vergleich zu Patienten ohne ADV-Resistenzvarianten. Vor allem werden die Varianten rtA 181 V und rtN 236 T selektiert, jedoch nicht die Variante rtA 181 T. Die {{absolute}} Anzahl der LAM-Resistenzvarianten hingegen halbiert sich. Varianten mit einem initial per UDPS detektierten Anteil von > 20 % der patientenspezifi-schen HBV-Population werden meist selektiert und nehmen im Verlauf den Hauptanteil der Quasispezies ein. UDPS stellte ein potentes Medium der Detektion, Identifikation und Quantifi-zierung von HBV-Varianten dar und ist INNO-LiPa und TG überlegen. Es ergibt sich kein Hin-weis auf TDF-Resistenzvarianten, jedoch zeigt das Vorliegen von ADV-Resistenzvarianten ei-nen tendentiell negativen Einfluss auf die virale Kinetik. Weitere größere Langzeitstudien sind zur Bestätigung dieser Beobachtung notwendig. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is {{a highly}} efficient treatment option for nucleos(t) ide analogue (NA) pre-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Little {{is known about the}} reasons for persistent virus replication in some rare cases. As of today, no TDF resistance variants have been identified, but a possible linkage to Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) resistance associated variants negatively influencing HBV-DNA suppression by TDF has been suspected, based on the similarity of the chemical structure. In this retrospective cohort study the dynamics of NA resistance variants in the HBV polymerase gene with focus on ADV resistance variants were assessed. For this, we have chosen a cohort including patients with multiple failures to treatment with different NAs. Thus, data of 18 patients with previous treatment failure to LAM and ADV was analysed, showing a persistent viremia (HBV-DNA > 35 copies/mL) despite switch to TDF monotherapy (median HBV-DNA at month 12 3, 5 ± 0, 8 (2, 1 - 4, 9) log 10 copies/mL). Sequencing analysis was performed with ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) (Genome Sequencer FLX, 454 Life Science, Roche Diagnostic, Branford, CT), direct sequencing (TG) (TRUGENETM HBV Genotyping Kit, OpenGeneTM DNA Sequencing System, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic, USA) and line probe assay (INNO-LiPA) (INNO-LiPa DRv 2 /v 3, Innogenetics, Belgium). Using TDF monotherapy, a quantitative shift in favour to ADV resistance variants was observed in this cohort. The percentage of substitutions conferring resistance to ADV at baseline (BL) and {{at the time of the}} last sequencing endpoint (EP) of the HBV genome remained constant (BL 35 %, 13 / 37, EP 36 %, 9 / 25). The variants rtA 181 V and rtN 236 T were mostly selected, whereas rtA 181 T was not selected. The total amount of substitutions conferring resistance to <b>Lamivudin</b> (LAM) showed a strong decline, however remained the majority part of all NA resistance variants (BL 51 % (19 / 37), EP 40 % (10 / 25)). The percentage of ETV resistance variants increased slightly (BL 14 % (5 / 37), EP 24 % (6 / 25)). Known ADV, Lam and ETV resistance variants emerged in variable abundance (1, 0 - 99, 6 %) of quasispecies during TDF therapy. A homogenization of HBV quasispecies took place. Especially mutations occurring in higher abundance (> 20 % of viral population) were mostly selected (BL 51 % (19 / 37), EP 80 % (20 / 25)). No new HBV variants with possible association to resistance against TDF were identified, but patients with ADV resistance variants showed the highest HBV-DNA level at month 12 of TDF therapy (median HBV-DNA 3, 57 ± 0, 72 (2, 14 - 3, 96) log 10 copies/mL, not significant). A negative influence of ADV resistance variants on viral suppression with TDF monotherapy may be assumed, however more long-term studies are needed to confirm the role of ADV resistance variants in TDF therapy. UDPS is a potent medium for detection, identification and quantification of dominant to low level variants in HBV-DNA. It is superior to direct sequencing and line probe assay in the detection of variants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Development of {{resistance}} to antiretroviral drugs remains an important cause of treatment failure in HIV-infected patients, and {{has been associated with}} increased mortality. Drug resistance can also be transmitted upon infection and causes subsequent inferior response to treatment.

We also investigated for potential differences in resistance within the subgroups gender and socio-cultural background. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study on data from the HIV-cohort database at Ullevål University Hospital. Patients having at least one genotypic resistance test in the time period between 2003 and 2008 were included. Patients were stratified into two groups, ART-naïve and ART-experienced. Resistance mutations were identified, and clinical resistance to NRTIs (divided into lamivudine and other), NNRTIs and PIs respectively was predicted by the means of an algorithm developed from the IAS-USA list of mutations. The prevalence {{of resistance to}} at least one drug class was calculated for each of the two main groups, {{as well as for the}} subgroups gender and socio-cultural background (labeled western/non-western). Results: The study included 665 resistance tests from 547 patients, of which 399 tests were from ART-naïve and 266 from ART-experienced. We found a low overall prevalence of resistance among the ART-naïve, and a decreasing prevalence among the ART-experienced. In the latter group resistance to NRTIs was most common. In the ART-naïve resistance was detected more often in non-western females than in western males, and this was most apparent for NNRTI-resistance. In the ART-experienced there were no differences in overall prevalence between gender and sociocultural background, but some differences were observed within the individual drug classes, with proportionately more western males harboring resistance to PI and NRTIs (other than <b>lamivudin)</b> than non-western females. Conclusion: Our findings regarding the overall prevalence in both ART-naïve and ART-experienced are in agreement with other studies from Europe and North America. The decreasing prevalence is most likely due to more efficient treatment in the recent years and shows that resistance can be kept at a low level in spite of increased availability of antiretroviral treatment. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the observed differences in prevalence of resistance at the subgroup level are due to local variations in access, prescription and utilization of drugs, genetic factors or other reasons...|$|E
40|$|Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor (NNRTI) that was first {{reported in the}} scientific literature in 1990. Varying doses of nevirapine (NVP) {{and a number of}} regimens containing this NNRTI have been studied in antiretroviral (ARV) naive patients. Four key studies have compared the efficacy and safety of triple drug regimens containing NVP in ARV naive, HIV- 1 infected patients. The INCAS study was the first demonstration of how to use NVP in an effective and durable manner: as a component of a triple drug regimen. The COMBINE Study was a comparison of protease inhibitor (PI) -based and NVP-based triple regimens. The Atlantic Study is comparing the safety and efficacy of three triple drug regimens in ARV naive patients. In this study, treatment consists of a divergent drug regimen (PI and nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors, NRTIs) targeting both HIV- 1 protease and reverse transcriptase or a convergent regimen targeting reverse transcriptase alone (three NRTIs or two NRTIs plus a NNRTI). A clinical endpoint study (BI 1090) compared the efficacy and durability of multi-drug regimens in ARV naive patients with high baseline plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels (pVLs) and low peripheral blood CD 4 + lymphocyte counts. Data from these studies confirm that triple regimens containing NVP suppressed viral replication for up to one year, even when the ARV naive patients had low CD 4 + cell counts at baseline. Nevirapine-containing regimens suppressed pVLs to < 50 copies/mL in approximately 50 % of patients in the studies discussed (Intent to Treat analyses). Data from 96 weeks of follow up in the Atlantic Study demonstrates that the regimens containing didanosine and stavudine plus indinavir or NYP were significantly more successful in suppressing pVLs to < 50 copies/mL during this period than a regimen composed of these NRTIs and lamivudine (p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001). As with other ARV drugs, NVP should always be used as part of a fully suppressive ARV regimen. When used in this way, it is an effective ARV drug, which contributes to durable virological and immunological responses in approximately half of all treated patients. Nevirapine-containing regimens are effective in patients with advanced HIV- 1 infection, i. e., low CD 4 + cell counts. Data will soon be available from the 2 NN Study that compares the efficacy and safety of four different regimens using NVP once daily, NYP twice daily, efavirenz once daily or a combination of NVP and efavirenz. All four arms of the study include a backbone of stavudine and <b>lamivudin...</b>|$|E

Za uspjeh same transplantacije, kao i dugoročnog preživljenja bolesnika i njegovog transplantata, nužna je detaljna evaluacija primatelja i potencijalnog darivatelja organa, bilo da se radi o kadaveričnom ili živom darivatelju. Poseban problem u sklopu infektivnih bolesti su virusi hepatitisa, osobito virus hepatitisa B (HBV) i C (HCV), a u novije vrijeme sve se više spominje i virus hepatitisa E (HEV) kao značajan uzrok kroničnog hepatitisa u populaciji bolesnika s transplantatom. Unatoč poboljšanju preventivnih mjera posljednjeg desetljeća incidencija virusnih hepatitisa je u bolesnika koji se liječe postupcima hemodijalize značajno smanjena. Međutim, njihova incidencija i dalje je veća u toj skupini bolesnika kao i u bolesnika kojima je transplantiran bubreg u odnosu na opću populaciju. Virusni hepatitisi su značajan čimbenik povećanog morbiditeta i mortaliteta u tim populacijama bolesnika, ali i prema većini studija značajan čimbenik disfunkcije bubrežnog transplantata. Naime, u bolesnika koji su podvrgnuti transplantaciji bubrega primarni cilj je očuvanje dobre funkcije transplantata, uz primjenu učinkovite, a što manje toksične imunosupresivne terapije. Osim toga, nužno je praćenje i adekvatna terapija virusnih hepatitisa, s obzirom na dobro poznatu činjenicu da te infekcije vode prema kroničnom hepatitisu, cirozi jetre i hepatocelularnom karcinomu. Nadalje, HBV i HCV mogu inducirati nastanak de novo membranskog glomerulonefritisa u bubrežnom transplantatu. Renal {{transplantation}} {{has significantly}} improved survival {{of patients with}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Transplantation is the best treatment in this population of patients. Despite the introduction of various preventive measures, viral hepatitis, i. e. hepa¬titis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, are still a major problem because they are common in patients on re¬nal replacement therapy {{as well as in}} allograft recipients. They are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. In recent years, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been added as an emergent cause of chronic hepatitis in solid organ transplantation, mainly in renal and liver allograft recipients. Most studies show higher mortality in renal transplant recipi¬ents (RTRs) infected with HBV, compared with RTRs without HBV infection, although this topic is still under debate. Furthermore, HCV infection in RTRs is associated with a significant reduction in patient and graft survival due to liver disease and septic com¬plications related to cirrhosis and immunosuppressive therapy. The immunosuppressive therapy prescribed after transplantation modifies the natural history of chronic HCV infection. Given the high prevalence of HCV and HBV infections in RTRs, a growing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the possible contribution of immunosuppression might be expected in these patients. Therefore, after renal transplantation, early screening with abdominal ultrasound (every 3 months in cirrhotic patients and every 6 - 12 months in non-cirrhotic RTRs) is necessary when the risk factors such as HBV and HCV are present. The European Asso¬ciation for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends that all HbsAg-positive patients who are candidates for solid organ trans¬plantation should be treated with nucleoside analogs. The KDIGO guidelines recommend that all HbsAg-positive RTRs receive prophylaxis with tenofovir, entecavir or lamivudine; however, tenofovir and entecavir are preferable to <b>lamivudin.</b> Viral suppres¬sion by inhibiting necro-inflammation may result in reduced fibrosis, thereby improving transplant survival. Active HCV infection in a dialysis patient requires evaluation of liver fibrosis. Antiviral therapy should be given to all HCV-infected dialysis patients in order to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) not only to avoid subsequent hepatic deterioration but also to limit the risks of HCV-related posttransplant de novo glomerulonephritis. Systematic vaccination of all HbsAg-negative patients is the best preventive treatment of HBV infection. HbsAg positive donors are only used occasionally, whereas the use of hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) +, HbsAg negative donors is more common but remains somewhat controversial. The presence of antibody to HCV is indicative of HCV infection because antibody to HCV appears in peripheral blood within two months of HCV exposure. However, it is important to emphasize that detection of antibody to HCV by serologic screening of the donor is not predictive of HCV transmission. Approximately 50 % of patients positive for antibody to HCV have detectable hepatitis C viremia by PCR analysis of peripheral blood. Therefore, all organ donors with PCR analysis positive for HCV will transmit HCV to RTRs. On the other hand, the risk of transmission from an organ donor with negative PCR analysis is unclear. Another problem in the evalua¬tion of the potential donors of solid organs is the fact that antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) will not detect recent infections. The use of nucleid acid testing (NAT) could be useful because it involves amplification of viral gene products and thus is not dependent on antibody formation. Therefore, by using this method the period between the infection and detectability, which is known as the window period, could be reduced. However, this method is expensive and time consuming...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionHepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{is a global}} health problem. Current estimates are that 2 billion people have been infected worldwide, of these, 360 million suffer from chronic HBV infection resulting in over 520 000 deaths from acute hepatitis B and 470 000 from cirrhosis or liver cancer(1). The prevalence of hepatitis B carriers varies {{in different parts of}} the world, ranging from less than 1 % to 15 %. In the Middle East, the endemicity is intermittent, with a carrier rate of 2 % to 7 % (2). It is estimated that over 35 % of Iranians have been exposed to the HBV and about 3 % are chronic carriers, ranging from 1. 7 % in Fars Province to over 5 % in Sistan and Balouchestan(3). To date, eight different genotypes of the HBV have been identified (A-H). The clinical spectrum of HBV infection ranges from subclinical to acute symptomatic hepatitis or, rarely, fulminant hepatitis during the acute phase and from the inactive HBV infection and chronic hepatitis of various degrees of histologic severity to cirrhosis and its complications during the chronic phase(4, 5). Thirty years ago, the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was thought to require the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), as a reliable and sensitive marker of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Individuals positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative for HBeAg were considered to have non replicative HBV infection, and if their liver enzymes were normal or nearly normal they were referred to as asymptomatic or healthy HBsAg or HBV carriers. On the other hand, if they displayed elevated serum aminotransferases and liver histology indicative of chronic hepatitis, they were generally thought to be suffering from other superimposed or complicating conditions such as hepatitis D virus infection, alcohol-induced, metabolic, autoimmune, druginduced, or other forms of chronic liver disease(6). In the early 1980 s it became apparent that HBV could replicate in the absence of HBeAg. Patients from the Mediterranean area, although negative for HBeAg and positive for antibodies to HBeAg (anti- HBe), were reported to have CHB with replicating HBV. The term anti-HBe-positive or HBe Ag negative CHB was then proposed and subsequently became widely accepted. In 1989 the molecular basis of this form of CHB was discovered with the identification of HBV mutations preventing HBeAg formation from an otherwise normally replicating HBV(7). With time, it became apparent that HBeAg-negative CHB, initially viewed as an atypical and rare form of CHB mainly restricted in the Mediterranean area, had a much wider geographical distribution and that its frequency was increasing(6). Its molecular virology and immunology were found to be more complex than initially thought(8), whereas the selection of precore HBV mutants was shown to be largely determined by the HBV genotype(9). Mutations abolishing or diminishing HBeAg formation were identified along with changes in other parts of the HBV genome(9).

The 4 genes are core, surface, X, and polymerase. The core gene encodes the core nucleocapsid protein (important in viral packaging) and hepatitis B e antigen. The surface gene encodes pre-S 1, pre-S 2, and S protein (yielding large, middle, and small surface proteins, respectively). The X gene encodes the X protein, which has transactivating properties and may be important in hepatic carcinogenesis. Thepolymerase gene encodes a large protein with functions critical for packaging and DNA replication (including priming, RNA and DNA dependent DNA polymerase, and RnaseH activities) (10). Although HBV is a DNA virus, replication is through an RNA-replicative intermediate requiring an active viral reverse transcriptase/polymerase enzyme. The reverse transcriptase (for both HBV and human immunodeficiency virus) is believed to lack a proofreading function that is common to other polymerases. Therefore, HBV exhibits a mutation rate more than 10 -fold higher than other DNA viruses(11); the estimated mutation rate is approximately one nucleotide/ 10, 000 bases/ infection year. In addition, the accuracy of replication by the reverse transcriptase has been shown to vary with intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate concentrations(12). Figure 1.

PrevalenceAn estimated 350 million individuals in the world have chronic HBV infection(1; 14). Although positive for HBsAg, most of them are HBeAg negative. HBeAg positivity is highly prevalent only in younger age groups of HBsAg carriers(14). The median prevalence of e-CHB among HBsAgpositive/ HBeAg-negative patients was 32 %, with the highest median prevalence in Asia Pacific (36 %) and lower prevalences in the Mediterranean (24 %), the United States, and Northern Europe (22 %). Differences in prevalence of e-CHB in different regions of the world are in part related to the geographical variation in HBV genotypes(13). In HBV genotype A, cytosine is present at position 1858 (C- 1858) precluding the selection of the G 1896 A mutation (Figure 2) (15). This explains the low frequency of precore mutants in Northern Figure 2. Precore mutation and HBV genotypeEurope, North America, and parts of Africa where genotype A predominates (16). In contrast, the non- A HBV genotypes (B, C, D, and E) harbor thymidine at the same position (T- 1858), which pairs with A at 1896 (16). Thus, precore mutants prevail in the Mediterranean where non-A genotypes, particularly D, are predominant(17; 18). In Iran, there is a new report about HBV genotypes in 26 patients from a referral hospital. S and C regions sequencing showed that all these patients had HBV D genotype (19). It is estimated that almost 58 % of HBV infections in Iran are precore mutants (20). The great majority of HBsAg positive/HBeAg negative individuals have normal ALT values. However, a number suffer from CHB (15 %- 30 %) (6; 21). The prevalence of e-CHB seems to vary geographically. Possible contributing factors for its development include vertical transmission of HBV, long duration of infection and male sex (6; 14). In previous studies, only a few countries were found to have more HBeAg-negative than HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (22) but now it is apparent that there is a worldwide increase in the prevalence of e- CHB (14). In Italy, 41 % of patients with CHB during the period between 1975 and 1985 were HBeAg negative but in the last decade this has increased to 90 % (21). Emergence and selection of HBeAg-negativeHBV mutantsOnce immune pressure to the wild-type virus starts to mount, selection of HBeAg-negative mutants and their predominance over the wild-type HBV is hastened (14; 23). But it remains to be determined why HBV mutants that are not producing HBeAg would be privileged to become selected over the wild-type virus during or after HBeAg loss and seroconversion. It is becoming clear that in the absence of immune-mediated hepatocyte damage, HBeAg-negative mutants are not selected(14; 23; 24). This is best illustrated by HBV genome analyses in patients with persistently high viral replication and normal aminotransferases (indicating absence of liver injury) during the HBeAg positive phase, where only few, if any, mutations are detectable(25). Therefore, theirselection is not a primary event implicated in the loss of tolerance to HBV but most likely secondary to the already-mounted immune response against HBV. HBeAg-negative mutants most likely exhibit certain biological properties that render them less vulnerable to host immune reactions compared with wild-type HBV (6). Mutations in e-CHB (HBeAg-negative chronichepatitis B) The most commonly studied mutation associated with e-CHB is in the pre-core region at nucleotide (nt) 1896 where adenine (A) is substituted for guanine (G), producing a stop codon that prematurely terminates synthesis of the HBeAg (7). The core promoter region regulates transcription of the pre-core region. Therefore certain mutations in this region can affect HBeAg synthesis. Specifically, a double mutation involving substitution of T for A at nt 1762 and A for G at nt 1764 can reduce precore mRNA and HBeAg production (26 - 28). e-CHB and disease severityThe relationship between precore/core promoter variants, serum HBV DNA levels, and severity of liver disease is unclear. Some (26; 28; 29) but not all (30) in vitro studies suggest that core promoter mutations increase HBV replication. The significant nucleotide and amino acid divergence in the core promoter and precore region and its link to hepatitis B disease activity is well documented in some studies for example Bozdaie et al 31 suggested that an active immune response of the host to viral epitopes localized in core promoterregion may play an essential role and may thus have clinical significant(32 - 35). But some studies (36) found that no significant correlation exists between core promoter and precore mutations, viral replication and liver damage in chronic hepatitis B infection. Briefly different studies found different results. These findings suggest that geographical differences represented possibly by both viral (e. g. the predominant HBV genotype) and host factors (e. g. HLA type?) may influence the occurrence of these mutations (31). In 2002, Funk et al reviewed 50 of 281 research articles potentially related to e-CHB by a literature search; and suggested some major sources of variability in these articles. Apart from the geographical location and predominant HBV genotype, various factors may affect the prevalence of e-CHB including gender, age, treatment history, and duration of infection. Because all of these factors vary between studies, comparing the results of one study with another or combining the results of several studies from the same region may not be appropriate. In order to better understand the complex interplay between these factors and the development of e-CHB, sufficiently large studies using multivariate techniques to adjust for these potential confounders are needed (13). It is important to know whether determination of precore and core promoter mutations may help in predicting the different outcomes along the course of HBeAg to anti HBe seroconversion (37). But to date no clinical or virological factor has been identified which accurately predicts the risk of disease in patients with e-CHB. ManagementSome studies suggest that the HBeAg negative variants may be more resistant to the immune clearance actions of interferon and is consistent with the hypothesis that the HBeAg negative strains emerge because of immune selection (38). Basal core promoter and pre-core mutations in the HBV genome enhance replication efficacy of <b>lamivudin</b> resistant mutants (39; 40). Also one study showed that the precore stop codon mutation appears to compensate for the decreased replication phenotype of the <b>lamivudin</b> mutants In Vitro(41). The newly approved adefovir has been tested in e- CHB and it appears to have a similar efficacy as in HBeAg positive infection (42) ...|$|E
