30|$|The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> {{may be seen}} {{by some as a}} loss of the {{potential}} support necessary to work. For example, there may be some individuals working below SGA using their benefits for car payments and other expenses necessary for work. This could, in theory, lead to a narrower earnings gap (or even a negative gap) between the ceased and continued individuals. However, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in this case would result in less work. Thus, our estimate of the earnings and employment levels of ceased beneficiaries would still be an upper bound, but the difference between the ceased and continued individuals would be biased. Because work by non-ceased individuals in our target population is uncommon, we do not think this substantially alters our hypotheses.|$|E
