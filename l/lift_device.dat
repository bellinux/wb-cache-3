On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> selection deploys the droops (called droop noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their stowed position. Another function of the droops on the A380 is to change the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E

The <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> consisted of a large steel plate on a hinged sub-frame attached to the underside of the vehicle frame between {{the front and rear}} axles. The lift was lowered by a hydraulic ram that was controlled from inside the vehicle. The lift plate also served to protect the underside of vehicle when raised.|$|E

Nitrogen at 35 atmospheres (3.5 MPa) was supplied to the nozzles by flexible hoses. An engineer-operator on the ground regulated the supply of nitrogen through a valve. Additionally, the tester regulated the thrust using levers under his shoulders. The tester inclined the nozzles forward and backward, trying to reach stable hovering at a limited height. A safety tether was attached from below, so that the rig and tester could not fly too high.|$|E

This web-based boot includes boot body, <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> and support to support the feet and the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to fix on the boot body. The support uses the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to connect {{to the bottom of}} the boot body, and through the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> function, it can have lifting displacement to the boot bottom. The workers put foot fixed on the support, so as to make the inflating lifting boots walk along with the workers.

Thirty-eight HSWs and three seniors evaluated the BCIT lift, a commercially available lift (BHM Medical Inc.) and the manual method of transfer and lift. Results indicated that the BCIT lift was an improvement over the manual method of transferring, and approximated the more expensive, automatic lift in terms of perceived exertion, ease of use and safety.

40|$|A {{wingsail}} {{is a solid}} symmetrical aerofoil section {{which creates}} thrust {{in the same manner}} as a conventional sail. Wingsails may either be used as a sole power unit, e. g. for a yacht or catamaran, or as an auxiliary power unit on a larger craft, e. g. fishing vessels, cargo ships or passenger liners. To augment the thrust created by the wingsail, high lift devices are employed to increase both the maximum lift and the stall incidence of the aerofoil. A wingsail must be symmetrical and capable of creating an equal lift force with the flow approaching the leading edge from either side of the wing centreline, i. e. the wingsail surface must act as either the upper, or lower pressure surface. Initial experimental work proved that using a symmetrical slat as a leading edge high <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> both delayed the separation of flow over the wingsail upper surface and increased the effective camber of the aerofoil. To increase the thrust created still further, this leading edge high <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> was combined with a trailing edge high <b>lift</b> <b>device,</b> a symmetrical single slotted flap. Due to the large number of possible model configurations, a commercially available CFD package was introduced to assist with the design. A series of validation tests comparing the CFD with published and experimental results showed a qualitative agreement with these results. However, the CFD predictions were not sufficiently accurate to be used quantitatively. The computationally designed triple element model was tested experimentally. Lift, drag, pitching moment and pressure distribution measurements were taken from the model. The results of this testing showed that the triple element wingsail increased the plain wing Coax by 68...|$|E

40|$|Among nurses, {{low back}} pain is a common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder. A significant proportion of back pain episodes {{can be attributed to}} events that occur during patient handling activities when nurses are exposed to heavy lifting, awkward back postures, and pushing and/or pulling. In the past years, many ergonomic interventions have been developed, like <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> to reduce mechanical load related to patient handling activities in order to (partly) decrease the occurrence of {{low back pain}}. The efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> designed to reduce mechanical load has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies. However, the timely and integrated implementation at the workplace remains difficult. Various intervention studies have indicated that individual behaviour of nurses is a key factor in successful implementation of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> in healthcare. As examples, Evanoff et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2004) identified the lack of perceived need to use lifts as an important barrier in the effectiveness of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> at the workplace. Nelson et al. (2006) showed that acceptance of patient handling equipment by the staff was a crucial facilitator in the implementation process of a multiple intervention aimed at patient handling in healthcare. A previous study in hospitals and nursing homes showed that individual behaviour of nurses, i. e. nurses’ motivation to use <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> was strongly associated with <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> use. This study also pointed at the influence of organisationallevel measures on nurses’ behaviour, comprising both factors in each ward {{as well as at the}} managerial level of the healthcare institute. Thus, the appropriate implementation of ergonomic devices requires a careful process whereby individual behaviour is supported by organisational measures in order to enable and support the individual to adopt the required behaviour to prevent musculoskeletal complaints. A recent systematic review corroborated that upstream organisational strategies had a profound impact on musculoskeletal health...|$|R
