40|$|I {{discuss a}} model for free-for-all {{passenger}} boarding which is employed by some discount air carriers. The model {{is based on the}} principles of statistical mechanics where each seat in the aircraft has an associated energy which reflects the preferences of travelers. As each passenger enters the airplane they select their seats using Boltzmann statistics, proceed to that location, <b>load</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage,</b> sit down, and the partition function seen by remaining passengers is modified to reflect this fact. I discuss the various model parameters and make qualitative comparisons of this passenger boarding model with those that involve assigned seats. The model can be used to predict the probability that certain seats will be occupied at different times during the boarding process. These results might provide a useful description of this boarding method. The model is a relatively unusual application of undergraduate level physics and describes a situation familiar to many students and faculty...|$|E
40|$|I {{present and}} discuss {{a model for}} the free-for-all {{passenger}} boarding which is employed by some discount air carriers. The model is based on the principles of statistical mechanics where each seat in the aircraft has an associated energy which reflects the preferences of the population of air travelers. As each passenger enters the airplane they select their seats using Boltzmann statistics, proceed to that location, <b>load</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage,</b> sit down, and the partition function seen by remaining passengers is modified to reflect this fact. I discuss the various model parameters and make qualitative comparisons of this passenger boarding model with models which involve assigned seats. This model {{can also be used to}} predict the probability that certain seats will be occupied at different times during the boarding process. These results may be of value to industry professionals as a useful description of this boarding method. However, it also has significant value as a pedagogical tool since it is a relatively unusual application of undergraduate level physics and it describes a situation with which many students and faculty may be familiar.

5000|$|Planning {{a trip to}} Vermont for the weekend, Jack is {{contacted}} by Laura. She has just broken up with her boyfriend Dennis, the actor who plays Dr. Paul Kirkwood on the show, and wishes to accompany Jack. As Jack <b>loads</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> into the trunk, Dennis suddenly calls out to Rachel. Jack {{looks up to see}} them kissing just as the trunk lid hits him in the head. Upon awakening, he leaves for Vermont alone. Not far out of New York, he crashes his car.|$|R

25|$|After the Clear Lake show ended (at around midnight), Holly, Valens and Richardson {{drove to}} the Mason City Airport, <b>loaded</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> and boarded the red and white {{single-engine}} Beechcraft Bonanza. At around 1:00am on February 3, 1959, pilot Roger Peterson received clearance from the control tower, taxied down the runway and took off. But the plane remained airborne {{for only a few}} minutes. For an unknown reason, shortly after takeoff, the plane slammed into the ground at full throttle about 5 miles outside Mason City, in the middle of farm country. Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought he was ascending while he was actually descending. It is also possible that he had mechanical problems and was attempting to turn back toward Mason City. The right wingtip of the Beechcraft Bonanza sliced into the frozen ground and sent the aircraft cartwheeling across a cleared cornfield at approximately 170mph.|$|R
50|$|The use of tenders for <b>loading</b> {{passengers}} and <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> was well established {{even before the}} Edwardian heyday of ocean liners as the major means of intercontinental transport. They avoided the need to wait for these large ships to enter harbour and be docked, sometimes involving the wait for suitable tides. Tenders were also used by intermediate ports, where they could stand out to sea beyond a harbour bar and exchange passengers, without the large ship needing to enter port. In the Victorian times of several postal deliveries a day, speed was of the essence in transporting mails and the slightest time advantage would be seized upon.|$|R
50|$|When their {{vacation}} is over, guests can check-in and check bags at their resorts, provided {{they are on}} partner airlines. They then board buses back to the airport for departure.

50|$|In {{some cities}} (including Bangkok, Dubai, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, New Delhi, Chennai, Seoul, and Taipei), certain {{airlines}} provide in-town check-in services, allowing passengers to check <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> at check-in counters located in railway or subway terminals {{as much as}} a day ahead of time. This service allows passengers to take a train to the airport without the burden of carrying <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> to the airport terminal. In Seoul, for example, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and Jeju Air offer check-in services at Seoul Station. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific offer in-town check-in at KL Sentral.|$|R
