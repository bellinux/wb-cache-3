5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
500|$|Before {{talking with}} his brother, Max wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Inflikted," [...] inspired by Sepultura's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where {{they saw a}} [...] "crazy ritual". Describing what he saw, Max said, [...] "There was self-inflicted pain, knives, blood, fire. It was insane. It stuck in my head." [...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> used it before, so he {{had to come up with}} something else." [...] When trying to find a name, he [...] "blurted out" [...] Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, [...] "I think I like it better than Inflikted. It has a ring to it that connects me and Igor as two brothers back together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's lyrical {{content is}} divided between themes {{of love and}} romance; also {{discussing}} lust and monogamous intimacy. An underlying theme of alternate personalities is explored, with Jackson's substitute personae [...] "Damita Jo" [...] and [...] "Strawberry" [...] appearing on several songs. Jackson explained the album shows several sides of her personality, {{as well as a}} [...] "more private side"; saying [...] "The album is about love," [...] "Damita Jo is one of the characters that lives inside of me." [...] A producer stated Jackson had done [...] "a lot of the writing and co-production," [...] conceptualizing [...] "a balance of a lot of different sides of Janet's personality." [...] After Jackson's controversial Super Bowl performance incident, Jackson was urged to remove or tone down the suggestive lyrics of several songs, but resisted pressure to do so. [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> concerns and wanted me to take certain songs off the album, but I refused, because in doing so I wouldn't be who I am," [...] said Jackson. [...] "I'm not going to change, and that's fine. Either they like it, or they don't." [...] Spliced between several songs are [...] "mystifying" [...] interludes consisting of brief autobiographical soliloquies regarding relaxation, astrology, and Karma; in which Jackson attempts to intimately communicate her inner thoughts with the listener.|$|E

6000|$|Three days later, in that fast-yellowing October, Soames took a taxi-cab to Highgate Cemetery {{and mounted}} through its white forest to the Forsyte vault. Close to the cedar, above catacombs and columbaria, tall, ugly, and individual, {{it looked like}} an apex of the {{competitive}} system. He could remember a discussion wherein Swithin had advocated the addition to its face of the pheasant proper. The proposal had been rejected in favour of a wreath in stone, above the stark words: [...] "The family vault of Jolyon Forsyte: 1850." [...] It was in good order. All trace of the recent interment had been removed, and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the sunshine. The whole family lay there now, except old Jolyon's wife, who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in Suffolk; old Jolyon himself lying at Robin Hill; and Susan Hayman, cremated so that none knew where she might be. Soames gazed at it with satisfaction--massive, needing little attention; and this was important, for he was well aware that no one would attend to it when he himself was gone, and {{he would have to be}} looking out for lodgings soon. He might have twenty years before him, but one never knew. Twenty years without an aunt or uncle, with a wife of whom one had better not know anything, with a daughter gone from home. His mood inclined to melancholy and retrospection. This cemetery was quite full now--of people with extraordinary names, buried in extraordinary taste. Still, they had a fine view up here, right over London. Annette had once given him a story to read by that Frenchman, Maupassant--a most lugubrious concern, where all the skeletons emerged from their graves one night, and all the pious inscriptions on the stones were altered to descriptions of their sins.
