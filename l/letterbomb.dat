50|$|Such {{actions are}} usually, though not always, non-violent, with {{groups such as}} The Olga Cell {{attempting}} assassinations of nuclear scientists, and other related groups sending <b>letterbombs</b> to nano tech and nuclear tech-related targets. Though not necessarily Green anarchists, activists have used the names Animal Rights Militia, Justice Department and Revolutionary Cells among others, to claim responsibility for openly violent attacks.|$|R
5000|$|From 1978 to 1995, Harvard University {{graduate}} and former mathematics professor Theodore [...] "Ted" [...] Kaczynski - {{known by the}} codename [...] "UNABOM" [...] until his identification and arrest by the FBI - carried out a campaign of sending <b>letterbombs</b> to academics and various individuals particularly associated with modern technology. In 1996, his manifesto was published in The New York Times and The Washington Post, under the threat of more attacks. The bomb campaign ended with his capture.|$|R

50|$|December 28, 1977: In Malta, Karen Grech, age 15, {{was killed}} when she opened a <b>letterbomb</b> {{addressed}} to her father Edwin Grech. On the same day, another bomb was sent to Labour MP Dr. Paul Chetcuti Caruana, {{but it did not}} detonate.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, aged 15, she {{was killed}} by a <b>letterbomb</b> {{addressed}} to her father. In the presence of her brother Kevin (then 10 years old), she opened the package, which she thought to be a present since it was covered in wrapping paper. The bomb exploded, and she died half an hour later at St. Luke's Hospital, due to severe burns on various parts of her body. At her funeral Mass, Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi called the murder of Karin Grech [...] "the first terrorist act in the country".|$|E
5000|$|Wii softmodding is also {{closely related}} to the methods used to softmod Xboxes and PSPs. The first known method of loading {{unsigned}} code on a Wii (without a hardware mod) is known as the Twilight hack. This allowed users to run unsigned [...]dol/.elf files. The exploit was superseded by the development of Bannerbomb, which allows a user to run unsigned code on the console without relying on an exploit within a game. Bannerbomb works by using a malformed banner to inject a loader program into the Wii Menu program in memory. As the Wii Menu crashes, an unsigned executable is executed. Bannerbomb was superseded by <b>Letterbomb,</b> which uses a glitch in the Wii Message Board to crash the Wii Menu and load the [...]dol/elf file, allowing the user to install the Homebrew Channel.|$|E
50|$|The Wii U's {{built-in}} Wii emulator (often nicknamed vWii) {{is capable}} of running Wii homebrew, and also allows installation of the Homebrew Channel. However, the virtual Wii is much more fragile than a classic Wii console and has a higher chance of being bricked if dangerous software is used. Also, due to the updated patches, previous exploits that utilized the HOME menu itself to load the HackMii Installer, such as <b>Letterbomb,</b> do not work on vWii. However, exploits that launch the HackMii Installer via a game still work on vWii. The only way to hack vWii without one of the exploit games is using IOSU, using an exploit called wuphax. Wuphax uses the same client used to install Wii U exploits such as haxchi to temporarily load the HackMii Installer from the SD card when loading the Mii Channel. Users can then run the HackMii Installer to install the Homebrew Channel to their vWii. After installing the Homebrew Channel to the vWii, the modification to the Mii Channel is no longer needed and can be restored back to normal using a client script.|$|E
