40|$|Ethernet {{is a key}} {{component}} of the standards used for digital process buses in transmission substations, namely IEC 61850 and IEEE Std 1588 - 2008 (PTPv 2). These standards use multicast Ethernet frames that can be processed by more than one device. This presents some significant engineering challenges when implementing a sampled value process bus due to the large amount of network traffic. A system of network traffic segregation using a combination of Virtual <b>LAN</b> (VLAN) and <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> filtering using managed Ethernet switches is presented. This includes VLAN prioritisation of traffic classes such as the IEC 61850 protocols GOOSE, MMS and sampled values (SV), and other protocols like PTPv 2. <b>Multicast</b> <b>address</b> filtering is used to limit SV/GOOSE traffic to defined subsets of subscribers. A method to map substation plant reference designations to <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> ranges is proposed that enables engineers to determine the type of traffic and location of the source by inspecting the destination address. This method and the proposed filtering strategy simplifies future changes to the prioritisation of network traffic, and is applicable to both process bus and station bus applications...|$|R

40|$|Although IP {{multicast}} {{can be used}} {{to support}} message transmission among players in large network games running on Intranets, it is mostly not available on the Internet.
