This combines a formal semantics for a large fragment of the LD language (including a modeling of timed function blocks), and a powerful temporal logic model checking technology. Keywords: formal verification, programmable logic controllers, real-time, <b>Ladder</b> <b>Diagrams,</b> IEC 61131 - 3. 1 INTRODUCTION 1. 1 Contents of the paper We describe a formal approach to the automated verification of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs written in the <b>Ladder</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (LD) language of the IEC 61131 - 3 standard [4]. Our approach introduces a formal semantics for LD programs in terms of state automata, on which we use Cadence SMV [6], a powerful symbolic model checking tool, that checks automatically whether the LD program satisfies its expected behavioural properties. The properties are written in temporal logics (CTL and LTL). Our formal semantics for LD programs accounts for a large subset of the full langua [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the anomalous {{dimension of the}} cusped Wilson loop in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang– Mills theory to order λ 2 (λ = g 2 YMN). We show that the cancellation between the diagrams with the three-point vertex and the self-energy insertion to the propagator which occurs for smooth Wilson loops is not complete for cusped loops, so that an anomaly term remains. This term contributes to the cusp anomalous dimension. The result agrees with the anomalous dimensions of twist-two conformal operators with large spin. We verify the loop equation for cusped loops to order λ 2, reproducing the cusp anomalous dimension this way. We also examine the issue of summing <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams</b> to all orders. We find an exact solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation, summing light-cone <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and show that for certain values of parameters it reduces to a Bessel function. We conclude that without interaction <b>diagrams</b> the <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams</b> cannot reproduce {{the behavior of the}} cusp anomalous dimension expected for large λ from the AdS/CFT correspondence. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|We first derive a new "commutation technique" for an exciton {{interacting}} with electrons, inspired {{from the one}} we recently developed for excitons {{interacting with}} excitons.

In a last part we generate the <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams</b> associated to these trions. Although similar to the exciton <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams,</b> with the hole replaced by an exciton, they are actually much more tricky : (i) Due to the composite nature of the exciton, one cannot identify an exciton-electron potential similar to the Coulomb potential between electron and hole; (ii) the spins are unimportant for excitons while they are crucial for trions, singlet and triplet states having different energies...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{electron}} correlation {{plays an}} important role in the determination of double ionization energy, which is required for removing or adding two electrons, particularly in small-sized systems. Starting from the state-of-the-art GW approximation, we evaluate the particle-particle <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams</b> up to the infinite order by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the T-matrix theory to calculate the double-ionization energy spectra of atoms and molecules (Be, Mg, Ca, Ne, Ar, Kr, CO, C 2 H 2, Li- 2, Na- 2, and K- 2) from first principles. The <b>ladder</b> <b>diagrams</b> up to the infinite order are significant to calculations of double-ionization energy spectra.

50|$|Modern PLCs can be {{programmed}} {{in a variety}} of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of BASIC and C. Another method is state logic, a very high-level programming language designed to program PLCs based on state transition diagrams. The majority of PLC systems today adhere to the IEC 61131/3 control systems programming standard that defines 5 languages: <b>Ladder</b> <b>Diagram</b> (LD), Structured Text (ST), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Instruction List (IL) and Sequential Flow Chart (SFC).|$|E
50|$|Actions {{associated}} with steps {{can be of}} several types, the most relevant ones being Continuous (N), Set (S) and Reset (R). Apart from the obvious meaning of Set and Reset, an N action ensures that its target variable is set to 1 {{as long as the}} step is active. An SFC rule states that if two steps have an N action on the same target, the variable must never be reset to 0. It is also possible to insert LD (<b>Ladder</b> <b>Diagram)</b> actions inside an SFC program (and this is the standard way, for instance, to work on integer variables).|$|E

5000|$|The {{motivation}} for representing sequential control logic in a <b>ladder</b> <b>diagram</b> was to allow factory engineers and technicians to develop software without additional training {{to learn a}} language such as FORTRAN or other general purpose computer language. Development, and maintenance, was simplified because of the resemblance to familiar relay hardware systems. [...] Implementations of ladder logic have characteristics, such as sequential execution and support for control flow features, that make the analogy to hardware somewhat inaccurate. This argument has become less relevant given that most ladder logic programmers have a software background in more conventional programming languages.|$|E
5000|$|Programmable {{controllers}} vary {{in their}} capabilities for a [...] "rung" [...] of a <b>ladder</b> <b>diagram.</b> Some only allow a single output bit.

If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.|$|E
