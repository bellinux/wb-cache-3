25|$|Examining Kuhn's use of {{the word}} {{solution}} more closely, Stove notes that Kuhn sometimes uses it in the ordinary way regarding practical knowledge, but at other times in a weaker sense, specific to Kuhn's theory, that a solution is relative to a paradigm, people, place and time. This equivocation on solution actually provides Stove with an answer of exactly the type he was <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>All</b> his authors, with many similar words, show similar equivocation. Stove lists knowledge, discovery, facts, verified, understanding, explanation and notes the list is far from complete. Idiosyncratic weak senses of these words are a characteristic of the writing of his subjects that explains clearly how a reader, presuming ordinary use of language, might believe them to be expressing something more orthodox than is, in fact, their intention.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from critics, with some reservations over the resolution and character interactions. Dan Martin of The Guardian gave a positive review, {{believing that the}} episode [...] "moves along the bigger, 50-year story and effectively reboots the show". He particularly praised it for being simplistic, {{as well as the}} visuals of all history running together at once. Rachel Tarley, writing for Metro, praising the [...] "gripping race" [...] against time and noting that the script was [...] "snappy and witty throughout, but the episode had its eerie and touching moments where necessary, too". The A.V. Club Keith Phipps gave the episode an A, calling it [...] "pretty close to a perfect season finale" [...] for those not <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of the answers. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "As a piece of Saturday night entertainment, it works— packed full of strong performances, stunning visuals and sharp dialogue. And as the resolution to a series-long arc, it's mostly satisfactory— though the episode poses as many questions as it answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Damon Albarn got {{the idea}} for Plastic Beach while on a beach next to his house: [...] "I was just <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the plastic within the sand", he said. On 17 September 2008, Albarn and Jamie Hewlett {{announced}} that they would be doing another Gorillaz album in an interview with CBC News. Hewlett said that from their work on Monkey, [...] "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at when we come to another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music". Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again: [...] "I'm so f--king bored of drawing those characters. But then we had a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them". In a later interview Hewlett said: [...] "they'll be the same characters, but a little bit older and told in a different way".|$|E

2500|$|Simcha Jacobovici, {{involved}} {{in the production of}} a documentary on Freund's work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that [...] "Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach". Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of people have made many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic places where you have a lunatic fringe <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> types of things. And Richard Freund is known as someone who makes 'sensational' finds. I would say that I am exceptionally skeptical about the thing, but I wouldn’t discount it 100% until I see the details, which haven’t been published as far as I know...every few years we hear something like this from him... And the fact that it’s on National Geographic doesn’t mean much. Unfortunately, over the past years they’ve had many questionable programs.".|$|E
