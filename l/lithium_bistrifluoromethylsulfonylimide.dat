30|$|Perovskite {{solar cells}} are {{emerging}} {{as one of}} the most promising candidates for solar energy harvesting. To date, most of the high-performance perovskite solar cells have exclusively employed organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) such as 2, 2 ′, 7, 7 ′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)- 9, 9 ′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) or polytriarylamine (PTAA) which are often expensive and have low hole mobility. Almost all these HTMs reported needed lithium salt, e.g., <b>lithium</b> <b>bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide</b> (Li-TFSI) doping, to improve hole mobility and performance. However, the use of Li-TFSI should be avoided because the hygroscopic nature of Li-TFSI could cause decomposition of perovskite and reduce device stability. Herein, we employed solution-processed CuIn 0.1 Ga 0.9 (S 0.9 Se 0.1) 2 (CIGSSe) nanocrystals as a novel inorganic HTM in perovskite solar cells. A power conversion efficiency of 9.15 % was obtained for CIGSSe-based devices with improved stability, compared to devices using spiro-OMeTAD as HTM. This work offers a promising candidate of Cu-based inorganic HTM for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.|$|E
30|$|Each {{patterned}} TNP used as {{an individual}} photoanode for a unit cell was connected in series for a high-voltage DSSC array. The patterned TNP layer was immersed in a solution of 3  mM Z 907 dye (Solaronix SA) dissolved in a 1 : 1 mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol for 24  h. The dye-coated TNP layer was simply washed with acetonitrile. For the solid-state hole transport material (HTM), spiro-OMeTAD (American Dye Source, Inc., Baie D'Urfé, Quebec, Canada) dissolved in chlorobenzene was mixed with a <b>lithium</b> <b>bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide</b> salt ionic dopant dissolved in acetonitrile. The solution {{was placed on the}} whole TNP-patterned FTO glass, and the pores in the TNP layer were filled with the solution by capillary action for 1  min. The TNP-patterned FTO glass was then spun at the rate of 2, 000  rpm. For the preparation of a cathode, Au of 100  nm thick was thermally deposited at the rate of 1  Å/s through a shadow mask to connect 20 cells in series. The array of 20 DSSCs connected in series has a total active area of 1.4  cm 2.|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} (PSCs) employing organo-lead halide perovskite absorber materials have attracted substantial attention {{because of their}} excellent qualities, such as large absorption coefficient [1, 2], direct bandgap [3], {{high charge carrier mobility}} [4], and long diffusion lengths [5, 6]. Methylammonium lead iodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3) is a light-harvesting perovskite material with a direct bandgap of 1.55  eV [7], which makes it an ideal light absorber in PSCs [8, 9]. Perovskite films can be prepared by using either one-step or two-step sequential deposition methods [10 – 12]. To boost the solar cell efficiency, various types of solar cell architectures including perovskite-sensitized solar cells, mesoporous PSCs, and planar n-i-p or p-i-n heterojunction solar cells have been developed [8, 9]. So far, the efficiencies of mesoporous PSCs are higher than those of the planar PSCs. Recent advances in perovskite materials, perovskite film deposition methods, and device structures have been proven to contribute to the dramatic progress in PSCs. Thus, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been increased incredibly from 3.8 % to over 20 % {{in the past few years}} [1, 2, 13 – 19]. Noteworthy, organic small molecule 2, 2 ′, 7, 7 ′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)- 9, 9 ′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) [2, 14 – 16] is the most widely used hole-transporting material (HTM) in these high-performance PSCs with mesoporous or planar n-i-p architectures. Other organic small molecules and polymers are also employed as HTMs in PSCs, such as poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) [20 – 22], polyaniline (PANI) [23], polytriarylamine (PTAA) [19, 20], and poly[2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole- 4, 7 -diyl-[4, 4 -bis(2 -ethylhexyl)- 4 H-cyclopenta[2, 1 -b: 3, 4 -b′]dithiophene- 2, 6 -diyl]] (PCPDTBT) [20]. Despite the high efficiency obtained with these HTMs, the relatively high cost of these HTMs limits further large-scale production of PSCs because of their complicated synthetic procedures and high-purity requirement. Besides, almost all these HTMs require lithium salt, e.g., <b>lithium</b> <b>bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide</b> (Li-TFSI) doping, to improve hole mobility and performance [20]. However, the hygroscopic nature of Li-TFSI could cause decomposition of perovskite and reduce the device stability [24, 25]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop other HTMs with low cost and high stability.|$|E
