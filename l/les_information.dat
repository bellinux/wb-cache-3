40|$|Compile-time code transformations which expose instruction-level {{parallelism}} (ILP) typically {{take into}} account the constraints imposed byallexecution scenarios in the program. However, there areaddi tional opportunities to increase ILP along some execution sequences if the constraints from alternative execution sequences can be ignored. Traditionally, pro <b>le</b> <b>information</b> has been used to identify important execution sequences for aggressive compiler optimization and scheduling. This paper presents a set of static program analysis heuristics used in the IMPACT compiler to identify execution sequences for aggressive optimization. We show that the static program analysis heuristics identify execution sequences without hazardous conditions that tend to prohibit compiler optimizations. As a result, the static program analysis approach often achieves optimization results comparable to pro <b>le</b> <b>information</b> in spite of its inferior branch prediction accuracies. This observation makes a strong case for using static program analysis with or without pro <b>le</b> <b>information</b> to facilitate aggressive compiler optimization and scheduling...|$|R

40|$|Experience and {{exposure}} rating are traditionally {{considered to be}} independent but complementary methods for pricing property per risk excess of loss reinsurance. Strengths and limitations of these techniques are well-known. In practice, both methods often lead to quite different prices. In this paper we show that limitations of traditional experience rating can be overcome by taking into account historical profi <b>le</b> <b>information</b> by means of exposure curves. For pricing unused or rarely used capacity, we propose to use exposure rating, calibrated on the experience rate of a working layer.

Our approach uses instrumentation sampling to reduce the overhead of instrumentation, thus eliminating many of the limitations present in existing online systems. Several online feedback-directed optimizations are described, including a novel algorithm for performing feedback-directed splitting. Our experimental results show improvements in peak performance of up to 20 % while overhead remains low, with no individual execution being degraded more than 2 %...|$|R

However, these techniques have not been embraced by software vendors because programs instrumented for pro ling run 2 { 30 times slower, an awkward compile-run-recompile sequence is required, and a test input suite must be collected and validated for each program. This paper proposes using existing branch handling hardware to generate pro <b>le</b> <b>information</b> in real time. Techniques are presented for both one-level and two-level branch hardware organizations. The approach produces high accuracy with small slowdown in execution (0. 4 %{ 4. 6 %). This allows a program to be pro led while it is used, eliminating the need for a test input suite. This practically removes the inconvenience of pro ling. With contemporary processors driven increasingly by compiler support, hardware-based pro ling is important for high-performance systems. ...|$|R

Diamorphine and bupivacaine were combined in various concentrations in 100 ml bags for use with the Bard patient controlled analgesia pump.

40|$|An ILP (Instruction-Level Parallelism) {{compiler}} uses aggressive optimizations {{to reduce}} a program's running time. These optimizations {{have been shown}} to be e ective when pro <b>le</b> <b>information</b> is available. Unfortunately, users are not always willing or able to pro le their programs. A method of overcoming this issue is for an ILP compiler to statically infer the information normally obtained from proling. This paper investigates one aspect of this inference: the static prediction of conditional-branch direction. The goals of this work are to utilize the source-level information available in a compiler when performing static branch prediction, to identify static-branch-prediction cases in which there is a high con dence that a branch will go in one direction at run time, to gain an intuitive understanding into the reasons why the static-branch-prediction heuristics are effective, and ultimately to improve the accuracy of the static branch prediction. The e ectiveness of the static-branchprediction heuristics developed in this paper is demonstrated on a set of programs from SPEC CINT 92, SPEC CINT 95, and the IMPACT compiler. ...|$|R

Methods: Charts were reviewed for demographic data, duration of symptoms, radiologic workup, antibiotic choice, micro-biologic findings, surgical approach, complications, {{and duration of}} medical therapy.

Empirical intravenous clindamycin was started for a trial of conserv-ative medical therapy. Fifty-one patients (75 %) responded to medical treatment, and only 17 patients (25 %) required surgi-cal intervention. The CT scan showed a sensitivity of 43 % and a specificity of 63 % in this series. None of the patients with retropharyngeal infection died, had a major complication, or had a recurrence.
