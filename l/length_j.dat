Given a {{permutation}} τ of <b>length</b> <b>j,</b> we {{say that}} a permutation σ has a τ-match starting at position i, if the elements in position i; i+ 1; : : :; i+ j 1 in σ have the same relative order as the elements of τ. If ϒ is the set of permutations of <b>length</b> <b>j,</b> then {{we say that}} a permutation σ has a ϒ-match starting at position j {{if it has a}} τ-match at position j for some τ 2 ϒ. A number of recent papers have studied the distribution of τ-matches and ϒ-matches in permutations. In this paper, we consider a more rened pattern matching condition where we take into account conditions involving the equivalence classes of the elements mod k for some integer k 2. In this paper, we prove explicit formulas for the number of permutations of n which have s τ-equivalence mod k matches when τ is of length 2. We also show that similar formulas hold for ϒ-equivalence mod k matches for certain subsets of permutations of length 2...|$|E

When P is the property that a graph contains no subgraph isomorphic to a graph F, we write Ø (G; :F). The conditional chromatic number of a graph has been studied by various authors since 1968. We focus on two conditional chromatic numbers, specifically Ø (G; :C j) and Ø (G; :P j), where C j is a cycle of <b>length</b> <b>j</b> for some fixed j 3 and P j is a path of <b>length</b> <b>j</b> Γ 1 for some fixed j 2.
