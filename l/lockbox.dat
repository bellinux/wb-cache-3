5|$|On the February 18, 2010 {{episode of}} Impact!, Tara {{defeated}} Daffney by disqualification, after she hit Tara with a toolbox. At Destination X, Tara successfully defended her title against Daffney, who stole Poison the tarantula from her after the match. On the March 29 episode of Impact!, Tara retained her title against Daffney {{for a second}} time, {{this time in the}} first ever women's First Blood match in TNA. On the April 5 episode of Impact!, Tara was one of the four winners in an eight-Knockout <b>Lockbox</b> match. The box she opened contained her pet tarantula, Poison. At the same time, however, Tara lost the Knockouts Championship to Angelina Love. After losing the title, Tara began turning villainous due to her friction with Love heading into their match against The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky). At Lockdown, Tara cemented her heel turn by attacking Love after losing a tag team steel cage match against Rayne and Sky.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{good sense}} of humor, and in the series premiere his will was {{required}} to be read to Brian and Joe together; it required them to reunite after their six-year estrangement. He willed them a key which opened up the <b>lockbox</b> to another key, then another, which had Joe and Brian go to Boston then back to Nantucket airport where they ended up finding a suitcase full of spring snakes and a photograph of them as children, encouraging them to always value their kinship.|$|E
25|$|The first E1189 {{would end}} up {{travelling}} to the US in August {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission. By the spring of 1940, Bowen was being increasingly sidelined in the AI field due to his continuing battles with Rowe. Watt, responding to these problems, announced a reorganization of the AI teams, with Bowen left off the roster. Bowen then joined the Tizard Mission, secretly carrying the E1189 in a <b>lockbox</b> until he presented it to great acclaim by the US delegates who had nothing like it. This ultimately caused some confusion, as the supposedly matching blueprints were actually for the original six-chamber version.|$|E

25|$|While Ross and Joshua Spooner were in Princeton, Bathsheba invited two runaway British soldiers—escaped {{prisoners of}} war Pvt. Williams Brooks and Sgt. James Buchanan—to stay at the Spooner home and {{discussed}} ideas for killing her husband with them. When Joshua Spooner returned home, she recruited them to assist her. She also wrote to Ross to inform him of these developments, and he returned to Brookfield on February 28. When Spooner returned home from a local tavern the following evening, Brooks committed the murder and Buchanan and Ross helped hide {{the body in the}} Spooners' well. Bathsheba distributed paper money from her husband's <b>lockbox</b> and articles of his clothing to the three men, who then took one of the Spooner horses to Worcester, 14 miles away.|$|E
500|$|The online {{multiplayer}} allows up {{to eight}} players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches, with the latter excluding the ability to respawn; Interrogation features teams investigating {{the location of the}} enemy team's <b>lockbox,</b> and the first to capture such <b>lockbox</b> wins. In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)—and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve [...] "weeks", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction. Killing enemies, reviving allies, and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; parts can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their Facebook account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' Facebook friends. Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, in Ohio, 16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of {{his bedroom}} window to {{purchase}} the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father, a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, Ohio, U.S. His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it, and secured it in a <b>lockbox</b> in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun according to prosecutors. In October 2007, Daniel used his father's key to open the <b>lockbox</b> and remove the gun and the game. He then entered {{the living room of}} his house and shot both of them in the head, killing his mother and wounding his father. Petric was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole, which was later commuted to 23 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction. The court dismissed these claims. The judge, James Burge, commented that while he thought there was ample evidence the boy knew what he was doing, Burge thought the game had affected him like a drug, saying [...] "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever." ...|$|E

50|$|In general, a <b>lockbox</b> is a post-office box (PO box) that is {{accessible}} by a bank. A company may {{set up a}} <b>lockbox</b> service with its bank for receiving customers' payments. The company's customers send their payments to the PO box. Then the bank collects and processes these payments directly and deposits them to the company's account. Typical costs are several cents per transaction to as high as one dollar or more.|$|E

Caging is a shorthand term for the service bundle. The term may be a derivative of the financial teller cage since operations related to <b>lockbox</b> services involve the control and protection of funds.|$|E
50|$|The rules {{associated}} with where forms {{are to be}} mailed are complex: the location for mailing a form depends on the form name, the category of application, and the mailing address specified by the applicant (this may differ from the address the applicant sends the application from). The mailing address is either one of the <b>lockbox</b> addresses {{or one of the}} Service Center addresses. The lockboxes are in three US cities: Chicago (Illinois), Phoenix (Arizona), and Lewisville (Texas) (this is near Dallas, Texas and {{is often referred to as}} the Dallas <b>lockbox).</b> They are managed for the USCIS by a Department of Treasury designated financial agent. The <b>lockbox</b> cashes in on the included payment, sends an e-notification if the applicant filed Form G-1145 with the application, and forwards the rest of the application to the service center.|$|E
