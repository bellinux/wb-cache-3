2500|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session ran for an {{hour and}} was divided into four groups of five cars. Each group was determined by a lottery system and was permitted six minutes of on-track activity. All drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power. The fastest five overall competitors in the four groups participated in a [...] "Super Pole" [...] session with one driver on the track at any time going out in reverse order. Each of the five drivers was limited to one timed lap; the starting order was determined by the participants' fastest times. The driver and team who recorded the fastest time were awarded three points towards their respective championships. Qualifying was held in dry and warm weather conditions, and the track appeared slower than in practice. In the first group of five runners, where drivers waited three and a half minutes before venturing onto the track, Duval was fastest, three-tenths of a seconds quicker than Abt. The duo were followed by Bird who could not use the maximum amount of power available to him due to a mapping issue. Piquet heavily locked his tyres on his maximum power lap, and Jérôme d'Ambrosio was the first group's slowest (and overall) driver as he failed to reach the timing line to start his full power <b>lap.</b> <b>Track</b> conditions improved in the second group which saw the five drivers wait until the closing seconds to begin their maximum power laps. Sarrazin recorded the fastest lap time and Prost took second. Frijns was third-fastest. António Félix da Costa attacked but struggled with understeer and slid his car to go half a second slower than Sarrazin. López was the second group's slowest participant after a similar mapping error to teammate Bird left him driving at a slower pace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic lapping can {{effectively}} improve machining efficiency and obtain higher machining precision, {{which can be}} as the final process. This paper discusses the ultrasonic lapping mechanism through simulating the <b>lapping</b> <b>tracks.</b> Based on the contrast experiments between common and ultrasonic lapping, the influence of different lapping parameters on material removal rate and surface roughness were studied and the surface microstructure of workpiece was analyzed. The experimental results show that material removal rate of ultrasonic lapping is nearly two {{times that of the}} common lapping, especially in ultrasonic axial lapping, and the better surface quality can be obtained during ultrasonic lapping. Meanwhile, the reasons for material removal rate increasing and surface quality improving were analyzed...|$|R
