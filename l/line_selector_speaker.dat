30|$|DCM {{provides}} {{a wide range}} of powerful clock management features: Clock De-Skew, Frequency Synthesis, Phase Shifting and General Control Signals. The DCM contains a delay-locked loop (DLL) that can completely eliminate clock distribution delays, hence deskewing the DCM’s output clocks with respect to the input clock. The DLL contains delay elements (individual small buffers) and control logic. The control logic contains a phase detector and a delay <b>line</b> <b>selector.</b> The phase detector compares the incoming clock signal (CLKIN) against a feedback input (CLKFB) and steers the delay <b>line</b> <b>selector,</b> essentially adding delay to the output of DCM until the CLKIN and CLKFB coincide.|$|R
50|$|Video <b>line</b> <b>selectors</b> are {{circuits}} or {{units of}} other devices, fitted to the demand {{of the unit}} or a separate device for use in workshops, production and laboratories. They contain analog and digital circuits and an internal or external DC power supply. There's a video signal input, sometimes an output to prevent reflexions of the video signal {{and the cause of}} shadows of the video picture, also a trigger output. There is also an input or adjust for the line number(s) to be picked out and as an option an automatic or manual setting to fit other video standards and non-interlaced video. Video <b>line</b> <b>selectors</b> do not need all the picture signal, just the synchronisation signals are needed. Sometimes inputs for H- and V-sync were installed, only.|$|R
50|$|A video <b>line</b> <b>selector</b> is an {{electronic}} circuit or device for picking {{a line from}} an analog video signal. The input of the circuit is connected to an analog video source, the output triggers an oscilloscope, so display the selected line on the oscilloscope or similar device.|$|R

5000|$|When Hella was a two piece, Spencer {{only used}} a Boss LS-2 <b>Line</b> <b>Selector</b> to switch between {{distortion}} and clean tones. He played a Bently [...] "Flowercaster" [...] (a Telecaster copy) {{and used a}} Mesa Boogie Mark III amp with white tolex. On the tour following the release of Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard, Spencer was seen with an expanded setup using a pedal board.|$|R

The instrument has seven major units as follows: (i) Synchronizing Generator, (ii) Flying Spot Scanner, (iii) Optical System, (iv) XY stage, (v) Video Chain, (vi) Monitor for visual presentation, and (vii) a <b>Line</b> <b>Selector</b> for digitization {{in one direction}} at the image plane. Detailed descriptions of these units are given. The calibration procedures are outlined and numerical calibrations for the instrument are given...|$|R
40|$|IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH), Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA, JUL 18 - 20, 2016 International audienceWith {{the arrival}} of {{crosspoint}} based memories on the consumer market, high-density resistive memories could be introduced as flash memories replacement or as storage class memory. However, transistor-Less Resistive memory architectures using 1 Selector- 1 resistance bitcells suffer from performances loss due to sneaking current through unselected bitcells. Beyond {{the back end of}} <b>line</b> <b>selector</b> design, circuit design solutions have to be pushed in order to improve precision during programming steps. In this paper we propose a novel capacitor based 2 -steps SneakPath compensation circuit for transistor-less architectures of resistive memories. Compared to standard SneakPath compensation circuits, it ensures up to 20 x of area improvement and more than 3 x reduction of the variability effects for a 28 nm CMOS node...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the second}} album onwards, {{he has had}} quite an {{elaborate}} pedalboard. The pedals used have almost changed altogether. He stuck to his MXR Distortion +, and has added an Electro-Harmonix Little Big Muff, Electro-Harmonix HOG, Electro-Harmonix Pulsar Tremolo, Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man, a Boss LS-2 <b>Line</b> <b>Selector,</b> a Guyatone sustain and an expression pedal for the HOG all this was changed to an Ernie Ball volume/pan pedal, which can be seen used when playing the Arctic Monkeys song [...] "Nettles" [...] live. His main guitar is now a Gibson ES-335TD from 1975. He has been seen using several different Bad Cat amplifiers, including a Bad Cat Hot Cat 30 R, {{in addition to his}} Hiwatt amplifiers, on the 4th album Suck it and See a Rosewell Bluesman 30 and an Audio Kitchen Big Chopper was used.|$|R
50|$|Gopher menu {{items are}} defined by lines of tab-separated values in a text file. This file is {{sometimes}} called a gophermap. As the source code to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an HTML file for a web page. Each tab-separated <b>line</b> (called a <b>selector</b> <b>line)</b> gives the client software {{a description of the}} menu item: what it is, what it's called, and where it leads. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.|$|R
50|$|Interlace video {{requires}} a V-sync detector which detects first a second {{scan of the}} interlaced frame. Some reset the counter and toggle an interlace bit, others ignore the sync after the odd numbered lines and continue counting.Broadcast television systems were based on a nearly identical monochrome video signal with minor changes all over the world, which a number of lines can be covered by 10 bit counter (29 < lines < 210 → 512 < 576 < 1024). The digital comparator, feed by the line number preset and the counter detects the logical equivalence as match of the binary numbers, which is the output pulse of the video <b>line</b> <b>selector.</b> When fed to the trigger input of an oscilloscope, the signal of the selected video line is displayed on the oscilloscope when the test probe is fed by the video signal. A precision timer can trigger a pixel or dot of the line.|$|R
5000|$|For example: The {{following}} <b>selector</b> <b>line</b> {{generates a}} link to the [...] "/home" [...] directory at the subdomain gopher.floodgap.com, on port 70. The item type of [...] indicates that the resource is a Gopher menu. The string [...] "Floodgap Home" [...] is what the user sees in the menu.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>selector</b> <b>lines,</b> a gophermap may contain comment lines. Comment lines {{are not for}} code comments; rather, they are lines of text sent to the client to display alongside the menu items, such as for a menu description or welcome message. A comment line contains no tab characters.|$|R
50|$|The first {{character}} in a <b>selector</b> <b>line</b> indicates the item type, which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client {{decide what to do}} with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the media type system used by the Web and email attachments.|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of luminous density distribution in plasmas by densitomtric evaluation of pictures, taken with high speed image convertor- or rotating mirror cameras, {{suffers from the}} uncertainties in spectral response, sensitivity and reciprocity law failure of photographic emulsions. The time elapsed by film processing can often be troublesome. On the other hand, arrangements with multiple light pipes and photomultipliers give a good time but a poor space-resolution, moreover several oscilloscopes must be used. The videooutput signal of a shuttered TV - Camera System yields the luminous density distribution on the photocathode of the camera tube. Using a special <b>line</b> <b>selector</b> switch, we have measured up to 10 selected lines of a single exposure with one oscilloscope. The encouraging results of this technique, applied to several experiments in the Institute {{have led to the}} design of a new compact and versatile system. It consists of the TV - Camera, the shutterpulse generator and the recording unit. The latter comprises the multiple line oscilloscope and a cinescope with a flat faced picture tube of excellent geometry for recording purposes. The incorporation of an electronic Isophote Convertor is envisaged. By use of Image Orthicon Camera Tubes with bialcali photocathodes a shutter efficiency of 10 $^{ 5 }$ was achieved, the sensitivity is 45 DIN (app. 16000 ASA). The transfer function is linear within a contrast range of 1 : 25, the accuracy (5 - 10 %) is limited by the beam noise in the tube...|$|R
5000|$|All of the M70 models {{share the}} grenade {{launching}} ability with gas cutoff, the lengthened wooden handguard with 3 cooling slots, iron sights with flip-up illuminating elements, initially filled with phosphorus and later with tritium (Which {{is used on}} the current production M70's), to improve aiming at night; the plunger that keeps the receiver cover in place during grenade launching, and a non-chrome <b>lined</b> barrel. Fire <b>selectors</b> have R markings for automatic fire (R for rafalna, [...] "burst fire") and J for semi-automatic fire (J for jedinačna, [...] "single").|$|R
50|$|In 1900 a {{parliamentary}} inquiry {{was conducted to}} determine the best route for a proposed rail line to Nanango. James McConnel of Cressbrook stated that an extension of the Brisbane Valley Railway <b>Line</b> would enable <b>selectors</b> to pursue dairying rather than grazing and to cultivate the land. The inquiry subsequently recommended a 45 kilometre extension of the Brisbane Valley Branch Line to Moore, which was approved in December of the same year. The first section, to the new township of Toogoolawah, which was the site of the Cressbrook Condensed Milk Factory, opened on 8 February 1904. On 1 September 1904 the extension to Yimbun was opened and remained the terminus until 1910.|$|R
