5|$|The Hitachi Rail Italy Driverless Metro is a {{class of}} driverless {{electric}} multiple units and corresponding signaling system. Manufactured by Hitachi Rail Italy (formerly AnsaldoBreda) and Ansaldo STS in Italy, it is or will be used on the Copenhagen Metro, Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University, the Brescia Metro, the Thessaloniki Metro, Line 5 of the Milan Metro, <b>Line</b> <b>C</b> of the Rome Metro and the Yellow Line of the Taipei Rapid Transit System. The first system to use this class of driverless electric multiple units was the Copenhagen Metro which opened in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Line E {{stations}} were closed in 1966, after {{the line was}} re-routed from Constitución railway station (where it connected with <b>Line</b> <b>C)</b> closer to {{the centre of the}} city, leaving the San José vieja and Constitución stations out of the network, a move which tripled traffic on the line. The two stations have been used as workshops and storage areas in the past.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made in expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today <b>Line</b> <b>C,</b> a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lines</b> <b>C</b> and D (now U6 and U8) of the West Berlin BVG {{were left}} alone, but the {{stations}} {{located in the}} eastern sector were closed (the Geisterbahnhöfe). Connections were not allowed from the eastern section of line A and <b>lines</b> <b>C</b> and D at city centre stations or at Alexanderplatz.|$|R

5|$|In 1994 the {{operation}} of the network was privatised, along with the country's railways, and is now managed by Metrovías. SBASE (as part of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires) maintained ownership the network, its rolling stock and infrastructure, and administers its expansion and budget. One cosmetic change carried out in the 1990s under private operation was the re-assignation of the colours of the lines, with Lines B and D switching colours, <b>Line</b> <b>C</b> changing from purple to blue and Line E changing from yellow to purple. The change of colours was also accompanied by a standardisation of the network's signage to match the new schemes.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, {{the city}} of Buenos Aires {{together}} with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan Estratégico y Técnico para la Expansión de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts {{and the need to}} adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, Line I is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro – a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, <b>Line</b> <b>C</b> is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.|$|E

25|$|The <b>line</b> <b>C</b> {{planned by}} Nord-Sud between Montparnasse station and Porte de Vanves was built as line 14 (different from present line14).

5|$|Other works {{being carried}} out during this period include the {{improvement}} of disabled access in older stations, new ventilation systems on <b>lines</b> B, <b>C</b> and D, improvements in electrification (such as replacing overhead lines and substations) on <b>lines</b> A, B, <b>C</b> and D and the replacement of 14km of track on <b>Lines</b> <b>C</b> and E.

25|$|The Metro uses modern Eurotram low-floor, {{articulated}} trams.

They also have more seats, and can, {{in common with}} most modern light rail systems, recover 30% of the total of consumed energy during braking.|$|E
25|$|Nord-Sud did {{not become}} {{profitable}} and bankruptcy became unavoidable. By the end of 1930, the CMP bought Nord-Sud. Line A became line 12 and line B line13. <b>Line</b> <b>C</b> was built and renamed line14, that line was reorganized in 1937 with lines 8 and 10. This partial line is now the south part of line13.|$|E

25|$|After {{the regular}} {{service on the}} first section of <b>Line</b> <b>C</b> began in 1974 between Florenc and Kačerov, {{building}} of extensions continued quite rapidly. In 1978 the second Line A was opened and the third Line B opened in 1985, thus forming the triangle with three crossing points. Since then, the lines have been extended outwards from the center.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 and 1990, line A was {{extended}} from Náměstí Míru to {{east to the}} terminal stations Želivského and Skalka. Line B {{was extended}} from Nové Butovice to Zličín in 1994, from Českomoravská to Černý Most in 1998, Kolbenova and Hloubětín stations were opened in 2001. Expansion of the <b>line</b> <b>C</b> {{was carried out in}} 1980 (Kačerov - Háje) and 1984 (Florenc - Nádraží Holešovice).|$|E
25|$|On Line E, the two {{stations}} were closed in 1966 when {{the line was}} re-routed closer to the centre of Buenos Aires {{in order to improve}} passenger numbers. They have both been used as maintenance areas for Line E and <b>Line</b> <b>C,</b> while one of the stations served as a set for the 1996 Argentine film Moebius. The {{stations were}} under consideration to be re-purposed as part of the new Line F, however it was later decided to build new tunnels instead.|$|E
