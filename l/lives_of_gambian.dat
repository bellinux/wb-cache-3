40|$|Girls ’ {{education}} has been promoted by the international development community for over two decades; however, it has proven harder to promote gender equality through education {{than it has been}} to promote gender parity in education. Of significance is the global circulation and co-existence of two competing rationales for the importance of girls ’ education: economic efficiency and social justice. The cost of ignoring how and why Southern governments and their development partners choose to promote girls ’ education is high: an over-emphasis on economic efficiency can mean that the root causes of gendered inequalities in society remain unchallenged, and more social justice-oriented reforms become marginalized. This thesis uses a critical feminist lens to qualitatively investigate the role and significance of human capital, human rights, and human capabilities policy models {{in the context of the}} production and enactment of gender equality in education policy knowledge in The Gambia, a small, aid-dependent Muslim nation in West Africa. The purpose of the study was to assess the scope education policies provide for positive change in the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gambian</b> women and girls.

5000|$|On 12 December, the Gambia bar {{association}} held an emergency meeting. They called Jammeh's {{rejection of the}} election results [...] "tantamount to treason" [...] and passed a unanimous resolution calling for {{the resignation of the}} Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Nigerian judge Emmanuel Oluwasegun Fagbenle, for gross misconduct, saying he had shown a lack of independence and impartiality by campaigning for Jammeh and inappropriately interfering with decisions made by judicial officials. The Gambia teachers' union called Jammeh's action [...] "a recipe for chaos and disorder which undoubtedly endangers the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> all <b>Gambians</b> particularly our children". The Gambia Press Union, the University of the Gambia, and the country's medical association and Supreme Islamic Council also supported the view that Jammeh should step aside and allow Barrow to assume the presidency. On 20 December, twelve serving Gambian ambassadors sent a congratulatory letter to Barrow and called on Jammeh to step down. In response, Jammeh's new Information Minister, Seedy Njie said on 10 January 2017 that the twelve ambassadors had been fired.|$|R

In <b>Gambian</b> men the nutritional status thus does not seem to affect energy metabolism notably. No differences in respiratory quotient, diet-induced thermogenesis, net work efficiency, spontaneous physical activity, heart rate, or urinary catecholamine excretion were observed between the two groups. It is, however, {{interesting to note that the}} basal metabolic rate <b>of</b> <b>Gambian</b> men, regardless <b>of</b> their nutritional status, is approximately 10 % (range 4 - 12 % depending on the reference value used) lower than that predicted for individuals living in industrialized countries...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} transnational kinship relations between Gambian {{parents in the}} United Kingdom and their children and carers in The Gambia, {{with a focus on}} the production, exchange and reception <b>of</b> photographs. Many <b>Gambian</b> migrant parents in the U. K. take their children to The Gambia to be cared for by extended family members. Mirroring the mobility <b>of</b> <b>Gambian</b> migrants and their children, as they travel between the U. K. and The Gambia, photographs document changing family structures and relations. It is argued that domestic photography provides insight into the representational politics, values and aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>Gambian</b> transatlantic kinship relations. Further, the concept of the moral economy supports a hermeneutics <b>of</b> <b>Gambian</b> family photographic practice and develops our understanding of the visual economy of transnational kinship relations in a number of ways: it draws attention {{to the way in which}} the value attributed to a photograph is rooted in shared moral and cultural codes of care within transnational relations of inequality and power; it helps us to interpret Gambian’s responses to and treatment of family photographs; and it highlights the importance attributed to portrait photography and the staging, setting and aesthetics of photographic content within a Gambian imaginary...|$|R
5000|$|The {{main goal}} for the <b>Gambian</b> branch <b>of</b> the NCBWA was to {{successfully}} establish elected representation in the Gambian government that would include prominent elite members <b>of</b> <b>Gambian</b> society, as the Gambian branch was made up predominantly {{of members of the}} Creole middle class. [...] In attempting to lobby for the creation of elected representation, the members <b>of</b> the <b>Gambian</b> branch were unable to determine how to best include the large Muslim community in The Gambia into the elected representation that they were setting out to achieve. [...] This inability to determine how to best include the Muslim community {{led to the creation of}} internal factions which undermined the efforts <b>of</b> the <b>Gambian</b> branch. Another factor that also undermined the ability <b>of</b> the <b>Gambian</b> branch to meet its desired agenda was its inability to include the poorer, peasant citizenry into their discussions.|$|R
