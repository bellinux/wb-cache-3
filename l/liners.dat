5|$|The ships {{assigned}} {{to carry the}} 9th Division to Australia were the converted ocean <b>liners</b> Aquitania, Île de France, Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen Mary; these four large vessels had previously carried Australian soldiers to the Middle East and other locations. The <b>liners</b> were heavily tasked transporting Allied military personnel across long distances, and arrived at Suez individually. Aquitania put in from Australia on 5 January, Queen Mary was reassigned from transporting American personnel across the Atlantic and arrived from the United Kingdom on 18 January, Nieuw Amsterdam completed one of her frequent voyages {{along the coast of}} East Africa on 31 January and Île de France arrived in late January. In addition to the four converted <b>liners,</b> the armed merchant cruiser HMS Queen of Bermuda was transferred from transport duties in the Indian Ocean to both augment the convoy's escort and embark Australian personnel. The four <b>liners</b> were armed with anti-aircraft guns manned by dedicated personnel, as well as two 6-inch guns each. The operation to sail these vessels from Egypt to Australia together was designated Operation Pamphlet.|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of SAG mills is variable over time {{due to their}} continually changing <b>liner</b> shape, mass and subsequent load motion. However, this tends to be poorly accommodated in <b>liner</b> design and mill control, with only limited compensation made for this influence, usually {{in the first few}} weeks after a new <b>liner</b> is installed. With ever-increasing ore competency, increasing energy costs and decreasing ore grades, simplified design and operational approaches that compromise the achievable mill efficiency are no longer adequate. This paper presents a methodology that has been developed to measure and account for the changes in mill performance as the <b>liner</b> wears. This involves monitoring all <b>liner</b> profiles – in other words the three-dimensional <b>liner</b> shape - {{over the life of the}} <b>liner,</b> then conducting controlled surveys at different stages of the <b>liner</b> wear life, and correlating the mill performance to the <b>liner</b> profiles. The measured <b>liner</b> mass is modelled to provide an ongoing meaningful load mass measure that excludes the <b>liner</b> mass...|$|R

5|$|The {{restoration}} of peace inevitably meant {{a reduction in}} military expenditure, but {{this was more than}} offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British <b>liners</b> travelling to and from India and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek <b>liners</b> travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.|$|E

50|$|In 1929, Cicero C. Brown {{organized}} Brown Oil Tools in Houston, and patented {{the first}} <b>liner</b> hanger in 1937. <b>Liner</b> hangers enable drillers to lengthen their casing strings {{without having the}} <b>liner</b> pipe extend {{all the way to}} the surface. This saves capital cost and reduces weight borne by offshore platforms. Hughes Tool Company acquired Brown Oil Tools in 1978. In 1970, Baker Oil Tools acquired Lynes, Inc., which produced <b>liner</b> hangers and other completion equipment. In 1978, Baker Oil Tools introduced the Bakerline casing <b>liner</b> hanger. In 1985, the FlexLock <b>Liner</b> Hanger was introduced, extending the performance range and functionality of <b>liner</b> hanger systems. In 1987, the Brown <b>liner</b> hanger technology was merged into Baker Oil Tools. In 1992, BOT introduced the ZXP <b>Liner</b> Hanger Packer, with expandable metal seals, which set the stage for development of expandable screens, casing systems and <b>liner</b> hangers.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the usefulness of}} the ducted fan noise prediction code TBIEM 3 D as a <b>liner</b> optimization design tool. Boundary conditions on the interior duct wall allow for hard walls or a locally reacting <b>liner</b> with axially segmented, circumferentially uniform impedance. Two <b>liner</b> optimization studies are considered in which farfield noise attenuation due to the presence of a <b>liner</b> is maximized by adjusting the <b>liner</b> impedance. In the first example, the dependence of optimal <b>liner</b> impedance on frequency and <b>liner</b> length is examined. Results show that both the optimal impedance and attenuation levels are significantly influenced by <b>liner</b> length and frequency. In the second example, TBIEM 3 D is used to compare radiated sound pressure levels between optimal and non-optimal <b>liner</b> cases at conditions designed to simulate take-off. It is shown that significant noise reduction is achieved for most of the sound field by selecting the optimal or near optimal <b>liner</b> impedance. Our results also indicate that there is relatively large region of the impedance plane over which optimal or near optimal <b>liner</b> behavior is attainable. This is an important conclusion for the designer since there are variations in <b>liner</b> characteristics due to manufacturing imprecisions...|$|R

40|$|Modern aero-engines require due {{to their}} {{architecture}} an enhanced damping performance of passive, acoustically absorbing wall treatment, called <b>liner.</b> The concept in thispaper aims on {{the improvement of the}} broadband damping compared to the narrow damping behavior of conventional Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) <b>liner.</b> This study investi- gates a new <b>liner</b> concept based on an additional acoustical excitation of the <b>liner</b> cavity below the <b>liner</b> face sheet. This so-called Zero-Mass ow-liner (ZML) concept was investigated earlier in the framework of combustion chamber <b>liner</b> design. Here, this concept was enhanced by combining a single cavity ZML <b>liner</b> with a honeycomb-structured SDOF <b>liner</b> yielding a hybrid ZML <b>liner</b> concept. Within this work, this concept was investigated in detail focusing on different parameters like the cavity excitation amplitude, the face sheet porosity and the grazing flow in uence. In conclusion, the hybrid ZML concept reveals a signiffcant potential for increased broadband dissipation behavior due to an additional damping effect based on the periodically excited flow through the <b>liner</b> facesheet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Landfill <b>liner</b> leakage {{detection}} {{has become the}} necessity procedure before the landfill put into operation.

5|$|The first European emigrants {{travelled}} in the holds {{of sailing}} cargo ships. With {{the advent of}} the age of steam, an efficient transatlantic passenger transport mechanism was established {{at the end of the}} 1860s. It was based on huge ocean <b>liners</b> run by international shipping lines, most prominently Cunard, White Star, and Inman. The speed and capacity of the large steamships meant that tickets became cheaper. From the Swedish port towns of Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg, transport companies operated various routes, some of them with complex early stages and consequently a long and trying journey on the road and at sea. Thus North German transport agencies relied on the regular Stockholm—Lübeck steamship service to bring Swedish emigrants to Lübeck, and from there on German train services to take them to Hamburg or Bremen. There they would board ships to the British ports of Southampton and Liverpool and change to one of the great transatlantic <b>liners</b> bound for New York. The majority of Swedish emigrants, however, travelled from Gothenburg to Hull, UK, on dedicated boats run by the Wilson Line, then by train across Britain to Liverpool and the big ships.|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver <b>liners</b> to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

40|$|Background and aim: Thermal {{discomfort}} often affects prosthesis wearers {{and could}} be addressed by increasing <b>liner</b> thermal conductivity. This note explores a <b>liner</b> made from thermally conductive silicone and two additional alternative <b>liner</b> designs. Technique: Thermally conductive silicone was {{used to create a}} conductive <b>liner</b> and a hybrid <b>liner.</b> Additionally, one with open elements was made. These were compared with a plain silicone <b>liner</b> and a no <b>liner</b> scenario. Scaled down <b>liner</b> prototypes were used due to the high-cost of the thermally conductive silicone. Temperature decay profiles were collected by attaching thermistors to a heated <b>liner</b> phantom and used to evaluate scenarios. Discussion: No scenario performed much better than the plain silicone <b>liner.</b> Implementation of passive solutions may be easier, but alternative <b>liner</b> materials are unlikely to affect dissipation enough to address thermal discomfort. Based on this work, future research efforts may be better spent developing active thermal discomfort solutions. Clinical relevance Thermal discomfort can increase the probability of skin damage, reduce prosthesis satisfaction and, ultimately, the quality of life. The prosthesis-wearing experience could be improved if thermal discomfort can be addressed by technological improvements...|$|R
