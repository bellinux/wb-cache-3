5|$|Hideo Sasaki's {{architectural}} firm Sasaki Associates, Inc. {{found in the}} February 2010 master plan that the campus's seismic risk, uneven terrain, lack of parking spaces, small classrooms, and pedestrian-unfriendly roads are major constraints for future campus development. It also indicated the lack of identity, an undefined sense of arrival, {{and a desire to}} build a stronger on-campus community, among others, as recurrent themes among campus's users. Nonetheless, the firm highlights campus ethnic diversity, its location-climate, and the natural beauty of campus, among others, as positive aspects of the physical campus as well as the campus <b>life</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{conversation}} {{poems are}} {{a group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807. Each details a particular <b>life</b> <b>experience</b> {{which led to the}} poet's examination of nature and the role of poetry. They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and <b>life</b> <b>experience</b> are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{effective}} {{leaders from}} diverse organizational backgrounds described their significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> {{and the impact}} upon their development as leaders. Using grounded theory methodology, a theoretical model emerged for assisting leaders absorb greater learning from their various <b>life</b> <b>experiences.</b> Related to the central phenomenon of how effective leaders learn from significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences,</b> four causal conditions of types of experiences were identified as influencing how leaders learn: (1) experiences of adversity or loss; (2) experiences of “stretch assignments”; (3) inspirational experiences; and (4) experiences with conflict. Strategies used by the leaders to absorb learning from their significant experiences were active reflection and seeking to apply the lessons learned for their own leadership {{as well as to}} help others. Intervening conditions and conditions pertaining to the context of the learning experiences were also identified through the data. Several consequences or outcomes of leaders’ significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> were also identified through the data: (1) consideration of others; (2) self-awareness; (3) resiliency; (4) change; (5) embracing of life; (6) confidence; and (7) humility. Six propositions emerged from the data: (1) the influence of family plays {{a significant role in the}} response of leaders to life experiences; (2) learning from significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> provides a valuable foundation of case-based knowledge that leaders can utilize in times of uncertainty and change; (3) significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> can serve as the trigger point for the development of Authentic Leadership; (4) significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> can provide a means for developing Emotional Intelligence within leaders; (5) the strategy of reflection used by leaders in significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> can be utilized as an effective learning tool in leadership development; and (6) significant <b>life</b> <b>experiences,</b> as related in this study, may serve as means to develop the Servant Leadership characteristics of altruistic calling, emotional healing and wisdom...|$|R

5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the Democratic National Committee and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi Democratic Party. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent Blackwell and three other delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey.

In late 1982 Blackwell went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and received a Master's Degree in Regional Planning. Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and <b>life</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Guerrero {{was raised}} in the Jamaica Plain and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston after being taken in by other Colombian families. She has had an {{interest}} in acting since a young age and took advantage of free opportunities in the neighborhood or at school. Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's <b>life</b> <b>experience</b> compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that she draws upon in her acting.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the <b>life</b> <b>experience</b> she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Several studies report a {{positive}} association between adverse <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> and adult obesity. Despite the high comorbidity between binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity, few authors {{have studied the}} link between trauma and BED. In this review the association between exposure to adverse <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> and a risk {{for the development of}} obesity and BED in adulthood is explored. Methods Based on a scientific literature review in Medline, PubMed and PsycInfo databases, the results of 70 studies (N[*]=[*] 306, 583 participants) were evaluated including 53 studies on relationship between adverse <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> and obesity, 7 studies on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to obesity, and 10 studies on the association between adverse <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> and BED. In addition, mediating factors between the association of adverse <b>life</b> <b>experiences,</b> obesity and BED were examined. Results The majority of studies (87 %) report that adverse <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> are a risk factor for developing obesity and BED. More precisely a positive association between traumatic experiences and obesity and PTSD and obesity were found, respectively, in 85 % and 86 % of studies. Finally, the great majority of studies (90 %) between trauma and the development of BED in adulthood strongly support this association. Meanwhile, different factors mediating between the trauma and obesity link were identified. Discussion and conclusions Although research data show a strong association between <b>life</b> adverse <b>experiences</b> and the development of obesity and BED, {{more research is needed to}} explain this association...|$|R
