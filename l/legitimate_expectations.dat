5|$|In cases falling {{under the}} second sub-heading, a public {{authority}} has satisfied all the factual and legal conditions required for exercising a statutory power conferred upon it, but nevertheless may have acted illegally {{by doing so}} in a manner contrary to administrative law rules. The grounds of review available under this heading include the authority acting in bad faith, acting {{on the basis of}} no evidence or insufficient evidence, making an error of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant ones, acting for an improper purpose, fettering one's discretion, and not fulfilling a person's substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E
25|$|Category (b): {{procedural}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> â€“ no consultation. The second form {{occurs when}} a public authority's promise or practice has induced a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> of a procedural nature. An illustration of such a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> would be an expectation to be consulted before an authority reaches a conclusion, arising from a representation made by the authority. In such a situation, the court is bound to hold that the procedure be conducted as legitimately expected unless there are overriding reasons to justify abrogating the procedure.|$|R

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedural}} {{dimension of}} the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the substantive form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question.|$|R
500|$|Other decided cases {{also do not}} {{indicate}} whether the doctrine of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> will be developed {{in the way it}} has been developed in the UK. In Siah Mooi Guat, another argument the applicant raised was that she had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re-entry permit. Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (1983), a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong, from the case at hand. In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation.</b> In the present case, no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations. No substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> arose in the applicant's favour, following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> arises [...] "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue". Thus, the judge did not discuss the detailed legal rules to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to a substantive right.|$|R

25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice. The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature {{in the application of}} the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> In their elaboration of {{the doctrine}}, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury unreasonableness, fairness, and abuse of power to justify the existence and the protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b>|$|E
25|$|When a court protects an applicant's {{substantive}} legitimate expectation, it {{is effectively}} mandating {{the outcome of}} a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will {{no longer be able to}} formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the administrative power to alter policy is not used to unduly frustrate <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to expect, it may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise. The problem is alleviated if the court orders that the individual's legitimate expectation be given effect.|$|E

2500|$|Strong {{reliance}} by {{the applicant}} is not compulsory {{to prove the}} existence of a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation.</b> In spite of this, Lord Justice of Appeal Peter Gibson stated in R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999) that [...] "it would be wrong to understate the significance of reliance in this area of the law". Detrimental reliance is not indicative of whether the court should protect an applicant's <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> but usually furthers an applicant's case, and it is only in exceptional cases where courts will protect a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> in which detrimental reliance is absent.|$|R
25|$|Representations {{will not}} lead to <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> when {{delegation}} of such power to the individual making the representation is forbidden by statute, or where the individual making the representation lacks actual or apparent authority. In the latter case, the applicant's expectation will lack legitimacy and thus would prima facie not be binding on the public authority.|$|E
25|$|A {{procedural}} {{legitimate expectation}} is created when a representation {{is made by}} a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case. Examples of procedural <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> include an expectation to be consulted and to a fair hearing. A substantive legitimate expectation is formed where a representation is made by an authority as to the final decision and outcome that the authority will make in a particular case.|$|E
25|$|More {{recent case}} law from the UK tends {{to refer to}} a duty of public {{authorities}} to act fairly rather than to natural justice. One aspect of such a duty is the obligation on authorities in some cases to give effect to procedural <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> These are underpinned by the notion that a party that is or will be affected by a decision can expect that he or she will be consulted by the decision-maker before the decision is taken.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E

The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice.

25|$|A {{procedural}} {{legitimate expectation}} {{by an individual}} or group rests on the presumption that the decision-maker will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken. This expectation can manifest in various ways, such as the expectation of being consulted; of an inquiry being held; of a fair hearing; and of being allowed time to make representations, especially where the applicant is seeking to persuade an authority to depart from a lawfully established policy. The courts' protection of procedural <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> reinforces the notion that administrative decision-makers should be bound by certain representations which they make to individuals who stand {{to be affected by}} their decisions.|$|E

25|$|Illegality {{is divided}} into two categories: those that, if proved, mean that the public {{authority}} was not empowered to take action or make the decision it did; and those that relate to whether the authority exercised its discretion properly.

25|$|The {{courts of}} the United Kingdom have {{recognized}} both procedural and substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> A procedural legitimate expectation {{rests on the}} presumption that a public authority will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken, while a substantive legitimate expectation arises where an authority makes a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive some kind of substantive benefit. In determining a claim for an alleged breach of a legitimate expectation, a court will deliberate over three key considerations: (1) whether a legitimate expectation has arisen; (2) {{whether it would be}} unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation; and (3) if it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person.|$|E
