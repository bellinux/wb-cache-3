5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 190s, {{northern}} China {{was divided}} between two contending warlords, Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. Each had assimilated the smaller powers around them and made political arrangements with the larger powers elsewhere, and were increasingly <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for potential gains. Cao Cao had earlier secured the helpless Emperor Xian into his custody, a move that Yuan Shao regretted not to have made. After the successful conquest of Gongsun Zan's territories to the north, Yuan Shao turned to the south to prepare for an assault on Cao Cao in the summer of 199. In response, Cao Cao went on a patrol to the northern front and dispatched several armies to defend positions {{on the south side of}} the Yellow River in the eighth lunar month (September 8 - October 7) of 199. Among these was the placement of Yu Jin at Yan Ford (延津; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan) with 2,000 troops. This position blocked Yuan Shao's direct approach over the ford toward Cao Cao's main defense lines at Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan).|$|E
25|$|The shield itself {{consists}} of many components. In {{the center is}} a depiction of the Mount Ararat with Noah's Ark sitting atop it. According to tradition, the ark {{is said to have}} finally rested on the mountain after the great flood. Ararat is considered the national symbol of Armenia and thus is of principal importance to the coat of arms. Surrounding Mount Ararat are symbols of old Armenian dynasties. In the lower left portion of the shield, there are two eagles <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> symbolizing the length of the Armenian territory during the reign of the Artaxiad Dynasty that ruled in the 1st century BC. In the upper left portion, there is a lion with a cross, the emblem for the Bagratuni Dynasty that ruled during the Middle Ages, between the 7th and 11th centuries. Under this dynasty, Armenia blossomed culturally, making its capital, Ani, {{one of the most important}} cultural, social and commercial centers of its time. Bagratuni was destroyed by the Byzantine Empire's encroachment and by Seljuk conquests in the 11th century. In the upper right portion, there is a two-headed eagle, the emblem of the first dynasty to reign over a Christian Armenia, the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Tiridates III of Arsacid Dynasty made Armenia the first Christian nation in 301. This dynasty ruled from the 1st century to 428. In the lower right portion, there is a lion with a cross, the emblem of the Rubenid dynasty. This dynasty reigned in Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, a state that expanded and prospered during the 12th and 13th centuries, until the Mamelukes and Turks eventually conquered it.|$|E

500|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book's {{illustrations}} were positive. Beier writes highly of the illustrations and states that Dyer's paintings of the dogs' faces are priceless, particularly in the scenes where they are <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> through the fence and those where {{they are in their}} owners' arms. Similarly, the Kirkus reviewer calls the illustrations charming and writes that they [...] "have all the clever details that are Dyer's signature touch", noting specifically the lavender frames of Miss Violet's eyeglasses and the inclusion of the dogs' names on their collars. Fletcher suggests that, apart from the [...] "ominous grays and greens" [...] in the illustrations of the forest scenes with the bear, the pastel-colored illustrations in the book are evocative of 1940s picture postcards, which she considers [...] "just right for such jolly capers".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Williams {{waiting for his}} laundry {{to be done in}} a store, before getting out for a walk. Meanwhile, Barlow is {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the street. As the song starts the two of them start walking towards their cars whilst <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> When they get inside, the scenes are intercut with the two of them dancing with their female partners. Later in the video, they are shown sitting at the bar having a drink whilst singing the song's words. As the second chorus starts, Williams and Barlow are at a pond, fishing and laughing. Scenes of them looking each other secretly are also shown. In the middle of [...] "Shame"'s bridge they start taking their shirts off. Shortly, they are shown climbing up a cliffs. After they get on the top they want to jump, however, they realize it's too high. Instead they hug each other and walk away as the video finishes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Ipswich, Ramsey began experimenting with a new style of play that would {{eventually}} lead to success in the World Cup and led to his England team being styled, [...] "The Wingless Wonders". As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing fullbacks, who would naturally {{expect to see a}} winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As Bobby Charlton remarked, [...] "The Spanish fullbacks were just <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> while we were going in droves through the middle". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E

500|$|Cote de Pablo relayed {{that there}} had been a dispute between the {{director}}, Terrence O'Hara, and the actors during filming about how the scene should be choreographed. Both sides thought that it needed to be very intimate, but the director thought that the moment should be drawn out more while de Pablo and Michael Weatherly wanted to keep it brief. Furthermore, the latter two believed that simply <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> would be sufficient to convey the message to the audience. Eventually, de Pablo approached O'Hara and said, [...] "Listen, if there was any more time of staring into each other's eyes, it would be like, cut to a hotel room." [...] In an interview, she explained that she and Weatherly played the characters as being at a more vulnerable level than is typical for the show. She likened Tony to a [...] "man Teddy Bear" [...] in the episode; in the Tony-Ziva dynamic, he is normally portrayed as being the more juvenile of the two while Ziva is more mature and worldly. In [...] "Berlin", their roles are largely reversed as more of [...] "the little girl in Ziva" [...] is shown and as Tony takes charge of the situation while they are dancing. De Pablo said that she found this reversal in their interactions to be an interesting change.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E

This {{made her the}} {{youngest}} athlete to win an individual {{gold medal at the}} World Championships. Recalling the race, Dibaba said, [...] "I competed in Paris only because I had the 'A' standard. No one expected me to win. There was no pressure from anywhere. All of them [...] were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> [...] and no one was focusing on the finish line. I just went for it and was surprised that I had won." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} at Edgbaston is {{reputed to be}} the most hostile in England for visiting teams. Former England captain Alec Stewart recalled [...] "On a world level I would put it up there with Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which holds about 100,000. It inspires a team. It's like having another man in your side." [...] and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how [...] "The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment." [...] After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented [...] "The Edgbaston crowd was up there with the loudest I can remember. With some of the chants, even guys who have played a fair bit of cricket were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and realising how special it was. Edgbaston has been a fantastic venue for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{the seven years}} of plenty ended and famine struck, and when Egypt was famished, Joseph opened the storehouses, and sold food to the Egyptians. People from all {{countries}} came to Egypt to buy grain, because the famine struck all the earth. Jacob {{saw that there was}} grain in Egypt, asked his sons why they sat around <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and sent them down to Egypt to buy some. Ten of Joseph's brothers went down to Egypt, but Jacob kept Benjamin behind, so that no harm might befall him. Joseph's brothers came to buy grain from Joseph and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth. Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him, for he made himself strange to them and spoke roughly with them. Joseph remembered his dreams, and accused them of being spies. But they protested that they were not spies, but upright men come to buy food, ten sons {{of a man who had}} twelve sons, lost one, and kept one behind. Joseph told them that to prove their story, they would have to send one of them to fetch their brother, and he imprisoned them for three days. On the third day, Joseph told them his plan, because he feared God. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
