5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> handle {{and bent over}} so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} {{continued to}} fire up, keeping the storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning it away from the Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, Major General David G. Barr, the {{commander}} of the 7th Infantry Division, flew into the Sinhung-ni inlet and met with Faith, who by now had assumed command of RCT-31. Faith expressed the difficulties for a breakout, particularly the 500 wounded that RCT-31 had to carry. On the same day, parts of the PVA 94th Division and the rest of 81st Divisionarrived as reinforcements for the 80th Division. By midnight, six Chinese regiments renewed their attacks and Zhan Danan, {{the commander}} of the 80th Division, ordered the complete destruction of RCT-31 before dawn. Again, the 57th Battalion's AA guns held the Chinese at bay, but the shell supplies were running desperately <b>low.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> day of 1 December, Faith finally ordered RCT-31 to breakout from Sinhung-ni and withdraw to Hagaru-ri.|$|E

5|$|The American group The Black Eyed Peas has {{released}} six studio albums, two compilation albums, one extended play, twenty-one singles, and two video albums. Interscope Records released the band's debut album, Behind the Front, in the United States in June 1998. Although the album received a four-star review from AllMusic, it charted <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard 200 in the United States {{and on the}} French Albums Chart, at numbers 129 and 149 respectively. The band's second album, Bridging the Gap, was released in 2000 and peaked at number sixty-seven in the US and reached its highest position in New Zealand, at number eighteen.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|The album has {{received}} a mixed reception from music critics; many aplauded the album itself, while some did not like another bubblegum pop musician. Despite the mixed critical reaction, Kylie was a worldwide success. It peaked at number one in three countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Japan, and it produced three number one singles in Australia. In North America, the album peaked <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard charts, yet still managed to sell over 500,000 copies and was certified gold. In Australia, the album was re-issued as The Kylie Collection also in 1988, {{as well as a}} VHS video in Australia and featuring bonus remixes. Kylie was certified seven times platinum in the UK and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Tragic Kingdom {{was first}} {{released}} by Trauma and Interscope on October 10, 1995. The album {{did not appear}} on the Billboard 200 chart until {{the first week of}} January 1996. To promote the album, Trauma launched a street campaign that targeted high school students and the skateboarding community. No Doubt performed on the Warped Tour, which was sponsored by several skateboarding companies, and at several skateboarding festivals. The album remained <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard 200 and did not enter the top 100 until February 1996, when it jumped 27 positions to number 89. Palmer attributed the jump to a Channel One News program that Stefani hosted in January 1996, which was broadcast in 12,000 classrooms, and the band's subsequent performance at a Blockbuster store in Fresno, California.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene {{was a short}} lived, {{pre-season}} {{tropical storm}} which made landfall on the central Louisiana coastline on May 30, 1959, causing minor damages and one fatality. Arlene developed out of a tropical wave which was first noted near the Dominican Republic on May 23. Development of the system was slow before it gained enough convection to be declared Tropical Storm Arlene on May 28. The storm slowly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h) on May 30. Rapid weakening took place as the storm neared land and Arlene made landfall with winds of 45mph (75km/h) later that night. Arlene weakened {{to what is now}} classified as a Tropical Depression early the next morning. The system degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of May 31 and fully dissipated late on June 2 while located over South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Strickland and Melville {{established}} that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high {{in relation to the}} beak, and the nostril was located <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion {{to the rest of the}} cranium.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting <b>low</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
