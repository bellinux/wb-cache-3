2500|$|Although the {{government}} was looking to manage motor vehicle growth, potentially with a congestion charge {{as suggested by the}} Smeed Report, this was contrasted by a strong desire for dramatic cost-saving measures in nationalised public transport. Doctor Beeching's proposed closure of a third of the passenger railway <b>lines,</b> the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> tramways and trolleybuses and shunning of light rail, with bus services offering a partial replacement, all emphasised the widely held expectation that [...] "progress" [...] would see an increasing dependency on private motor cars. This represented a departure from the previous policies set by the Salter Report of 1933, which looked to balance the needs of railways against motor vehicles.|$|R

40|$|STI 571 induces {{sustained}} hematologic remission {{in patients}} with chronic my-eloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. However, in advanced phases, especially blast crisis, the leukemia usually be-comes resistant within months. It has been investigated whether resistance to STI 571 is stable and immutable or whether it can be reversed in selected CML cell <b>lines.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> STI 571 for varying lengths of time from cultures <b>of</b> 3 resis-tant <b>lines</b> (K 562 -r, KCL 22 -r, and Baf/BCR-ABL–r 1) did not restore sensitivity to the inhibitor. In contrast, LAMA 84 -resistant cells experienced a sharp reduction in survival and proliferation {{during the first week}} <b>of</b> STI 571 <b>withdrawal</b> but recovered thereafter. Moreover, when left off the inhibitor for 2 months or longer, this cell line reacquired sensitivity to STI 571. It is hypothesized, therefore, that patients who have become resistant to the drug may respond again if STI 571 therapy is tempo-rarily interrupted.

5|$|According to the plan, {{the main}} forces of Army Group Narwa had to {{withdraw}} mainly through Viljandi and Pärnu to Riga. In {{order to do}} that, II Army Corps at the Emajõgi front and XXVIII Army Corps at the Väike Emajõgi had to keep the front line stable until the Army Detachment had passed behind them. Officially, {{the beginning of the}} operation was supposed to be September 19. The retreat was to be gradual, over several <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> resistance. The <b>withdrawal</b> was to be backed mainly by the units consisting of Estonians, who, by the estimates of the German army command, would not have wanted to leave Estonia anyway. A naval force under Vice-Admiral Theodor Burchardi began evacuating elements of the German formations along with some civilians on 17 September. The headquarters prepared a detailed plan to leave their positions at the Narva front on the night of 18–19 September.|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{withdrawing}} life sustaining therapy from patients with acute illnesses. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe this experience for families participating in the process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life sustaining therapy from a family member with an unexpected, life threatening illness or injury. Using a family symbolic interactionism theoretical framework and a hermeneutic phenomenological perspective, this study sought to answer the question: What do families experience during the process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life sustaining therapy from a family member with an unexpected, life threatening illness or injury? ^ Van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) phenomenological method of qualitative research was used. This method allowed the researcher and the family members to mutually commit to describing the phenomenon being studied. Interviews were conducted with family members and observation techniques were employed. Multiple interviews and observations occurred over a period of days to weeks as families participated in the process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life sustaining therapy. Four critical care units of a metropolitan medical center were used for data collection. Theoretical purposive sampling was used to obtain families with a variety of experiences. Nineteen families and 56 family members were included in the study. Families were enrolled into the study until data saturation was reached. All interview transcripts and field notes were transcribed. Units of meaning, clusters, then categories were inductively determined from each <b>line</b> <b>of</b> recorded data. Within and across case analyses were conducted. Methodological rigor was established. ^ The study found that the family experience involves a variety of dimensions including personal issues within the family, family issues specifically related to having an ill or injured family member with a life threatening illness or injury, family issues with health care providers, family issues with the health care system, and bioethical issues. Five qualitatively distinct styles of family management were evident in this sample of families and were the overarching ways in which families participated in the process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life sustaining therapy: progressing, accommodating, maintaining, struggling, and floundering. The results of this study have important implications for future research and clinical practice regarding <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> life sustaining therapy. ...|$|R

50|$|It was {{generally}} accepted {{on both sides}} that the Comanches were superior cavalrymen at the time. The choice of weapons available to them to use while mounted, namely their short bows and wooden lances, were best employed upon the Great Plains. The preferred terrain was the rolling, wide-open hills of the prairie. Comanches did utilize ambushes, but invariably the ambush involved attacking from horseback from behind a thicket of trees or somewhere that allowed men and horses to remain concealed. However, these particular conditions were clearly impossible all the time--Texan vistas are often quite long and flat and do not offer an abundance of places to hide. The last place that Comanches would set an ambush {{would be at the}} end of a pass which affords the Comanche's victim a clear <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Logically, the Comanche would favor a wide-open portion of the Great Plains or Llano Estacado, which would mean that the Comanches could attack from any direction.|$|E

More men were killed and wounded as they tried to board the landing craft under the enemy's withering fire. Almost miraculously five landing craft and one tank landing craft managed to rescue men from the shallows and cleared the beach with full loads.
