The aerosol optical thickness (AOT), which infers the aerosol burden, {{is used to}} measure the satellite monitoring capabilities. AOT products retrieved from POLDER on low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> and products from a radiometric instrument (MODIS) on high and low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> are presented for comparison. Our study reveals that for high aerosol days, the monitoring capability of the polarized instrument is lower than that of the traditional instrument. The accuracy of matched POLDER fine-AOTs is lower than that of MODIS-matched AOTs. On low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> the performance of the polarized instrument is good when monitoring the aerosol optical thickness. Further analysis reveals that for the high aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> the mean relative errors of matched POLDER fine AOTs and MODIS AOTs with respect to AERONET measurements are 44 % and 16 %, respectively. For the low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> the mean relative errors of POLDER and MODIS measurements with respect to AERONET measurements are 41 % and 40 %, respectively. During high aerosol days, POLDER-retrieved fine-AOTs reveal a poor accuracy with only 14 % of matches falling within the error range, which is nearly one fourth of the MODIS regression results (51. 59 %). For the low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> the POLDER regression results are good. Approximately 62 % of the POLDER measurements fall within the expected error range ±(0. 05 + 15 %) compared with the AERONET observed values...|$|E
40|$|It {{is crucial}} to ensure an {{adequate}} nutritional support for young soccer players under high physical stress situations, including match days and high training <b>load</b> <b>days.</b> Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the dietary intake of young male soccer players from a Portuguese first league soccer club, both on match day and on the highest training <b>load</b> <b>day</b> of the week. All players recorded their ingestion at these moments for 3 consecutive weeks, by completing a food diary and making a photographic record. On match day, the intake of carbohydrates (5. 2 ± 0. 6 g. kg- 1. d- 1), proteins (2. 1 ± 0. 2 g. kg- 1. d- 1), and fats (1. 0 ± 0. 2 g. kg- 1. d- 1) represented 55. 1 ± 5. 0 %, 22. 3 ± 1. 52 %, and 23. 9 ± 5. 1 %, respectively, of the average daily energy intake. Regarding the highest training <b>load</b> <b>day,</b> the intake of carbohydrates (5. 2 ± 0. 9 g. kg- 1. d- 1), proteins (2. 0 ± 0. 3 g. kg- 1. d- 1), and fats (1. 0 ± 0. 3 g. kg- 1. d- 1) represented 54. 8 ± 5. 3 %, 21. 8 ± 1. 8 %, and 24. 6 ± 4. 6 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — Load {{forecasting}} is very {{essential to}} the operation of electricity companies. It enhances the energy-efficient and reliable operation of a power system. This paper presents a study of short-term load forecasting using neuro-fuzzy approach to electric load forecasting. The neuro-fuzzy is used to learn the relationship among past, current and future temperatures and loads. In order to provide the forecasted load, the neuro-fussy interpolates among the load and temperature data in a training data set. We analyze the problem domain and choose the most adequate set of attributes in our model. To obtain the best performance in prediction we follow an experimental approach analysing the entire neuro-fuzzy technique. The main stages are the pre-processing of the data sets, network training, and forecasting. The inputs used for the neural network are the previous hour <b>load,</b> previous <b>day</b> <b>load,</b> previous week <b>load,</b> <b>day</b> of the week, and hour of the day.

The FSU were axially loaded (200, 1, 000, 1, 500 - 2, 000 N) within a custom made radiolucent, saline filled loading device. At each loading step, FSUs were scanned using the micro-CT. Endplate heights were determined using custom software. No significant increase in endplate deformation following cement augmentation was noted for the adjacent endplate (P > 0. 05). The deformation of the augmented endplate was significantly reduced following cement augmentation for both the prophylactic and fracture group (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01, respectively). Endplate deformation of the controls showed no statistically significant differences between <b>loading</b> on <b>day</b> 1 and day 2. A linear relationship was noted between the applied compressive load and endplate deflection (R (2) = 0. 58). Evidence of significant endplate deformation differences between unaugmented and augmented FSU, while evident for the augmented endplate, was not present for the adjacent endplate.

There are 38 participants willing to join to the study. Their ages are between 20 and 27. All of them are choosed from active athletes. From the findings of this study; all the participants’ in the creatin group have increased the total workout production in all cycles of isokinetic exercise. The difference between the values in the first and fifth cycles, (both before and after loading) are statistically significant. In the creatin group the difference between before loading and 15 th day values are statistically significant. But the difference between before loading and 50 th day values does not have statistical difference. In placebo group, before and after values in all 5 cycles, there is no statistical difference between the total workout production values. There is also no statistical difference between the before loading and 15 th day values. As the same there is no statistical difference between the before loading and the 50 th day values. The most important finding in this study is that, there is no affect of long term creatin <b>loading</b> (50 <b>days)</b> on maximal voluntary knee extansion, as a total muscle workout values.

Occurring on special days, such as public holidays, anomalous load conditions pose considerable modeling challenges due to their infrequent occurrence and significant deviation from normal load. To overcome these limitations, we adopt a rule-based approach, which allows incorporation of prior expert knowledge of load profiles into the statistical model. We use triple seasonal Holt-Winters-Taylor (HWT) exponential smoothing, triple seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARMA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and triple seasonal intraweek singular value decomposition (SVD) based exponential smoothing. These {{methods have been}} shown to be competitive for modeling <b>load</b> for normal <b>days.</b> The methodological contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how these methods can be adapted to model <b>load</b> for special <b>days,</b> when used in conjunction with a rule-based approach.

A combination of two rule-based methods generated the most accurate forecasts. Comment: 8 Pages, 11 Figure...|$|R
