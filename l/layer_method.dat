40|$|Abstract. Based on {{appropriate}} numerical {{constitutive model}} of lightweight aggregate concrete filled steel tubes (LCFST), <b>layered</b> <b>method</b> was adopted {{to predict the}} complete moment-curvature curves of LCFST composite section subjected to pure bending. A FORTRAN program for the moment-curvature curves was developed. Applying the <b>layered</b> <b>method,</b> the influences of the significant parameters, such as steel ratio, yield strength of steel and strength of lightweight aggregate concrete on the moment-curvature curves of the composite section subjected to pure bending were discussed. The practical composite flexural stiffness, ultimate moment and practical moment-curvature relationship of LCFST composite section were presented. The predicted results of both <b>layered</b> <b>method</b> and practical moment-curvature relationships of LCFST composite section are in good agreement with the test results from reference. Compared with the <b>layered</b> <b>method,</b> practical calculate method could remove the step of composite section layered and improve the calculation speed while achieving similar results...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{pre-processing}} {{of multiple}} access systems {{with large numbers}} of concurrent active channels, such as asynchronous high-density CDMA systems or high-bit rate multiple antenna systems, is used to decrease de-coding complexity and transform the multiple access channel into a set of parallel single-user channels. This is known as layering. The linear filters most often con-sidered are decorrelation and MMSE filters, both of which have a computational complexity which is qubic {{in the size of the}} filters. A new non-linear <b>layering</b> <b>method</b> based on iterative decoding of coded multiple access systems is introduced and the information theo-retic capacities of these different <b>layering</b> <b>methods</b> are studied.

5000|$|The CFOP (Cross - F2L - OLL - PLL) method, {{also known}} as the Fridrich Method, was named after one of its inventors, Jessica Fridrich, who {{finished}} second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to David Singmaster, {{who was one of the}} first to publish a layer by <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> of solving in 1980, and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L). Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997, an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as [...] "corner-edge pairs" [...] or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps — first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer).|$|E

40|$|Many speech coding {{standards}} {{are based upon}} code-excited linear prediction (CELP), and it is desirable to develop <b>layered</b> coding <b>methods</b> that are compatible with this installed base of coders. We propose a layered speech coding structure that is universally compatible with all CELP-based coders. This structure encodes the reconstruction error signal from layer 1 using a lowdelay, adaptive tree coder based upon the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. We note that rate distortion optimal successive refinement is achievable using two different distortion criteria and we derive expressions for the rate distortion function under autoregressive Gaussian assumptions on the source and the two different distortion measures. We demonstrate the universality of the approach by developing two-layer coders for a 3. 65 kbps CELP coder, G. 723. 1, and G. 729. We show that our <b>layering</b> <b>method</b> is favorably competitive with the MPEG- 4 <b>layering</b> <b>method</b> at 8. 7 kbps for both clean and noisy speech.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The finite <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> is {{the most}} {{efficient}} numerical method for 3 D analysis of simply supported rectangular plates. In this method, the plate is divided {{into a number of}} finite layers. Within each finite layer, trigonometric functions are used for the in-plane interpolations of displacements, whereas polynomials are employed for the interpolations in the thickness direction. Thus, the 3 D analysis is transformed into a series of 1 D analyses, and the efficiency is enhanced significantly. In the present study, the finite <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> is extended to the stability analysis of piezoelectric antisymmetric angle-ply laminates, which may be also combined with some symmetrical cross-plies. Numerical results are presented to verify the proposed method. The effects of side-to-thickness ratio, aspect ratio, number of plies, fiber-orientation, and electrical conditions on stability behaviors of some piezoelectric lami-nates are investigated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{numerical}} analysis of elastic wave propagation in unbounded media {{may be difficult}} due to spurious waves reflected at the model artificial boundaries. This point is critical {{for the analysis of}} wave propagation in heterogeneous or layered solids. Various techniques such as Absorbing Boundary Conditions, infinite elements or Absorbing Boundary Layers (e. g. Perfectly Matched Layers) lead to an important reduction of such spurious reflections. In this paper, a simple absorbing <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> is proposed: it is based on a Rayleigh/Caughey damping formulation which is often already available in existing Finite Element softwares. The principle of the Caughey Absorbing <b>Layer</b> <b>Method</b> is first presented (including a rheological interpretation). The efficiency of the method is then shown through 1 D Finite Element simulations considering homogeneous and heterogeneous damping in the absorbing layer. 2 D models are considered afterwards to assess the efficiency of the absorbing <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> for various wave types and incidences. A comparison with the PML method is first performed for pure P-waves and the method is shown to be reliable in a more complex 2 D case involving various wave types and incidences. It may thus be used for various types of problems involving elastic waves (e. g. machine vibrations, seismic waves, etc) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} and positivity-preserving <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> is introduced {{to solve the}} radiation belt diffusion equation and is applied to study the bounce resonance interaction between relativistic electrons and magnetosonic waves. The <b>layer</b> <b>method</b> with linear interpolation, denoted by LM-L (layer method-linear), {{requires the use of}} a large number of grid points to ensure accurate solutions. We introduce a monotonicity- and positivity-preserving cubic interpolation method to be used with the Milstein-Tretyakov <b>layer</b> <b>method.</b> The resulting method, called LM-MC (layer method-monotone cubic), can be used to solve the radiation belt diffusion equation with a much smaller number of grid points than LM-L while still being able to preserve the positivity of the solution. We suggest that LM-MC can be used to study long-term dynamics of radiation belts. We then develop a 2 -D LM-MC code and use it to investigate the bounce resonance diffusion of radiation belt electrons by magnetosonic waves. Using a previously published magnetosonic wave model, we demonstrate that bounce resonance with magnetosonic waves is as important as gyroresonance; both can cause several orders of magnitude increase of MeV electron fluxes within 1 ﾠday. We conclude that bounce resonance with magnetosonic waves should be taken into consideration together with gyroresonance...|$|E
