40|$|Phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) {{based on}} organic small {{molecules}} offer a {{great potential for}} a variety of future applications. In terms of efficiency PHOLEDs can already compete with conventional light sources. However, PHOLEDs typically suffer from a steady decrease in efficiency at high current densities, known as efficiency roll-off. One of the reasons for this is the high probability for triplet-triplet quenching processes. On the one hand these processes happen due to the long lifetime of the triplet phosphors {{and on the other hand}} due to the high triplet density in the rather narrow recombination zone in common OLED heterostructures. One approach to minimize this roll-off is to introduce a mixed host structure in the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>layer.</b> This is done by mixing one mostly hole-transporting material and one mostly electron-transporting material with each other. In the first part of this thesis, the characteristics of PHOLEDs with a conventional heterostructure, a uniformly mixed host structure and a graded mixed host structure were studied in detail. PHOLEDs with a graded mixed structure showed an increased quantum efficiency, a reduced efficiency roll-off and a longer lifetime compared to them with conventional heterostructure. These effects are attributed to the broadening of the recombination zone and a better charge balance inside the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>layer.</b> Existing techniques for the detection of intermixing are very expensive and time consuming. In the second part of this thesis, it was tested whether impedance spectroscopy can be used as a suitable and cheap tool to measure the degree of intermixing between two layers.

Annealing at 100 °C resulted in inferior device performance.
