40|$|The {{influence}} of SO 2, H 2 S and COS in low concentrations on the deactivation of PURh/BaO/Al 2 O 3 NOx storage catalysts was investigated. Different {{samples of the}} catalyst were exposed to synthetic gas mixtures mimicking lean/rich engine cycling in a mixed lean application at 400 degreesC. The <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> contained 8 vol. % O 2, 500 vol-ppm C 3 H 6 and 400 vol-ppm NO balanced to 100 vol. % with Ar. The rich excursions were performed by switching off the oxygen supply.

Spray growth, vaporization are studied using Schlieren and Mie scattering experiments. The Schlieren set-up is also used for registration of light emitted by the combustion process; this can also provide information on ignition delay and on soot lift-off length.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of oxygen {{concentration}} {{and the presence of}} water on methane oxidation were examined over a Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The physicochemical properties of the catalyst were investigated in detail using BET, XRD, STEM, O- 2 -TPO and CH 4 -TPR. Ramping experiments from 150 to 700 degrees C were conducted using rich, stoichiometric and <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> in the absence and presence of water. It was found that increasing the oxygen concentration in a dry atmosphere resulted in higher methane oxidation activity, which can be connected to the facilitation of palladium oxide formation. The TPO data showed that only minor amounts of PdO up to 700 degrees C were decomposed; however, in the stoichiometric and rich reaction mixture, PdO was still decomposed because of the oxygen limitation. This fact resulted in a "negative activation" during cooling, with increased activity because of palladium re-oxidation. Moreover, methane steam reforming and water gas shift reactions were important reactions under rich conditions over the metallic palladium sites. A significant inhibiting effect of water on the Pd-catalyst with loss of methane activity was found. Interestingly, the inhibition effect was much greater using high oxygen concentration in the <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> (500 ppm CH 4, 8 % O- 2, 5 % H 2 O) than that at lower oxygen levels (800 - 1200 ppm) and we propose that the hydroxyl species formation, which blocks the active sites, are facilitated by a large oxygen excess. In addition, the re-oxidation of palladium occurring during the cooling ramp in dry feed using rich and stoichiometric <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> was also significantly suppressed {{in the presence of a}} large amount of water. Thus, water impedes the oxidation of palladium, which significantly deactivates the Pd catalyst...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{demand for}} natural gas is {{increasing}} since recent climate change. Natural gas is considered an abundant energy source with low greenhouse-gas emissions. A natural gas engine usually operates in lean-burn mode to gain the advantage of high thermal efficiency and low nitrogen oxides emission. A problem typically associated with natural <b>gas</b> combustion in <b>lean</b> mode is poor ignitability. The objective {{of this study is}} to improve ignitability of <b>lean</b> natural <b>gas</b> combustion using gas-jet ignition method. Several experiments were done using a confined volume chamber apparatus. Images of the combustion flame were captured using a high speed camera, and hydrocarbon emissions were measured. The result showed that the gas-jet ignition method is effective in improving ignitability of <b>lean</b> natural <b>gas</b> <b>mixture.</b> An addition of 30 % hydrogen gas to the natural gas fuel improves both the ignitability and further flame propagation, thus lowering the hydrocarbon emission...|$|R
40|$|The Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) at the Combustion Laboratory at the Institute of Marine Technology has shown: (I) Temperature {{related issues}} that reduce {{reproducibility}} within test series. (II) The environment the vessel can simulate is not satisfactory {{in terms of}} density. Previous results and observation {{with the use of}} a high-speed camera indicates that the CVCC has an inhomogeneous temperature field. This is due to unsymmetrical heat loss to the wall after pre-combustion, which is used to chemically heat the CVCC to reach the engine-like conditions. The CVCC can run up to a maximum of 100 [bar], which directly affects how much of the gas used for pre-combustion can be injected. The amount of the <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> that the old ignition system was capable of igniting cannot be increased substantially without reaching the pressure limit. These issues were investigated in this present work by installing two types of ignition systems that both aimed to initiate a more symmetrical pre-combustion and to ignite <b>leaner</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> for the pre-combustion. The conventional inductive ignition system from Motortech has a dual spark configuration and an alternative ignition system using Corona Discharge made by Øystein Smith and fellow students at the Omega Workshop at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU). The experiment we conducted on the conventional ignition system indicated a higher maximum pressure level and a faster pre-combustion with a dual spark plug configuration compared to a single spark plug configuration, which could reduce the temperature gradient, but further experimentation is necessary to conclude on this issue. The system indicated an improved capability to ignite lean mixtures, during experiments where the volume fraction of Carbon Monoxide (CO) was reduced when the GMB was further pressurized with Nitrogen gas (N 2). The corona discharge ignition system has promising properties as a symmetrical ignition source to address both issues presented. The challenge is to introduce the voltage into the CVCC without reaching the dielectric strength of the insulating material surrounding the conducting electrode. This would generate an arc between the electrode and the grounded CVCC. The initial experiments we conducted resulted in spark discharge and not corona discharge with all developed electrodes. Further development on the electrodes and a more controllable signal to drive the corona driver is necessary to get this ignition system working properly...|$|R

The SI engine test fuelled with simulated producer gas, {{natural gas and}} simulated biogas with variable value of excess air ratio has been done. The experiments were carried out on the petrol engine with a low engine displacement. Typical SI engine was selected in order to evaluate the potential application of gaseous fuel (i. e. producer gas, natural gas or biogas). These types of engines are available on a wide scale and commonly used in automotive sector because of the low purchase price and operating costs.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{a series of}} cobalt spinel {{catalysts}} was synthesized by different methods and doped with 1 wt. % of palladium via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) or solution combustion synthesis (SCS). Both undoped and Pd-doped spinels were characterized from the structural and surface point of view (XRD, XRF, μRS, BET, FESEM) and tested toward the oxidation of methane in <b>lean</b> conditions, in <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> containing from 0. 5 to 2 vol. % of CH 4.

The temperature window for the catalytic activity of the undoped Co 3 O 4 materials spread from 350 to 600 °C. The preparation method affected the catalytic activity of undoped Co 3 O 4, with the best catalytic activity related to the spinel prepared by SCS employing urea. The addition of 1 wt. % of Pd lowered the temperature window for the catalytic activity to the range of 250 - 500 °C, with insignificant differences for the various preparation methods.

The temperature window for the catalytic activity of the undoped mixed iron-cobalt spinels spread from 350 to 650 °C. While lower iron substitution levels lead to {{a decrease in the}} spinel's activity, the catalyst with 2 / 3 of the cobalt in the Co 3 O 4 substituted with iron shows similar activity to the parent Co 3 O 4. Although the materials were proved to be heterogeneous from the crystal phase point of view (a mixture of cobalt-iron spinels), the observed reactivity still depends on the amount of iron introduced during the synthesis. The addition of Pd lowered the temperature window for the catalytic activity to the range of 250 - 550 °C. The promoting effect of Pd is most evident for the pure Co 3 O 4 catalyst. In contrast to the Pd-free catalysts, the best activity of Pd-promoted samples was observed for the catalysts with the highest iron content...|$|R
