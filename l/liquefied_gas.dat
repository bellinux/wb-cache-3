25|$|For a {{particularly}} bright display, pyrotechnic compounds and even burning metals have been used. Since the Munich Games of 1972, most torches have instead used a <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> such as propylene or a propane/butane mixture. These are easily stored, easily controlled {{and give a}} brightly luminous flame. The number of torches made has varied from, for example, 22 for Helsinki in 1952, 6,200 for the 1980 Moscow Games and 8,000 for the London 2012 Games.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} infrastructure needed for LNG production and transportation is an LNG plant consisting {{of one or}} more LNG trains, each of which is an independent unit for gas liquefaction. The largest LNG train now in operation is in Qatar. These facilities recently reached a safety milestone, completing 12 years of operations on its offshore facilities without a Lost Time Incident. Until recently it was the Train4 of Atlantic LNG in Trinidad and Tobago with a production capacity of 5.2 million metric ton per annum (mmtpa), followed by the SEGAS LNG plant in Egypt with a capacity of 5mmtpa. In July 2014, Atlantic LNG celebrated its 3000th cargo of LNG at the company’s liquefaction facility in Trinidad. The QatargasII plant has a production capacity of 7.8mmtpa for each of its two trains. LNG sourced from Qatargas II will be supplied to Kuwait, following the signing of an agreement in May 2014 between Qatar <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gas</b> Company and Kuwait Petroleum Corp. LNG is loaded onto ships and delivered to a regasification terminal, where the LNG is allowed to expand and reconvert into gas. Regasification terminals are usually connected to a storage and pipeline distribution network to distribute natural gas to local distribution companies (LDCs) or independent power plants (IPPs).|$|E

40|$|This study {{endeavors to}} {{determine}} whether farmers adjust their consumption of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> in response {{to changes in the}} unit price of energy. A demand model is specified and estimated. The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} load a gas as {{a sample of}} {{pressure}} transmitting medium, the gas must be in a dense state, as to not shrink the sample chamber once pressure is induced. To achieve a dense state, gases can be liquefied at low temperatures or compressed. Cryogenic loading is a technique that uses <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> {{as a means of}} filling the sample chamber. The DAC is directly immersed into the cryogenic fluid that fills the sample chamber. However, there are disadvantages to cryogenic loading. With the low temperatures indicative of cryogenic loading, the sample is subjected to temperatures that could irreversibly change it. Also, the boiling liquid could displace the sample or trap an air bubble in the chamber. It is not possible to load gas mixtures using the cryogenic method due to the different boiling points of most gases. Gas compression technique densifys the gases at room temperature. With this method, most of the problems seen with cryogenic loading are fixed. Also, loading gas mixtures becomes a possibility. The technique uses a vessel or chamber in which the DAC is placed and is filled with gas. Gases are pressurized and pumped into the vessel with a compressor. Once the vessel is filled and the desired pressure is reached the DAC is closed with a clamp system run by motor driven screws.|$|E

60|$|The Earl of Carbury was a youngish {{man with}} no sort of turn for being a nobleman. He could {{not bring himself to}} behave as if he was anybody in particular; and though this passed for perfect {{breeding}} whenever he by chance appeared in his place in society, on the magisterial bench, or in the House of Lords, it prevented him from making the most of the earldom, and was a standing grievance with his relatives, many of whom were the most impudent and uppish people {{on the face of the}} earth. He was, if he had only known it, a born republican, with no natural belief in earls at all; but as he was rather too modest to indulge his consciousness with broad generalizations of this kind, all he knew about the matter was that he was sensible of being a bad hand at his hereditary trade of territorial aristocrat. At a very early age he had disgraced himself by asking his mother whether he might be a watchmaker when he grew up, and his feeble sense on that occasion of the impropriety of an earl being anything whatsoever except an earl had given his mother an imperious contempt for him which afterward got curiously mixed with a salutary dread of his moral superiority to her, which was considerable. His aspiration to become a watchmaker was an early symptom of his extraordinary turn for mechanics. An apprenticeship of six years at the bench would have made an educated workman of him: as it was, he pottered at every mechanical pursuit as a gentleman amateur in a laboratory and workshop which he had got built for himself in his park. In this magazine of toys--for such it virtually was at first--he satisfied his itchings to play with tools and machines. He was no sportsman; but if he saw in a shop window the most trumpery patent improvement in a breechloader, he would go in and buy it; and as to a new repeating rifle or <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> gun, he would travel to St. Petersburg to see it. He wrote very little; but he had sixteen different typewriters, each guaranteed perfect by an American agent, who had also pledged himself that the other fifteen were miserable impostures. A really ingenious bicycle or tricycle always found in him a ready purchaser; and he had patented a roller skate and a railway brake. When the electric chair for dental operations was invented, he sacrificed a tooth to satisfy his curiosity as to its operation. He could not play brass instruments to any musical purpose; but his collection of double slide trombones, bombardons with patent compensating pistons, comma trumpets, and the like, would have equipped a small military band; whilst his newly tempered harmonium with fifty-three notes to each octave, and his pianos with simplified keyboards that nobody could play on, were the despair of all musical amateurs who came to stay at Towers Cottage, as his place was called. He would buy the most expensive and elaborate lathe, and spend a month trying to make a true billiard ball at it. At the end of that time he would have to send for a professional hand, who would cornet the ball with apparently miraculous skill in a few seconds. He got on better with chemistry and photography; but at last he settled down to electrical engineering, and, giving up the idea of doing everything with his own half-trained hand, kept a skilled man always in his laboratory to help him out.|$|E
