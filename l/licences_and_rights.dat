50|$|Swaziland {{is one of}} {{the last}} {{countries}} in the world to abolish an almost complete monopoly in all sectors of its telecommunications market. Until 2011 the state-owned operator, Swaziland Posts & Telecommunications Corporation (SPTC), also acted as the industry regulator and had a stake in the country’s sole mobile network, in partnership with South Africa’s MTN Group. In a bid to enter the mobile market independently, SPTC transferred its stake in MTN and the regulatory authority to the government. In return, Swazi MTN received a 3G <b>licence</b> <b>and</b> the <b>right</b> to provide its own backbone network and international gateway. However, proposals have been made to reinstate SPTC's monopoly on the national backbone and the international gateway, and MTN is challenging SPTC in the courts over its move into the mobile market.|$|R

Thanks to the previous existence of a second bank <b>licence</b> <b>and</b> name <b>rights,</b> the transaction was swift: the non-US business was transferred to Nettobank AG, a partner company of Wegelin & Co. with its own banking license.

The resource is structured around a model of course design: •Aims and learning outcomes •Design for learning •Delivery •Assessment •Evaluation Learning goals and models of pedagogy are looked at in terms of underpinning the design of practical work (at both programme and module levels) that is effective in promoting student learning. Good practice in laboratory teaching, assessment, alternative approaches and ways of ensuring that delivery is accessible to disabled students are considered.

500|$|When {{the public}} {{performance}} ban was lifted at the Restoration {{of the monarchy}} in 1660, Charles II immediately encouraged the drama and took a personal interest in the scramble for acting <b>licences</b> <b>and</b> performance <b>rights</b> which followed. Two middle-aged pre-Commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during Charles' exile emerged from the struggle with royal Letters Patent for new, or refurbished, patent theatre companies: Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant. Killigrew {{was able to take}} over Michael Mohun's skilled veteran troupe for his [...] "King's Company" [...] and to start with [...] "what was essentially a going concern" [...] (Hume), with the added advantage of the traditional performance rights Mohun brought with him for practically the whole classic repertory of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the Beaumont and Fletcher team. The competition, Davenant's [...] "Duke's Company", seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young, scratched-together troupe and scarcely any performance rights. They were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of Shakespeare plays, and a few that Davenant had written. However, Davenant, [...] "a brilliant impresario" [...] (Hume), was soon able to turn the tables on Killigrew by realising his old pre-Civil War dream of music, dance, and spectacular visual effects on the public stage.|$|R

Staff development and training are also highlighted. The booklet ends with a suggestion for evaluation and guidelines for implementing successful personal tutor systems. Being an academic advisor or personal tutor can be a challenging experience within any academic career.

50|$|In October 1980 Florence Bjelke-Petersen {{was elected}} to the Senate as a National Party member and six weeks later Joh won his fifth {{successive}} state election as premier, with the Nationals converting a 27.9 percent primary vote—their highest ever—into 35 of the parliament's 82 seats, or 43 percent of seats. It also created a record 13-seat lead over their coalition partners, the Liberals, who had campaigned by offering Queenslanders an alternative style of moderate government. The Nationals picked up all four Gold Coast seats and all those on the Sunshine Coast. Once again the premier took advantage of his party's dominance over the Liberals in Cabinet, this time demanding that the seven Liberal ministers sign a coalition agreement in which they promised unquestioned allegiance to Cabinet decisions. The move turned the Nationals' 35 votes to a guaranteed majority of 42 in the House, effectively neutralising any potential opposition by the 15 Liberal backbenchers. Bjelke-Petersen began making appointments, including judges and the chairmanship of the Totalisator Agency Board, that had traditionally been the domain of Liberal ministers, and accusations arose of political interference and conflicts of interest as mining contracts, casino <b>licences</b> <b>and</b> the <b>rights</b> to build shopping complexes were awarded to business figures with National Party links.

40|$|This policy brief {{discusses}} {{the role of}} ‘rights’ in water use and water trade {{in the context of}} climate change. Abstraction <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> their ownership are related to water ‘commons’ <b>and</b> traditional riparian <b>rights.</b> When the demand for water (including water for the environment) exceeds the available supply in some regions, {{there is a need to}} encourage trade both in water <b>licence</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> in bulk water. This position has been reached in England and Wales and the problems are likely to increase in coming years and decades. The policy brief presents the implications of this for the definition and operation of property rights in water, including options for abstraction licence reform. The policy brief concludes with a discussion of a model which redefines water abstraction rights in terms of percentage shares of available water rather than in physical units. The ‘water shares’ approach to water pricing and trade has become arguably the leading option for abstraction reform. An abstraction mechanism of this type can make a major contribution to commodifying the use of water while ensuring sufficient water for ‘the environment’. By providing secure property <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> ensuring that trade reflects security, water <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> water trading are not just reconciled but can reinforce one another. </p...|$|R
