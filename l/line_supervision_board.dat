40|$|The {{performance}} and accountability of {{boards of directors}} and effectiveness of governance mechanisms {{continue to be a}} matter of concern. Focusing on differences between conventional banks and Islamic banks, we examine the effect of (i) Shari-ah <b>supervision</b> <b>boards,</b> (ii) board structure and (iii) CEO-power on performance during the period 2005 - 2011. We find Shari'ah <b>supervision</b> <b>boards</b> positively impact on Islamic banks' performance when they perform a supervisory role, but the impact is negligible when they have only an advisory role. The effect of board structure (Board size and board independence) and CEO power (CEO-chair duality and internally recruited CEO) on the performance of Islamic banks is overall negative. Our findings provide support for the positive contribution of Shari'ah <b>supervision</b> <b>boards</b> overall negative. Our findings provide support for the positive contribution of Shari'ah <b>supervision</b> <b>boards</b> overall negative. Our findings provide support for the positive contribution of Shari'ah <b>supervision</b> <b>boards</b> but also emphasize the need for enforcement and regulatory mechanism for them to be more effective...|$|R

25|$|In 2006-07 nine {{small towns}} (between 5,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) across Peru {{introduced}} a new water and sanitation management model, under which the community is being more empowered, including through deciding themselves about {{a certain level of}} service quality, such as low-cost technologies, and corresponding tariffs. Subsequently the municipality hires a specialized operator who is being regulated by a Community <b>Supervision</b> <b>Board</b> under a Public-Private-Social Partnership. The specialized operator can be a private or a mixed company. The aim of the new approach was to break with the low-level equilibrium of poor service quality and poor cost recovery that prevails throughout small towns in Peru, under which poor quality water services are provided directly by the municipality. The new approach was supported through the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) of the Ministry of Housing, with technical support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and financial support of US$ 6.6 million from the Canadian International Development Agency for limited infrastructure investments and training for both the operator and members of the Community <b>Supervision</b> <b>Boards.</b> After the municipal elections of 2007, 3 new mayors decided to abandon the new approach and to return to the old model of direct municipal management. In the 6 other cities specialized operators continue to operate.|$|R

Since someyears ago, Bank Indonesia had decided that the target of monetary policy was only to keep inflation, knowninflation targeting. This policy had a strong point because BI could focus in keeping economic stability. However, the weakness of this policy was its tendency not to be adaptive with national economic situation,such as poverty and unemployment problems. Anyway, BI independence also gave a good benefit because BIcould formulate a policy as needed without any intervention from other interest, like politic. However, in theimplementation, the independence should not come into management, including monetary policy management. This was the important thing in giving a chance for BSBI (<b>Supervision</b> <b>Board</b> of Bank Indonesia) towatch BI, including monetary policy, without disturbing BI independence in formulating a policy.

This research focuses on the regulations issued by DSN-MUI and their implementation regarding IKBS IKNBS, as well as DPS as the one having the authority to supervise every sharia-based finance industry. This was a normative research, which searches for data in the form of books and other written data which have correlation with the research object by using descriptive-analytic approach.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of China’s corporate governance reforms in the year 2002 on firm performance. Specifically, the study investigates the relationship between good firm performance and board characteristics that capture boards’ monitoring and resource provision abilities {{before and after the}} corporate governance reform. This study firstly examines whether the Chinese corporate governance reform in year 2002 has caused changes in board characteristics, then the study relates the measurements for good firm performance to board characteristics that represent boards’ monitoring role (i. e., director independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director share ownership) and resource provision role (i. e., board size, directors on multiple board, director tenure, and frequency of <b>supervision</b> <b>board</b> meetings). The study uses a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to calculate a firm economic efficiency score as the main measurement of firm performance. For sensitivity analysis, traditional measurements including share returns, return on assets and Tobin’s Q have also been applied to consolidate the findings. The study provides evidence that China’s corporate governance reforms in year 2002 has resulted in changes regarding to the number of independent directors on board, CEO-chair duality, director tenure and frequency of <b>supervision</b> <b>board</b> meetings. Those changes are towards enhancing investor protection and improving firm performance, which the evidence is consistent with the prediction that the year 2002 corporate governance reforms will change the corporate governance factors of Chinese listed firms. However, inconsistent with the agency theory and resource dependence theory predictions, this study shows that board characteristics do not have a significant relationship with firm economic efficiency score. The additional tests of using traditional performance measurements also shows corporate governance factors before and after the reform do not influence firm performance. These findings point to a significant problem. It would seem that China’s corporate governance reform in year 2002 has made Chinese listed firms simply obeys the governance code, rather than fully utilise it. Therefore, the corporate governance reform in the year 2002 has enhanced the corporate governance factors, however failed to improve firm performance. Therefore, the findings have implications for regulators in emerging economies, that the corporate governance code should be developed and modified based on the specific characteristics of a countries economy, rather than simply following the developed countries’ regulatory system...|$|R
