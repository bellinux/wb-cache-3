60|$|What troubled {{her more}} a thousandfold, however, were her fears for Leo.

It was true he was sleeping in wet clothes, but the night was now so warm that I thought (and so did Job) that they were not likely to injure a man of his unusually vigorous constitution.

25|$|Despite {{his defeat}} at the Battle of Chalons in 451, Attila invaded Italy in 452, sacking {{cities such as}} Aquileia and heading for Rome. He {{allegedly}} demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent {{to him with a}} dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: Gennadius Avienus, one of the consuls of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former urban prefect, and <b>Leo.</b> <b>Little</b> is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy. According to Prosper of Aquitaine who was alive {{at the time of the}} event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew. Another near-contemporary was the historian Priscus who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king Alaric, who died shortly after sacking the city in 410. Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.|$|R
