5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.|$|E

60|$|Some of {{the people}} and animals was partly covered with sand, but most of them not, for the sand was thin there, and the bed was gravel and hard.

60|$|The Scotchman {{started up}} from the table; the doctor shrank from the bedside. The two looked at the dying wretch, {{mastered}} by the same loathing, chilled by the same dread.

6000|$|Well, {{it being}} {{away in the}} night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> so mournful and lonesome {{in the middle of the}} river.

6000|$|... "Then I {{thought you}} prayed for me--and I could {{see you and}} hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote {{on a piece of}} {{sycamore}} bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being pirates,' {{and put it on the}} table by the candle; and then you looked so good, <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{about three}} in the morning I fetched Elexandria and see this {{stern-wheeler}} <b>laying</b> <b>there,</b> and was very glad, because I felt perfectly safe, now, you know. It was just daybreak. I went aboard and got this stateroom and put on these clothes and went up in the pilot-house--to watch, though I didn't reckon there was any need of it. I set there and played with my di'monds and waited and waited for the boat to start, but she didn't. You see, they was mending her machinery, but I didn't know anything about it, not being very much used to steamboats.|$|E

60|$|In the estuary of the River Fal {{a splendid}} ship, on the {{building}} of which the most cunning engineers had been employed and no money spared, rode proudly at anchor just off Smithick under the very shadow of the heights crowned by the fine house of Arwenack. She was fitting out for a distant voyage and for days the work of bringing stores and munitions aboard had been in progress, {{so that there was}} an unwonted bustle about the little forge and the huddle of cottages that went to make up the fishing village, as if in earnest of the great traffic that in future days was to be seen about that spot. For Sir John Killigrew seemed at last to be on the eve of prevailing and of <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> the foundations of the fine port of his dreams.|$|E
60|$|We was out {{and gone}} {{the minute the}} rain stopped. It was just broad day then. We loafed along up the road, and now and then met a person and stopped and said howdy, and told them when we come, and how we left the folks at home, and how long we was going to stay, and all that, {{but none of them}} said a word about that thing; which was just astonishing, and no mistake. Tom said he {{believed}} if we went to the sycamores we would find that body <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> solitary and alone, and not a soul around. Said he believed the men chased the thieves so far into the woods that the thieves prob'ly seen a good chance and turned on them at last, and maybe they all killed each other, and so there wasn't anybody left to tell.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twenty or {{twenty-five years}} ago, {{one of the}} feud {{families}} caught a young man of nineteen out and killed him. Don't remember {{whether it was the}} Darnells and Watsons, or one of the other feuds; but anyway, this young man rode up--steamboat <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> at the time--and the first thing he saw was a whole gang of the enemy. He jumped down behind a wood-pile, but they rode around and begun on him, he firing back, and they galloping and cavorting and yelling and banging away with all their might. Think he wounded a couple of them; but they closed in on him and chased him into the river; and as he swum along down stream, they followed along the bank and kept on shooting at him; and when he struck shore he was dead. Windy Marshall told me about it. He saw it. He was captain of the boat.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I am now {{busy with}} Frederick the Great; I am not now {{astonished}} that Carlyle calls him Great, neither that this {{work of his}} should have had such a sad effect upon him in producing it, when I see the number of volumes {{he must have had}} to wade through to produce such a clear terse set of utterances; and yet I do not feel the work as a book likely to do a reader of it the good that some of his other books will do. It is truly awful to read these battles after battles, lies after lies, called Diplomacy; it's fearful to read all this, and one wonders how he that set himself to this--He, of all men--could have the rare patience to produce such a labored, heart-rending piece of work. Again, when one reads of the stupidity, the shameful waste of our moneys by our forefathers, to see our National Debt (the curse to our labor now, the millstone to our commerce, to our fair chance of competition in our day) thus created, and for what? Even Carlyle cannot tell; then how are we to tell? Now, who will deliver us? that is the question; who will help us in these days of idle or no work, while our foreign neighbors have plenty and are actually selling their produce to our men of capital cheaper than we can make it? House-rent getting dearer, taxes getting dearer, rates, clothing, food, etc. Sad times, my master, do seem to have fallen upon us. And the cause of nearly all this lies embedded in that Frederick; and yet, so far as I know of it, no critic has yet given an exposition of such <b>laying</b> <b>there.</b> For our behoof, is there no one that will take this, that there lies so woven in with much other stuff so sad to read, to any man that does not believe man was made to fight alone, to be a butcher of his fellow-man? Who will do this work, or piece of work, so that all who care may know how it is that our debt grew so large, and a great deal more that we ought to know?--that clearly is one great reason why the book was written and was printed. Well, I hope some day all this will be clear to our people, and some man or men will arise and sweep us clear of these hindrances, these sad drawbacks to the vitality of our work in this world." ...|$|E
