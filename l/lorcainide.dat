This could be due to a greater accumulation of plasma Noriorcainide when exposed to oral <b>Lorcainide.</b> Noriorcainide, an N-dealkylated derivative, is an active metabolite of <b>Lorcainide.</b> It is as potent as its parent compound with similar antiarrhythmic efficacy, wherein it suppresses chronic premature ventricular complexes. 4 It has a half life of 26.5 +-7.2 hrs. 9 ...|$|E

5000|$|Fast-acting {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels (Nav1.5) {{found in}} high {{concentrations in the}} ventricular myocytes, open at a membrane potential of −80 mv in typical cardiac rhythm. This {{will result in a}} rapid upstroke of an action potential that leads to contraction of the ventricles.8 Class 1c drugs have local anesthetic properties and have a high affinity for open Nav1.5 (but not closed or inactive Nav1.5), thus irreversibly binding and reducing the fast Na+ influx. Interactions of <b>Lorcainide</b> with Nav1.5 are time and voltage dependent. Class 1c drugs have a characteristically slow dissociation rate, which will slow the upstroke duration and amplitude of ventricular myocytes’ action potential and prolong the PR, QRS and QT intervals of an ECG.4 <b>Lorcainide</b> also increases the ventricular fibrillation threshold in a dose-dependent fashion.4 Overall, <b>Lorcainide</b> causes a decrease in tachycardiac events, but also reduced ventricular contractility ejection fraction. The effect on sinus node function is controversial, as some researchers have noted a decreased sinus cycle length and increase in sinus node recovery, whereas others have observed no change. 4 ...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} effective, well tolerated, {{intravenous}} antiarrhythmic agents. The effects of <b>lorcainide,</b> a new class I antiarrhythmic agent, were compared with those of lidocaine in a randomized parallel study with crossover option in 30 hospitalized patients with frequent (> 1 /min) complex ventricular arrhythmias. <b>Lorcainide</b> loading dose was 3 mg/kg (at 2 mg/min) supplemented, if needed, with 100 mg in 1 hour; maintenance dose was 8 mg/h. Lidocaine loading dose was 1 mg/kg (at 25 mg/min) supplemented, if needed, with 50 mg in 2 minutes; maintenance dose was 2 or 3 mg/min (as needed). Arrhythmias were compared for 2 hours before and after drug loading. Initially responding patients (minimum of 70 % arrhythmia suppression) were continued on maintenance therapy for 24 hours. Patients initially failing or with later arrhythmia escape crossed over to alternating therapy (seven to lidocaine, nine to <b>lorcainide).</b> The median frequency of premature ventricular complexes decreased by 76 % after lidocaine (p < 0. 05) and by 93 % after <b>lorcainide</b> (p < 0. 001); this difference approached significance (p = 0. 06). More than 95 % arrhythmia suppression was achieved by <b>lorcainide</b> in 47 % of patients and by lidocaine in only 13 % (p < 0. 05). Couplets decreased by a median of 100 % after <b>lorcainide</b> and by 89 % after lidocaine. Couplets were eliminated in 62 % of the patients after <b>lorcainide</b> and in 27 % after lidocaine (p = 0. 06), There was 100 % suppression of runs of premature beats in 11 patients after <b>lorcainide</b> and 99 % suppression in 10 patients after lidocaine. In patients crossing over, <b>lorcainide</b> led to greater suppression of premature ventricular complexes in six of nine patients (67 %) compared with none of seven patients (0 %) (p < 0. 01) crossing over to lidocaine. Adverse effects were minor after both drugs; effects on vital signs and the electrocardiogram were insignificant. After loading, plasma lidocaine level averaged 2. 5 ± 1. 5 µg/ml and was maintained at 2. 1 to 4. 1 µg/ml. <b>Lorcainide</b> concentration averaged 0. 47 ± 0. 23 µg/ml after loading, but decreased to between 0. 18 and 0. 25 µg/ml during maintenance. Arrhythmia escape was noted later in six patients whose complex ventricular arrhythmias were initially controlled with <b>lorcainide</b> and was associated with decreasing levels in blood. In summary, <b>lorcainide</b> proved to be a well tolerated, efficacious antiarrhythmic agent when administered intravenously for acute therapy of complex ventricular arrhythmias and appeared to be generally superior to lidocaine.

40|$|<b>Lorcainide,</b> a new {{antiarrhythmic}} agent with local anesthetic or membrane-stabilizing properties {{similar to those}} of quinidine, was tested in 76 patients with diverse types of heart disease and recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. <b>Lorcainide</b> was administered for 72 to 96 hours in a dose ranging from 200 to 400 mg daily. Evaluation of drug efficacy involved ambulatory monitoring and exercise stress testing in 60 patients who had high grade ventricular arrhythmia. Invasive electrophysiologic testing was carried out in the remaining 16 patients who exhibited infrequent ventricular ectopic activity during control studies. <b>Lorcainide</b> was effective in 21 (38 %) of 56 patients evaluated for suppression of ventricular ectopic activity and in 6 (40 %) of 15 who had invasive testing. In five patients, the drug was discontinued because of toxic reactions. Thus, 27 (38 %) of the 71 patients who completed the drug study responded to <b>lorcainide.</b> Side effects, reported by 42 patients (55. 3 %), consisted primarily of insomnia and gastrointestinal symptoms; 7 experienced aggravation of arrhythmia. Fifteen patients were discharged while receiving <b>lorcainide</b> therapy, but in four the treatment was discontinued after 2 months because of side effects. Three patients died, one suddenly. It is concluded that <b>lorcainide</b> is of value in a small subset of patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who have proven refractory to conventional drugs.

Twelve patients with recurrent refractory ventricular tachycardia and organic heart disease, 10 men and 2 women aged 41 to 76 years, with no evidence of prior high degree atrioventricular or bifascicular block were studied. Programmed electrical stimulation was performed in the control, drug-free state and after chronic administration of <b>lorcainide</b> (dose range 200 to 600 mg/day, duration 48 to 240 hours, mean 106 hours) in 11 patients. One patient developed intolerable drug side effects and treatment was discontinued after 36 hours. In the 11 other patients, {{there was a significant}} increase in PR interval (187 ± 55 to 219 ± 56 ms; p 0. 2). The ventricular effective refractory period increased from 234 ± 21 to 266 ± 15 ms (p < 0. 02). During the control studies, 11 patients had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. After chronic <b>lorcainide</b> therapy, four patients showed suppression of sustained ventricular tachycardia, while seven patients continued to have inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. Long-term <b>lorcainide</b> therapy was continued in the four responders. During a 2 to 12 month follow-up period, two patients have remained arrhythmia-free, one patient developed intolerable side effects requiring discontinuation of the drug and one patient with advanced renal failure died.

40|$|<b>Lorcainide</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{given at}} the dose of 150 mg i. v. proved to be well tolerated at the acute stage of a myocardial infarction; the subjective signs were benign and never prevented us from completing the injection. The haemodynamic changes reflect some depressive effects on the myocardial function. Most of the observed changes are transient, and when significant from the statistical point of view, they remain very mild: the cardiac output decreased from 3. 4 to 3. 2 1 /min per m 2, the stroke index from 46 to 41 ml/m 2, and the pulmonary wedge pressure increased from 6. 6 to 8. 4 mm Hg (mean values). <b>Lorcainide</b> hydrochloride may thus {{be used as an}} antiarrhythmic drug in acute myocardial infarction.

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of drug-induced {{congestive heart failure}} with several newer antiarrhythmic agents including encainide, ethmozine, <b>lorcainide,</b> mexiletine, propafenone and tocainide was determined {{in a group of}} 407 patients who underwent 1, 133 drug tests. The incidence rate ranged from 0. 7 % with <b>lorcainide</b> to 4. 7 % with propafenone. Congestive heart failure was present in 167 patients (41 %) who underwent 491 drug trials. Congestive failure was induced in 15 (9 %) of these 167 patients and involved 19 (3. 9 %) of the 491 tests. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 20 ± 8 % in patients who developed congestive failure, in contrast to 39 ± 19 % in those who did not (p < 0. 001). It is concluded that each of the six antiarrhythmic drugs examined has the potential to aggravate congestive heart failure in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or a history of congestive heart failure, but the incidence rate is low and its occurrence unpredictable...|$|E

The IA drugs all produced significant slowing of spontaneous rate in therapeutic concentrations. The IB agents did so only in concentrations well above therapeutic levels and the IC drugs were of intermediate potency. All nine drugs markedly slowed the repolarization rate and this was the major mechanism of sinus slowing for the IA and IC compounds. The IB drugs shared this effect but prolongation of phase 4 by reduction of the slope of diastolic depolarization was also a prominent feature of their action...|$|E
40|$|The haemodynamic {{effects of}} encainide, flecainide, <b>lorcainide</b> and {{tocainide}} in man are reviewed. Most of the investigations discussed are acute intervention studies after intravenous {{administration of the}} drugs. With all four drugs, haemodynamic changes, when present, were moderate. In most studies a decrease in left ventricular maximal dp/dt is demonstrated, suggesting a negative inotropic action. Left ventricular filling pressures are unchanged or slightly increased. A small decrease in cardiac performance, as determined by measurements of cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction, is usually observed, while systemic vascular resistance is increased or remains unchanged. Haemodynamic deterioration and/or hypotensive reactions after intravenous administration {{of any of the}} above drugs are uncommon in patients without severe cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions relative to drug safety in frank congestive failure are not warranted, in view of the small number of patients studied.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{prolongation}} of the {{effective refractory period}} (ERP) of a novel complex Class III agent CPU- 86017 with compounds blocking I-Na (<b>lorcainide,</b> Lor), I-K (dofetilide, Dof), I-Ca (verapamil, Ver) and a complex Class III multiple channel blocking agent (amiodarone, Ami) at different frequency levels. METHODS: The ERP of the guinea pig right papillary muscle and the anoxic left atrial muscle treated with high K+ at pH 6. 6 - 6. 8, in concentrations ranging 0. 03 - 30 mu mol/L was compared at frequency levels ranging from 0. 5 - 4. 0 Hz. RESULTS: CPU- 86017 showed a positive frequency dependence (PFD) with respect to ERP in the papillary muscles and a mild reverse frequency dependence(RFD) in the diseased atrium. The potency of ERP prolonging effect of various agents at 4. 0 Hz was Dof > CPU- 86017 > Ver > Ami > Lor, and Dof > CPU- 86017 > Ami > Lor > Ver in the normal papillary and diseased atrial muscle, respectively. CONCLUSION: The profile and potency of prolonging the ERP by CPU 86017 is similar to Dof which blocks I-Kr in the diseased atrium, and to Ver which blocks I-Ca in guinea pig ventricle...|$|E
