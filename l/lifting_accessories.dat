5000|$|Safe Working Load (SWL) {{sometimes}} stated as the Normal Working Load (NWL) is {{the maximum}} safe force that {{a piece of}} lifting equipment, <b>lifting</b> device or <b>accessory</b> can exert to lift, suspend, or lower, a given mass without fear of breaking. Usually marked on the equipment by the manufacturer. It is a calculation of the Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS) and its risk factor, usually five to one (5:1 or 1/5) for lifting equipment although other fractions may be used such as 1/4, 1/6 and 1/10.|$|R
40|$|Tender <b>lifts</b> are yacht <b>accessories</b> {{that are}} mainly used to drop small boats and persons into the water. The {{extensive}} personalisation of yachts {{can lead to}} some critical issues {{for the design of}} tender lifts, which must be specifically made according to the unique geometry of each yacht. The aim of this work was to analyse and optimise the structure of a prototype tender lift for medium-sized yachts, as realised by BesenzoniS. p. A (Sarnico, BG) with AISI 304. The optimisation process involved analytical and numerical models, which were verified by experimental measurements. In particular, the stress and strain states of the actuation device were evaluated along the entire range of motion of the mechanism. The results were used to modify the geometry of the prototype. The optimised prototype demonstrated reduced applied stresses and increased values for the safety factor along the entire mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two main objectives: Learning to use NORSOK-R 002 and comparing it with Aker Solutions former work instruction manual A 237; and conducting a case study on the main frame of the C 05 east balcony for the Gina Krog project. The main task in the case study was to maintain proper weight structure with sufficient capacity and strength in respect to transportation, installation and operation. Apart from that, the design analysis and optimization of this structure were undertaken to create a structure that has a high element of safety with respect to life, environment and economic risk. NORSOK R- 002 was used for hand calculations of <b>lifting</b> <b>accessories</b> used in the case study. During modeling, design analysis and optimization of the C 05 balcony the following software tools were learned and used:  STAAD. pro.  Mathcad. In addition, the following topics were considered:  Evaluation and use of relevant rules and standards for offshore construction.  Optimizing the main frame and selection of steel profiles to achieve optimum design with respect to weight, strength and costs for transport, lifting, installation and operation.  Using the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method for checks and control.  Local calculation of joints, beams, lifting lug, slings, master links, forerunners, bolts, welds and other <b>lifting</b> <b>accessories.</b> The structural design and analysis was performed considering the lifting operation as basic. However, other stages had {{to be considered in}} order to create an optimal structure. During the case study, NORSOK R- 002 and Aker work instruction manual A 237 were both used for full comprehension and comparison. In an issues chapter below, factors are evaluated and compared...|$|E

40|$|Excavators are {{frequently}} used as ‘cranes’ for object handling on construction sites, but this situation {{brings with it}} significant health and safety hazards that often, are not fully appreciated by stakeholders. These hazards are identified; their risks explained and studied; and appropriate advice for stakeholders explicated. A developmental approach is employed that embraces accrual of evidence; case studies; theoretical examination; and derivation of guidance. It is found that excavators are often used as cranes employing both ‘formal’ or less satisfactory ‘informal’ methods of load connection. Hazards from using excavators as cranes (found principally among load connection points and associated <b>lifting</b> <b>accessories),</b> are often ‘hidden’ {{and can lead to}} catastrophic failure during lifting operations. Stakeholders {{need to be aware of}} the hazards and implement suggested risk controls to remove or mitigate them...|$|E
