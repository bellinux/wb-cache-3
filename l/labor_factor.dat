Absolute advantage meant greater efficiency in production, or the use of less <b>labor</b> <b>factor</b> in production. Two countries could both benefit from trade if each had a relative advantage in production. Relative advantage simply meant that the ratio of the labor embodied in the two commodities differed between two countries, such that each country would have at least one commoditiy where the relative amount of labor embodied would be less than that of the other country.|$|E
50|$|In microeconomics, the {{marginal}} factor cost (MFC) is the increment to total costs {{paid for a}} factor of production resulting from a one-unit increase {{in the amount of}} the factor employed. It is expressed in currency units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as labor, per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the number of units of labor hired, {{the marginal}} factor cost is identical to the wage rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the <b>labor</b> <b>factor</b> is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.|$|E

In the first phase, the female workers were usually young and single, working in manufacturing or as domestics and laundresses. These women had little learning {{on the job and}} the majority of women were not well educated. Moving into the second phase, the <b>labor</b> <b>factor</b> productivity for married women increased by 15.5% because of an increased demand for office workers and the participation of women in the [...] "high school movement". By the third phase, the female labor supply had become more elastic and more responsive to changes in wages. In this period, most women were secondary earners and worked in [...] "pink-collar" [...] jobs as secretaries, teachers, nurses, social workers, and librarians. Even though higher education was possible, most women did not establish careers, and went to college to meet their spouses rather than to further their education. Goldin argues that the transformation in female labor force participation is due to changes in factors such as female horizons, identities, and average marrying age.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the Canadian {{economy for}} the post 1960 period. It uses an accounting procedure developed in Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2006). The procedure identifies accounting factors that help align the predictions of the neoclassical growth model with macroeconomic variables observed in the data. The paper finds that the total factor productivity (the productivity factor) and the consumption-leisure trade-off (the <b>labor</b> <b>factor)</b> are key to understand the changes in output, labor supply and labor productivity observed in the Canadian economy. The paper performs a decomposition of the <b>labor</b> <b>factor</b> for Canada and the United States. It finds that {{the decline in the}} gender-wage gap is a major driving force of the decrease in the labor market distortions. Moreover, the milder reduction in the labor market distortions observed in Canada, compared to the US, is due to a relative increase in effective labor taxes in Canada. We are grateful to Ellen R.
