2500|$|The {{official}} opening by Queen Victoria was on 20 June 1857. In the following year, <b>late</b> <b>night</b> <b>openings</b> were introduced, {{made possible by}} the use of gas lighting. This was to enable in the words of Cole [...] "to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes"—this was linked {{to the use of the}} collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry. In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of [...] "High Art" [...] at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum. George Wallis (1811–1891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections. This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949. From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road. In 1893 the [...] "Science Museum" [...] had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.|$|R

50|$|Following an {{increase}} in visitor numbers after the arrival of Snake River Falls water coaster in 1994, management decided to pursue {{the development of the}} park into a more 'thrilling' theme park. On April 30, 1996, Megafobia opened. It cost £1.7m to build, but allowed the park to reach 500,000 visitors in one season for the first time. In 1996 Oakwood also began an annual After Dark event, with <b>late</b> <b>night</b> <b>opening,</b> fireworks, entertainment and discounted evening entry.Due to its location and comparatively limited financial resources the park is unlikely to develop into a major competitor on the same level as such parks as Alton Towers and Thorpe Park.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundViolence in {{community}} pharmacies in Ireland {{is thought to}} be common but underreported. The frequency and consequences of violence has not been studied previously. AimsTo establish the frequency and nature of violence {{in community}} pharmacies over 12 months, and to investigate the impact of violence on employees and possible consequence for the industry. MethodsA two-part survey was distributed to community pharmacies in Ireland in 2011 (n = 200). The first part related to pharmacy demographics, the frequency of various violent events (verbal abuse, threats etc.), the respondents' worry regarding violence and its impact on their co-workers. The second part concerned individual employees' subjective response to a violent event, using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). ResultsFifty-seven per cent of the pharmacies responded, with 77 % reporting some violent event (verbal or physical), over the past year. Eighteen per cent reported physical assault, and 63 % were worried about workplace violence. There was no association between <b>late</b> <b>night</b> <b>opening</b> hours or pharmacy size and violence frequency. Positive statistically significant correlations were present between all types of violence and absenteeism and employee fear levels. An IES-R score could be calculated for 75 respondents; the median IES-R score was 8 with 19 % reporting clinically significant scores. ConclusionsViolence is common in Irish community pharmacies and impacts on employees and the industry...|$|E
