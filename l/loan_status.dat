40|$|Changes in the {{demographics}} of the United States have resulted in growing numbers of minorities. Unfortunately, the field of psychology has failed to reflect these changes in the diversity of the academic student body and the national workforce. To ensure that the needs of the United States' increasingly diverse population are addressed through both culturally and linguistically competent research and practice, it is imperative to increase the racial/ethnic diversity among psychologists. This study explores the ways in which a national sample of undergraduate students, from various racial/ethnic groups, are similar and different in their perceptions of support, barriers, perception of diversity, monetary considerations, satisfaction with their studies in psychology, and intention to pursue a graduate degree in psychology, and in the interrelationships among these variables. The findings revealed a positive relationship for all students between academic support and satisfaction with studies and a negative relationship between academic barriers and satisfaction with studies. There was also evidence of an interaction between race/ethnicity and the perception of diversity in the academic environment on satisfaction with studies in psychology. Specifically, African American students' reports of satisfaction with studies in psychology were related to their perceptions of the extent of cultural diversity in their academic environment {{to a greater extent than}} European American students. In addition, academic support was positively related to intention to pursue an advanced degree in psychology; however, there was no relationship between the other psychosocial predictor variables and intention. Hypothesized ethnic group differences were found related to <b>loan</b> <b>status</b> and satisfaction with studies in psychology. In regards to <b>loan</b> <b>status,</b> African Americans were significantly more likely to rely on loans as their only form of financial support compared to European Americans, and on loans combined with other financial support compared to all three racial/ethnic groups. Finally, African Americans and Asian Americans were significantly less satisfied with their studies in psychology than their European American peers. Overall, the current study's findings contribute to our understanding of important factors related to enhancing diversity in psychology and provide additional support for the critical role of academic support related to educational outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Timely student {{completion}} of undergraduate nursing programs {{in order to}} produce practicing registered nurses (RNs) is of concern to students, faculty, governments, employers, and health care consumers across Canada. The shortage of health care professionals in Saskatchewan, particularly in nursing, is an immediate and growing concern. The average age of RNs in Saskatchewan is 44. 9 years (CIHI, 2003). With the inevitability of retirement of many RNs, recruitment and retention of new nurses is critical to the quality of health care in this province. The looming shortage creates a further challenge for key stakeholders in academia, government, and health regions who hold a vested interest in the retention of nurses educated in Saskatchewan. Currently, {{little is known about the}} impact of barriers to timely {{completion of}} students in the Nursing Education Program of Saskatchewan (NEPS). Considering the aging nursing workforce, frequent, substantial numbers of nursing graduates are important to meet the demand for health human resources in the province of Saskatchewan (SRNA, 2004). The purpose of this research was to conduct a secondary analysis of the NEPS Database including exit surveys completed by 363 graduates over a three-year period, 2002 - 2003; 2003 - 2004; 2004 - 2005. Group membership was determined by splitting data between graduates who had taken four academic years (September to April) or less to complete the program (timely completers) and those who took longer than four academic years (delayed completers). Objectives were to examine the differences between the two aforementioned groups in terms of the following variables: employment hours, financial burden, student <b>loan</b> <b>status,</b> dollar amount of bursaries awarded during the NEPS, primary responsibility the year prior to the NEPS, significant life changes during the NEPS, Aboriginal ancestry and core course averages. Results show that 86 % of females in the study group completed the NEPS in a timely manner compared with 58 % of their male counterparts. There was a trend of higher employment hours per week in every year of the NEPS for delayed completers. However, this difference approached statistical significance only for students in year one, t (360) = 1. 81, p <. 07. Fifty percent of delayed completers had three or more significant life changes during the NEPS. Seventy-five percent of timely completers had two or fewer significant life changes. Students require various forms of support to ensure timely completion of the NEPS. It is anticipated that results of this research will inform policy decisions to facilitate timely completion of the NEPS...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 2012 DoBeS Workshop: The impact of DoBeS-related technology on empirical and theoretical linguistics. An important argument for language documentation stresses the way that traditional ethnobiological knowledge is woven into, and transmitted through, the languages of small groups in increasingly threatened physical environments. This gives a clear and widely accepted reason for approaching the study of ethnobiology with the techniques of documentary linguistics. For example, in Kámnzo the plant name kʷatsʏr kʷatsʏr (Helminthostachis zeylanica) is the reduplicated form {{of a kind of}} fish. Informants described that when the flower of this plant falls into the water, this would indicate that the fish would eat the those flowers, and that this is the time when the kʷatsʏr fish becomes 'nice and greasy'. This particular reduplication pattern thus captures an important part of ethnoecological knowledge in its semantics. But there is another lesser-known aspect to the symbiosis of language documentation and ethnobiological research. The biological domain of vocabulary may exhibit revealing and unusual characteristics absent or rare elsewhere in the language. In the present talk, we focus on three of these, as they have emerged from our developing study of two languages of Southern New Guinea, Nen and Kámnzo, as well as the neighbours with which they are in contact. The characteristics we will investigate lie at the intersection of encyclopaedic knowledge, intergroup transmission of terminology, social processes (at various levels of conscious articulation) for assimilating or camouflaging the origins of loan terms, the use of botanical and ornithological knowledge as symbols for group identity, and individual sociophonetic positioning. Specifically, we will examine: (a) levels of reduplication, which particularly for plant names but also for bird names reach levels several times higher than for any other semantic domain (b) patterns of unusual phonology suggestive of <b>loan</b> <b>status</b> for some biological terms, such as a number of Kámnzo plant names which begin with vowels, in defiance of the language’s general phonotactic norms. Examples are ætraɸ (gonocaryum littoralis), æw (ficus crysantha), æðəŋgam (parinari nonda) and akeake (alphitonia incana) (c) degrees of etymologisability for reduplicates, and the relevance of this for models of group adaptation to local ecology. In Nen for example only a small proportion of reduplicated plant terms have language-internal etymologies: cf téqli ‘tree frog (sticks to high surfaces), téqlitéqli ‘epiphyte sp. ’ (anthorrhyza sp.) (which adheres to points high up on the host tree). But many more have etymologies which must be sought in neighbouring languages – cf Nen qaklqakl ‘scrophularia sp. ’, {{for which there is no}} unreduplicated counterpart *qakl, while in neighbouring Idi the resemblant word kwakəλkwakəλ (also scrophularia tree) has the unreduplicated counterpart kwakəλ ‘small orange crab which comes out from the banks of streams in the savannah’, and which hides at the base of the kwakəλkwakəλ tree. Cases like these can be used (as per Nash 1997) to argue for particular directions of borrowing (here, from Idi to Nen, with phonological adaptation in Nen but also a lack of the etymological transparency still found in Idi). (d) the degree to which different speakers deal with the phonologies of plant terms (some clearly indigenous, some clearly from neighbouring languages, some partially assimilated). Here we will focus on a subcorpus of over 150 plant names recorded from 4 speakers (all knowing at least Nen and Idi) of different identity-orientations following from their clan affiliation, father and mother’s languages, and life history of residency. Gathering data like this involves the closely-linked investigation of ethnobiological and sociolinguistic issues. In our talk we will set off the analytic issues outlined above with a discussion of how fieldwork practice in an interdisciplinary team can be harnessed to tackle these tasks together.

Problem statement: This article examines factors that affect SMMEs’ ability to borrow money from commercial banks. Empirical evidence was collected from manufacturing SMMEs. Motivation for the study: There is a scarcity of studies on factors influencing borrowing among Botswana manufacturing SMMEs. Methodology: The study employed both qualitative and quantitative research designs. The random stratified sampling technique was used to draw a sample of 100 manufacturing SMMEs from a population of 329 registered manufacturing SMMEs in Botswana. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression estimation was used to obtain the main objective. Main findings: The empirical results showed that longevity in position and annual turnover have positive impact on getting access to bank <b>loans,</b> while marital <b>status</b> has a negative effect on access to bank loans. Practical implications: An understanding of factors influencing borrowing can increase chances of an SMME gaining financing from commercial banks, thus solving the challenge of access to finance.

However, a number of factors, including a new payment structure for loan servicing contracts to reward servicers for keeping more borrowers in repayment status, have created some uncertainty about the servicing cost per borrower in coming years. ...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{microfinance}} {{has been}} purported {{to have experienced}} enormous amounts of progress and is seen to contribute towards poverty reduction, however, the question on how microfinance social performance is assessed remains unresolved. Several studies have emerged {{with the aim of}} appraising the social performance of microfinance as well as enriching the debate on performance assessment. However, most of these studies focus on either measuring the impacts on beneficiaries or on taking the subjective perspective of practitioners, respectively. By contrast, this paper attempts to bridge these two schools of thought and resorts to a quantitative approach for assessing the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) based on an externally-audited set of indicators of social performance, which warrants objectivity and reliability of information. Thus, the paper presents a comprehensive analytical structure of the social performance made by MFIs using panel data. The paper identifies indicators for social performance and develops a social performance rating for 878 MFIs, across all geographic regions each year for a period of 11 years (2000 - 2010) using quantitative methodologies. Furthermore, with the generated social performance ratings and with the use of econometric methodologies and models, the paper investigates whether or not, the age, assets, regulation <b>status,</b> <b>loans</b> per loan officers, as well as the profit status of MFIs affect MFIs’ ability to perform socially...|$|R
40|$|In 1995, the Chinese {{government}} enacted Commercial Bank Act {{to enforce}} and regulate commercial banking activities. The government {{hoped that the}} initiation of the Act, together with other bank reforms, would promote risk management among commercial banks to allow the banking industry to move toward a market based system. One outcome regulators expected to achieve was that state-owned commercial banks would stop (social) policy lending or directed lending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs hereafter). This paper empirically examines lending by a bank around {{the enforcement of the}} Act. After the Act, the bank puts in place strict screening criteria including size of the borrowing firm, collateral <b>status,</b> <b>loan</b> duration, the length of relationship with the bank, and the credit rating of the firm. The bank also charges SOEs higher rates of interest than private firms by 5 basis points recognizing that such loans are more risky. In sum, the findings show that Chinese SOEs lost their access to cheap money from the bank after 1995. I would like to express my gratitude to Takeshi Yamada for his supervision and encouragement. I wish to acknowledge helpful suggestions and comments of Jun Koo Kang, Inmoo Lee, and Hassan Naqvi. I thank an anonymous bank for providing me data.
