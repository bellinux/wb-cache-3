5|$|The Little Shop of Horrors was {{developed}} when director Roger Corman was given temporary access to sets {{that had been}} <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> from his previous film, A Bucket of Blood.

5|$|When Mardonius {{learned of}} the Spartan force, he {{completed}} the destruction of Athens, tearing down whatever was <b>left</b> <b>standing.</b> He then retreated towards Thebes, hoping to lure the Greek army into territory that would be suitable for the Persian cavalry.

5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were <b>left</b> <b>standing.</b> All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> {{unattended}} unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E

Hestercombe was the American 801 Hospital Centre after the Normandy {{landings}} {{until the end of the}} war. A total of 33 barrack huts (various Nissen huts, Romney huts and MOWB (Ministry of Works brick huts) were constructed at Hestercombe during the war.

5|$|Fort Senneville {{is one of}} the {{outlying}} forts of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, built by the Canadiens of New France near the Sainte-Anne rapids in 1671. The property was part of a fief ceded to Dugué de Boisbriant in 1672 by the Sulpicians. A large stone windmill, which doubled as a watch tower, was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring machicolation and other castle-like features. The fort was burned down by Iroquois in 1691, with only the mill itself <b>left</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Eco Beach {{tourist resort}} was only built to resist wind gusts of Category3 strength. Only about 10 of the 40 {{accommodation}} huts were <b>left</b> <b>standing.</b> Some of the huts {{were removed from}} their concrete foundations, and were carried by the winds and smashed into other buildings. Showing how strong Rosita's winds were, a sea container weighing 2.5 tonnes (5500 lb) and filled with 2 to 3 tonnes (4400 to 6600lb) of equipment was blown 700m (0.4mile) across sand dunes. The magnitude of the devastation to the vegetation in this area resembled a place being destroyed by bushfires.|$|E

5|$|The {{destruction}} of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to remark that no usable trees were <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> between {{the mouths of}} the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers. In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E
5|$|The film stars Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, and Dick Miller, all of {{whom had}} worked for Corman on {{previous}} films. Produced under the title The Passionate People Eater, the film employs an original style of humor, combining black comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof. The Little Shop of Horrors was shot on a budget of $28,000, with interiors being shot in two days utilizing sets that had been <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> from A Bucket of Blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} {{incident}} was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in {{to take charge of}} the search for survivors and secure the part of the building <b>left</b> <b>standing.</b> Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety-one victims. To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23July.|$|E

Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it inoperable. Percy also battered the southern Cook Islands while weakening, although the damage there was minimal.|$|E

The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal <b>left</b> <b>standing</b> in air is {{passivated}} by oxidation, {{forming a}} thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
