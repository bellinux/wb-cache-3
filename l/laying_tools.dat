40|$|Static {{structural}} {{analysis of a}} pipe during laying is usually performed by use of finite element analysis tools specialized for this purpose. In this paper, Abaqus/CAE, which is a general purpose FEA software, was used for a static non-linear {{structural analysis}} of a pipe during pipe laying. The pipe is modeled as a geometrically non-linear elastic beam supported by a vessel and its stinger in the overbend region and by the seabed in the sagbend region. We propose a new method for tensioner modeling based on friction contacts between the pipe and the tensioner. Contact interactions between the pipe and rollers, {{as well as between}} the pipe and the seabed, are also considered. Basic static analysis is enhanced with floating stinger implementation, a non-flat seabed profile and buoyancy tanks application.

40|$|Delineating the {{framework}} for a fundamental model of long-range coherence in biological systems is said to rely on principles beyond parameters addressed by current physical science. Just as phenomena of quantum mechanics <b>lay</b> beyond <b>tools</b> of classical Newtonian mechanics we must now enter a 3 rd regime of unified field, UF mechanics. In this paper we present a battery of nine empirical protocols for manipulating long-range coherence in complex self-organized living systems (SOLS) in a manner surmounting the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum uncertainty (space-quantization) thereby allowing empirical access to underlying coherent biophysical principles driving self-organization. Interestingly, while the UF is not indicative of a 5 th fundamental force in the usual phenomenal sense of quantal transfer during field interactions; it does however provide an inherent ‘force of coherence’ in an energyless ontological sense by a process called ‘topological switching’ of higher dimensional (HD) brane dynamics. It is this putative inherent property that produces long-range coherence and leads {{to the possibility of}} its direct experimental mediation...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on a {{lifetime}} of comparisons between French and British experiences, this essay clears ground for a more general explanation of variation in the impact of regimes on contention, and vice versa, over Europe as a whole since 1650. Differences among Swiss, British, French, Dutch, Iberian, and other European experiences with regime change and contention set challenging empirical, conceptual, and theoretical problems. Considering the great variety of European trajectories, how can we possibly pinpoint important similarities and differences in the interplay among changes in social environments, alterations in governmental forms, histories of contentious politics, and approaches to (or retreats from) democracy? How can we single out the effects of varying patterns of military activity? What concepts will help discipline those comparisons and single out significant causal mechanisms? To what extent can we identify recurrent cause-effect relationships that operated throughout the range of European history since 1650 ? This paper's task is to <b>lay</b> out <b>tools</b> for pursuit of those questions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Patient {{and public}} {{involvement}} (PPI) in all research studies is recommended {{from the earliest}} point and in as many stages as possible. Qualitative research is also recommended {{in the early stages}} of designing. complex intervention trials. Combining both together might enable inclusion of ‘harder-to-reach’ perspectives from the target population(s), particularly when the research is intended for their benefit. However, the interface between PPI and qualitative research has received little attention. Methods: In a multi-disciplinary, mixed methods study to inform the design of incentive trials for smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding, we combined PPI and qualitative research, with some overlap. Mother and baby groups from two geographically separate disadvantaged areas, with diverse experiences of the smoking and breastfeeding, but no training or previous involvement in research, were recruited as PPI research grant co-applicants. An iterative partnership approach facilitated involvement in research conduct and design across all project phases. Group PPI members were also invited to contribute to more formal qualitative data collection, as and when indicated by the research questions, and emerging analysis. Results: We engaged with ‘harder-to-reach’ women in mother and baby group settings, rather than in academic or home environments. These settings were relaxed and informal, which facilitated rapport-building, disclosures of unexpected information and maintained trust. 21 women participated in standard PPI activities: feedback on study protocols and documents; piloting questionnaires and interview schedules. PPI members voiced some different perspectives from those captured within the qualitative dataset. 19 participated in focused qualitative research. Novel aspects were audio recorded PPI discussions, which contributed qualitative data; first, to interpret systematic review findings and construct intervention vignettes for use in the qualitative research; second, to assist with recruitment to improve sample diversity in the formal qualitative dataset; and third, to translate theory and findings presented in a researcher generated logic model into a <b>lay</b> <b>tool.</b> This had face validity for potential trial participants and used the metaphor of a ladder. Conclusions: Combining and overlapping PPI and qualitative research added ‘harder-to-reach’ contributions, sample diversity, trust and engagement in creative approaches beyond what could be achieved through PPI or qualitative research alone.

40|$|Galling is {{a severe}} form of {{adhesive}} wear encountered in metal forming operations. In hot stamping, an Al-Si coating is normally applied onto the ultra high strength steels (UHSS) to prevent decarburisation {{and improve the}} corrosion resistance of the steel. Material transfer occurring from the coated UHSS to the tool surface {{has been identified as}} major issue in hot stamping. It is a known problem as this transferred material impairs the quality of the produced parts as well as increases the costs of maintenance of the tools. The present work focuses on the understanding of surface topography parameter and their effect on galling. Surface roughness level and orientation of the roughness marks (<b>lay)</b> on <b>tool</b> surface have been studied. The results showed that a single parameter of the surface topography is not enough to describe the resistance to galling. Parameters such as Rp, Rv and Rsk are also important to consider in order to rank the galling resistance of the surface. The sliding direction with respect to the surface lay also had a significant influence on galling; sliding in the direction parallel to it resulted in substantially reduced material transfer.
