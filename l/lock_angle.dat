5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle <b>lock.</b> <b>Angle</b> made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E

30|$|Distal radial {{fractures}} {{seem to be}} {{the most}} common fracture entity currently seen in accident and emergency units, with an annual estimated incidence of 36.6 women/ 10, 000 and 8.9 men/ 10, 000 per year [1]. A significantly growing elderly population with a markedly increasing life expectancy may increase the fracture incidence by a further 50  % by the year 2030 [2]. Non-operative treatment using a plaster cast is usually chosen for non-displaced fractures. A stable reduction in displaced fractures may also be treated non-operatively [3]. Unstable and displaced radial fractures are treated operatively. Besides stability and displacement, intra-articular or extra-articular fracture type may also be important for the decision. The ideal method for surgical management of these fractures has been a controversial topic of discussion, and numerous procedures are available. Percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation, joint-bridging and non-joint-bridging external fixation, or a combination of both can be used successfully [4, 5, 6]. The palmar locking plate has recently become popular [5, 7, 8] for treatment for distal radial fractures, and good to excellent clinical results have been published [8, 9, 10, 11]. In fact, {{there are a number of}} studies demonstrating good results in the treatment for distal radial fractures with palmar <b>locked</b> <b>angle</b> plates at a large, specialized institution. The limited number of specialized institutions coupled with the increasing number of distal radial fractures may be leading to a lack of treatment capacity of this injury. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the subjective and objective outcome after operative treatment for distal radial fractures using a palmar <b>locked</b> <b>angle</b> miniplate (Koenigsee, 2.4  mm T-miniplate) by a smaller, non-specialized institution to evaluate the necessity for referral to high-volume services.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Energetic {{efficiency}} and stability are the fundamental criteria which {{can improve the}} autonomy and task performance capabilities of humanoid robots. The scope {{of this paper is}} to investigate the energetic effects of knee locking and addition of torsional springs to different joints of a sevenlink fully actuated planar bipedal robot. The focus is on the reduction of energy consumption during walking. The energetic cost of walking is determined without joint stiffness and knee locking as a baseline for the comparison of results. In the first approach, the gait trajectory is optimized by adding springs to different joints and energetic cost of walk is then calculated at different walking speeds. The second approach presented in this paper is to mechanically lock the support knee and then optimize the gait and calculate the walking cost. The energetic cost of walking determined for the above two cases is then compared to the baseline cost. It is observed that addition of torsional springs at both hips reduce the walking cost up to 50 %, support hip up to 85 % with spring stiffness as an optimization variable for both cases while mechanically locking the support knee reduces the cost of walking up to 25 % with gait and knee <b>locking</b> <b>angle</b> optimized.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of a single colloidal particle driven through a colloidal lattice which can distort {{in response to the}} driven particle. We find a remarkably rich variety of dynamical locking phenomena as we vary the angle of the applied drive with respect to the orientation of the colloidal lattice. When the driven colloid locks to certain lattice symmetry directions, its motion is not necessarily aligned with the drive. Applying a transverse force to the driven particle can result in either increased or decreased drag in the driving direction, depending on the angle of the drive. The dynamical locking produces anomalies in both the longitudinal and the transverse velocity vs driving force curves, including steps and regimes of negative differential resistance. As the interaction of the driven particle with the surrounding lattice increases, significant distortion or dislocations in the surrounding media occur, and as a result the directional locking is enhanced. We compare these results to those obtained for driving particles over fixed substrates, and show that a far richer variety of behaviors occurs when the underlying lattice is allowed to distort. We discuss how this system can be used for particle species segregation when the onset of different <b>locking</b> <b>angles</b> occurs at different drives for varied particle sizes. We also show that the most pronounced locking phases should be observable at temperatures up to the melting transition of the colloidal lattice. Comment: 12 pages, 17 postscript figure...|$|R
30|$|For {{adjusting}} the structural {{parameters of the}} failure joint and the adjacent joints, the rotation matrix of failure joint is still remained in the kinematic equations, and the current angle of failure joint locked is substituted into kinematic equations. For different failure joints and location, only the corresponding joint variables in the kinematics should be converted to a constant which is currently <b>locked</b> rotation <b>angle.</b> Then the normal analytical solution algorithm is used to solve the equations. This method can improve the solvability of insufficient DOF manipulator and achieve its trajectory planning; this will make sure 6 -DOF manipulator still accomplishes most tasks {{in case of a}} single joint failure.|$|R
