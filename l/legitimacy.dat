5|$|According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has a {{complicated}} relationship with small businesses. Criticism of Yelp {{focuses on the}} <b>legitimacy</b> of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews {{in order to increase}} ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Conceptually {{deriving}} <b>legitimacy</b> {{from the}} Diet, {{whom it is}} responsible to, the Cabinet exercises its power in two different ways. In practice, much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister, while others are exercised nominally by the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: <b>legitimacy</b> {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from <b>legitimacy</b> highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of {{the main}} rebel coalition, the Syrian National Coalition, were angered by the agreement. The U.S., without {{consulting}} the coalition, had changed its mind about striking Syria. Rebels furthermore worried the agreement might be a considered a de facto admission of the Bashar al-Assad government's <b>legitimacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko's inauguration {{ceremony}} of 22 January 2011 was boycotted by EU ambassadors, and only thirty-two foreign diplomats attended. During this ceremony, Lukashenko defended the <b>legitimacy</b> of his re-election and vowed that Belarus {{would never have}} {{its own version of}} the Orange Revolution or Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Periya Puranam {{version is}} {{interpreted}} as a Brahmanical narrative, where a particular Dalit is granted salvation by transforming into a Brahmin; {{the superiority of the}} Brahmins is reinforced and the <b>legitimacy</b> of the ban of Dalits is not challenged.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the <b>legitimacy</b> of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's <b>legitimacy</b> into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic <b>legitimacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as the}} third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his <b>legitimacy</b> as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E
5|$|According to top Marine officials, the {{elections}} {{were designed to}} help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott. The simultaneous elections for the provincial council were won by the Iraqi Islamic Party, which suffered from a perceived lack of <b>legitimacy</b> but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.|$|E
5|$|After the {{inception}} of Scouting in the early 1900s, some nations' programs have taken part in social movements such as the nationalist resistance movements in India. Although Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials {{as a way to}} strengthen their rule, the values they based Scouting on helped to challenge the <b>legitimacy</b> of British imperialism. Likewise, African Scouts used the Scout Law's principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to collectively claim full imperial citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Allegations of {{genocide}} and brutality by the ANC {{were used to}} provide <b>legitimacy</b> to Kasa-Vubu's dismissal of Lumumba, {{with the support of}} Mobutu, in September 1960. In the aftermath of the campaign, the South Kasaian state was able to provide substantial aid to its refugees, many of whom were resettled in homes and jobs.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} {{defected}} to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa, the pastor who had re-baptized González in 1938. González {{had a vision}} in July 1943 where the baptism by Figueroa was invalidated and {{he was ordered to}} re-baptize himself invoking Jesus' name. The whole congregation was re-baptized as well, as now Joaquín was the source of baptismal <b>legitimacy</b> and authenticity. With all those who had challenged him gone, Joaquín was able to consolidate leadership of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, Barnes, who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing {{one foot on the}} edge of the pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the <b>legitimacy</b> of his action and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.|$|E
5|$|At Theobald's request, Pope Gregory urged Alice {{to come to}} Rome, {{because the}} <b>legitimacy</b> of her parents' {{marriage}} was to be investigated. Alice refused {{to appear before the}} papal tribunal, but renounced her claim to Champagne and Brie for 40,000 livres tournois and estates yielding a yearly income of 2,000 livres in September 1234. In the agreement with Theobald, she also stated that she would not erect fortresses in her estates in Champagne.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented {{more than a simple}} coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their <b>legitimacy</b> from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the <b>legitimacy</b> of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the aim of}} the NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} the impacts of the first-past-the-post system, its <b>legitimacy</b> is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as in the case of NMPs). As a result, the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the <b>legitimacy</b> of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited too much from the cult of Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the <b>legitimacy</b> of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the <b>legitimacy</b> of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon. Early marriages, such as that of Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa and Egilona {{at the turn of the}} 8th century, was thought to help establish the <b>legitimacy</b> of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. Later instances of intermarriage were often made to seal trade treaties between Christian kings and Muslim caliphs.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{publicly}} {{declared that}} he was the illegitimate son of Caracalla, and therefore deserving the loyalty of Roman soldiers and senators who had sworn allegiance to Caracalla. After Julia Maesa displayed her wealth to the Third Legion at Raphana they swore allegiance to Elagabalus. At sunrise on 16 May 218, Publius Valerius Comazon, commander of the legion, declared him emperor. To strengthen his <b>legitimacy</b> Elagabalus assumed Caracalla's names, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, in {{an attempt}} to end public family feuding, Jackson's brother Jermaine Jackson {{retracted}} his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Michael Jackson's estate and his mother's advisers concerning the <b>legitimacy</b> of his brother's will. T.J. Jackson, son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children after false reports surfaced of Katherine Jackson going missing.|$|E
5|$|In England, Parliament held James {{abandoned}} the throne by fleeing from English territory to France. The Convention argued James forfeited the Scottish throne by his actions, as {{listed in the}} Articles of Grievances. This effectively rejected {{the principle of the}} Divine Right of Kings which had driven political conflict for the last 60 years. If James could be removed from the throne because of his acts, monarchs derived their <b>legitimacy</b> not from God but the people as represented by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{the eastern}} {{departments}} pushed for greater autonomy, but Morales' government rejected the <b>legitimacy</b> of their position. They {{called for a}} referendum on recalling Morales, which saw an 83% turnout and in which Morales was ratified with 67.4% of the vote. Unified as the National Council for Democracy (CONALDE), these groups – financed by the wealthy agro-industrialist, petroleum, and financial elite – embarked {{on a series of}} destabilisation campaigns to unseat Morales' government.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007 {{a public}} {{discussion}} between supporters {{and opponents of}} the mosque plan was held at Ithaca House in Stratford. Issues discussed included the <b>legitimacy</b> of the concerns about the mosque, {{the extent of the}} conservative view of Islam taught by Tablighi Jamaat, their unwillingness to engage in public discourse, the extent that racism plays a role in the mosque's opposition, and the demand for larger facilities in the West Ham area to support the needs of the community.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her <b>legitimacy</b> was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Tătărescu {{chose to}} back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, {{remained}} active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning {{it had never been}} enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the <b>legitimacy</b> of the action for the following years. Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brătianu's political allies.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that while the subsidy reform plan needs further adaptation and fine-tuning, citizens must separate the questions of public policy from the issues of government <b>legitimacy.</b> The IMF has hailed Iran's economic reform and asked Iran's expertise {{to be transferred to}} other countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit has also praised Iran's subsidies reform plan for its positive effect on the economy in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Sratsimir {{began to}} mint his own coinage {{to show his}} <b>legitimacy</b> {{as early as the}} 1360s. The {{abundance}} of coin treasure troves found in the territory of the Tsardom of Vidin is an indication of the wealth and the well developed trade in the region {{during the second half of}} the 14th century. The Brașov Charter, the only surviving document made by Ivan Sratsimir, grants the merchants of the Transylvanian town of Brașov free access and the right to trade in his realm.|$|E
5|$|Later sources {{suggest that}} {{perceptions}} of <b>legitimacy</b> {{played a part}} in the arguments, as did the relative age of the two candidates. In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975. There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. Æthelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles.|$|E
5|$|LeMond is a {{longtime}} vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the <b>legitimacy</b> of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning {{of his relationship with}} Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him {{in the center of the}} anti-doping controversy.|$|E
5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of the Wicked Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of questionable interpretation. Collins argues further {{that there is no}} evidence in the Community Rule or the Damascus Document to support the view that the Qumran community was concerned with the <b>legitimacy</b> of a non-Zadokite High Priest.|$|E
5|$|Several episcopalians, {{supporters}} of the existing system of bishops, were {{also included in the}} summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater <b>legitimacy</b> to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, Daniel Featley, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils {{continue}} to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia. The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants. Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system. A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees {{have gone back to}} Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the <b>legitimacy</b> of their refugee claims.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{refused to}} leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for {{intentionally}} violating the Tenure of Office Act, {{by a vote of}} 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the <b>legitimacy</b> of Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists, Proceso magazine, {{and several}} journalists and press freedom {{organizations}} have complained about irregularities {{in the investigation}} and question the <b>legitimacy</b> of the whole case. They believe that their colleague's murder {{was part of a}} campaign of intimidation against those who investigate alleged links between drug traffickers and politicians in the state of Veracruz.|$|E
