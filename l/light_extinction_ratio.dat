40|$|ABSTRACT] Vertical {{profiles}} of <b>light</b> <b>extinction</b> coefficient by atmospheric aerosols are measured continuously {{day and night}} in Seoul using a micro pulse lidar (MPL) during Fall 1997. The <b>ratio</b> of the <b>light</b> <b>extinction</b> coefficient to the backscattering is calculated from the Mie theory with the aerosol characteristics measured in Seoul. The <b>extinction</b> to backscattering <b>ratio</b> {{turns out to be}} a nearly constant value of 25 in Seoul for the relative humidity of 30 to 70 % range. For the relative humidity greater than 70 %, the ratio decreases linearly down to 20 at relative humidity near 100 %. 0 With this value of the <b>extinction</b> to backscattering <b>ratio</b> the <b>light</b> <b>extinction</b> coefficient by aerosols in each layer of 30 m thick is computed up to 5 km height, Numerous vertical profiles are examined to investigate the variation of the tropospheric aerosol profiles in conjunction with meteorological field.

30|$|Wire grid polarizers offer a large {{spectral}} working range, {{small feature}} size, and good integrability and are {{of utmost importance}} for various applications such as microscopy or imaging systems. Generally, a wire grid polarizer consists of a periodical arrangement of conductive (metallic) wires on a transparent substrate. Upon illumination, a wire grid polarizer shows a higher transmission for light with the electrical field vector perpendicular to the wires (transverse magnetic (TM) polarization) than for the parallel counterpart (transverse electric (TE) polarization). In addition to the transmission of TM-polarized <b>light,</b> the <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio</b> which {{is defined by the}} ratio of TM- and TE-polarized light is another characteristic optical property of a wire grid polarizer. The spectral working range and the optical properties of a wire grid polarizer are determined by the grating material and the structural parameters of the grating such as period, grating height, or ridge width. First wire grid polarizers for the IR spectral region were demonstrated by Bird and Parrish [1] in 1960. Subsequent work in the past years showed polarizers for the terahertz [2], IR [3], visible [4], and UV [5] spectral ranges. Decreasing the operation wavelength requires smaller grating periods. For a wire grid polarizer, it is necessary that only the zeroth diffraction order is propagating. For this purpose it is known that the grating period must be much smaller than the incident wavelength. Consequently for a target wavelength of 250 nm a period of about 100 nm is required. The fabrication of such a high frequency metallic grating with high aspect ratios is technologically very challenging and demands a sophisticated lithography and metal structuring process. Possible lithographical processes include nanoimprint lithography [5], interference lithography [6], or electron beam lithography [7]. Metal structuring can be accomplished by means of a lift off process [8], dry etching [9], or a spatial frequency doubling technique [10].|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel very short (< 300 µm) {{vertical}} direc-tional coupler switch with high <b>extinction</b> <b>ratios</b> larger than 30 dB. The device {{consists of a}} switching operation induced section (SOIS), an <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio</b> adjusted section (ERAS), and an <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio</b> enhanced section (ERES).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the discrepancies in measurements of <b>light</b> <b>extinction</b> and extinction-to-backsatter <b>ratio</b> (lidar ratio) of desert dust with CALIPSO and ground-based lidar systems. Multiwavelength polarization Raman lidar measurements in the Saharan dust plume performed at Praia, Cape Verde, 15. 0 degrees N, 23. 5 degrees W, during SAMUM- 2 in June 2008 were analyzed and compared to results of nearby CALIPSO overflights. The particle extinction coefficients {{and thus the}} optical depth are underestimated in the CALIPSO products by about 30 % compared to Raman lidar measurements. A pre-defined lidar ratio of 40 sr at 532 nm is used for mineral dust in the CALIPSO algorithms in agreement with values of 41 +/- 6 sr found from constrained retrievals. However, the ground-based lidar observations show much larger values {{of the order of}} 55 +/- 10 sr. The discrepancies {{can be explained by the}} influence of multiple scattering which is ignored in the CALIPSO retrievals.

To clarify the origin of this degradation, we {{have investigated}} the effects of surface morphology on the <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio.</b> Two models were presented to describe the surface morphology. One models a rough surface by a combination of a periodic curve and a Gaussian white noise, while the other models the surface by randomly distributed nanoparticles. Both models indicated that the high performance did not degrade by the surface roughness. This is because the high <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio</b> is governed by Babinet’s principle, resulting in the robustness of the surface morphology. We have also investigated the relation between the <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio</b> and the increase in metallic loss because of the surface roughness, which showed drastic degradation of the <b>extinction</b> <b>ratio.</b> The spectral feature of the blue-shift was also reproduced by the numerical calculation, indicating that the degradation is due to the increase in the metallic loss. From this result, we find that the metal deposition should be conducted to reduce the scattering and grain boundary losses that are related to the roughness. Throughout the numerical calculation, we have found that the low transmittance has a high sensitivity to the surface morphology, while the high transmittance does not have the high sensitivity.
