The incident occurred at a college campus where the two workers were installing {{a sign on the}} campus Field House. The Field House is approximately 35 feet high and the sign was to be placed on the upper front section of the building. A boom-supported aerial work platform (aerial work platform) was used to elevate the workers.

50|$|Siege of Chittorgarh(year 1567):In October 1567, the Mughal {{forces of}} {{approximately}} 5,000 men led by Akbar surrounded and besieged 8,000 Hindu Rajputs in Chittorgarh Fort. Within a few months, Akbar's ranks expanded to over 50,000 men and possibly more than 60,000 troops {{during the late}} phases of the siege, which ended in a decisive victory of the Mughals. The primary reason for Akbar's attack was because the Rajput had begun to emerge as a dominant power after {{the defeat of the}} Lodi dynasty. The Rajputs were opposed to the rise of the Mughal Empire and often supported Akbar's fellow Muslim rivals including Baz Bahadur, causing much tension in the region. Akbar set out on a series of campaigns against the Rajputs. In the year 1567 he fought many battles against the Rajputs and realized that the Rajput owned Chittorgarh Fort must be eliminated because it was used as a bastion for those who opposed him. On 23 October 1567, Akbar arrived and set up encampments. His personal presence in the battlefield was a message for the Rajput forces inside the fort that the siege was not a temporary affair. The next day, Akbar unleashed his powerful cannons, but within a few days of the siege it was evident that his mortars needed higher elevation. Akbar then ordered his men to build the Mohur Margi (Mohur Hill), also known as Coin Hill. After an arduous siege, Akbar ordered his men to <b>lift</b> <b>baskets</b> of earth during both day and night, {{in order to create a}} hill right in front of the fort by which the Mughal cannons could be placed.

40|$|The neural {{mechanisms}} that support learning and memory are still poorly understood. Much work {{has focused on}} changes in neurotransmitter receptor expression, while changes in voltage-gated ion channel expression have been largely unexplored, {{despite the fact that}} voltage-gated ion channels govern neuronal excitability. Here we used eyeblink conditioning (EBC) in rats, a model of learning and memory with a well-understood neural circuit, to examine regulation of voltage-gated ion channels as a consequence of learning. EBC is a form of classical conditioning that involves pairings of a behaviorally neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) and an eyeblink eliciting unconditioned stimulus (US) over many trials to produce an eyeblink conditioned response (CR) to the CS in anticipation of the US. The acquisition and generation of the eyeblink CR is governed by plasticity at various sites in the cerebellum, both in the cerebellar cortex and the interpositus nucleus (IPN). Purkinje cells (PCs) are the primary neuron in the cerebellar cortex and these cells represent the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. PCs tonically inhibit the neurons of the IPN; the IPN is the start of the eyeblink pathway. In order for a CR to be generated, the inhibition of the IPN by PCs must be <b>lifted.</b> <b>Basket</b> cells (BCs) are small inhibitory interneurons that form synapses near the PC soma. These neurons are strategically located to strongly regulate PC output through inhibitory input near the axon hillock. BC axon terminals have the highest expression of Kv 1. 2, an alpha subunit of the Kv 1 (Shaker) family of voltage-gated potassium channels, in the cerebellum. In addition, significant Kv 1. 2 expression is found on PC dendrites. Blocking Kv 1. 2 leads to increased GABAergic input to PCs and facilitates EBC. In the current work, we addressed the question of whether EBC itself regulates surface expression of Kv 1. 2 in cerebellar cortex. Rats received three days of either EBC, explicitly unpaired stimulus presentations, or no stimuli, and cerebellar tissue was harvested and analyzed via biotinylation/western blot (WB) and multiphoton microscopy (MP) techniques. In the first experiment, the Unpaired group showed significantly reduced surface Kv 1. 2 expression at BC axon terminals as measured by MP, but no changes observed with the WB measure, which measures expression at both BC axon terminals and PC dendrites. The second experiment used the same procedures but examined cerebellar tissue following a shorter training procedure. We hypothesized that the Paired and Unpaired groups would show similar Kv 1. 2 surface expression earlier in training. The Unpaired group showed increased surface Kv 1. 2 compared to the other two groups in the WB measures, but no differences were observed in the MP measure. Paired group rats that did not exhibit CRs showed the same pattern as the Unpaired group. Overall, we observed training and location specific changes in surface Kv 1. 2 expression, suggesting that learning does appear to regulate voltage-gated ion channel expression in the mammalian brain. Increased surface Kv 1. 2 early in training before CR expression emerges may set the stage for other mechanisms to govern the expression of the learned response. Prolonged stimulus input that is unmodulated by expression of a learned response, such as in the Unpaired group in the first experiment, leads to long-term changes in surface Kv 1. 2 expression exclusively at BC axon terminals...|$|R

5000|$|According to {{an article}} in a November 1932 {{magazine}} article in the journal Nature by Herbert Beardsley, [...] "...the male larvae of a white insect, {{about the size of}} a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax. The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the wood oil tree, then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters <b>lift</b> the <b>baskets</b> on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night - for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon - traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market." ...|$|R

60|$|George Stephenson {{was born}} in June, 1781, {{the son of a}} fireman who tended the pumping engine of the {{neighbouring}} colliery, and one of a penniless family of six children. So poor was his father, indeed, that the whole household lived in a single room, with bare floor and mud wall; and little Geordie grew up in his own unkempt fashion without any schooling whatever, not even knowing A from B when he was a big lad of seventeen. At an age when he ought to have been learning his letters, he was bird's-nesting in the fields or running errands to the Wylam shops; {{and as soon as he}} was old enough to earn a few pence by light work, he was set to tend cows at the magnificent wages of twopence a day, in the village of Dewley Burn, close by, to which his father had then removed. It might have seemed at first as though the future railway engineer was going to settle down quietly to the useful but uneventful life of an agricultural labourer; for from tending cows he proceeded in due time (with a splendid advance of twopence) to leading the horses at the plough, spudding thistles, and hoeing turnips on his employer's farm. But the native bent of a powerful mind usually shows itself very early; and even during the days when Geordie was still stumbling across the freshly ploughed clods or driving the cows to pasture with a bunch of hazel twigs, his taste for mechanics already made itself felt in a very marked and practical fashion. During all his leisure time, the future engineer and his chum Bill Thirlwall occupied themselves with making clay models of engines, and fitting up a winding machine with corks and twine like those which <b>lifted</b> the colliery <b>baskets.</b> Though Geordie Stephenson didn't go to school at the village teacher's, he was teaching himself in his own way by close observation and keen comprehension of all the machines and engines he could come across.|$|R

He held on by his father's hand, and ran by his side past the lines of wagons that stretched sometimes from the bridge to the court-house, in the dim morning light. The market-house, where the German butchers in their white aprons were standing behind their meat-blocks, was lit up with candles in sconces, that shone upon festoons of sausage and cuts of steak dangling from the hooks behind them; but without, all was in a vague obscurity, broken only by the lanterns in the farmers' wagons. There was a market-master, who rang a bell to open the market, and if anybody bought or sold anything before the tap of that bell, he would be fined. People would walk along the line of wagons, where the butter and eggs, apples and peaches and melons, were piled up inside near the tail-boards, and stop where they saw something they wanted, and stand near so as to lay hands on it the moment the bell rang.

Motion data were collected from 14 subjects: 10 non-amputees control subjects, 1 person with a transradial amputation, and 3 persons with a transhumeral amputation, in the University of South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s (USF) motion analysis laboratory. Motion capture for each subject consisted of the repetition of a series of range of motion (RoM) tasks and activities of daily living (ADLs), which were recorded using an eight camera Vicon (Oxford, UK) motion analysis system. The control subjects were also asked to repeat the motions while wearing a brace on their dominant arm. The RoM tasks consisted of elbow flexion 2 ̆ 6 extension, forearm pronation 2 ̆ 6 supination, shoulder flexion 2 ̆ 6 extension, shoulder abduction 2 ̆ 6 adduction, shoulder rotation, torso flexion 2 ̆ 6 extension, torso lateral flexion, and torso rotation. The ADLs evaluated were brushing one 2 ̆ 7 s hair, drinking from a cup, eating with a knife and fork, <b>lifting</b> a laundry <b>basket,</b> and opening a door. The impact of bracing and prosthetic devices on the subjects 2 ̆ 7 RoM, and their motion during ADLs was analyzed. The segment geometries of the subjects 2 ̆ 7 upper body were extracted directly from the motion analysis data using a functional joint center method. With this method there are no conventional or segment length differences between recorded data segments and the RHBM. This ensures the accuracy of the RHBM when reconstructing a recorded task, as the model has the same geometry as the recorded data. A detailed investigation of the weighted least norm, probability density gradient projection method, artificial neural networks was performed to optimize the redundancy RHBM inverse kinematics. The selected control algorithm consisted of a combination of the weighted least norm method and the gradient projection of the null space, minimizing the inverse of the probability density function. This method increases the accuracy of the RHBM while being suitable {{for a wide range of}} tasks and observing the required subject constraint inputs...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the modeling of a PWR fuel assembly under dynamic shock loading {{in support of}} the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) shaker test campaign. The focus of the test campaign is on evaluating the response of used fuel to shock and vibration loads that a can occur during highway transport. Modeling began in 2012 using an LS-DYNA fuel assembly model that was first created for modeling impact scenarios. SNL’s proposed test scenario was simulated through analysis and the calculated results helped guide the instrumentation and other aspects of the testing. During FY 2013, the fuel assembly model was refined to better represent the test surrogate. Analysis of the proposed loads suggested the frequency band needed to be lowered to attempt to excite the lower natural frequencies of the fuel assembly. Despite SNL’s expansion of lower frequency components in their five shock realizations, pretest predictions suggested a very mild dynamic response to the test loading. After testing was completed, one specific shock case was modeled, using recorded accelerometer data to excite the model. Direct comparison of predicted strain in the cladding was made to the recorded strain gauge data. The magnitude of both sets of strain (calculated and recorded) are very low, compared to the expected yield strength of the Zircaloy- 4 material. The model was accurate enough to predict that no yielding of the cladding was expected, but its precision at predicting micro strains is questionable. The SNL test data offers some opportunity for validation of the finite element model, but the specific loading conditions of the testing only excite the fuel assembly to respond in a limited manner. For example, the test accelerations were not strong enough to substantially drive the fuel assembly out of contact with the basket. Under this test scenario, the fuel assembly model does a reasonable job of approximating actual fuel assembly response, a claim that can be verified through direct comparison of model results to recorded test results. This does not offer validation for the fuel assembly model in all conceivable cases, such as high kinetic energy shock cases where the fuel assembly might <b>lift</b> off the <b>basket</b> floor to strike to basket ceiling. This type of nonlinear behavior was not witnessed in testing, so the model does not have test data to be validated against. a basis for validation in cases that substantially alter the fuel assembly response range. This leads to a gap in knowledge that is identified through this modeling study. The SNL shaker testing loaded a surrogate fuel assembly with a certain set of artificially-generated time histories. One thing all the shock cases had in common was an elimination of low frequency components, which reduces the rigid body dynamic response of the system. It is not known if the SNL test cases effectively bound all highway transportation scenarios, or if significantly greater rigid body motion than was tested is credible. This knowledge gap could be filled through modeling the vehicle dynamics of a used fuel conveyance, or by collecting acceleration time history data from an actual conveyance under highway conditions...|$|R
40|$|The thirteenth fishing {{operation}} with a long-line having five branch lines {{was carried out}} in the Eastern Indian Ocean by "The T. S. KAGOSHIMA-MARU (G. T. 1, 293 Tons) ", of the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, from May 19 to 31, 1987. The hourly variations of the depth of hooks in the tuna long-line and the hooking depth of tunas and marlins were investigated. The numbering method of hooks was adopted to name the first hooks <b>lifted</b> in each <b>basket</b> as No. 1 and sequently as No. 2, No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5. The results of the analysis are as follows: 1. The recorded depths of hooks ranged from 69 m to 103 m (89 m in average) for No. 1 and No. 5 hooks, 111 m to 154 m (134 m in average) for No. 2 and No. 4 hooks and 122 m to 178 m (154 m in average) for No. 3 hooks. 2. The patterns of hourly variations of the depth recordings were classified into three categories of A, B and C. In the case of the high current velocity obtained from the drift of the long-line, all the data were classified into B or C category. 3. The maximum differences between measured and calculated depths of the hooks were, in average, 16 m for No. 1 and No. 5 hooks, 20 m in same for No. 2, No. 4 and No. 3 hooks. 4. The hooked ratio of yellowfin tuna in each branch line was high in No. 3 and No. 4 hooks showing same value of 27. 4 %, followed by No. 2, No. 1 and No. 5 hooks in order. From these results, the main hooking stratum was estimated to be at the depths of 120 m to 150 m. 5. The hooked ratio of bigeye tuna was 33 % for No. 3 hooks, accounting for 30 % of total catches, with 73. 3 % of total bigeye tuna catch attained No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 hooks. From these results, the main hooking stratum of bigeye tuna was estimated to be at the depths of 140 m to 170 m. 1987 年 5 月 19 日から 31 日の期間,インド洋東部海域において,鹿児島大学水産学部練習船かごしま丸(総トン数 1293 屯) を使用して 5 本付延縄による 13 回の釣獲試験操業を実施した。鮪延縄の釣針の経時変化とマグロ,カジキ類の釣獲深度について検討を試みた。枝縄別の釣針深度は 1, 2, 3 番の枝縄に装着した 3 台の自記式深度計の記録から求め,マグロ,カジキ類の釣獲深度については釣獲野帖から各枝縄別釣獲データを深度別に集計して釣獲層を推定した。釣針の番号の命名方法は各鉢ごとに最初に揚げられた釣針を 1 番とし,以後順番に 2, 3, 4, 5 番釣針と呼ぶことにした。今回の解析の結果は次の通りである。 1. 1, 5 番釣針の実測深度は 69 ~ 103 m(平均 89 m), 2, 4 番釣針で 111 ~ 154 m(平均 134 m), 3 番釣針では 122 ~ 178 m(平均 154 m) であった。 2. 投縄後,釣針が安定するまでの所要時間は 1, 5 番釣針では平均すると約 12 分, 2, 4 番釣針では平均 20 分, 3 番釣針では 18 分を要している。 3. 深度記録の経時変化のパターンをA型,B型,C型の 3 種類に分類して各々の記録を図示した。A型は流速 0. 3 ノット以下であり釣針の計算深度と実測深度の差が極めて小さい。釣針の振幅は小さくてその周期も緩やかに変動している。B型とC型は釣針の計算深度と実測深度の差が 20 m以上あり,幹縄はカテナリー曲線を描いていないと推測される。B型は釣針の上下動の振幅が 10 ~ 20 mで,周期が 15 ~ 60 分ぐらいで変動しておりC型は振幅は 10 ~ 30 m,周期が 1 ~ 5 時間と大きなウネリを伴って上下動している。縄の漂移から求めた流速が大きい時はすべてB型かC型に分類された。 4. 水中での釣針の最大振幅は枝縄別の平均値をとると, 1, 5 番釣針では 16 m, 2, 4 番釣針と 3 番釣針では 20 mと同じ値であった。 5. 深度計を取り付けた鉢の釣針にキハダが釣獲された記録から 20 m以上も上方に枝縄を持ち上げている例を図示した。 6. キハダの枝縄別釣獲割合は 3 番と 4 番で高く, 27. 4 %と同じ値を示し,以下 2, 1, 5 番釣針の順となっている。これらの結果からキハダの主釣獲層は 120 ~ 150 m深と推定した。 7. メバチの枝縄別釣獲割合は 3 番釣針で 33 %と全体の 3 割を占め, 2, 3, 4 番釣針でメバチ全釣獲の 73. 3 %に達している。これらの結果からメバチの主釣獲層は 140 ~ 170 m深と推定した。 8. 各枝縄間の釣獲差について,t検定を行った。キハダについては 4 番と 5 番釣針間には釣獲差について 5 %水準で有意差が認められたが,その他の枝縄間ではキハダ,メバチ共に枝縄間には 5 %水準以下で釣獲差に有意差は認められなかった。 9. 水温鉛直分布によるキハダやメバチの釣獲深度は水温躍層内に存在していた...|$|R
