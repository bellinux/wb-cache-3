5|$|Towers A, B, and C house mostly first-year freshmen. The towers {{are all of}} {{different}} heights, and differ slightly in their <b>living</b> <b>accommodations.</b> Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size, roughly 17ft (5.2m) by 11ft (3.4m). These measurements are not exact, however, because the three towers are cylindrical in shape (although actually twenty-sided) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat trapezoidal.|$|E
