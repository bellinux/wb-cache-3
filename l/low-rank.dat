She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a <b>low-rank</b> fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E

40|$|This article applies DICTION {{computer-assisted}} {{text analysis}} software {{to evaluate the}} tone of research ‘Environment’ submissions by Business and Management Studies schools in the UK’s 2014 Research Evaluation Framework. We find that submissions contain distinctive differences in semantic tone between high-ranked and <b>low-ranked</b> universities, particularly in terms of DICTION’s master variable, ACTIVITY. The language of high-ranked institutions has a tone of low ACTIVITY, whereas the language of <b>low-ranked</b> institutions has a tone of high ACTIVITY. More adjectives are used than expected: by high-ranked universities to bolster strong public reputations, and by <b>low-ranked</b> universities to atone for weaknesses. High-ranked universities are advantaged {{because they are more}} likely to be represented on assessing panels and be better-attuned to reader expectations. The results suggest that <b>low-ranked</b> universities could have achieved higher scores by reflecting on particular areas of word choice and the potential effects of those choices on assessors...|$|R

In terms of knights killed, it was the eighth largest defeat of the Livonian Order in the 13th century.

At the moment the Hungarian cavalry found shelter in the National Palace, when Díaz personally sent for Major Csizmadia and granted him a meeting. The two had known each other {{for quite a long time}} as Csizmadia served as a prison lieutenant in Puebla when Díaz was held as captive there. On one occasion Díaz refused to be taken to the bathroom by a <b>low-rank</b> prison guard when Csizmadia offered to personally escort him there, which was an unusual courtesy. He even invited the General for a lunch at his house, who accepted it. The lieutenant dealt with his inmate amicably and they even attended a bullfight together. Díaz only refused a closer friendship to evolve because he feared to having been labeled pro-Imperialist, and that would have ruined his image. On 20 September 1865 he successfully escaped from the prison using a rope and a dagger with the acquiescence and consent of the Hungarian officer. He praised Csizmadia's generous and noble attitude towards him several times in his later memoirs. This was the reason he was looking for the captured Csizmadia after the siege and allowed him and his Hungarian regiment to move to Vera Cruz and to be taken home on the board of the Austrian ship SMS Novara along with the rest of the Austrian corps. Csizmadia also helped to negotiate the same terms of surrender for the Austrians as well.|$|E
500|$|Bajo Pivljanin ( [...] – May 1685) was a hajduk {{commander}} mostly {{active in}} the Ottoman territories of Herzegovina and southern Dalmatia. Born in Piva, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, he was an oxen trader who allegedly left his village after experiencing Ottoman injustice. Mentioned in 1654 as a brigand during the Venetian–Ottoman war, he entered {{the service of the}} Republic of Venice in 1656. The hajduks were used to protect Venetian Dalmatia. He remained a <b>low-rank</b> hajduk for the following decade, participating in some notable operations such as the raid on Trebinje. Between 1665 and 1668 he quickly rose through the ranks to the level of harambaša ("bandit leader"). After the war, which ended unfavourably for the Venetians, the hajduks were moved out of their haven in the Bay of Kotor under Ottoman pressure. Between 1671 and 1684 Pivljanin, along with other hajduks and their families, were refugees in Dalmatia. Upon renewed conflict, he was returned to the Bay of Kotor and placed in charge of defending the frontier; in 1685 he and his band fell in battle against the advancing Ottoman governor of Scutari. Regarded {{as one of the most}} distinguished hajduks of his time, he is praised in Serbian epic poetry.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{portfolios}} comprising high‐ranked corporate social performance (CSP) firms out/underperform portfolios comprised of <b>low‐ranked</b> CSP firms. The authors employed a US sample covering the period 1998 ‐ 2007. Design/methodology/approach – In the context of the Fama and French model augmented by momentum and industry factors, the authors test the significance of the alpha for a CSP difference portfolio, defined as high‐ranked minus <b>low‐ranked</b> CSP stocks. Findings – The results are consistent with the “no‐linkage” hypothesis, which argues that no significant difference in the risk‐adjusted performance is expected between high‐ and <b>low‐ranked</b> CSP‐formed portfolios. Furthermore, little evidence was found that high‐ or <b>low‐ranked</b> CSP‐formed portfolios, irrespective of the portfolio formation type, systematically differ with regard to performance, size, book‐to‐market or momentum factors. Originality/value – The authors employ sustainability CSP rankings that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality factors, in contrast to many prior studies that solely use KLD ratings or just focus on a subarea of CSP. Moreover, the authors' dataset considerably improves upon previous studies employing similar data in which individual company rankings are not available. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The Ultimate Fighting Championship {{considers}} {{its official}} rankings (decided by a media pool, based on match results) when matchmaking, though not strictly. Due {{to the high}} incidence of training injuries, unranked or <b>low-ranked</b> replacement fighters often compete higher up the ladder than they otherwise would. This is also (more rarely, usually on pay-per-view) done for promotional reasons, when a big name or rivalry makes a <b>low-ranked</b> fighter the more marketable option. Sometimes no similarly-ranked opponents are available, and a fighter may risk losing their spot to a <b>low-ranked</b> one just to stay busy. Winners are interviewed after fights, and all fighters are required to use Twitter. Challenges through these avenues (and others) are encouraged. Though not binding, a publicly agreed fight usually occurs as soon as practical. Rematches are generally disallowed, excepting some championship bouts and others ending in controversial decisions.|$|R
