5000|$|Long irons are {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} most difficult to hit, because their <b>low</b> <b>loft</b> gives them a very small striking face and [...] "sweet spot" [...] compared to higher-lofted irons. As such, they are less commonly seen in players' bags, usually replaced with higher-lofted fairway woods like the 5 and 7, or with hybrid clubs that have similar overall performance but are easier to hit. The 2-iron, like the driving iron, is virtually never seen in modern sets, due to both its difficulty and to a [...] "de-lofting" [...] of modern cavity-backed irons which increases the average distance of shorter irons. If the long irons are used, they are often seen with graphite shafts to add additional clubhead speed to the average golfer's swing by storing energy from the downswing and releasing it at impact. Hybrid clubs that replace these irons also often have graphite shafts for the same reason.|$|E

5000|$|The irons from 2 to 4 are {{typically}} called the [...] "long irons"; {{they have the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>lofts</b> and the longest shafts, and are designed {{to hit the ball}} long distances (180-260 yards) with a low launch angle. They {{are typically}} used from the fairway or rough, but are also useful in trouble spots such as when [...] "punching out" [...] from underneath a stand of trees.|$|R
5000|$|The putting green, {{or simply}} the green, {{is an area}} of very closely trimmed grass on {{relatively}} even, smooth ground surrounding the hole, allowing players to make precision strokes on it. To [...] "putt" [...] is to play a stroke on this surface, usually with the eponymous [...] "putter" [...] club, which has very <b>low</b> <b>loft</b> so that the ball rolls smoothly along the ground, and hopefully into the cup. The shape and topology of the green can vary almost without limit, but for practical purposes the green is usually flatter than other areas of the course, though gentle slopes and undulations can add extra challenge to players who must account for these variations in their putting line. The green typically does not include any fully enclosed hazards such as sand or water; however, these hazards can be - and often are - placed adjacent to the green, and depending on the shape of the green and surrounding hazards, and the location of the hole (which often changes from day to day to promote even wear of the turf of the green), there may not be a direct putting line from a point on the green to the cup.|$|E

30|$|Polyester fiber battings, {{commonly}} used in upholstered seats, provide a significant barrier effect when tested with smoldering cigarette ignition ([Gandhi & Spivak 1994]). However, it fails to protect the underlying cushioning material when an open flaming ignition source is used ([Damant GH. et al. 1994]). The polyester fiber melts away from the smoldering cigarette and extinguishes, whereas the polymer melt burns {{in the presence of}} flaming ignition. Once ignited, the molten polymer burns vigorously, resulting in substantial weight loss and increased temperature of the system. Thus, the polyester fiber batting acts as an additional fuel and the whole system fails. Recent studies on the flammability of cushions with polyester fiber wraps (<b>low</b> <b>loft</b> batting) in our laboratories have shown that the presence of polyester wrap increases the PHRR when compared to analog systems without polyester fiber wrap ([Davis et al. 2009]). This study suggests that, regardless of the type of FR-PUF and/or cover fabric, polyester fiber promotes the composite system to burn vigorously.|$|E

5000|$|The 1 iron, {{or driving}} iron, is the <b>lowest</b> <b>lofted</b> and longest iron (14 or 16 degrees of loft), {{although}} Wilson {{did make a}} 0 iron for John Daly. Often called a butter knife because of its looks, the 1 iron has the least surface area on its face and so is commonly regarded as the most difficult club in the bag to hit. The driving iron is virtually obsolete as its nominal range easily falls into that of the easier-to-hit fairway woods, although some sets still include one {{and it can be}} purchased separately as a custom club.

40|$|AbstractGolf club fitting is {{becoming}} a more and more precise science. In the last 10 years, {{a number of different}} devices have become available to club fitters for measuring either the flight of the golf ball (e. g. Trackman™ and Flightscope® radar devices) or just the initial launch conditions (e. g. Vector Pro™ and 3 Trak® camera devices, Golf AchieverTM laser device). In 2008, PING released the nFlight® fitting software to tie in with any of these devices, capture data, digitally analyze and scientifically compare every aspect of every shot taken by a golfer to provide the best possible golf club fitting. One challenge arising from this approach was how to account for large differences in golf ball construction and performance, both in the initial launch conditions immediately after impact and the resultant ball flight. In particular, many golf courses use various kinds of range balls in practice and fitting areas. To conduct a golf club fitting using data derived from these balls could be misleading and result in inappropriate club choices. For example, a driver fitting using an exceptionally high spin ball could result in a <b>low</b> <b>loft</b> and stiff shaft being chosen to minimize the spin rate when actually the high spin is {{due to the nature of}} the ball used in the fitting rather than aspects of the golfer’s swing. To account for these differences and ensure accurate data from a golf club fitting, the nFlight® fitting software provides a way to convert launch data from one category of golf ball into another. So far over 60 different brands of ball have been subjected to static, robot and player comparison testing including at least 1500 shots hit by Ping Man, PING’s robotic testing machine. A cluster analysis was used to group similar golf balls into various categories and C# code in the nFlight® fitting software was used to manage the data conversion. The poster describes the testing conducted, the methods behind the cluster analysis and the patent-pending nFlight® fitting software application of the data conversion...|$|E
5000|$|Woods are {{numbered}} {{in ascending order}} starting with the driver, or 1-wood, which has the <b>lowest</b> <b>loft</b> (usually between 9 and 13 degrees), and continuing with progressively higher lofts and numbers. Most modern woods are sold as individual clubs allowing the player to customize their club set, but matched sets of woods, especially {{as part of a}} complete club set, are readily available. Odd-numbered lofts are most common in players' bags, though 2- and 4-woods are available in many model lines. The number of the club is mainly a reference for the player to easily identify the clubs; the actual loft angle of a particular number varies between manufacturers, and there is often some overlap of lofts (one 3-wood might be higher-lofted than a 4-wood of a different brand or model). Other identifiers have been utilized such as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "plus" [...] to differentiate various lofts within a line of clubs.|$|R

2500|$|Golf {{clubs have}} {{traditionally}} been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively [...] "open" [...] lies, such as the tee box and fairway. Of particular importance is the driver or [...] "1-wood", which is the <b>lowest</b> <b>lofted</b> wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to , or more, in a professional golfer's hands. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used {{for a variety of}} shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates {{our current}} {{knowledge}} of pollution outflow from Asia using simulations from the LMDz-INCA global model {{combined with the}} available satellite observations of CO {{during the spring of}} 2005. CO is measured by several space-borne instruments using different techniques, allowing complementary perspectives. The CO observations from the MOPITT and SCIAMACHY nadir sounders, which provide vertically integrated information with excellent horizontal sampling, and from the ACE-FTS solar occultation instrument, which has limited spatial coverage but allows the retrieval of vertical profiles, are used. Combining observations from MOPITT (mainly sensitive to the free troposphere) and SCIAMACHY (sensitive to the full column) allow the evaluation of the boundary layer CO. Underestimated emissions in eastern Asia, and possibly too <b>low</b> <b>lofting</b> in the model, lead to an underestimate of the export to the free troposphere, as highlighted by comparisons with MOPITT and ACE-FTS. Both instruments observe large trans-Pacific transport extending from ~ 20 &deg; N to ~ 60 &deg; N, with high upper tropospheric CO observed by ACE-FTS above the eastern Pacific (with values of up to 300 ppbv around 50 &deg; N at 500 hPa and up to ~ 200 ppbv around 30 &deg; N at 300 hPa). The low vertical and horizontal resolutions of the global model do not allow the simulation of the strong enhancements in the observed plumes. However, the transport patterns are well captured, and are mainly attributed to export from eastern Asia, with increasing contributions from South Asia and Indonesia towards the tropics. Additional measurements of C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 6 and HCN by ACE-FTS provide further information on the plume history. C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 6 enhancements are well correlated with the CO plumes, indicating common sources and rapid trans-Pacific transport.
