A macroscopic traffic flow model, derived from the GSOM family (generic second order modeling), is used to propagate the flow of vehicles running on cold engines. The model is dynamic, it is compatible with cross-entropy dynamic assignment, and can thus be used with various levels of data availability.

The boundary forces acting there as a byproduct of elastic stresses are responsible for delamination, i. e., progressive failure of adhesive bonds. This phenomenon is mathematically represented by a boundary variable that represents the <b>local</b> <b>fraction</b> of active bonds and is assumed to satisfy a doubly nonlinear ODE.

It is a fundamental assumption of secret sharing protocols that not all players are trusted parties, and that some may collude amongst themselves and with eavesdroppers to break confidentiality. To this extent, quantum secret sharing introduces a new layer of security, enabling eavesdropping detection via entangled states and noncommuting observables.
