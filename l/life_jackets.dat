5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942. As her {{whaleboat}} was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell overboard {{and failed to}} ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of life vest on that required being inflated by mouth. This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that Omahas boarding party's return to wearing the older style <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> that had proven themselves effective {{even though they were}} more cumbersome and bulky.|$|E
5|$|Across coastal areas, {{the storm}} surge {{flooding}} caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, two {{people who did not}} evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> though the woman returned safely to the boat. The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Moderate wind gusts caused scattered power outages and downed some trees across the northeast portion of the state. Overall, property damage in the state rose to about $390,000 (2006USD) in total.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing <b>life</b> <b>jackets.</b>|$|E

50|$|Collision at Sea: The Nautilus {{becomes a}} <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> for an injured whale.|$|R
25|$|According to {{an account}} given by four survivors, {{who managed to}} swim to nearby Sibuyan Island, Princess of the Stars had not malfunctioned (as had been {{previously}} reported), but ran into rough seas {{off the coast of}} Romblon. At 11:30am, passengers had been told to put on <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> and fifteen minutes later, the captain gave the order to abandon ship. The ship began to tilt at around midday. The survivors witnessed many people jumping into the water, while some made it onto life rafts. Many of them were not wearing <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> and according to the four survivors, the crew were more concerned with saving themselves than with assisting the passengers. The ferry finally capsized at 1 pm noontime.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{passengers}} survived the collision. Passengers {{who were able}} to see downstream became aware of the rapidly closing motions of the vessels, and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent. Fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty. Three others were briefly trapped under the George Prince. The last survivor had run back to his vehicle, thinking he would be safer in his truck. After the collision, he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window. Only one survivor had a life jacket before going into the water, but had not had time to put it on. Two others found <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> floating in the river, which they used for a short time, but neither man had time to properly don the <b>life</b> <b>jackets.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ancient {{instances}} of the <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> {{can be traced}} back to simple blocks of wood or cork used by Norwegian seamen. The modern <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who, in 1854, created a cork vest to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.|$|R
25|$|Today these {{air chamber}} vests are {{commonly}} referred to as 'inflatable <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> or vests' and are available not only for commercial applications but also for those engaged in recreational boating, fishing, sailing, kayaking and canoeing. They are available in a variety of styles and are generally more comfortable and less bulky than traditional foam vests.|$|E
25|$|While the USCG {{does not}} certify {{personal}} flotation devices for animals, many manufacturers produce <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> for dogs and cats.

25|$|Quality <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> always {{provide more}} {{buoyancy}} than {{offered by the}} buoyancy aids alone. The positioning of the buoyancy on the wearer's torso is such that a righting moment (rotational force) results that will eventually turn most persons who are floating {{face down in the}} water (for example, because they are unconscious) into a face up orientation with their bodies inclined backward, unlike more simply designed common foam buoyancy vests.|$|E
25|$|Drifting in open {{seas and}} {{international}} waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by military forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> are often {{attached to a}} vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio (walkie-talkie), emergency beacon (406MHz frequency), signal mirror, sea marker dye, smoke or light signal flares, strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.|$|E

When the captain inquired about the rescue, the VTS replied that patrol boats were due to arrive in 10 minutes and a helicopter in one minute. The captain then replied that there were too many passengers for the helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Rafting is {{very popular}} in Lehigh Gorge State Park. The Lehigh River is rated a Class III river on the International Scale of River Difficulty, {{although}} this depends on the water conditions, which are generally best in the spring. The conditions are controlled {{by the amount of}} rainfall in the area and by the amount of water released from the Francis E. Walter Dam at White Haven by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. All boaters must wear <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> that are in compliance with the rules and regulations of the United States Coast Guard. Several licensed commercial outfitters currently operate on the Lehigh River. This first white water rafting outfitter to operate on the Lehigh River was , founded in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba divers dived {{without a}} {{buoyancy}} aid. In an emergency {{they had to}} jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> (ABLJ) became available, {{which can be used}} to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.|$|E
