The significant differences between perceptions of superintendents, principals, assistant principals, deans, counselors, and teachers regarding discipline problems in selected Illinois public high schools were investigated. Results from a questionnaire concerning high school discipline were received from 688 educators in 103 high schools. The study was descriptive in nature and was composed of three parts. The first part described the demographic characteristics of the 688 respondents and their respective high schools. Part II contained results of the chi-square analyses of the data regarding perceptions of the respondents and ten research questions. A. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypotheses. Part III discussed findings from previous studies as they compared to this study.
