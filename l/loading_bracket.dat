40|$|As part of {{the digital}} {{manufacturing}} technology, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has re-ceived the special attention in fabricating titanium component in a cost-efficient fashion. However, it has been recognised {{that there are many}} issues have influenced the growth of titanium AM deployment, among which the high cost and the low availability of AM qualified titanium powder are the critical issues. Nevertheless, a novel titanium powder extraction method, the Metalysis process, promises to offer the current market signifi-cantly cheaper and more accessible titanium in its powder form. Such recent event of the titanium powder commoditisation underlines the importance of investigating the future of titanium AM. This thesis analyses the future of AM from the perspective of AM economics, which is demonstrated from the manufacturing costs and the value-added applications com-pared with the conventional manufacturing (CM) methods, namely, investment casting and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining. Apparently, the titanium powder commoditisation resulted from Metalysis process has attracted both the interest of AM manufacturers and that of traditional manufacturers. However, titanium powder re-quires an additional powder solidification process before it can be utilised in some CM methods. Consequently, the extra steps might increase the overall production time and expense, thus weakening the attractiveness of cheap Metalysis titanium powder. Thus, this research investigates the competitiveness of AM economics by taking into account of both the benefits and the disadvantages that Metaysis titanium powder could bring onto CM methods. Based on the Scenario Modelling analysis of a multi-case study of Ti 6 Al 4 V Low-pressure turbine blade (LPB) and Jet engine <b>loading</b> <b>bracket</b> (ELB), utilising 75 % cheaper Metalysis titanium powder generates a significant enhancement in the economics of AM (LPB cost is reduced by 26, 9 % via AM, and ELB cost is reduced by 39, 7 % via AM). Moreover, utilising titanium in its powder form more clearly influences the economics of AM when compared with CNC machining, than compared with investment casting (maximum production Break-Even Quantity [BEQ] increased by 35, 9 % compared with investment casting, whereas by 66, 7 % when compared with CNC machining). By synthesising the value-added applications and advantages of deploying AM technology, AM has then proven to be a convenient economical alternative to CM. From a broad perspective, this thesis suggests that the metallic properties of raw material as well as its supply chain configuration are essential enabling factors for AM to be a conveniently economical manufacturing alternative to CM methods...|$|E

40|$|Assessment of {{constituent}} loads in rivers {{is essential}} to evaluate water quality of streams and estuaries; however uncertainty in load estimation may be large and must be considered and communicated together with estimates. In this comparative study, the usefulness of two existing methods (bootstrap and Bayesian inference) to assess uncertainty in constituent loads estimated with an improved eight-parameter rating curve is demonstrated. Bootstrap prediction intervals and Bayesian credible intervals were estimated for daily and monthly loads obtained with a rating curve applied to routine monitoring sampling datasets of nitrate (NO 3 -N), reactive phosphorus (RP), and total phosphorus (TP) of the Duck River, in Tasmania (Australia). Predicted loads and prediction intervals were compared to benchmark loads obtained by an independent, high frequency monitoring program. The eight-parameter rating curve resulted in better prediction of NO 3 -N and TP than RP loads. Both inference methods successfully generated prediction intervals. The bracketing frequency (i. e. the fraction of prediction intervals that comprised benchmark loads) of bootstrap prediction intervals was 50 - 65 % of daily or monthly benchmark <b>loads.</b> <b>Bracketing</b> frequency of Bayesian credible intervals was consistently higher, and included 74 - 85 % of benchmark daily loads and 80 % or more of benchmark monthly loads. Both methods proved to be robust {{to the presence of}} an artificial outlier. Prediction intervals were affected by the distribution of the regression error, hence they reflected uncertainty in the regression dataset and limitations in the rating curve formulation. They did not account for other sources of uncertainty, i. e. they were still conservative predictions of load uncertainty. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R

The results of the present study showed that the location of the <b>load,</b> type of <b>bracket</b> material, and accordingly, stress distribution inside the bracket-cement-enamel system are significant parameters in strength testing, selection of type of bracket, and debonding method. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the influence of different bracket base designs and different orthodontic adhesives on the bond strength and stress distribution of orthodontic brackets.|$|R
40|$|Numerical limit {{analyses}} {{are applied to}} evaluate the self-weight bearing capacity factor for a rigid surface footing with a smooth or rough interface. To isolate {{the effect of the}} self-weight on the bearing capacity, the soil is modeled as a cohesionless frictional Mohr-Coulomb material. Assuming an associated flow rule, the true collapse <b>load</b> is <b>bracketed</b> to within 3. 42 % by computing rigorous lower and upper bound solutions using recently developed limit analysis methods [Lyamin and Sloan, 2002 a. Upper bound limit analysis using linear finite elements and non-linear programming. International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics 26 (2), 181; Lyamin and Sloan, 2002 b. Lower bound limit analysis using linear finite elements and non-linear programming. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 55 (5), 573]. With these sharp bounds, the average bearing capacity factor provides an excellent estimate of the exact bearing capacity factor that can be used with confidence for design purposes. The numerical formulations of both the upper and the lower bound theorems are obtained by means of finite elements and solved using efficient non-linear mathematical programming schemes. The solutions, presented in the form of graphs, are compared against existing semi-empirical expressions and numerical solutions. An approximate analytical expression for N-gamma is suggested {{at the end of the}} paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in vitro, the shear bond {{strength}} presented by three brands of polycrystalline ceramic brackets and one brand of metallic bracket; verify the adhesive remnant index (ARI) after the tests, and analyze, through {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) the enamel surface topography after debonding, detecting the release of mineral particles. METHODS: Sixty bovine lower incisors were used. Three ceramic brackets (Allure(r), InVu(r), and Clarity(r)) and one metallic bracket (Geneus(r)) were bonded with Transbond XT(r). Kruskal-Wallis's test (significance level set at 5 %) {{was applied to the}} results of share bond and ARI. Mann Whitney's test was performed to compare the pairs of brackets in relation to their ARI. Brown-Forsythe's test (significance level set at 5 %) was applied to the results of enamel chemical composition. Comparisons between groups were made with Games-Howell's and the Post-hoc tests. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in relation to the shear {{bond strength}} <b>loads.</b> Clarity(r) <b>brackets</b> were the most affected in relation to the surface topography and to the release of mineral particles of enamel (calcium ions). CONCLUSION: With regard to the ARI, there was a prevalence of score 4 (40. 4 %). As for enamel surface topography, the Geneus(r) bracket was the only one which did not show superficial tissue loss. The InVu(r) and Clarity(r) ones showed cohesive fractures in 33. 3 % and the Allure(r) in 50 %, the latter being the one that presented most fractures during removal...|$|R
40|$|Sinkholes are surface {{depressions}} or shafts {{resulting from}} {{the collapse of a}} submerged cavity in soil. The cavities that lead to sinkholes form as a result of underlying geology in limestone areas, or as a result of human activity such as mining or leakage from a sewer. The formation of sinkholes is often sudden and can lead to extensive damage and loss of life, especially in urban areas. Much of the literature on the subject of sinkhole formation is empirical in nature, often being associated with specific locations. This paper presents the results of a study, using numerical modeling, of the undrained stability of the submerged cavities that lead to sinkhole formation. Finite-element limit analysis techniques (using programs developed at the University of Newcastle) are used to obtain upper and lower bound values of a suitable <b>load</b> parameter, which <b>bracket</b> the exact solution.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} silica dioxide (SiO 2) nanofillers in different bonding systems on shear bond strength (SBS) and mode of failure of orthodontic brackets at two experimental times. Methods: Ninety-six intact premolars were divided into four groups: A) Conventional acid-etch and primer Transbond XT; B) Transbond Plus self-etch primer; and two self-etch bonding systems reinforced with silica dioxide nanofiller at different concentrations: C) Futurabond DC at 1 %; D) Optibond All-in-One at 7 %. Each group was allocated into two subgroups (n = 12) according to experimental time (12 and 24 hours). SBS test was performed using a universal testing machine. ARI scores were determined under a stereomicroscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {{were used to determine}} the size and distribution of nanofillers. One-way ANOVA was used to compare SBS followed by the post-hoc Tukey test. The chi-square test was used to evaluate ARI scores. Results: Mean SBS of Futurabond DC and Optibond All-in-One were significantly lower than conventional system, and {{there were no significant differences}} between means SBS obtained with all self-etch bonding systems used in the study. Lower ARI scores were found for Futurabond DC and Optibond All-in-One. There was no significant difference of SBS and ARI obtained at either time points for all bonding systems. Relative homogeneous distribution of the fillers was observed with the bonding systems. Conclusion: Two nanofilled systems revealed the lowest bond strengths, but still clinically acceptable and less adhesive was left on enamel.

Therefore, {{the objective of}} this investigation is to evaluate the initial distribution patterns and magnitude of compressive stress in the periodontal ligament (PDL) in a simulation of orthodontic intrusion of maxillary incisors, considering the points of force application. Methods: Anatomic 3 D models reconstructed from cone-beam computed tomography scans were used to simulate maxillary incisors intrusion loading. The points of force application selected were: centered between central incisors <b>brackets</b> (<b>LOAD</b> 1); bilaterally between the brackets of central and lateral incisors (LOAD 2); bilaterally distal to the brackets of lateral incisors (LOAD 3); bilaterally 7 mm distal to the center of brackets of lateral incisors (LOAD 4). Results and Conclusions: Stress concentrated at the PDL apex region, irrespective of the point of orthodontic force application. The four load models showed distinct contour plots and compressive stress values over the midsagittal reference line. The contour plots of central and lateral incisors were not similar in the same load model. LOAD 3 resulted in more balanced compressive stress distribution...|$|R
40|$|Different angle {{brackets}} for anchoring solid wooden panels were tested {{to learn about}} their response and basic mechanical properties on the acting load in two perpendicular directions. Namely, previous tests showed two distinct cases of panel deformation. In one case the panel mainly rotates around its compressed corner. In the other case the panel slips along foundation and deforms into parallelogram shape. Based on this knowledge, the tests were designed to simulate these two cases of deformation. The two tests were named »up-lift test« and »slip test«. The tests were carried out on cross laminated and unidirectional laminated wooden panels segments anchored by BMF and WÜRTH {{angle brackets}}. To obtain reliable mechanical characteristics three different loading protocols were applied. Loading protocols to simulate realistic <b>loads</b> on angle <b>brackets</b> were monotonous, according to standard EN 26891, and cyclic or semi-cyclic according to standard prEN 12512.

40|$|This paper focuses {{mainly on}} the {{stability}} of a square tunnel in cohesive–frictional soils subjected to surcharge loading. Large-size noncircular tunnels are quickly becoming a widespread building technology {{by virtue of the}} development of advanced tunneling machines. The stability of square tunnels in cohesive–frictional soils subjected to surcharge loading has been investigated theoretically and numerically, assuming plane strain conditions. Despite the importance of this problem, previous research on the subject is very limited. At present, no generally accepted design or analysis method is available to evaluate the stability of tunnels or openings in cohesive–frictional soils. In this study, a continuous loading is applied to the ground surface, and both smooth and rough interface conditions between the loading and soil are modelled. For a series of tunnel geometries and material properties, rigorous lower and upper bound solutions for the ultimate surcharge loading of the considered soil mass are obtained by applying recently developed numerical limit analysis techniques. The results obtained are presented in the form of dimensionless stability charts for practical convenience, with the actual surcharge <b>loads</b> being closely <b>bracketed</b> from above and below. As a handy practical means, upper bound rigid-block mechanisms for square tunnels have also been developed, and the obtained values of collapse loads were compared with the results from numerical limit analysis to verify the accuracy of both approaches. Finally, an expression that approximates the ultimate surcharge load of cohesive–frictional soils with the inclusion of shallow square tunnels has been devised for use by practicing engineers...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{research}} on high strain rate effects on wood since the 1950 s has been on impact loading. Very limited work has been conducted on full-scale wood specimens under blast loading. In North America, the prevalence of these structures makes them susceptible to unintended blast effects. The question on how to retrofit and protect these structures against blast loads has still not been addressed adequately, and design provisions for new wood structures against blast are not comprehensive. Far-field explosion effects were simulated using the University of Ottawa shock tube. Twenty-five light-frame wood stud walls were tested dynamically. The research program aimed to determine the response of light-frame wood stud walls to blast loads that correspond to the heavy to blow-out damage levels. The results showed that, under idealized simply supported end conditions, the stud walls failed in flexure. Under heavier loads, ripping of sheathing commonly used in light-frame wood structures was observed, which caused premature failure of the assembly because the load was not fully distributed to the studs. The use of stiffer sheathing or reinforcing the sheathing provided a better load path and the wall was capable of reaching its full capacity. The effect of using realistic boundary connection details was investigated, and the results showed that typical connection detailing performed poorly under blast <b>loads.</b> Designed steel <b>brackets</b> connecting the studs to the rim-joist allowed for the studs to reach their full capacity. An analytical single degree-of-freedom model was generated using material properties obtained from static testing. The model was validated using the experimental results from the shock tube testing. Also, a catcher system consisting of welded-wire-mesh was incorporated into the wall system in order to diminish debris throw...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The launching, acceleration {{and stability of}} MHD outflows were studied numerically in two and three dimensions using a parallelized version of the ZEUS code. The launching from Keplerian accretion disks was investigated using time-dependent simulations, to determine parameter dependence and stability to 3 D perturbations. The most critical factors controlling the cold outflows from the disk surface {{were found to be}} the poloidal magnetic field profile and the mass discharge rate: together they determine the acceleration of gas away from the disk, and the location of the Alfven surface, which, in turn, fixes the angular momentum loss and the asymptotic speed. The flows were found to be remarkably stable in 3 D against perturbations of the initial conditions, at least in the formation region of the jet before the Alfven surface. This is surprising in the context of previous studies. Intermittent flows are found when the mass discharge rate is too large for a given magnetic field profile. This may be relevant to some observed episodic sources. This intermittency can be suppressed if the mass loading has the angular dependence suggested by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism, namely that the discharge {{is a function of the}} angle θ between the poloidal fieldline threading the disk and the rotation axis, turning off when θ[ [...] . ] 30 °. The mechanism of intermittency sets up a maximum mass loading to the observed smooth jets, may explain those that are pulsed, and shows a possible transition back and forth between both regimes. The result presented here may be compared to some recently published papers which suggest that intermittency could occur if the mass loading is too small: here it occurs when it is too large. If both results are generic, mass <b>loading</b> is <b>bracketed</b> for steady flows. Launching from disks was simulated using a cold disk and atmosphere. The number of boundary conditions that was imposed on the disk surface is what is necessary and sufficient to take into account information propagating upstream from the fast and Alfven critical surfaces, avoiding over-determination of the flow and unphysical effects, such as numerical "boundary layers" that otherwise isolate the disk from the flow, produce impulsive accelerations and confuse the connection between the disk parameters and the flow. The solar wind provides another example of an MHD outflow, using the high solar latitude observations by the satellite Ulysses. The simulations performed here allowed an estimate of the mean value of the azimuthal velocity, which is not directly accessible to measurement, and is necessary to estimate the torque of the solar wind. The Alfven point was found to be located at ~ 11 R[ [...] . ]. Similar outflows from faster rotators were simulated, and found to be collimated along the rotational axis...|$|R
