5000|$|Diaporthe toxica is a plant {{endophyte}} {{and occasionally}} a plant pathogen. [...] D. toxica produces secondary metabolites {{that result in}} toxicoses of animals such as <b>lupinosis</b> of sheep. Mycotoxic <b>lupinosis</b> is a disease caused by lupin material that is infected with the fungus. The fungus produces mycotoxins called phomopsins, which cause liver damage. <b>Lupinosis</b> has been incorrectly attributed to Diaporthe woodii but has now {{been shown to be}} a mycotoxicosis caused by the recently discovered (1994) teleomorphic fungus Diaporthe toxica. [...] The discovery and naming of this new fungus concludes over a century of investigation into the cause of <b>lupinosis</b> since the first outbreak in Germany in 1872.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lupinosis</b> in grazing sheep {{is often}} {{associated}} with a potentially deleterious increase in the concentration of copper in the liver. Siromin®, a mineral mix developed by CSIRO for sheep on dry herbage and containing Cu at 116 mg/kg, was tested for its suitability for use with sheep consuming toxic lupin stubble, taking particular regard for dangers of Cu toxicity. There were three dietary treatments applied at two levels (either present or absent) to 40 Merino wethers for 8 weeks. Treatments consisted of adding Cu (10 mg Cu as CuSO 4 /kg), minerals (25 g/kg as Siromin®) and toxic lupin stubble (50 g/kg) to a basal diet consisting of oaten hay and lupin seed and containing 3 mg/kg of Cu. Toxic lupin stubble decreased feed intake and growth, increased plasma activities of liver enzymes and increased plasma concentrations of protein, globulin, bilirubin, Cu and Zn. It also decreased concentrations of Zn and Fe in liver, but had no effect on Cu. The mineral mix had no adverse effects on any signs of <b>lupinosis,</b> and it did not increase liver Cu concentration at either level of dietary Cu. The mineral mix prevented the inappetence caused by <b>lupinosis</b> in sheep fed the low Cu basal diet. Cu treatment resulted in increased concentrations of Cu and Fe in liver, and exacerbated some signs of <b>lupinosis.</b> The results show that the mineral mix is safe to feed to sheep grazing toxic lupin stubble, and it may provide a practical means of supplying additional Zn. The exacerbation of signs of <b>lupinosis</b> by the addition of only 10 mg Cu/kg as CuS 04 suggests that under field conditions the supply of Cu in the absence of suitable amounts of molybdenum and sulfur should be kept to a minimum...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lupinosis</b> {{of sheep}} has been {{sporadically}} investigated {{from the earliest}} times when the injurious nature of the bitter principle of lupins was recognized. During the last century, disease caused by the consumption of lupins was separated into two distinct entities: (i) that due to the alkaloids contained in the seed, and (ii) that associated with the consumption of lupin roughage and now termed ‘lupinosis’. The latter condition was investigated to some extent in Northern Germany beginning about 1860, and was {{shown to be a}} toxic liver degeneration. In Western Australia, <b>lupinosis</b> is limited essentially to sheep grazing dry standing lupins during the summer, its occurrence follow-ing periods of rainfall and high humidity. The main clinical and pathological features were described by BENNETTS ~ and GAR DINER^. This paper extends these earlier findings with particular emphasis on the histopathology of <b>lupinosis,</b> as seen in some 500 affected sheep during the course of 5 years. Materials and Methods Animals Material from three sources was available: (i) liver from affected sheep in natural outbreaks, (ii) controlled pen trials, contributing 118 sheep in 11 tests, and (iii) controlled field trials providing an additional 356 sheep in 33 tests on eleven properties. The sheep used in (ii) and (iii) were young, clinically healthy Merino wethers having no previous experience of lupins. Internal parasites were eliminated o...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lupinosis</b> was induced in Merino ewes by {{subcutaneous}} {{injections of}} phomopsins. Liver damage and impairment of liver function {{was measured by}} increases in plasma activities of glutamate dehydrogenase and gamma glutamyl transferase, plasma concentrations of bilirubin, and plasma clearance of bromosulfthalein. The wool growth of the ewes during and after exposure to phomopsins at different periods relative to mating was measured, {{and the impact of}} <b>lupinosis</b> on annual wool production assessed. Phomopsin administration decreased the length of staple grown during, and for at least 6 weeks after, exposure to phomopsins. Mean fibre diameter of wool grown during this time was also reduced. Annual wool production of the ewes was affected by exposure to phomopsins, with effects noted on fleece weight, yield, fibre diameter, strength and position of break. These effects were minor and varied between experiments. The adverse effects of reproduction on annual wool production were more significant than those of phomopsins...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lupinosis</b> was induced in Merino ewes by {{subcutaneous}} {{injections of}} phomopsin toxins, given for 2 weeks before {{and up to}} 2 weeks {{after the start of}} joining, and the reproductive performance of the injected ewes was compared with untreated control ewes. Two experiments were conducted in consecutive years, with similar results. The liver damage and impairment of liver function due to <b>lupinosis</b> were measured by increases in plasma activities of glutamate dehydrogenase and gamma glutamyl transferase, plasma concentration of bilirubin, and plasma clearance of bromosulfthalein. Ovulation rate was depressed by phomopsin administration (1. 11 v. 1. 33 for the combined phomopsin-treated and control ewes, P < 0. 001), and fewer phomopsin-treated ewes were pregnant (70. 4 % for the combined phomopsin-treated ewes v. 93. 8 % for the combined control ewes, P < 0. 01). Thus, fewer lambs were born to the phomopsin-treated ewes compared with the control ewes (66. 0 v. 109. 3 % for the combined years, P < 0. 01). These results indicate that there may be severe detrimental effects of phomopsin intoxication on reproductive performance of ewes. Keywords: phomopsins; ovulation; reproductio...|$|E
40|$|Phomopsis blight in Lupinus albus {{is caused}} by a fungal pathogen, Diaporthe toxica. It can invade all plant parts, leading to plant {{material}} becoming toxic to grazing animals, and potentially resulting in <b>lupinosis.</b> Identifying sources of resistance and breeding for resistance remains the best strategy for controlling Phomopsis and reducing <b>lupinosis</b> risks. However, loci associated with resistance to Phomopsis blight have not yet been identified. In this study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified genomic regions associated with resistance to Phomopsis pod blight (PPB) using a linkage map of L. albus constructed previously from an F 8 recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between Kiev-Mutant (susceptible to PPB) and P 27174 (resistant to PPB). Phenotyping was undertaken using a detached pod assay. In total, we identified eight QTLs for resistance to PPB on linkage group (LG) 3, LG 6, LG 10, LG 12, LG 17 and LG 27 from different phenotyping environments. However, at least one QTL, QTL- 5 on LG 10 was consistently detected in both phenotyping environments and accounted for up to 28. 2 % of the total phenotypic variance. The results of this study showed that the QTL- 2 on LG 3 interacts epistatically with QTL- 5 and QTL- 6, which map on LG 10 and LG 12, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Phomopsis leptostromiformis, and its teleomorph Diaporthe toxica, is a lupin {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} stem blight in young lupins and, as a saprophyte, has been detected on dead lupine material. Under favourable conditions, the fungus produces phomopsins (PHOs), {{a family of}} macrocyclic hexapeptide mycotoxins capable of binding tubulin through the tripeptide side chain. The toxic effects appear largely confined to the liver. In particular, the ingestion of PHO contaminated lupin stubble {{has been linked to}} <b>lupinosis,</b> a debilitating disease of sheep (the most sensitive animal) characterised by disorientation, blindness, lethargy, and eventually death. The chemical structures of PHO A, B and D have been identified. Analytical methods to determine PHOs are mainly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or chromatographic separations, in combination with ultraviolet and mass spectrometric detection. The data about the PHOs occurrence are limited to Australia, restricted to lupin seed. Only one survey has been carried out on lupin seeds and flours from the Swiss market. Not many strategies have been developed to limit lupin seed contamination. Efforts devoted to control <b>lupinosis</b> in Australia focused on the development of cultivars resistant to Phomopsis infection. There are few examples in literature of decontamination or detoxification of PHOs; moreover, they {{have been shown to be}} resistant to extensive processing, including cooking. Australia and New Zealand are the only countries that included PHOs in their mycotoxin regulations, with a limit of 5 μg/kg in lupin seeds and derived products. Phomopsins are poorly studied mycotoxins and risk assessment on PHOs has not been done at the European level. The collection of all available scientific data was requested by EFSA in a specific project and partners involved considered it of general interest preparing this review to highlight the limited available information, which indicate that the assessment of potential risk related to PHOs is currently not feasible...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{survey of}} the {{literature}} on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (ƴ-GT) activity is included in this study. The levels of activity in the serum of normal Merino sheep (13, 6 - 32, 4 mI. U. /ml) were ascertained as a preliminary to following the activity through the entire course of experimentally induced ovine <b>lupinosis,</b> a hepatotoxicosis caused by Phomopsis leptostromiformis (Kühn) Bubák. The response of the serum level of ƴ-GT activity to the course of the disease was compared with that of glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and 2 liver function tests for the purpose of assessing its potential application in the study of this mycotoxicosis. Because the levels of activity of ƴ-GT were more valuable for the early diagnosis of low grade acute intoxication and the detection of chronic liver involvement while those of GOT gave better information on the development of severe acute hepato-cellular damage, these 2 enzymes, considered together, were found to give the best information on the course of the toxicosis. The changes in ƴ-GT activity during various stages of intoxication were also related to the histopathological lesions in the liver.

40|$|Phomopsins (PHO) are mycotoxins {{produced}} by the fungus Diaporthe toxica (also referred to as Phomopsis leptostromiformis). Lupin {{is the most important}} host crop for this fungus and PHO are suspected as cause of <b>lupinosis,</b> a deadly liver disease, in sheep. Lupin is currently in use to replace genetically modified soy in many food products available on the European market. However, a validated method for analysis of PHO is not available until now. In this work, a dilute-and-shoot LC-MS/MS-based method was developed for the quantitative determination and identification of phomopsin A (PHO-A) in lupin and lupin-containing food. The method involved extraction by a mixture of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (80 / 20 / 1 v/v), dilution of the sample in water, and direct injection of the crude extract after centrifugation. The method was validated at 5 and 25 µg PHO-A kg(- 1) product. The average recovery and RSD obtained were 79 % and 9 %, respectively. The LOQ (the lowest level for which adequate recovery and RSD were demonstrated) was 5 µg PHO-A kg(- 1). Identification of PHO-A was based on retention time and two transitions (789 > 226 and 789 > 323). Using the average of solvent standards from the sequence as a reference, retention times were all within ± 0. 03 min and ion ratios were within ± 12 %, which is compliant with European Union requirements. The LOD (S/N = 3 for the least sensitive transition) was 1 µg PHO-A kg(- 1) product. Forty-two samples of lupin and lupin-containing food products were collected in 2011 - 2012 from grocery stores and internet shops in the Netherlands and analysed. In none of the samples was PHO-A detecte...|$|E
40|$|The British mycologist, I. B. Pole-Evans, was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} South African government mycologist in 1905 following the Anglo-Boer War (1899 - 1902). The Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute was founded in 1908 with the Swiss veterinarian, Arnold Theiler, as the first director. Thus, {{the stage was set}} for the commencement of mycotoxicological research when the Union of South Africa came into being in 1910. The first accounts of this pioneering research appeared in the 'Seventh and eight reports of the Director of Veterinary Research, Union of South Africa. 1918 ' in which D. T. Mitchell reported on the experimental reproduction of the neurotoxic syndrome, diplodiosis, in cattle with pure cultures of Stenocarpella maydis (= Diplodia zea) isolated by P. A. Van der Bijl and grown on sterile maize kernels. This is the first report of the experimental reproduction of a veterinary mycotoxicosis with a pure culture of a fungus in South Africa and possibly in the world. This seminal research was followed by a great deal of multidisciplinary research on veterinary mycotoxicoses as well as human syndromes in which fungal toxins are suspected to be involved, taxonomy of mycotoxigenic fungi and chemistry of mycotoxins in South Africa. The mycotoxicoses studied in South Africa include the following (more or less in chronological order) : diplodiosis, Paspalum staggers, aflatoxicosis, human hepatocellular carcinoma, ochratoxicosis, <b>lupinosis,</b> facial eczema, tremorgenic mycotoxicosis, hyperoestrogenism, stachybotryotoxicosis, ergotism, leukoencephalomalacia and human oesophageal cancer. A major breakthrough in mycotoxicological research was made in South Africa in 1988 with the isolation and chemical characterisation of the carcinogenic fumonisins produced by Fusarium verticillioides in maize. Current research at the PROMEC Unit of the South African Medical Research Council on the risk assessment of fumonisins and intervention methods to reduce fumonisin intake by rural populations on a maize staple diet is highlighted.
