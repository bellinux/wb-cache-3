25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven {{is a time}} of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. Purgatory is a {{temporary}} place for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> thief who was crucified next to Jesus.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the moderately negative feedback {{the third and fourth}} seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: [...] "Overall, it feels more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> old days than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." [...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Pissarro's son, Lucien, {{his father}} painted {{regularly}} with Cézanne beginning in 1872. He recalls that Cézanne walked {{a few miles}} to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger Cézanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro's eyes, as he admired Pissarro's landscapes from the 1860s. Cézanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> Lord." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{played in}} the World Series two years earlier, the 1986 Padres {{finished}} in fourth place in the National League West with a disappointing record of 74–88. The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by Larry Bowa on October 24, 1986. Boros said at the time, [...] "I was prepared {{for the fact that}} I wouldn't be coming back. ... It's <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> news and bad news joke. The good news was {{that at the end of}} the season I hadn't been fired. The bad news was I hadn't been rehired." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1873 {{he helped}} {{establish}} a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the [...] "pivotal" [...] figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the [...] "dean of the Impressionist painters", {{not only because}} he was the oldest of the group, but also [...] "by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality". Cézanne said [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> Lord," [...] and he was also one of Gauguin's masters. Renoir referred to his work as [...] "revolutionary", through his artistic portrayals of the [...] "common man", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without [...] "artifice or grandeur".|$|E

60|$|I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> very well; but the merchant, as {{they called}} him, that is to say, the knave {{appointed}} to cheat the poor stranger, was cunningly out of the way, so that no bargain was to be made that night. But as I had said that I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> brandy, the same person who brought me an account of them, comes to my lodgings to treat with me about the price. We did not make many words: I bade him the current price which I had bought for some days before, {{and after a few}} struggles for five crowns a-tun more, he came to my price, and his next word was to let me know the gage of the cask; and as I had seen <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> already, he thought {{there was nothing to do}} but to make a bargain, and order <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> to be delivered.|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{successful}} collector of folk tales was the novelist and storyteller Ion Creangă, who in very picturesque language, shaped into their now-classic form stories like Harap Alb (roughly, [...] "The White Prince") or Fata babei şi fata moşului (roughly, [...] "The old woman's girl and the old man's girl"). Also, the poet Vasile Alecsandri published {{the most successful}} version of the ballad Mioriţa (The Little Ewe), a sad, philosophical poem, centered on a simple action: the plot by two shepherds to kill a third shepherd because they envied his wealth. Another prolific editor of folk tales was Petre Ispirescu, who, in the 19th century published an impressive number of volumes containing {{a large number of}} short novels and tales from popular mythology. They are centered on popular characters like the prince Făt-Frumos (the Romanian [...] "Prince Charming"), the princess Ileana Cosânzeana, the villain or monster Zmeu or Căpcăun, the dragon Balaur or fantastic superbeings <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> Zână and the evil Muma Pădurii.|$|E

40|$|I {{consider}} the private provision of public goods in two stage games. If <b>the</b> agent who <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> least contributes first, {{the amount of}} <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> supplied {{will be the same}} as in the Nash equilibrium. If <b>the</b> agent who <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> most contributes first, less of <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> may be supplied. Similar results hold if the first mover is uncertain of the tastes of the other agent. If the agents bid for the right to move first, the agent who values <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> least will win. If each agent chooses the rate at which he will subsidize the other agent's contributions, the subsidies that support the Lindahl allocation are the unique equilibrium outcome. I also describe two related subsidy-setting games that yield Lindahl allocations in $n$-person games with general utility functions. }...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{knew his}} father well--he was distantly {{connected}} by marriage {{with my friend}} Lord Gosford; you could not remember him, I suspect" [...] (John rolled his eyes at this suggestion of his sister's recollection {{of a man who}} had been forty years dead); [...] "he always voted with me in the parliament of this realm; he was a thoroughly honest man; very much such a man to look at as Peter Johnson, my steward: but I am told his son <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> things of <b>the</b> ministry; well, well, William Pitt was the only minister to my mind. There was the Scotchman of whom they made a Marquis; I never could endure him--always voted against him." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{respected}} {{some particular}} sorts of goods only, and chiefly spices and drugs, and dye-stuffs, and <b>the</b> <b>like.</b> It were well if some other method {{than that of}} a rattling tongue could be found out, to ascertain the goodness and value of <b>goods</b> between <b>the</b> shopkeeper and the retail buyer, that such a flux of falsehoods and untruths might be avoided, as we see every day made use of to run up and run down every thing that is bought or sold, and that without any effect too; for, take it one time with another, all the shopkeeper's lying does not make <b>the</b> buyer <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> at all <b>the</b> better, nor does the buyer's lying make the shopkeeper sell the cheaper.|$|R
40|$|I {{consider}} the private provision of public goods when agents {{are able to}} make sequential contributions rather than simultaneous contributions. In the case of two agents with quasilinear utility, a quite complete analysis is possible. If <b>the</b> agent who <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> least gets to move first, the amount of <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> supplied will be the same as in the Nash equilibrium, but if <b>the</b> agent who <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> most moves first, less of <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> may be supplied. If the agents bid for the right to move first, the agent who values <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> least will always outbid the other agent. In general, each agent would prefer to subsidize the other agent's contributions. If each agent chooses the rate at which they subsidize the other agent, the subsidizes that support the Lindahl allocation are the unique equilibrium subsidies. For general utility functions, I show that the subgame perfect quilibrium always results in less of <b>the</b> public <b>good</b> being supplied than does the Nash equilibrium...|$|R
