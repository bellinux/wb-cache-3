60|$|There is one {{objection}} against Mr. Partridge's death, which I {{have sometimes}} met with, though indeed very slightly offered, That he still continues to write almanacks. But {{this is no}} more than what is common to all that profession; Gadbury, Poor Robin, Dove, Wing, and several others, do yearly publish their almanacks, though several of them have been dead since before the Revolution. Now the natural reason of this I take to be, that whereas it is the privilege of other authors to live after their deaths; almanack-makers are alone excluded, because their dissertations treating only upon the minutes as they pass, become useless as those go off. In consideration of which, Time, whose registers they are, gives them a <b>lease</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversion,</b> to continue their works after their death.|$|E
50|$|He was matriculated a fellow-commoner of Clare Hall, Cambridge, on 12 May 1563, and was {{presented}} to the queen when she visited the university in 1564; on coming of age, about November 1565, he repaired to Ireland, with letters of commendation from the queen to the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, granting him the <b>lease</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> of the abbey of All Saints and the custody of Sleaught-William in the Annaly, County Longford.|$|E
50|$|He {{obtained}} from the crown a grant of the mastership {{of the game in}} Enfield Chase and park, with the office of steward and ranger of the manor of Enfield. Accompanying Elizabeth on her visit to the University of Cambridge in 1564, he was created M.A. In or about 1568 the queen granted him a <b>lease</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> of the castle and manor of Allington, Kent, and he also had an estate at Otterden. He bought Maidstone Palace and had work done {{to the front of the}} building. His death appears to have occurred about July 1595. He was aged about 88; he and his wife Margaret are buried in Maidstone church.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an essay}} {{published}} in the second edition of William Camden's Remaines (1614), Richard Carew writes, [...] "look into our Imitations {{of all sorts of}} verses by any other language, and you shall finde that Sir Phillip Sidney, Maister Puttenham, Maister Stanihurst, and divers more have made use how farre wee are within compasse of a fore imagined impossibility in that behalfe". Around the same time, in his Hypercritica (not published until 1722), Edmund Bolton writes of [...] "the elegant, witty, and artificial book of the Art of English Poetrie, (the work as the fame is) of one of Elizabeth's Gentleman Pensioners, Puttenham". Since Puttenham received two <b>leases</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> from the queen in 1588, this seems to clearly identify him as the author.|$|R

40|$|Both the {{acridine}} half-mustard, ICR 191, and the nonalkylating azaacridine derivative, ICR 364 -OH, induce {{three classes}} of frameshift mutations in the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium. (i) One class is completely stable <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests and {{is presumed to}} represent deletion of {{one or a few}} critical nucleotide pairs or two nearby frameshifts. One extended deletion was found out of 11 stable mutations. (ii) Of two spontaneously reverting classes which also are considered to predominantly involve base deletions, one is unaffected <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> with ICR 191, nitrosoguanidine, and diethylsulfate, and the other is induced to revert with ICR 191. (iii) A third class, considered to predominantly involve base additions, responds <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests with ICR 191 as well as with nitrosoguanidine and diethylsulfate. Other investigators have shown that one mutant of this class is a “plus” frameshift and that nitrosoguanidine acts <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> to delete a guanine plus cytosine base pair. Although such plus frameshifts are found with high frequency among mutations selected from acridine-treated bacteria or when strong selection pressure is applied for their detection <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests, data from this laboratory indicate that this class of plus frameshifts is rare among mutations derived spontaneously or after treatment with a variety of other mutagens. Finally, we demonstrate that the alkylating ICR 191 and the nonalkylating ICR 364 -OH preferentially cause mutations in different chromosome regions and that their spectra of activity only partially overlap that found for spontaneous frameshift mutations...|$|R

60|$|I. For {{the first}} of these, that the best things are yet behind, and <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> for believers; this is {{manifest}} by the natural exercise of this grace. For 'hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it' (Rom 8:24,25). Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised. But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that the believer's best things are behind <b>in</b> <b>reversion.</b>|$|R
