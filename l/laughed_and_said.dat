5|$|Imelda, {{coming from}} a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial {{difficulties}} adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was her}} fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.|$|E
25|$|Initially, when Sima Zhao {{wanted to}} put Zhong Hui in charge of leading the Wei army to conquer Shu, Shao Ti (邵悌) warned him that Zhong Hui might rebel against Wei {{because he was in}} command of an army of thousands, was single, and had no family to worry about. Sima Zhao <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he {{understood}} Shao Ti's concern very well, but chose to let Zhong Hui lead the Wei army because he had faith in Zhong's ability to conquer Shu. He also predicted that Zhong Hui would not succeed even if he rebelled because of two reasons. First, the people of Shu would not support Zhong Hui because they were already fearful after witnessing the fall of Shu. Second, the Wei forces would not support Zhong Hui because they were already exhausted and homesick after the campaign.|$|E
25|$|The main {{script and}} {{branching}} storylines {{were written by}} author and screenwriter Satoru Akahori. Hiroi revealed that the setting of Sakura Wars was based on his family history, so felt that it would lose its entertainment value if he wrote the game's script himself. Hiroi had previously worked with Akahori on other projects, so Akahori was brought on board. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi, he <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{it would be better}} to try blending the stories of Haikara-san ga Tōru and Teito Monogatari. He was later convinced to join the project after talking with Hiroi. When first pitched the project, all that had been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and mecha. Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game, but Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television. When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still in an unfinished state: the only points finalized were its setting, overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft. Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself, needing frequent consultation with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision. Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length. Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, along with other duties such as script editing and debugging.|$|E

500|$|On 12 November 1975, the First Fraser Ministry {{was sworn}} in by Kerr. By some accounts, Kerr sought {{reassurance}} at that meeting that the Coalition senators would not have given in before supply ran out, [...] "The Senate would never have caved in, would it?" [...] According to those accounts, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to a colleague, [...] "That's all he knows." [...] Guilfoyle later stated that, if she did make such a remark, it {{was not meant to}} imply that the Coalition senators would have broken. However, Kelly lists four Coalition senators who stated, in subsequent years, that they would have crossed the floor and voted for the appropriation bills.|$|E
500|$|Greene's {{nickname}} remained {{popular due to}} his exploits on {{the playing}} field, where he was described as ferocious and intimidating. He instilled fear in opponents with the intensity of his play. In a 1979 game against the Houston Oilers, with only seconds remaining and Houston leading 20–17, the Oilers lined up near the Pittsburgh goal line to run their final play. With victory already assured for the Oilers, Greene pointed angrily across {{the line of scrimmage}} at Houston quarterback Dan Pastorini, warning, [...] "If you come into the end zone, I'll beat the crap out of you! I'm gonna kill you!" [...] Pastorini responded by taking a knee, ending the game. Afterword, Greene <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I knew you weren't going to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E

500|$|Saunders {{was among}} {{a party of}} men {{evacuated}} from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and returned to Australia in October. He rejoined his old unit, the 2/7th Battalion, which had re-formed in Palestine and been brought back to Australia {{along with the rest}} of the 6th Division to help defend against the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In November 1942, Saunders' younger brother Harry, who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940, was killed in action while serving in New Guinea with the 2/14th Battalion. When Harry had joined up, Reg recalled, [...] "I was angry because I was the only one that was supposed to go.... with two of us there, one of us was going to get killed..." [...] The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well, fighting in the Salamaua–Lae campaign in mid-1943 where, having again been promoted temporary sergeant, he took over command of a platoon when its commander was wounded in action. For his leadership, he was recommended for a commission by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. When Guinn told him of his plan, Saunders <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I don't want to be an officer... I'd rather be Regimental Sergeant Major". Guinn responded, [...] "Christ, they don't make boys RSMs".|$|E

2500|$|At the time, as Palace Attendants' duties {{included}} seeing to the emperor's {{daily living}} conditions, {{they were often}} teasingly referred to as zhihuzi (執虎子; [...] "chamber pot holder").

2500|$|On October 5, 2011, O'Brien {{returned}} to 30 Rockefeller Plaza for a surprise, scripted appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon to ceremonially retrieve the Triumph the Insult Comic Dog puppet {{from the studio}} after NBC had finally granted him the rights to use the character on TBS's Conan.

2500|$|For his {{achievements}} in {{the conquest of}} Jing Province, Lü Meng was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Nan Commandery. He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Chanling (孱陵侯) and awarded 100 million coins and 500 jin of gold. Earlier on, Sun Quan threw a feast at Gong'an County to celebrate the victory, but Lü Meng {{did not want to}} attend because he was ill. Sun Quan <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ziming, you deserve the honour of capturing Guan Yu. You've achieved victory but haven't received any reward yet, so how can you leave now?" [...] He ordered the soldiers to play music, and personally selected subordinates for Lü Meng and the equipment required for the ceremony. After the ceremony, all the soldiers lined up along the path when Lü Meng took his leave, with music playing in the background. That was Lü Meng's finest hour.|$|E
2500|$|Lü Meng {{was furious}} {{when he heard}} that Gan Ning had killed the servant so he {{gathered}} his own men and prepared to confront Gan. Gan Ning continued resting when he heard Lü Meng approaching. Lü Meng's mother {{came out of the}} house barefooted and chided her son, [...] "The lord (Sun Quan) treats you like his family and entrusts you with important responsibilities. How can you kill Gan Ning just because you've a private feud with him? If Gan Ning dies, even if the lord does not inquire into the incident, you've already overstepped your role as a subject." [...] Lü Meng was a filial son so his anger subsided after listening to his mother. He then went to Gan Ning's boat, <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Xingba, my mother is treating you to a meal. Come up quickly!" [...] Gan Ning wept and replied, [...] "I've let you down." [...] He followed Lü Meng to meet his mother and they feasted for the whole day.|$|E
