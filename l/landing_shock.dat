50|$|To achieve high performance, the {{manually}} retractable {{landing gear}} was of the individual leg type equipped with Goodrich tires, Hayes hydraulic brakes and Aerol landing gear struts; Grimes landing lights were also retractable. The fully retractable gear had the wheels retracting into wells in {{the underside of the}} wing and fuselage belly which was reinforced to survive an emergency with the wheels up. The streamlined tail skid was aluminum in its upper part and at the bottom made of Stellite, a substance for protecting metals subjected to excessive wear. A small wheel within the streamlined form, protruded sufficiently so that the wheel carried the load when landing on asphalt or concrete runways. On softer fields, {{the lower part of the}} skid absorbed the <b>landing</b> <b>shock.</b>|$|E

5000|$|One {{very early}} {{undercarriage}} arrangement that passively allowed for castoring during crosswind landings, unlike the [...] "active" [...] arrangement on the B-52, was pioneered on the Bleriot VIII design of 1908. It was later {{used in the}} much more famous Bl√©riot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the Etrich Taube. In this arrangement the main <b>landing</b> gear's <b>shock</b> absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take <b>landing</b> <b>shocks</b> also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel's suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.|$|R

5000|$|The December 29 {{accident}} {{was the second}} runway overrun involving a Red Wings operated Tu-204-100B in nine days. A Moscow Vnukovo to Novosibirsk flight on December 20, 2012 overran runway 25 at Tolmachevo Airport by 1,150 feet (350 meters) when its brakes failed on landing. As {{a result of that}} incident, on December 24 the Federal Air Transport Agency of Russia (Rosaviatsia) issued a mandatory Airworthiness Directive requiring Red Wings and all other operators of the Tu-204 to inspect and apply extra lubrication to the braking system drive mechanism limit switches, located on the main <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> absorber, [...] "before next departure". On December 28, the day before the fatal Vnukovo accident, Rosaviatsia also formally notified Tupolev, the aircraft's manufacturer, that malfunctioning brakes had caused the Red Wings Tu-204 overrun accident at Novosibirsk. On December 30 Rosaviatsia chief Alexander Neradko announced that a preliminary examination of the aircraft's flight data recorder indicated that the flight had touched down in the proper landing area but, as in the December 20 incident in Novosibirsk, the braking system on RA-64047 appeared to have failed in the fatal Moscow overrun accident as well.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{modeling}} is used {{to estimate}} physical quantities {{that are difficult to}} measure, in this case, the <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> experienced by ski jumpers. The <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> is difficult to measure because attaching instruments to the skiers would affect their balance and possibly cause them to fall or reduce their performance. Using basic principals of physics, the flight trajectories of two forms of competitive ski jumping, Freestyle Aerialist and Nordic Jumpers, were modeled and the landing shocks compared. The model uses physical quantities such as the takeoff inclination, takeoff height, the shape of the hill, and the vertical drop to the landing. The <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> is calculated from the velocity of the skier and angle which he or she hits the hill. For comparison to other sports, the <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> is converted to a vertical drop to a flat surface. The model shows that Freestyle Aerialist have landing shocks equivalent to a vertical drop of 20 feet to a flat surface. This is over twice the <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> of the Nordic Jumpers even though the Nordic Jumpers travel at twice the velocity and fall twice as far...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{examines the}} influence of landing gears and runway roughness on the physical loading of glider pilots. To simulate glider landings on uneven runways a numerical simulation procedure was developed. An experimental method to measure roughness on grass runways is described. Landing gears of single and twin gliders with and without additional springs were systematically shock tested. It reveals that nearly all landing gears would require an additional spring to properly fulfill the current <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> airworthiness requirements. Additionally it is shown that only landing gears acceptable <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> load factors achieve acceptable whole-body vibration during runway operation. Uncritical values are only possible by (well adapted) additional springs. Therefore a slightly modified <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> criterion can be applied instead of an extensive proof of acceptable whole-body vibration. Out of several possibilities to improve the <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> requirements, one favourable modification is suggested. (orig.)

50|$|The Marais had {{retractable}} landing gear, {{most unusual}} in its day for any aircraft but particularly {{so for a}} lightplane; Marais was aware that the drag of a fixed undercarriage would be particularly detrimental {{to the performance of}} a very low-powered aircraft. Each mainwheel was mounted on a single duralumin box-tube leg which slid on rollers inside another box-tube fixed inside the fuselage on two dural strengthening plates. The legs could be raised or lowered by the pilot via a crank-driven chain and an automatic locking device fixed the gear up or down. When raised, the wheels were completely enclosed under shaped fairings. The legs had no shock absorbers; instead, large pneumatic tyres softened <b>landing</b> <b>shocks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} of the Couzinet 100 had fixed, tailwheel landing gear. When the Couzinet 100, powered by [...] Salmson 9 ADb radials made its first flight it had mainwheels in trouser fairings and relied on low pressure tyres to absorb <b>landing</b> <b>shocks.</b> One flight was enough to see its return to the factory, where a more conventional three strut arrangement was installed. The Couzinet 101 had similar gear, each wheel with a near-vertical oleo strut to the forward spar in the inner wing and a cranked axle and drag strut from the lower fuselage. The wheels, in spats, were below the outer engines with a track of 2.83 m. The mainwheels had independent brakes and the tailwheel castored on its oleo strut.|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of ground influence on airplanes has recently attracted some attention {{in view of}} the claims made by certain designers that the landing speed of their airplanes is much decreased by an increase in lift coefficient due to the proximity of the ground in landing. The results of wind tunnel tests indicate that ground effect is not entirely beneficial. It decreases the landing speed and cushions the <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> somewhat. However, it does so at the expense of an increased length of preliminary skimming over the ground. By decreasing the drag and increasing the lift, it lengthens the distance necessary for the airplane to travel before losing enough speed to land. On the other hand, its influence is helpful in taking off, {{especially in the case of}} flying boats with their low-lying wings. In the conventional tractor airplane, the height of the wings above the ground is determined largely by propeller clearance. However, a small low-speed airplane like the Pischoff and large low-speed commercial aircraft with engines between wings can utilize ground influence to good advantage...|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of the microrover Nanokhod for the demanding surface environment of the Mercury night side, the rover made a huge advance towards a practical flight model. The rover was designed by the company von Hoerner & Sulger GmbH under an ESA contract to meet the flight-model requirements for a Mercury surface mission. This means it has to withstand such extreme environmental settings as temperatures down to ‚àí 180 ‚ó¶ C in vacuum conditions, a <b>landing</b> <b>shock</b> of 200 g for a duration of 20 ms and a surface material consisting of very fine regolith with an extremely low thermal conductivity. The hardware model based on these requirements was manufactured to an engineering level and is suitable for environmental testing of vibration, shock and thermal vacuum. The first thermal vacuum tests of the rover system were successfully conducted and the results provide {{a good understanding of}} the thermal behaviours within the system. In addition, these results are used for the validation of the detailed thermal model of the rover which has been developed in parallel to the Nanokhod model. This validated model thus presents a powerful tool which {{can be used as a}} baseline for the future design steps of the thermal concept. It provides detailed information on possible hot spots in vacuum condition and helps to avoid them. A good understanding on the temperature distribution within the rover also helps to reduce the risks and uncertainties for the scientific instruments and critical electronic components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an algorithm about online gait trajectory generation method, controller for walking, brief introduction of humanoid robot platform KHR- 3 (KAIST Humanoid Robot ‚Äì 3 : HUBO) and experimental result. The gait trajectory has continuity, smoothness in varying walking period and stride, {{and it has}} simple mathematical form which can be implemented easily. It is tested on the robot with some control algorithms. The gait trajectory algorithm is composed of two kinds of function trajectory. The first one is cycloid function, which is used for ankle position in Cartesian coordinate space. Because this profile is made by superposition of linear and sinusoidal function, it has a property of slow start, fast moving, and slow stop. This characteristics can reduce the over burden at instantaneous high speed motion of the actuator. The second one is 3 rd order polynomial function. It is continuous in the defined time interval, easy to use when the boundary condition is well defined, and has standard values of coefficients when the time scale is normalized. Position and velocity values are used for its boundary condition. Controllers mainly use F/T(Force/Torque) sensor at the ankle of the robot as a sensor data, and modify the input position profiles (in joint angle space and Cartesian coordinate space). They are to reduce unexpected external forces such as <b>landing</b> <b>shock,</b> and vibration induced by compliances of the sensors and reduction gears, because they can affect seriously on the walking stability. This trajectory and control algorithm {{is now on the}} implementing stage for the free-walking realization of KHR- 3. As a first stage of realization, we realized the marking time and forward walking algorithm with variable frequency and stride...|$|E
