If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium overall.|$|E

We discuss {{the concept of}} inter-firm <b>linkages</b> {{and the effects of}} <b>linkages.</b> We argue that the concept of <b>linkages</b> developed by Hirschman (1958) is an inter-sectoral concept which can arise as a result of underlying inter-firm <b>linkages.</b> Our empirical analysis indicates that foreign-owned electronic firms in Ireland source, on average, 24 per cent of their inputs in Ireland, which compares favourably with an estimate for foreign firms in Scottish electronics industries. In an econometric estimation, using panel data techniques, we find that firms in the Irish electronics sector increase their backward <b>linkages</b> over time; that foreign firms have lower <b>linkages</b> than Irish-owned firms; and that large and expanding firms have lower <b>linkages</b> than other firms. ...|$|R

40|$|Employing {{a unique}} dataset that covers almost 6000 {{informal}} enterprises from six West African urban centers, this paper examines the backward and forward <b>linkages</b> of these enterprises {{to the formal}} sector. We first provide a descriptive analysis of the existing formal-informal <b>linkages.</b> It turns out that formal backward <b>linkages</b> are much more prevalent than formal forward <b>linkages,</b> and that <b>linkages</b> vary with the degree of informality, occurring less frequently if firms have no ties to the formal sector at all or low capital stocks. In the second step, we employ a Probit approach to identify major factors associated with the observed backward <b>linkages.</b> The Probit analysis corroborates {{the importance of the}} degree of informality for the existence of <b>linkages</b> and shows various enterprise characteristics to be significant determinants as well. Finally, we analyze whether backward <b>linkages</b> matter for enterprise performance using both OLS and IV estimations.

5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic <b>linkage</b> to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, <b>linkage</b> decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with <b>linkage</b> to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

The <b>linkages</b> provide benefits beyond product sales: some firms are stimulated to improve technological capabilities through subcontracting <b>linkages</b> with assemblers; others are supported by trade credits embedded in <b>linkages</b> with wholesalers. In comparing these effects with external assistance, the firms rate technological help from private institutions with a business orientation more highly than that from assemblers, and support from wholesalers more highly than any other source of financial assistance. Government assistance receives a relatively low rating. There is little evidence of effects of clustering, partly because firms consider <b>linkages</b> with the outer economy more strategic. ...|$|R
