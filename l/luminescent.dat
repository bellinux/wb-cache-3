5|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of O.nidiformis fruit bodies is best seen in low-light conditions {{when the}} viewer's eyes have become dark-adapted. The gills {{are the most}} <b>luminescent</b> part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although {{the intensity of the}} luminescence is variable, William Henry Harvey once reported that it was bright enough to read a watch face by. It is not known if the mycelium is also <b>luminescent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium forms {{a variety}} of {{coordination}} complexes. Examples are the many pentammine derivatives n+ that often exist for both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous, best known being the <b>luminescent</b> tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{is used in}} {{dosimeters}} {{for measuring}} ionizing radiation. Crystals of calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and <b>luminescent.</b> The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.|$|E
5|$|The {{two other}} <b>luminescent</b> species of Mycena section Exornatae {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to M.chlorophos. M.discobasis fruit bodies have paler caps; microscopically, they have larger spores measuring 9.9 by 6.7μm, and lack the short apical appendage found on M.chlorophos cheilocystidia. M.margarita has smaller spores averaging 6.9 by 4.4μm, smaller cheilocystidia, and loop-like clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Many cephalopods, {{including}} at least 70 genera of squid, are bioluminescent. Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries {{in the same way}} as many squid use ink. A cloud of <b>luminescent</b> material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either <b>luminescent</b> or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} <b>luminescent</b> organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each {{responds}} to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the <b>luminescent</b> fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E
5|$|Using {{techniques}} of genetic complementation, Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with <b>luminescent</b> ones, {{and concluded that}} luminosity in P.stipticus is an inherited character, and governed by {{a single pair of}} alleles in which luminosity was dominant over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different gene mutations could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525nm, and shifted to 528nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. <b>Luminescent</b> solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are <b>luminescent,</b> and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|Miller noted there {{appeared}} to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly <b>luminescent</b> wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all interbred freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were phenotypic variants of a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the <b>luminescent</b> tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in <b>luminescent</b> paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish <b>luminescent</b> mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, <b>luminescent</b> dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more <b>luminescent</b> look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, {{but a couple of}} weeks later. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, and the color of emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other <b>luminescent</b> species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through <b>luminescent</b> or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele. The <b>luminescent</b> glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is <b>luminescent,</b> but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{band gap}} (see below) determines what {{portion of the}} solar {{spectrum}} a photovoltaic cell absorbs. A semiconductor will not absorb photons of energy less than the band gap; and {{the energy of the}} electron-hole pair produced by a photon is equal to the bandgap energy. A <b>luminescent</b> solar converter uses a <b>luminescent</b> medium to downconvert photons with energies above the band gap to photon energies closer to the band gap of the semiconductor comprising the solar cell.|$|E
25|$|Feb 15, 2012: Completes {{acquisition}} of the mask patterning business of <b>Luminescent</b> Technologies, Inc., thus adding Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) to its manufacturing product line.|$|E
25|$|The {{barrier layer}} may include UV {{stabilizers}} and/or UV absorbing <b>luminescent</b> chromophores (which emit at longer wavelengths) and antioxidants {{to protect and}} improve {{the efficiency of the}} cell.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>luminescent</b> systems: Early in {{his career}} Hastings {{developed}} techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a <b>luminescent</b> reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the <b>luminescent</b> molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.|$|E
25|$|The company {{struggled}} after World War I: {{the loss}} of military contracts sharply reduced demand for <b>luminescent</b> paint and dials, and in 1922, high-grade ore was discovered in Katanga, driving all U.S. suppliers out of business except U.S. Radium and the Standard Chemical Company. U.S. Radium consolidated its operations in Manhattan in 1927, leasing out the Orange plant and selling off other property. But demand for <b>luminescent</b> products surged again during World War II; by 1942, it employed as many as 1000 workers, and in 1944 {{was reported to have}} radium mining, processing, and application facilities in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; and North Hollywood, California as well as New York City.|$|E
25|$|Many fireflies do {{not produce}} light. Usually these species are diurnal, or day-flying, {{such as those in}} the genus Ellychnia. A few diurnal fireflies that inhabit {{primarily}} shadowy places, such as beneath tall plants or trees, are <b>luminescent.</b> One such genus is Lucidota.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} 15th century, oil {{paintings}} were generally {{done in a}} meticulous manner that simulated the smoothness and <b>luminescent</b> layering of tempera. In the 16th century {{the handling of the}} paint became freer and painters exploited the possibility of laying paint on in broad, visible and varied brushstrokes.|$|E
25|$|The {{superheated}} air {{surrounding the}} Orbiter suddenly brightened, causing a streak in the Orbiter's <b>luminescent</b> trail {{that was quite}} noticeable in the pre-dawn skies over the West Coast. Observers witnessed four similar events during the following 23seconds. Dialogue {{on some of the}} amateur footage indicates the observers were aware of the abnormality of what they were filming.|$|E
25|$|These {{formations}} come in {{many different}} brilliant colors such as reds, browns, blues, and grays. The reds and browns are caused {{by the presence of}} iron oxide in the formation. Similarly, blues and grays are caused by manganese oxide. Some speleothems are even partially <b>luminescent</b> and give off light for a brief period after exposure to another light.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} at CSIRO proved {{that they could}} encapsulate biomolecules during the MOF crystallization process. Biomolecules including proteins, DNA and antibodies could be encapsulated within ZIF-8. Enzymes encapsulated in this way were stable and active even after being exposed to harsh conditions (e.g. aggressive solvents and high temperature). ZIF-8, MIL-88A, HKUST-1, and several <b>luminescent</b> MOFs containing lanthanide metals {{were used for the}} biomimetic mineralization process.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{objects are}} portrayed with a disciplined {{graphical}} precision. They {{are separated from}} their usual surroundings either to stand alone, or to be presented in an artistically engineered context surrounded by ethereal space. The <b>luminescent</b> contrasting colours distort the materiality of the objects and confound the viewer. Frames {{in the style of}} those from times gone by form an essential part of each picture.|$|E
25|$|Indian Yellow {{was once}} {{produced}} by collecting the urine of cattle {{that had been}} fed only mango leaves. Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th and 18th centuries favored it for its <b>luminescent</b> qualities, and often used it to represent sunlight. Since mango leaves are nutritionally inadequate for cattle, the practice of harvesting Indian Yellow was eventually declared to be inhumane. Modern hues of Indian Yellow are made from synthetic pigments.|$|E
25|$|Anybody {{seeing this}} {{phenomenon}} might merely have been seeing, without knowing, a <b>luminescent</b> barn owl, {{at least in}} some instances. Much anecdotal evidence supports the fact that barn owls have a luminescence which may be due to fungal bioluminescence (foxfire). It is also possible those who have observed corpse candles may have been witnessing the effect of methane gases produced by decomposing organic material found in swamps, marshlands, and bogs.|$|E
25|$|The company's <b>luminescent</b> paint, {{marketed as}} Undark, was {{a mixture of}} radium and zinc sulfide; the {{radiation}} causing the sulfide to fluoresce. During World War I, demand for dials, watches, and aircraft instruments painted with Undark surged, and the company expanded operations considerably. The delicate task of painting watch and gauge faces was done mostly by young women, who were instructed to maintain a fine tip on their paintbrushes by licking them.|$|E
25|$|Labelle {{signed with}} the Warner Music imprint, Track Records, and {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1971. The record's psychedelic soul sound and its blending of rock and soul rhythms was {{a departure from the}} group's early sound. That same year, they sang background vocals on Laura Nyro's album, Gonna Take a Miracle. A year later, in 1972, the group released Moon Shadow, which repeated the homegrown gritty sound of the previous album. In 1973, influenced by glam rockers David Bowie and Elton John, Wickham had the group dressed in silver space suits and <b>luminescent</b> makeup.|$|E
