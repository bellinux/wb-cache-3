50|$|Wooden bicycle {{frames are}} {{sometimes}} aided by steel or composite <b>lugs</b> <b>to</b> connect the wooden tubes or attach components. These frames {{can be made}} with plywood, hardwoods, or bamboo.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the lifting yoke and blast shield assembly considers the bending stress, weld strength, and resistance of the <b>lug</b> hole <b>to</b> tear out. The bending stress of the lifting <b>lugs</b> is evaluated <b>to</b> ensure that they {{meet the requirements of}} the American Institute for Steel Construction (AISC 1989). Also considered in the calculations is the capability of the thick <b>lugs</b> <b>to</b> withstand the weight of the pump together with that of the container and strongback during rotation to the horizontal position...|$|R
50|$|The British 1937 Pattern entrenching tool added a bayonet <b>lug</b> <b>to</b> the tool's handle, {{allowing}} the Lee-Enfield spike bayonet to be {{mounted on the}} end and converting the tool into a mine prodder.|$|R

50|$|From 1947 to 1949 an {{electric}} transfer railway from Irkutsk via Bolshoy <b>Lug</b> <b>to</b> Slyudyanka was built, noticeably shortening the distance {{compared with the}} Circum-Baikal branch line.

50|$|Kaluđerica, {{in urban}} sense, grew with Belgrade’s most eastern part Mali Mokri Lug on the north, along the Smederevski put, and Veliki Mokri <b>Lug</b> <b>to</b> the south, divided from Kaluđerica (that is, from Kaluđerica's section of Klenak) by the highway.|$|R
50|$|Centerline lug mounts —Absorb {{forces on}} the centerline, and require dowel pins <b>to</b> secure the <b>lugs</b> <b>to</b> prevent {{movement}} at higher pressures or under shock conditions. Dowel pins hold it to the machine when operating at high pressure or under shock loading.|$|R
2500|$|Hoisting: The V-1 was {{delivered}} to the launching ramp via a wooden handling trolley on rails. [...] A wooden lifting gantry on rails {{was connected to the}} V-1 lifting <b>lug</b> <b>to</b> hoist and move it onto the launching spot {{at the lower end of}} the launching ramp.|$|R

5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent trend has been toward {{the use of}} stainless steel for investment cast lugs, {{as shown in the}} picture on the right. These lugs do not require painting, but must be brazed using silver filler rod, which necessitates much better heat control and better fit of <b>lug</b> <b>to</b> tube.|$|R

5000|$|Internally, helmets {{up until}} the 1970s, and in certain areas the 1980s, had only a sweat band {{to allow it to}} sit {{correctly}} on the wearer's head, with a single chin strap. The helmet plate and either a [...] "cockscomb" [...] or [...] "rose top" [...] fixed {{to the top of the}} helmet, were fitted by pressing the metal <b>lugs</b> attached <b>to</b> the badges through the helmet and then having small matchstick-size pieces of wood pushed through the <b>lugs</b> <b>to</b> secure them.

2500|$|At {{increased}} expense, frames {{may have}} lugs which are cut and filed by hand into fancy shapes, both for slight weight savings {{and as a}} display of craftsmanship. In addition many frame builders file the <b>lugs</b> <b>to</b> thin them, {{in order to reduce}} stress concentrations. [...] These ornate or fancy lugs may be painted to accentuate their appearance.|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} CBLS <b>lug</b> belonging <b>to</b> {{an aircraft}} was analyzed. Fractographic {{analysis revealed that}} the lug has failed by overload. Evidences on the failed lug suggest some inadvertent loads on the <b>lug</b> leading <b>to</b> its fracture. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure {{and there were no}} evidences of progressive failure such as fatigue...|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to mount both buffers and chain and knuckle couplers on the same car, provided that one can swing out of the way. Alternatively, either a <b>lug</b> <b>to</b> hold the chain is cast {{in the body of}} the coupler or a chain is mounted on top of the coupler. This is also done with an SA3 coupler built by SAB WABCO.|$|R
5000|$|The receiver, for {{the first}} time, and from here on out, was forged into shape, then machined. Heat {{treatment}} of the receiver was localized to the areas where necessary, namely the cams and locking <b>lugs,</b> <b>to</b> prevent warping caused by overall heat treatment. Forging the receiver increased its strength and reduced the machining labor and time needed to achieve the final shape.|$|R
