25|$|In the past, {{efforts have}} been made to provide each of the city's eight wards a seat in the city council, instead of the current at-large format. There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary {{argument}} for this has been that City Councilors <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>only</b> four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8–1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3–1. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{historical}} {{inventory of}} {{names for the}} dialects now called Saraiki is a confusion of overlapping or conflicting ethnic, local, and regional designations. [...] "Hindki" [...] and [...] "Hindko" [...] - refer to various Saraiki and even non-Saraiki dialects in Punjab Province and farther north within the country, {{due to the fact}} they were applied by arrivals from Afghanistan. One historical name for Saraiki, Jaṭki, means [...] "of the Jaṭṭs", a northern South Asian ethnic group; but Jaṭṭs speak the Indo-Aryan dialect of whatever region they <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> <b>Only</b> a small minority of Saraiki speakers are Jaṭṭs, and not all Saraiki speaking Jaṭṭs necessarily speak the same dialect of Saraiki. However, these people usually call their traditions as well as language as Jataki. Conversely, several Saraiki dialects have multiple names corresponding to different locales or demographic groups. The name [...] "Derawali" [...] is used to refer to the local dialects of both Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan, but [...] "Ḍerawali" [...] in the former is the Multani dialect and [...] "Derawali" [...] in the latter is the Thaḷi dialect.|$|E

5000|$|It is not {{generally}} known that XEROK was <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>only</b> brief periods of operation due to Mexican government restrictions on foreign language programming. At the beginning the programs were recorded, in real time, on tape and the tapes were carried by messenger to the transmitter site where they played after a 24-hour delay, a concept similar to voice-tracking {{used by many}} stations today; this allowed the announcers to announce real clock times, but not material that is required to be accurate and timely, such as accurate weather forecasts. The exception, by 1975, was [...] "morning drive" [...] programming, which was on a 4-hour delay that allowed for timely news and weather reports. Later, the recordings were made 12 hours ahead of time. Still later the station ran several parallel studios so that four shifts were recorded at a time. In 1977-78 studios were used at the tower near Satélite, Chihuahua for live operation. Eventually, the owners were granted permission from the FCC to install a 950 MHz studio-transmitter link (STL) {{across the border to}} feed the transmitter from El Paso live. The Mexican government also agreed to this arrangement but later, the station's top 40 demise halted the STL connection and all programming came out of the local Mexican studios after that.|$|E
