25|$|Coinciding {{with the}} well {{understood}} {{implications of a}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>accident,</b> the insufficient cooling eventually led to meltdowns in Reactors 1, 2, and 3.

25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>accident</b> can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E

In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. Redundant systems are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (<b>loss</b> <b>Of</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>accident)</b> where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the air-tight containment by shutting the isolation valves. Emergency Core Cooling Systems are quickly turned on to cool the fuel and prevent it from melting. The exact sequence of events depends on the reactor design.|$|E

High purity Mo as well as Mo[*]+[*]La 2 O 3 ODS alloy have been successfully fabricated into ∼ 2 -meter long tubes for the feasibility study. Preliminary results are encouraging, and hence rodlets with Mo-alloy cladding containing fuel pellets have been under preparation for irradiation at the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) in Idaho National Laboratory. Additional efforts are underway to enhance the Mo cladding mechanical properties via process optimization. Oxidation tests to temperatures up to 1500 [*]°C, and burst and creep tests up to 1000 [*]°C are also underway.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringSteven EckelsBoth {{cavitating}} {{and flashing}} flows are important phenomena in fluid flow. Cavitating flow, a common consideration in valves, orifices, and metering devices, {{is also a}} concern in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>accidents</b> for liquid water in power plants when saturation pressures are below atmospheric pressure. Flashing flow is a common consideration for devices such as relief and expansion valves and fluid injectors {{as well as for}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>accidents</b> in which the coolant’s saturation pressure is above atmospheric. Of the two phenomena, flashing flow has received greater interest due to its applicability to safety concerns, though cavitating flow is perhaps of greater interest in terms of energy efficiency. It is possible for cavitating and flashing flow to actually become sonic. That is, the local velocity of a fluid can exceed the local speed of sound due to the unique properties of two-phase mixtures. When a flow becomes sonic, it is possible for the flow to accelerate and impose additional energy losses that would not otherwise occur. Models of this aspect of two-phase flow are not well developed, typically only being presented for the case of constant area ducts. In this paper two models for cavitating sonic flow are developed and described by applying the integral forms of the mass, momentum, and energy equations to a control volume of variable cross-sectional area. These models, based on the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) and separated flow model, are then applied to experimental data taken by the author with R- 134 a as the fluid of interest. Experimental data were taken with four instrumented converging-diverging nozzles of various geometries using a custom testing rig that allowed for precise control and measurement of flow parameters such as mass flow, temperature, and pressure. The resultant data from the models are then examined, focusing on the resultant velocities, Mach numbers, quality, and shear stresses...|$|R
