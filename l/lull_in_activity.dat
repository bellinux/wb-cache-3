25|$|After a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> on January 9, a {{separate}} system across the Southern United States {{led to more}} severe weather, including tornadoes, on January 10. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> in the US, several tornadoes {{touched down}} across {{parts of the}} Tennessee Valley north into Kentucky on November 14. The strongest was an EF2 in Kimball, Tennessee where several houses and a church were heavily damaged, {{injuring}} nine people. Structural damage was also reported in Laurel County, Kentucky and in two counties in Middle Tennessee from separate EF1 tornadoes.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{comparative}} <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> while Allenby's divisions were reorganised and retrained, but some local attacks were made, {{especially in the}} Judean Hills. On 19 July, the Ottomans and Germans mounted a brief attack at Abu Tellul near the Jordan, but were defeated by Australian Light Horse regiments with heavy casualties to the German 11th Reserve Jäger battalion, which was subsequently withdrawn from Palestine.|$|E
50|$|The {{organisation}} {{was initially}} founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week {{project in the}} Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities,</b> {{a small group of}} engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions {{led to the formation of}} EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.|$|R
50|$|Mayon Volcano is {{the most}} {{prominent}} of the volcanoes in the region, famous for its perfect conical shape and for being the most active in the Philippines. Its eruptions have repeatedly inflicted disasters on the region, but during <b>lulls</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> it is a particularly magnificent peak. The southernmost tip of the peninsula is dominated by Bulusan Volcano, the other active volcano in the region. Tiwi in Albay and the Bacon-Manito area between Sorsogon and Albay are the sites of two major geothermal fields that contribute substantially to the Luzon Power Grid.|$|R
5000|$|Lizzie {{has made}} it into Manhattan East Enclave, but is {{immediately}} apprehended by security. Taking advantage of a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (as everyone scurries to watch the reports of Sanctuary's destruction), she sends another transmission to Theresa, begging her to get her out. Theresa does, once again by [...] "becoming" [...] Cazie. Lizzie then meets with Jackson at K-C, who instructs her (privately) to data-dip their systems, looking for proof that K-C hasn't spent any time working on the counter-agent. Meanwhile, Vicki moves through the Decon, but doesn't arrive until nearly midnight, having been detained by events pertaining to Theresa.|$|R
500|$|Hualālai (pronounced [...] in Hawaiian) is {{an active}} volcano {{on the island of}} Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. It is the westernmost, third-youngest and the third most active of the five shield volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii, {{following}} Kīlauea and the much larger Mauna Loa. Its peak stands [...] above sea level. Hualālai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300,000years ago. Despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801, Hualālai is still considered active, and is expected to erupt again some time within the next century. The relative unpreparedness of the residents in the area caused by the <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> would worsen the consequences of such an event.|$|E
500|$|By fall 1945, Ladd Field {{had grown}} to {{encompass}} almost 5,000 military personnel and acres of runways and buildings. While {{there was a brief}} <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> as the U.S. Army demobilized after World War II, activity in Fairbanks remained high as the Cold War began. The population of the Fairbanks area grew by 240 percent between 1940 and 1950, then doubled between 1950 and 1953. This growth strained the city's infrastructure: schools, water, power, sewer, and telephone systems were all overstressed by new arrivals and expansion. Suburbs sprang up around Fairbanks, which began annexing them in turn. In 1952, the city's boundaries grew from [...] to , with another [...] soon after. More than a dozen subdivisions and housing developments filled the area between Fairbanks city limits and College, and the city's border advanced westward until it met the College city limit. The burgeoning town stopped to commemorate its roots with the Golden Days Festival, a weeklong celebration of Fairbanks history that started to mark the 50th anniversary of the discovery of gold. The annual festival continues today.|$|E
2500|$|The early 70s saw a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> at Arapiles as {{attention}} {{shifted to}} the Grampians and Mount Buffalo. Interest in Arapiles resurfaced in late 1973 with many imposing lines being climbed with a few aids. These routes brought {{a sense of accomplishment}} to the climbing community as new grades were continually being created. In 1975, American visitor [...] "Hot" [...] Henry Barber arrived and began freeing these routes with minimal protection. The 21-year-old made a significant impact at Arapiles, and his visit was a pivotal point in Australian climbing, as climbers worked to support the legacy of Barber by freeing their new lines instead of being content to leave in aid points.|$|E

[...] His attacks may also take place while the rapist is between relationships. His attacks are usually between 6pm and 8pm, [...] "possibly on the way home from work", or between 1am and 3am, and he may have convictions for car crime [...] "because of the ease with which he breaks into vehicles." ...|$|R

25|$|A <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> {{communist}} <b>activity</b> followed, {{during which}} a melange of Royalist units launched a counterattack on 4 December. Hmong guerrillas manned PT-76 tanks captured from the communists, {{as well as}} 155mm howitzers. They supported Bataillon Infanterie 19 (BI 19), as well as BV 21 and ADC militia. After recapturing Phou Pheung, they continued eastward to seize the Routes 71 and 74 junction.|$|R
50|$|Following Garia, {{there is}} a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> {{agricultural}} <b>activity</b> as the Tripuris await the monsoon.

50|$|Orchomenos gives {{its name}} to a period of {{sculpture}} of archaic Kouroi, the Orchomenos-Thera group of 590-570 BC. This period witnessed a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> Attica, but <b>activity</b> was more vigorous in Boeotia, especially from the Ptoon sanctuary and Orchomenos (NAMA 9).|$|R
50|$|After the 1919 general strike, {{increasing}} {{violence against}} CNT organizers, {{combined with the}} rise of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship (which banned all anarchist organizations and publications), created a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> anarchist <b>activity.</b> Many anarchists responded to police violence by becoming pistoleros themselves. This was a period of mutual violence, in which anarchist groups including Los Solidarios assassinated political opponents. Many anarchists were killed by gunmen of the other side.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of Khrushchev in 1964, the new Soviet {{leadership}} was preoccupied with internal matters, and the East European countries were themselves busy with programs of economic reform. A comparative <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> Comecon <b>activities</b> ensued, which lasted until well after the 1968 Soviet-led intervention in Czechoslovakia. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, Eastern Europe had been shaken by the 1968 events, and there was an obvious need to revitalize programs that would strengthen regional cohesion.|$|R
50|$|After a long <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> {{a series}} of intense storms and {{associated}} cold fronts tracked across the Midwest starting late on December 30, {{with most of the}} activity on December 31. Early that morning, an EF3 tornado touched down in Washington County, Arkansas, destroying houses and killing at least four people. In nearby Benton County, Arkansas, another tornado caused significant damage and injuries.|$|E

50|$|After a {{very long}} <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> severe weather {{developed}} again across parts of the Southern United States as a strong cold front moved through. Although most of the damage was due to straight-line winds, numerous tornadoes were confirmed, including an EF2 that hit Casey County, Kentucky where houses were damaged and another EF2 hit Monroe County, Kentucky. Another tornado near Wayside, Mississippi resulted in one fatality and two injuries when a mobile home was destroyed. It was rated EF1. In total, at least 12 tornadoes were confirmed across the South.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils {{were taken to the}} Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, under the supervision of S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, sacrum, thigh bone, upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> further <b>activity</b> until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|R
50|$|After a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> a storm system {{produced}} a moderate outbreak of tornadoes on December 16, the strongest which killed 11 and injured 125 in Tuscaloosa and was rated as a violent F4 storm. The tornado moved through portions of Southeastern Tuscaloosa destroying 110 homes and causing $12 {{million in damages}} (2000 US Dollar). This tornado is tied as the second-deadliest December tornado since 1950, only behind the F5 in Vicksburg, Mississippi on December 5, 1953. In the end, the entire outbreak of 24 tornadoes was responsible for 12 fatalities and $35 million in damage across 7 states.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the label}} {{released}} a pressing of a greatest hits from UK Oi! band The Business, a reissue of Rest In Pieces debut album, and EPs from The Icemen, American Standard, and Outcrowd, {{there was a}} <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> during {{the beginning of the}} 1990s as the local hardcore scene became more prone to violence [...] - [...] a fact which compounded the temporary demise of one Blackout! band in particular, Killing Time. During this period Wilson established another imprint, Engine Records, which had a more indie rock sound, releasing multiple records, including the acclaimed Fast Japanese Spin Cycle EP from Guided By Voices.|$|E

The singing is trademarked and the orchestrations and material fit in nicely. His voice is totally enchanting and many of these cuts should break out. Some of them will get disco play. Best cuts: 'Black Wonders Of The World,' 'Billy's Back Home,' 'When It's Your Time To Go,' 'Be Truthful To Me,' Everything Must Change.' Dealers: In-store play will sell records and the packaging is beautiful." ...|$|E
50|$|A second Moldovan {{attempt to}} cross the Lunga bridge took place on 13 December 1991. As {{a result of the}} fighting, 27 PMR troops were taken {{prisoner}} and four Moldovan troops (Ghenadie Iablocikin, Gheorghe Cașu, Valentin Mereniuk and Mihai Arnăut) were killed, without Moldova being able {{to cross the}} bridge. After this second failed attempt, there was a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> military <b>activity</b> until 2 March 1992, considered the official start date of the War of Transnistria. This day was the same day when Moldova was admitted {{as a member of the}} United Nations, i.e. received full international recognition of its August 27, 1991 declaration of independence. The armed conflict lasted until 21 July 1992, in three areas along the Dniester river.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> rail {{construction}} <b>activity</b> for mining {{purposes in}} the 1930s and 1940s simply reflected {{the economic situation}} of the Depression and then World War II. Commencing {{with the construction of}} a branch to the Callide coal mine inland of Gladstone in 1953 (and the associated bypassing of the rack section at Mount Morgan), there has been a number of ‘mineral’ (as the term was used by QR) lines constructed, the rate of which again reflected the relative economic demand for Queensland minerals (especially coal), in particular for export.|$|R
50|$|In July 1970, the FANK High Command {{decided to}} take {{advantage}} of a <b>lull</b> <b>in</b> NVA/VC <b>activity</b> as an opportunity to regain the strategic initiave and raise the morale of the Cambodian Army (ANK) troops by retaking large expanses of rich rice-growing areas in northeastern Cambodia not under the Khmer Republic government control. President Lon Nol made preparations for an offensive plan codenamed 'Chenla' to be launched in late August of that same year. An ANK task-force consisting of a dozen infantry battalions - which included several 'repatriated' Khmer Krom volunteer battalions recruited in South Vietnam - supported by armour and artillery was assembled for the operation, which relied on limited ground and air support from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the South Vietnam Air Force (VNAF).|$|R
