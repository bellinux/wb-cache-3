50|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in Detective Comics #29, Doctor Death develops a <b>lethal</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> from pollen extract and enacts a plan to use the poison to extort money from wealthy Gotham City citizens. He is assisted by a large East Indian manservant, Jabah. He decides to eliminate Batman, and threatens to kill someone unless Batman stops him. Batman defeats his two henchmen, but is wounded when Jabah shoots him, though he escapes using a gas pellet. He then gets to Doctor Death's base, meeting him in his lab, and chases him around the building. In order to evade capture, Doctor Death ignites chemicals in his laboratory, presumably killing Jabah and himself in the resulting explosion. Doctor Death next appears the following month in Detective Comics #30. With a new accomplice, a Cossack named Mikhail, Doctor Death is this time successful in claiming a victim in his extortion scheme, but discovers from the widow that the poisoned man lost his fortune in the Great Depression. Batman intervenes in the plot, following Mikhail back to Doctor Death's base, and upon apprehending the doctor, discovers that his face had been horribly disfigured from the lab explosion, resulting in a brown, skeletal appearance.|$|E

40|$|Public Law 99 - 145 {{requires}} the US Department of the Army {{to dispose of}} the <b>lethal</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> and munitions stockpile stored at eight Army installations throughout the continental US and Johnston Atoll in the Pacific. Recognition by the US Army that a potential threat to the public from continued storage was greater than the threat from transportation and demilitarization of <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> gave rise to the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP). CSEPP is a community emergency preparedness program complementing the Department of Defense`s initiative to destroy domestic stockpiles of aged <b>chemical</b> warfare <b>agent</b> munitions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the US Army jointly coordinate and direct the CSEPP. The Compilation of Existing <b>Chemical</b> <b>Agent</b> Guidelines Table was developed under the direction of FEMA and the US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM). The purpose of this Table is to identify established <b>chemical</b> warfare <b>agent</b> guidelines, standards, and interim standards as of September 1997, and place them in an explanatory context for ready use by the CSEPP community. This Table summarizes and organizes information from numerous agencies and review bodies responsible for recommending exposure guidelines [e. g., The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Committee on Toxicology (COT), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), FEMA, Army and other federal agencies]. This Table provides references for the interested reader, but does not provide data and assumptions on which exposure guidelines were based, or comment on the rationale or appropriateness of the given values.

C. 1521) mandates that the Secretary of Defense carry out {{the destruction of the}} United States 2 ̆ 019 stockpile of <b>lethal</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> and munitions. Public Law 912 ̆ 013121 and Public Law 912 ̆ 013441 (50 U. S. C. 1512) mandate that, prior to the disposal of any such agent within the United States, the Secretary of Defense implement any precautionary measures recommended by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to protect the public health. This notice provides CDC 2 ̆ 019 s interim recommendations for worker and general population airborne exposure limits (AELs) for sulfur mustard. These revised exposure limits replace CDC 2 ̆ 019 s previously recommended AELs originally issued in 1988. These limits are being issued as interim criteria pending improved characterization of carcinogenic potential associated with sulfur mustard. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 2005.

50|$|<b>Lethal</b> unitary <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> and munitions are {{extremely}} volatile and they constitute {{a class of}} hazardous chemical weapons that have been stockpiled by many nations. Unitary agents are effective {{on their own and}} do not require mixing with other agents. The most dangerous of these are nerve agents, GA, GB, GD, and VX as well as vesicant (blister) agents, which are formulations of sulfur mustard such as H, HT, and HD. They all are liquids at normal room temperature, but become gaseous when released. Widely used during the First World War, the effects of so-called mustard gas, phosgene gas and others caused lung searing, blindness, death and maiming.|$|R

40|$|Under the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program (CSDP), the US Army {{proposes to}} dispose of <b>lethal</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> and munitions stored at eight {{existing}} Army installations in the continental United States. In 1988, the US Army issued the final programmatic environmental impact statement (FPEIS) for the CSDP. The FPEIS and the subsequent Record of Decision (ROD) identified an on-site disposal process as the preferred method for destruction of the stockpile. That is, the FPEIS determined the environmentally preferred alternative to be on-site disposal in high-temperature incinerators, while the ROD selected this alternative for implementation as the preferred method for destruction of the stockpile. In this Phase I report, the overall CSDP decision regarding disposal of the PUDA Stockpile is subjected to further analyses, and its validity at PUDA is reviewed with newer, more detailed data than those providing {{the basis for the}} conclusions in the FPEIS. The findings of this Phase I report will be factored into the scope of a site-specific environmental impact statement to be prepared for the destruction of the PUDA stockpile. The focus of this Phase I report is on those data identified as having the potential to alter the Army`s previous decision regarding disposal of the PUDA stockpile; however, several other factors {{beyond the scope of this}} Phase I report must also be acknowledged to have the potential to change or modify the Army`s decisions regarding PUDA...|$|R

40|$|There {{are eight}} {{installations}} {{in the continental}} US where <b>lethal</b> unitary <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> and munitions have been stored since the late 1950 `s. In December, 1985, Congress directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to destroy these stockpiles of aging chemical warfare weapons. The destruction was {{to take place in}} such a manner as to provide: (1) maximum protection of the environment, the general public, and the personnel involved in the destruction, (2) adequate and safe facilities designed solely for the destruction of the stockpile, and (3) clean-up dismantling, and disposal of the facilities when the disposal program was complete. To help communities develop emergency response capabilities, the Army established the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program or CSEPP based on principals established in the Emergency Response Concept Plan (ERCP). The Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) jointly oversee the CSEPP. An important part of the ERCP guidance was establishing cooperative interaction between local, state, and federal agencies and the development of emergency planning zones (EPZs) to support the emergency response concept. The purpose of this document is to describe how the population figures were derived for the population estimates for both the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program and the CSEPP analyses.

40|$|The startling {{successes of}} {{contemporary}} international arms control negotiations call {{to mind the}} old aphorism that one should be careful about what one wishes for, because the wish just might come true. Today, disarmament diplomacy has wrought unprecedented triumphs across {{a wide range of}} global bargaining issues, producing a series of watershed treaties that offer spectacular new advantages for the security of the United States and for the prospect of enduring world peace. At the same time, however, these unanticipated negotiation breakthroughs have themselves generated unforeseen implementation problems, spawning a host of novel difficulties for which the traditional tools and methods of arms control are ill-prepared or inappropriate. This Article examines one such difficulty: the potential legal and political conflict posed when a dramatic and crucial new arms control agreement, the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), confronts the equally fundamental and pressing dictates of national environmental protection policy. In short, the CWC will mandate the peaceful dismantling of massive national arsenals of now obsolete, but still exceptionally <b>lethal</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons (CW) <b>agents,</b> armaments, and facilities-and the destruction must be accomplished relatively promptly, reliably, and under the supervision of international inspectors. In the United States, however, long-standing environmental legislation, starting with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and continuing through a sequence of resource-specific antipollution enactments, mandates punctilious adherence to procedural safeguards (such as the preparation of disclosive Environmental Impact Statements) and compliance with stringent national and local substantive standards on emissions, hazardous wastes, community participation, and safety...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Acceleration of {{microbial}} {{activities and}} thus of CO 2 emission in drained peat soils used for agriculture, {{is of the}} main environmental concern. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) examine microbial activities in peat samples treated with different levels of water contents and ameliorants and (ii) evaluate the relative contribution of microbial groups to peat respiration. Approach: Surface (0 - 20 cm) and subsurface (30 - 50 cm) peat samples were collected from Tanjung Jabung Barat, Jambi Province, Indonesia. Peat samples were categorized as saprist (mature stage), acidic (pH 500 g kg− 1). Each peat sample was treated with four different levels of water contents (7 - 66 %, v/v) and four levels of ameliorant applications (without and with 600 kg ha− 1 furnace slag and/or lateritic-soil). Another set of peat samples was treated with three different <b>lethal</b> doses of <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> to inhibit the growth of selected microbial group (bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi). The rate of respiration and the number of individual microbial group population were estimated by alkali absorption method and spread-plate counting technique, respectively. Results: Application of furnace slag and/or lateritic soil at the level of 600 kg ha− 1 did not affect peat respiration. However, respiration rates increased as the water content of peat samples increased, namely from 4. 23 - 18. 2 µg CO 2 g− 1 h− 1 in the surface sample...|$|R
