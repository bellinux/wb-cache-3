5000|$|The Leadcutter sword or <b>lead</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is a type}} of broad, heavy, {{specialist}} English sword or cutlass. Popular in the 19th century, {{these weapons}} resemble an enlarged naval cutlass, consisting of single-edged, flatbacked blades with broad widths, often flexible and sometimes slightly curved, always with a full cutlass-type hilt. The swords, heavier than standard cutlasses, were designed for strength training and for [...] "sword feats" [...] (most often the severing of specially made triangular lead bars, hence the name). These displays often included the dissevering of whole sheeps carcasses and of balanced lead bars in a single blow. A prominent manufacturer of Leadcutters was Wilkinson Sword, who produced the sword in four sizes; Model 1 being the lightest, and Model 4 being the largest and heaviest. A Model 2 blade measures in at 31 inches in length and 1.75 inches in width, with a model 3 blade 33 inches long and 2 inches wide.|$|E

5|$|The Spirit of Fires crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and {{receives}} a UNSC {{signal from the}} surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the exfiltration, Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which <b>leads</b> <b>Cutter</b> to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark. The team secures a Forerunner elevator and ascends to the Cartographer.|$|R
5000|$|Swartz {{played the}} <b>lead</b> role of <b>Cutter</b> in the cyberpunk, full-motion video game Burn:Cycle (1994). According to Computer Gaming World, “the acting (with Aaron Swartz as Cutter) {{is better than}} the ‘Dinner Theater 101’ level that’s usually the rule in {{computer}} games.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{engineer}} {{disappeared into}} his den, {{and a moment}} later the exhaust muffler coughed and spluttered overside. But the schooner could not hold her <b>lead.</b> The little <b>cutter</b> made three feet to her two and was quickly alongside and forging ahead. Only natives were on her deck, and the man steering waved his hand in derisive greeting and farewell.|$|R
25|$|The process uses a {{milling cutter}} with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly smaller than the final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then angled to the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and <b>leads.</b> The <b>cutter</b> is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|R
50|$|While at a {{secondary}} {{school in the}} rural city of Traralgon, in the mid-1980s, Thomas {{was a member of}} rock groups, Get off the Cat and then Survival. In the late 1980s {{he was a member of}} Hans Valen, which covered material by United State heavy rocker, Van Halen; and then he was in Gnomes of Zurich. As Jones, he auditioned as lead vocalist for a Melbourne-based rock, pop group, the State. The State had formed in 1987, with the line-up of Peter Bowman on lead guitar and backing vocals (ex-Cutters), Phil Buckle on guitar and <b>lead</b> vocals (<b>Cutters),</b> Geoff Cain on bass guitar and Virgil Donati on drums (Taste, Cutters). He was considered too young for that group.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Potts {{originated}} {{the role}} of Connor Temple in the science fiction programme, Primeval. Although critically panned as campy on its debut, it became a hit show and pop cultural phenomenon. The storyline saw {{a team of scientists}} battling prehistoric and future beasts falling into the present through anomalies in time. Potts played geeky antihero Connor Temple, the vulnerable and innocent student of <b>lead</b> Nick <b>Cutter</b> (Douglas Henshall). [...] "Connor just came really easy to me. It was something organic that I discovered quite naturally with the character and everyone on Primeval allowed me to run with that." [...] During the course of programme, Potts became romantically coupled with co-star Hannah Spearritt both on-screen and off-screen, which garnered media attention for both the couple and the show.|$|R
50|$|Within the {{numerical}} systems of CNC programming {{it is possible}} for the code generator to assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. This is not always a true condition of CNC tools. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction. However a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can <b>lead</b> to <b>cutter</b> chatter and possible workpiece gouging. Backlash also affects precision of some operations involving axis movement reversals during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the amount of backlash is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.|$|R
50|$|Cutter, {{whom the}} reader joins at the novel's opening, was a friend, disciple, and lover to Judah during Judah's return to New Crobuzon. <b>Cutter</b> <b>leads</b> a group {{consisting}} of other disciples of Judah {{in search of}} the Iron Council, to warn of the impending attack of the New Crobuzon militia. Although the militia was initially defeated by Iron Council, it has amassed a force now capable of destroying the “perpetual train.” After living and working with the Council for a while, Cutter returns with Judah and others to New Crobuzon to inspire revolt with the news of Iron Council, which has decided to return to the city and confront the militia on its own turf. After learning of the failed uprising by the Collective, Judah sends Cutter back to dissuade the citizens of the Council from returning. He is unsuccessful, and at the novel's climax, Judah conjures a time-golem to freeze the train in time, thus saving it at the point of attack from destruction by the militia. As the novel ends, Iron Council has become a public monument of sorts, poised on the verge of attacking New Crobuzon's exterior until the undisclosed time in which Judah's time golem will dissipate. Judah is murdered by Ann Hari for halting the Council's attack, and Cutter re-immerses himself in New Crobuzon's underground resistance movements, revitalising the protest publication Runagate Rampant.|$|R
40|$|This master?s {{thesis is}} written in {{cooperation}} with NTNU, Robbins and BASF, with the aim to document the machine performance and production, when using the anti-abrasion agent ABR 5 versus water. In a traditional hard rock TBM water is sprayed on the cutters to cool them and suppress dust. Earlier studies indicate {{that the use of}} foam can reduce cutter wear, temperature, dust production and <b>lead</b> to cleaner <b>cutter</b> tools. The work on the thesis is mainly based on 8 weeks of field studies on a 10 mdiameter TBM at the AMR water irrigation project in India. To document the effects of using foam versus water the main scopes are to record and examine cutter wear and life, measure dust and log temperature of the cutters as well as general TBM performance. All this is seen in relation to the geology. This thesis suggests that foam has benefits in hard rock TBM tunnelling compared to water, but more research must be conducted with longer, and more consistent test periods. After boring 188 metres with foam, split into two intervals, the amount of blocked cutters has decreased with 47. 8 percent. When comparing the foam boring in the period between March 1. and May 12. a reduction in cutter wear of 12. 7 percent was achieved. In the same period cutter life increased with 18. 2 percent cubic metres per cutter and 713 meters longer rolling distance. The amount of time spent on cutter changes is 34. 2 percent less with foam. Temperature and dust measurements show slightly favourable values when boring with foam, but the data for these are too narrow to draw any conclusion. </p...|$|R
