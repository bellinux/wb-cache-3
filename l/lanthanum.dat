5|$|Among the lanthanides, <b>lanthanum</b> is {{exceptional}} as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, <b>lanthanum</b> has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, <b>lanthanum</b> is a soft metal. <b>Lanthanum</b> has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. <b>Lanthanum</b> is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, <b>lanthanum</b> has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, <b>lanthanum</b> changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, <b>lanthanum</b> {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of <b>lanthanum</b> will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. <b>Lanthanum</b> reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. <b>Lanthanum</b> reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, <b>lanthanum</b> readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. <b>Lanthanum</b> is the strongest and hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to <b>lanthanum,</b> which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like <b>lanthanum,</b> actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> {{compounds}} have numerous applications as catalysts, additives in glass, {{carbon arc}} lamps for studio lights and projectors, ignition elements in lighters and torches, electron cathodes, scintillators, GTAW electrodes, and other things. <b>Lanthanum</b> carbonate {{is used as}} a phosphate binder in cases of renal failure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans. The element is very poorly absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow. <b>Lanthanum</b> carbonate (Fosrenol) was approved as a phosphate binder to absorb excess phosphate {{in cases of}} end stage renal disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol La and atomic number 57. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that tarnishes rapidly {{when exposed to}} air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between <b>lanthanum</b> and lutetium in the periodic table, of which <b>lanthanum</b> is {{the first and the}} prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements. The usual oxidation state is +3. <b>Lanthanum</b> has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. <b>Lanthanum</b> is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a <b>lanthanum</b> atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, <b>lanthanum</b> almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> oxide {{is a white}} solid {{that can}} be {{prepared}} by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, <b>lanthanum</b> hydroxide is formed: {{a lot of heat}} is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard. <b>Lanthanum</b> hydroxide will react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the basic carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>lanthanum</b> added to steel {{improves}} its malleability, resistance to impact, and ductility, whereas addition of <b>lanthanum</b> to molybdenum decreases its hardness {{and sensitivity to}} temperature variations.|$|E
5|$|While <b>lanthanum</b> has {{pharmacological}} {{effects on}} several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the GABA receptor is unique among trivalent cations. <b>Lanthanum</b> acts {{at the same}} modulatory site on the GABA receptor as zinc, a known negative allosteric modulator. The <b>lanthanum</b> cation La3+ is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.|$|E
5|$|Also, pure <b>lanthanum</b> can be {{produced}} by electrolysis of molten mixture of anhydrous LaCl3 and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of <b>lanthanum</b> oxide (or lanthana) has {{a similar}} effect as cerium, and is also not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Cerium-doped <b>lanthanum</b> bromide and <b>lanthanum</b> {{chloride}} are {{the recent}} inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> {{carbonate}} {{was approved}} as a medication (Fosrenol, Shire Pharmaceuticals) to absorb excess phosphate {{in cases of}} end-stage renal failure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> {{fluoride}} {{is used in}} phosphor lamp coatings. Mixed with europium fluoride, it is also {{applied in}} the crystal membrane of fluoride ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of <b>lanthanum</b> solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. <b>Lanthanum,</b> like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lanthanum</b> oxide {{additive}} to tungsten {{is used in}} {{gas tungsten}} arc welding electrodes, as a substitute for radioactive thorium.|$|E
5|$|Like {{horseradish}} peroxidase, <b>lanthanum</b> {{is used as}} an electron-dense tracer in molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|Mischmetal, a {{pyrophoric}} alloy used in lighter flints, contains 25% to 45% <b>lanthanum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{actinium}} compounds are known including AcF3, AcCl3, AcBr3, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac2S3, Ac2O3 and AcPO4. Except for AcPO4, they are all similar to the corresponding <b>lanthanum</b> compounds. They all contain actinium in the oxidation state +3. In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous <b>lanthanum</b> and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{results are}} {{obtained}} with berkelium(IV) fluoride. Berkelium metal {{can also be}} produced by the reduction of berkelium(IV) oxide with thorium or <b>lanthanum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>lanthanum</b> {{are present in}} many pool {{products}} to remove the phosphates that feed algae.|$|E
5|$|The first {{historical}} {{application of}} <b>lanthanum</b> was in gas lantern mantles. Carl Auer von Welsbach used {{a mixture of}} 60% magnesium oxide, 20% <b>lanthanum</b> oxide, and 20% yttrium oxide, which he called Actinophor and patented in 1885. The original mantles gave a green-tinted light and were not very successful, and his first company, which established a factory in Atzgersdorf in 1887, failed in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} <b>lanthanum</b> or lutetium. <b>Lanthanum</b> continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of <b>lanthanum</b> is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by <b>lanthanum</b> and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E
5|$|Various {{compounds}} of <b>lanthanum</b> {{and other}} rare-earth elements (oxides, chlorides, etc.) are components of various catalysis, such as petroleum cracking catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas <b>lanthanum</b> oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning <b>lanthanum</b> trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen sponge alloys {{can contain}} <b>lanthanum.</b> These alloys {{are capable of}} storing up to 400 times their own volume of {{hydrogen}} gas in a reversible adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium, {{like all}} of the {{lanthanides}} (except <b>lanthanum,</b> ytterbium, and lutetium, which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1K.|$|E
5|$|Rocks from Incapillo {{are rich}} in sodium and have high ratios of <b>lanthanum</b> and {{samarium}} to ytterbium and high ratios of barium to <b>lanthanum,</b> as well as high lead-206 to lead-204 and strontium-87/strontium-86 ratios. These rare-earth element patterns {{are similar to the}} Late Miocene Maricunga Belt rocks and contrast to early Miocene rocks. The changes occurred {{at the same time as}} the arc migrated eastward, terminating activity in the Maricunga Belt. The element ratios are pronouncedly arc-like with some adakitic signatures. The rocks contain considerably more sodium and alumina than almost all Central Andes siliceous volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Scandium, yttrium, <b>lanthanum,</b> and {{lutetium}} tend {{to occur}} {{together with the}} other lanthanides (except promethium) tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30parts per million (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5ppm. The abundance of <b>lanthanum</b> is greater, being about 35ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50ppm, that of chromium is 160ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5ppm.|$|E
5|$|The major {{difficulty}} in separation of actinium is {{the similarity of}} its properties with those of <b>lanthanum.</b> Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of {{zirconium}} is 1855°C (3371°F), and {{the boiling point}} is 4371°C (7900°F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, <b>lanthanum,</b> and actinium.|$|E
5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to <b>lanthanum</b> {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} <b>lanthanum</b> and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, <b>lanthanum</b> is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, <b>lanthanum</b> {{has been placed}} under {{scandium}} and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than <b>lanthanum.</b> Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and <b>lanthanum</b> appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E
5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses <b>lanthanum</b> nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|Actinium was {{discovered}} in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne, an assistant of Marie Curie, in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium. He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to titanium and (in 1900) as similar to thorium. The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000, arguing that Debierne's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899–1900. This view instead credits the 1902 work of Friedrich Oskar Giesel, who discovered a radioactive element named emanium that behaved similarly to <b>lanthanum.</b> The name actinium comes from the Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. This metal {{was discovered}} not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products. Owing to the close similarity of actinium and <b>lanthanum</b> and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by Victor Goldschmidt in 1937.|$|E
