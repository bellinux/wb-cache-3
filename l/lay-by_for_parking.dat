However, unlike the other elevated stations, there are no escalators, lifts or staircases linking the station directly with the ground level.

60|$|The night {{passed as}} usual, and at noon of the 17th, {{or at the}} {{termination}} of the nautical day, the fleet had left another long track of ocean {{between it and the}} old world. The weeds were disappearing, and with them the tunny fish, which were, in truth, feeding on the products of shoals that mounted several thousands of feet nearer {{to the surface of the}} water, than was the case with the general bed of the Atlantic. The vessels usually kept near each other at noon, in order to compare their observations; but the Pinta, which, like a swift steed, was with difficulty restrained, shot ahead, until the middle of the afternoon, when, as usual, she <b>lay-by</b> <b>for</b> the admiral to close. As the Santa Maria came sweeping on, the elder Pinzon stood, cap in hand, ready to speak her, waiting only for her to come within sound of his voice.|$|R

40|$|Although drivers park free 99 {{percent of}} all their trips, you {{probably}} feel that you pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> on more than 1 percent of your automobile trips, and perhaps you do. Many of us undoubtedly pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> more frequently than others do. Americans make 230 billion vehicle trips a year, so drivers pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> 2. 3 billion times a year (1 percent of 230 billion), but they also park free 228 billion times a year. If drivers don't pay <b>for</b> <b>parking,</b> who does? Initially, developers pay for it when they provide all the parking spaces required by zoning ordinances. The cost of land and capital devoted to required parking raises the cost of all development, and this cost translates into higher prices for everything else, so everyone pays <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> indirectly. Residents pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> through higher prices for housing. Consumers pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> through higher prices for goods and services. Employers pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> through higher office rents. Only in our roles as motorists do we not pay <b>for</b> <b>parking</b> because motorists <b>park</b> free <b>for</b> most trips.

50|$|The year after, 1739, a new route {{route from}} Modena to Massa was {{proposed}} by Domenico Vandelli {{and the construction}} works begun. The construction was rapidly realized from Modena to Garfagnana. The road was provided with inns and staging posts all through its way, {{in order to allow}} for a safe and comfortable journey. The road had to overcome the Appennines, close to the ancient sanctuary of San Pellegrino in Alpe, above 1600m msl. During the years of the Austrian succession war, the road construction had to stop for more than 10 years and {{it was not possible to}} complete the work to reach Massa. In 1750 the construction begun again and the route was completed, overcoming also the Apuan Alps, at the Tambura Pass, above 1600m msl. This last part was the most difficult to be designed an realized, given the wilderness of the region and high slope of the mountain sides. To succeed in this part of the path, Domenico Vandelli had to use explosives to open passages on the mountain pass and to level some <b>lay-by</b> <b>for</b> the carriages, to follow the mountain side slope he had to construct dry-stone walls to support the road. In 1752, Via Vandelli was officially opened in its full length from Modena to Massa. A postal service by horse was operating regularly for years, being able to complete the trip from Modena to Massa and return in one week.|$|R
