Under then contract, Burbank provided a Hazardous Materials team, Glendale provided an Air and <b>Lighting</b> <b>unit</b> as well as the dispatch center, and Pasadena provided an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Type Heavy team. Today, both Glendale and Pasadena offer USAR Type Heavy teams. The three city fire departments are all dispatched from the Verdugo Communications Center, located in Glendale.

40|$|The new {{generation}} LED curing <b>light</b> <b>units</b> have significantly improved curing performance compared to first generation lights, {{and even some}} second generation LED curing <b>light</b> <b>units.</b> This study compared the curing performance of 10 {{new generation}} LED <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> (FLASH-lite 1401, LE Demetron 1, Coltolux, Ultra-Lume 5, Mini LED, bluephase, Elipar FreeLight 2, Radii, Smartlite IQ and Allegro) for depth of cure against a high-powered halogen curing <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> (Optilux 501). Depth of cure measurements were utilized per the ANSI/ADA No 27 standard to detect differences between the lights at three time intervals (10, 20 and 40 seconds).

Power density of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> with infection control barriers covering the fiberoptic bundle was measured with a hand held dental radiometer (Cure Rite). Wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> fixed on a custom made optical breadboard was measured with a portable spectroradiometer (CS- 1000).

50|$|HMI bulbs (like all arc bulbs) need {{a current}} {{limiting}} unit to function. Two {{ways of doing}} this are described in the ballast section below. The problem of flickering exists only when using the bulb in combination with magnetic ballast (electronic ballasts produce flicker-free light). HMI bulbs (running with magnetic ballast) present an inherent problem of possibly producing light on film or video with a noticeable flicker. This {{is caused by the}} method by which the unit produces light. An HMI, like an incandescent <b>lighting</b> <b>unit,</b> runs on mains power, which means that the lamp cycles on and off 100 or 120 times per second (twice for every line voltage cycle). Although not visible to the human eye, a film or video camera must be properly synchronized to this cycle or each frame recorded will show different light output. Although incandescent lamps also run off mains power, they don't exhibit perceptible flicker because their filaments don't cool down enough between cycles for their light output to decrease very much. For HMI lamps, flicker can be avoided by the use of electronic ballasts that cycle at frequencies thousands of times faster than the mains frequency.|$|E
