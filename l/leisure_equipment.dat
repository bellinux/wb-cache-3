In fact, SHAEF was aware that there were almost certainly two Panzer divisions at Arnhem but with the operation looming chose to ignore them. Such information would have been gleaned from Ultra intercepts that the First Allied Airborne Army was not privy to and therefore could not act upon themselves.|$|E

As inquietações a respeito da temática se deu a partir de investigações anteriores, na condição de bolsista de Iniciação Científica, através da oportunidade de sistematizar o estudo no Programa de Educação Ambiental – PPGEA/FURG, desenvolvendo esta dissertação. Mas, também, em virtude das escassas opções de equipamentos públicos para lazer num bairro popular e de quais atividades de lazer as crianças desenvolviam frente a esse condicionamento existente na comunidade. Portanto, estudamos o “lazer e infância” a partir do ponto de vista de um grupo de crianças do bairro Castelo Branco II - Rio Grande/RS, situado na periferia da cidade. O problema de pesquisa era então, saber o que elas faziam, o que era lazer para elas e verificar possiveis contribuições sobre a participação infantil. A Sociologia da Infância, ao valorizar a fala e as ações das crianças, ao fazer um enfrentamento teórico as concepções adultocêntricas hegemônicas, me possibilitaram o referenial de fundo ao estudo. Mas, também orientou minhas atividades de coleta de dados ao “deixar falar as crianças”, “ouvi-las”, bem como na análise, sistematização e interpretação dos dados. Ao optar por uma metodologia que tomasse a criança, não por suas incompletudes, mas como um grupo geracional diferente dos adultos, com uma cultura própria da infância, necessitava de instrumentos adequados as peculiaridades e características deste grupo de crianças. Os instrumentos para desenvolver a pesquisa foram as observações participantes, escrita de diários de campo, conversas informais e instrumentos que apelavam para oralidade como entrevistas que se utilizavam de recursos lúdicos. Por fim, diria que, mesmo sem equipamentos para o lazer, as crianças realizam atividades de lazer, criando estratégias para a diversão e prazer. E que lazer é brincar, fazer o que gosta, se divertir. Dentre as atividades descritas pelas crianças, nesta pesquisa, um ponto comum entre todas foram as brincadeiras desenvolvidas no ambiente doméstico, espaço no qual a maior parte das atividades de lazer são realizadas. Mas, as crianças também sonham, melhor, afirmaram suas utopias de lazer. Mostraram que elas têm muito a dizer sobre o lugar onde habitam, de como tornar o bairro mais acolhedor. Espero que o trabalho leve o leitor a repensar a forma como as crianças tem sido tratadas em nossa sociedade, reconhecendo ao final que elas são “seres sociais atuais”que podem contribuir com a elaboração de políticas públicas para a infância nas cidades. The {{perturbations}} {{about the}} thematic {{has come from}} the previous investigations when I was a holder of an Iniciação Científica scholarship, through the opportunity to systemize the study in the Programa de Educação Ambiental – PPGE/FURG, developing this dissertation. Another reason to develop this dissertation is the low number of options of public <b>equipments</b> for <b>leisure</b> in a popular neighborhood and the search of what leisure activities the children develop facing this condition in the community. Therefore, we have studied “leisure and childhood” since {{the point of view of}} a group of children from Castelo Branco II – Rio Grande/RS, located in the neighborhood of Rio Grande. The problem of the research was: to know what they did, what was leisure for them and verify possible contributions about the infantile participation. When doing a theoretical contrast of the hegemonic adult-centric concepts, the Sociology of Childhood valorizes the children’s speech and the actions and gave me the reference to the study. Besides that, it also oriented my data collection activities when “letting the children speak”, “listening them”, and the data analysis, systematization and interpretation. The option for a methodology that analyses children not for their lacks, but as a generating group different from adults, with a childhood culture, needed suitable instruments to the peculiarities and characteristics of this group of children. The instruments to develop the research were the participative observations, confection of a field diary, informal talks and instruments that appeal to the oral activities like interviews using joking resources. Finally, we could conclude that, even without <b>leisure</b> <b>equipments,</b> children do <b>leisure</b> activities, creating strategies for leisure and pleasure. We could conclude that leisure is to play, do what we like and enjoy. A common point, among the activities described by the children, in this research, were the jokes developed in the domestic environment, where the majority of the activities are accomplished. But children also dream and they affirm their leisure utopias. They showed that they have a lot to say about the place they live and how to change the neighborhood into a better place. The objective of this work is to make the reader think about the way children have been treated in our society, recognizing that they are “real social beings” which can the cities...|$|R
40|$|Acreditando que as crianças são ativas em seus contextos e capazes de revelar as realidades que as cercam, {{considerando que}} o conceito de infância vem se constituindo historicamente a partir das estruturas sociais, culturais, políticas e econômicas que envolvem as crianças e ainda nas relações que elas estabelecem com os outros, reconhecendo a importância dos contextos que direta ou indiretamente atingem as crianças e dado que a Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional nº 9. 394 / 96 vem sofrendo alterações que regem a escolaridade das crianças pequenas, o objetivo geral deste trabalho foi identificar, compreender e analisar a partir de concepções de crianças e suas {{professor}}as, como a escolarização nos dois últimos anos da Educação Infantil e nos dois primeiros anos do Ensino Fundamental vem se constituindo e as influenciando em um Centro Educacional Unificado (CEU) da cidade de São Paulo/SP. Neste cenário, a pesquisa de natureza qualitativa coletou dados no segundo semestre de 2014, a partir de cinco sessões de grupo focal com três grupos distintos: um grupo com 10 crianças matriculadas nos dois últimos anos da Educação Infantil, um grupo com 8 crianças matriculadas nos dois primeiros anos do Ensino Fundamental e um grupo formado por 4 professoras das crianças participantes. Os dados coletados foram categorizados e analisados à luz da perspectiva bioecológica que se constitui no modelo Processo-PessoaContexto-Tempo e em estudos da Sociologia da Infância, que consideram a infância como uma categoria permanente na estrutura social e concebem as crianças como atores sociais plenos e produtores de cultura capazes de interpretarem e revelarem seus mundos; além de outros autores que abordam temáticas que se aproximam a da que esta tese se propôs. Os resultados indicaram que a infraestrutura do CEU se diferencia por oferecer em um mesmo ambiente equipamentos de educação, lazer, cultura e esporte com acesso a toda comunidade, tendo as crianças mais possibilidade de vivenciarem ali práticas que em outras situações não teriam. As crianças pertencem a camadas populares, com predomínio de famílias estendidas e pais separados. Suas concepções revelaram que elas assumem os papeis de alunos e crianças, ainda que tenham definido particularidades relacionadas à ocupação ou local de inserção. Elas consideraram que se diferenciam dos adultos em algumas funções - ambos produtivos em seus contextos. Pareceram bem relacionadas entre si, gostam das professoras e estas buscam constituir vínculos com os alunos – estreitando as relações à medida que isso é possível dentro da rotina escolar. As crianças ainda pareceram gostar e estarem adaptadas à escola, atribuindo valor a ela e ao processo de escolarização e não apresentaram grandes perturbações ao que vem sendo oferecido. As professoras apresentaram experiências diversas, disseram gostar do que fazem apontando considerações relacionadas à profissão e concebem o professor como um aprendiz em constante interação com seus alunos. Elas não se opuseram as alterações legais mas indicaram adequações ao sistema escolar. A Educação Infantil revelou uma proposta de trabalho mais flexível do que o Ensino Fundamental que trabalha com foco para alfabetização. Há mais descontinuidades do que continuidades entre uma etapa de ensino e outra – porém alguns aspectos comuns a ambas etapas pareceram atenuar rupturas bruscas. A comunicação com as famílias das crianças se dá principalmente via agenda e presencialmente em situações pontuais. As professoras revelaram que as famílias respondem melhor ao Ensino Fundamental em função das exigências que esta etapa de ensino apresenta em relação à anterior e acreditam que a relação família-escola poderia ser mais qualificada. Os resultados deste estudo contribuirão para a Educação Escolar ao compor conhecimentos a outras pesquisas de natureza semelhante podendo superar conclusões prévias a elas ou serem superados por estudos futuros consolidando a teoria que vai sendo produzida na área. Palavras – chave: Pesquisa com crianças. Pesquisa com professoras. Educação Infantil: préescola. Ensino Fundamental: anos iniciais. Grupo focal. Believing {{that children are}} active in their context and able to reveal the realities that surround them, considering {{that the concept of}} childhood has constituted historically from social structures, cultural, political and economic involving children and also in the relationships that they establish with others, recognizing the importance of the contexts directly or indirectly affecting children and given that the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education No. 9394 / 96 has undergone changes that guide the education of young children, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify, understand and analyze from children's views and their teachers how the education in the last two years of pre-school and the first two years of elementary school has been constituting and influencing in a Unified Educational Center (UEC) in São Paulo/SP. In this scenario, the qualitative survey collected data in the second semester of 2014, from five focus group sessions with three distinct groups: one group with 10 children enrolled in the last two years of pre-school, a group of 8 children enrolled in first two years of elementary school and a group of 4 teachers of participating children. The collected data were categorized and analyzed according to the bioecological perspective that constitutes the model Process-Person-Context-Time and Sociological Studies of Child, which considers childhood as a permanent category in the social structure and conceive children as full social actors and producers of culture able to interpret and reveal their worlds; beyound authors that address issues that are close to the proposed by this thesis. The results proposes that the infrastructure of the UEC is different to offer in the same environment education <b>equipment,</b> <b>leisure,</b> culture and sports with access to the entire community, having the children more possibility to experience in that place practices that in other situations they would not have. Children belong to the urban poor, with a predominance of extended families structure and single parents. Their view reveal that they assume the roles of students and children, even though they define characteristics related to occupation or the place of insertion. They consider that differ from adults in some functions - both productive in their contexts. They seemed to be well related to each other, like the teachers whose search for establish links with the students - strengthening relationships as this is possible within the school routine. The children still seemed to be adapted to the school, assigning value to it and the process of schooling and had no major disruption to what has been offered. The teachers had different experiences, said that they like what they do pointing some considerations related to the profession and conceive the teacher as an apprentice in constant interaction with their students. They did not oppose the legal changes but indicated adjustments to the school system. The pre-school revealed a more flexible work proposal than the elementary school that works with focus on literacy. There are more discontinuities than continuities between a stage of education and the other – however some aspects common to both steps seem to mitigate sudden breaks. Communication between the families of children is done mainly via agenda and in personal in specific situations. The teachers reveal that families respond better to primary education in accordance with the requirements that this stage has based on the previous stage and believe that the family-school relationship could be more qualified. The results of this study will contribute to the school education once will assemble knowledge to other same nature which can overcome previous conclusions to them or be overcome by future studies consolidating the theory that is being produced in the area...|$|R
