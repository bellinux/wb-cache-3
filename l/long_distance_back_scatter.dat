40|$|During the {{formation}} of neuronal circuits, neurons respond to diffusible cues secreted by target tissues. Often, target-derived signals act on nerve terminals to influence local growth events; in other cases, they are transported <b>long</b> <b>distances</b> <b>back</b> to neuronal cell bodies to effect transcriptional changes necessary for neuronal survival and differentiation.

5000|$|The prairie falcon eats mostly {{small mammals}} (especially in summer) and small to {{medium-sized}} birds caught in flight, though as an opportunistic predator it will occasionally take larger birds. Though {{accounts of the}} prairie falcon taking prey as large as geese are verifiable (a prey that may be over 5 times heavier than a large female prairie falcon), it usually takes prey smaller than itself that it may safely subdue and which can be carried to the nest or to a safe perch to consume. The majority of prey is 150g or less, a weight that even the smaller tiercel (male) can carry <b>long</b> <b>distances</b> <b>back</b> to the nest. [...] Most prey is thus 30% or less {{of the weight of}} the tiercel, which is a common prey size fraction across numerous species of falcons where the males do the majority of the hunting during the nesting season. However, over shorter distances wildlife biologists have documented prairie falcons carrying up to about 60-70% of their body weight. Common mammalian prey for prairie falcons includes squirrels, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, gophers, and rabbits of various species. Reptiles are also sometimes taken. Bird prey commonly includes sparrows, starlings, grackles, doves, quail, meadow larks, pigeons, coots, teal, and mallards—virtually any bird of up to approximately the falcon’s own size and occasionally significantly larger. However, the need to feed their young focuses them on prey they can carry during nesting season, and the reproductive success of the prairie falcon depends upon such smaller prey being available.|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if 3  year treatment of hypercholesterolaemia with simvastatin causes {{an increase of}} lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  METHODS— 160 patients with hypercholesterolaemia in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4 S) were followed for 3  years. Half (80) of the patients took simvastatin and half (80) received placebo. The lens was photographed with a Topcon SL- 45 slit lamp camera {{at the beginning and}} at 1  year intervals. A common lens nuclear area was used for measuring lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  RESULTS—Nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased with age and there was more pronounced scattering in women than in men. Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> did not differ significantly between the simvastatin and placebo groups, but the power was low (0. 2). Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased during the study period independently of baseline <b>back</b> <b>scattering,</b> age, and sex for both groups.  CONCLUSION—Although no significant difference was found between the simvastatin and placebo groups, the currently available data are insufficient for exclusion of the possibility that taking simvastatin during a 3  year period increases nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, a possible minor increase of nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> is clinically irrelevant considering known beneficial effects of simvastatin on coronary heart disease. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Masker {{portion of}} the system is based upon {{creating}} a speed of sound (acoustic impedance) mismatch between the bubble curtain and the seawater. Acoustic waves encountering material with a radically different speed of sound do not penetrate, but are reflected back. The speed of sound in a medium is dependent upon the square root of stiffness of a material divided by its density. In a bubble cloud, the density is mostly unchanged - that of the water - but the stiffness is that of air. The result is that the speed of sound in a cloud of bubbles in water is a factor of almost ten slower than in water itself and a factor of three slower than it is in air. Thus, sounds within the ship (or submarine) hull which would otherwise go out into the water and propagate for a <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> are reflected <b>back</b> into the hull and are eventually dissipated.

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{has increased the}} trade between different places and countries. Products are now available {{from all over the}} world, but this requires transports that have consequences in the environment as well as the economy. New professions are creates that do formality, organize, administrate and implement other businesses transports. Their operations are between the business and customer and they are called logistics companies. The purpose of this report was to study third-party logistics and why more and more companies use this logistics services. A literature study was done to research This. The study is based on a literature work in the field of logistics by using books, articles and the Internet. The report also studied whether there are differences between terms within third-party logistics from 1980 - 90 s and today. In third-party logistics it is emphasize to there is focus on using a logistics company as a good alternative for the companies who aren´t able to have a high quantity in their own vehicle. The purpose with route planning is to use the availability in the vehicle and try to have as high filling degree as possible. The filling degree is usually calculated on how much of the total area, volume or weight that is used. Since the origin of the term third-party logistics in the 80 - 90 s, the positive and negative aspects have been the same. But during the years more positive aspects have appeared. There are more positive aspects about third-party logistics than negative. Companies’ use and dependence of what third-party logistics can offer, have provided the companies with mostly positive aspects. The logistics concept is more complex today that it was at its origin and it includes more activities. In the 90 s, the concept forwarder was used to describe a person who coordinated the transports while the transporter was the one who executed the transports. By looking at outdated literature, we can presume that the future will bring more changes and that the role of respective parties will become even more unclear than they are today. From the theory a deeper analysis was done in form of interviews with four third-logistics companies, to find out how transports work out in real life. The questions were classified in three groups; routes, filling degree and environment. The four companies worked constantly to improve the filling degree by different types of coordination and better loading, but also to by having goods in the return transport. Three of four companies thought that the transports were too cheap. A large number of goods are transported <b>long</b> <b>distances</b> <b>back</b> and forth. The logistics companies tried to offer their customers good customers service with cheap, fast and close transports in order to be competitive. We think that the logistics companies must take more responsibility and shouldn’t drive empty trucks, no matter the price they get. By a high filling rate the environments can be saved, because it will take fewer transports and it improves the company’s economy. The logistics companies of tomorrow have big challenges to overcome if they should continue a sustainable development that benefits their economic situation and the environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{develop an}} {{algorithm}} using two coupled parabolic equations for numerical simulation of wave propagation over <b>long</b> <b>distances.</b> The coupled parabolic equations {{are derived from}} a two mode wave decomposition. An iterative procedure was used in our numerical algorithm. The coupling between the two parabolic equations allow us to deal with inhomogeneities in the medium and capture the <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> that are usually neglected in a one way parabolic approximation. We study stability issues of our numerical algorithm and present numerical examples. 1 Introduction Efficient numerical algorithms are important {{in order to understand}} wave propagation in complex media. Resolving the wavelength is one of the basic sampling conditions for numerical algorithms. However, in many applications, such as underwater acoustics, communications and remote sensing, the wave propagates over a <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> which may be several order of magnitudes compared to the wavelength. If the medium is inhomogeneous there is an additional characteristic scale corresponding to the correlation length of the medium inhomogeneities. Wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium is thus a multi-scale problem in space and time, which poses a great challenge for numerical simulations. Here we focus on the simulation of time harmonic waves, that is, we reduce the full wave equation in space and time to the Helmholtz equation in space only by Fourier transformation in time. The Helmholtz equation gives a boundary value proble...|$|R

Richard had been constantly seeking territorial expansion through war against his Lombard neighbors, Pandulf VI of Capua and Guaimar's son and successor, Gisulf II of Salerno. He pushed back the borders of the latter until there was little left of the once great principality but the city of Salerno itself and when the weak prince of Capua died in 1057, he immediately besieged Capua and took the princely title (1058) from Pandulf's brother, Landulf VIII, but left the keys to the city in Lombard hands for at least four years more, until 12 May 1062.|$|R
