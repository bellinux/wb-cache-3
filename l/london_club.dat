5|$|After joining Stade Montois, Serevi {{moved to}} the {{coaching}} staff due to the second level sides only being allowed to play two non-European Union players. After getting clearance from the French Rugby Federation, Serevi was cleared {{to play for the}} club in 2001. He continued there until joining Stade Bordelais in January 2004. In late 2004 Serevi joined <b>London</b> <b>club</b> Staines; making his debut in a victory against Thurrock in December that year. Serevi stopped playing professional club rugby in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Luton Town {{supporters}} {{maintain a}} bitter rivalry with Hertfordshire-based Watford. Watford have remained the higher ranked {{team at the}} end of every season since 1997. However, overall Luton still hold the superior record in the fixture between the two clubs; out of 118 competitive matches there have been 53 Luton victories and 36 for Watford, with 29 draws. A survey taken in 2003 showed that there was also animosity between Luton Town fans and those of west <b>London</b> <b>club</b> Queens Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Mitcham Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is {{believed}} to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a <b>London</b> <b>Club</b> in 1722.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only three times before the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who just felt that different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to <b>London</b> <b>club</b> Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{began his}} career at West Ham United, joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the FA Youth Cup two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to Swindon Town and Birmingham City, before {{securing}} {{a place in the}} first team by the 2000–01 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002–03 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for the Hammers, and in 2004, he moved to rival <b>London</b> <b>club</b> Tottenham Hotspur for a fee believed to be £3.5million. He scored 2 goals in 75 appearances before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for £18million.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{had their}} first major success in 1955, when they won the English league championship. They then won various cup {{competitions}} between 1965 and 1971. The club's greatest period of success has come {{during the last two}} decades, winning 21 trophies since 1997. Chelsea have won six national league titles, seven FA Cups, five League Cups and four FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Super Cup. Chelsea are the only <b>London</b> <b>club</b> to win the UEFA Champions League, and one of five clubs and the first British club, to have won all three of UEFA's major club competitions.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic duopoly. The <b>London</b> <b>club</b> won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them with younger talent. The 2005 Cup win was their last piece of silverware until 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, the <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> {{have not}} {{accumulated}} as many trophies as those from North West England, such as Liverpool and Manchester United; however, today Arsenal and Chelsea {{are regarded as}} two of the Premier League's [...] "big four" [...] alongside them. In 2003-04 they became the first pair of <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> to finish first and second in the top flight, with Arsenal winning. In 2004-05 they did so again, this time with Chelsea winning. The 2009–10 Premier League saw Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham finish in the top 4 places, {{the first time ever}} that three <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> had done so, and it meant that all three qualified for the UEFA Champions League.|$|R
5000|$|Football is now {{the most}} popular spectator sport in London, and the city has several of England's leading <b>clubs.</b> Most <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> are named after the {{district}} in which they play (or used to play). Historically the <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> have not accumulated as many trophies as those from the north-west of England, such as Liverpool and Manchester United, but at present Arsenal (founded at Woolwich Arsenal but playing in Holloway), and Chelsea (who actually play in Fulham) are regarded as two of the Premier League's [...] "big four" [...] alongside Manchester United and Liverpool. In 2003-04 they became the first pair of <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> to finish first and second in the top flight, with Arsenal winning. In 2004-05 they did so again, this time with Chelsea winning. In 2009-10, three of the top four places were occupied by London sides—Chelsea (champions), Arsenal (3rd) and Tottenham Hotspur (4th). This meant that the 2010-11 season would see three <b>London</b> <b>clubs</b> in the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} ever.|$|R
5|$|On 1 December 1886, munitions {{workers in}} Woolwich, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with David Danskin as their first captain. Named after {{the heart of}} the Royal Arsenal complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common, though they spent most of their time in South East London playing {{on the other side of}} Plumstead, at the Manor Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only {{football}} association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first <b>London</b> <b>club</b> to turn professional.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{proved to}} be a crucial player for the 2004–05 season; in November 2004, he was awarded the FA Premier League Player of the Month award. Robben ended the 2004–05 season with seven goals, his second highest {{professional}} total. He was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year, but was beaten by Manchester United's Wayne Rooney. Robben was badly injured in a Premier League match away to Blackburn Rovers and forced to sit out Chelsea's title run-in and progress to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Back to fitness for 2005–06, Robben {{was an integral part of}} the Chelsea left wing. In 28matches, Robben contributed six goals as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League championship, the first back-to-back titles for the west <b>London</b> <b>club.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} the 108th season of {{competitive}} football played by Arsenal. It {{was the final}} season in which home matches were played at the club's Highbury stadium after 93 years; Arsenal intended to move to its new 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium {{in time for the}} following season. The club ended their Premier League campaign in fourth, having pipped local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to the position on the final day. Arsenal became the first <b>London</b> <b>club</b> to reach a UEFA Champions League final, though lost 2–1 to Barcelona in Paris. In the League Cup the club was eliminated in the semi-finals on aggregate score by Wigan Athletic and knocked out of the FA Cup, against Bolton Wanderers in the fourth round.|$|E

5|$|The next year, 1888, {{he scored}} {{successive}} half-centuries for Somerset {{early in the}} season against Warwickshire and Staffordshire before making his debut for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Facing Oxford University, Hewett made zero and eight for the <b>London</b> <b>club.</b> The same summer, Hewett was selected to play for an England XI against the touring Australians, and in a ten wicket win for the tourists, he scored 12 and 1. Between 1884 and 1888 Hewett had limited success at the first-class level, establishing a reputation as a useful, if erratic, hard-hitting middle-order batsman. He played a lot of club cricket, being a regular for Harrow Wanderers, and scoring 201 not out for Senior Common Room against Christ Church in 1888.|$|E
5|$|They {{moved to}} their third home, The Athletic Grounds, on 6 September 1890. This {{was their first}} {{purpose-built}} ground, with a grandstand that seated 600 people and an overall capacity of between 10,000 and 15,000. The club was forced to move on again though, this time by the Millwall Dock Company who wanted {{to use it as}} a timberyard. They relocated in 1901 to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich. They remained an east <b>London</b> <b>club</b> for a further nine years, with the last game played on the Isle of Dogs on 8 October 1910 against Portsmouth, which Millwall won 3–1.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} consistently {{with the}} team, on 24 March 2004, Evra suffered an ankle {{injury in the}} club's 4–2 first leg defeat to Spanish club Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Evra subsequently missed {{two weeks in the}} league, but was healthy enough to return for the team's second leg quarter-final tie against Madrid, which Monaco won 3–1. The win allowed the club advancement to the Champions League semi-finals on the away goals rule. In the semi-finals, Monaco faced English club Chelsea. Evra appeared in both matches as Monaco advanced to the final, beating the <b>London</b> <b>club</b> 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, Monaco were pitted against Porto at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The club was defeated 3–0 by Porto. Evra played the full 90minutes. After the season, Evra was given the UNFP Young Player of the Year award, becoming only the second defender and the first since 1997 (Philippe Christanval) to win the award. He was also named to the organisation's Ligue 1 Team of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with another}} newly formed <b>London</b> <b>club</b> Chelsea, Palace applied {{to join the}} Second Division of the Football League. But {{unfortunately}} for Palace, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and Palace were forced {{to settle for a}} place in the Southern League Second Division. To increase the number of club fixtures, they also joined the mid-week United Counties League. Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of other clubs' reserve sides alongside Southall, Southern United, St. Leonards United and Grays United was a successful one. Their opening match was against Southampton Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to sit. Palace led 3–0 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3–4. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9–1 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4–0 defeat of Watford Reserves in March.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west <b>London</b> <b>club</b> Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Chelsea {{were the}} first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley. They {{were the first}} English club to be ranked No. 1 under UEFA's five-year {{coefficient}} system in the 21st century. They were the first team in Premier League history to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone {{on the final day of}} the 2009–10 season. Chelsea are the only <b>London</b> <b>club</b> to win the UEFA Champions League, after beating Bayern Munich in the 2012 final.
