5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui.</b> However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Hsu {{went to the}} United States as a Columbia University {{exchange}} scholar. In {{the same}} year, he joined the World United Formosans for Independence, and he also served as the literary editor for the Taiwan Tribune. As a result, he {{was placed on the}} Kuomintang's black list and was unable to return to Taiwan. He then earned his PhD candidacy from New School for Social Research. In 1990, Hsu was invited to a meeting by President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui</b> and returned to Taiwan as a Taiwanese-American professor. With the influence of then-legislators Chen Shui-bian, Peng Pai-hsien, Hung Chi-chang, and Lu Hsiu-yi, the government relented and removed the restriction for Hsu to exit and enter the country, finally issuing him a new passport.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{concern is}} whether RTHK has enough editorial independence {{for a public}} broadcaster. One of the examples was the suspected intervention in RTHK's press freedom in July 1999. After inviting Cheng An-kuo (鄭安國), the highest representative of the [...] "Taiwanese authority" [...] in Hong Kong, {{to discuss the issue}} of the separation of China and Taiwan and <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> [...] "Two States Theory", RTHK was condemned by Chinese nationalists.|$|R
25|$|During the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, ROC President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui</b> {{proposed}} to reactivate the program, but {{was forced to}} back down {{a few days later}} after drawing intense criticism from the U.S. government.|$|E

50|$|It was rumoured {{that the}} {{decision}} for TSC over Eurotrain was political: according to Taiwanese media, the choice was made {{to pave the way}} for then-President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> visit to Japan. THSRC denied the allegations. However, in a book published earlier in May 1999, Lee made a case for picking the Japanese offer, claiming that while it was more expensive, the Shinkansen was superior based on safety and political considerations.|$|R
5000|$|Kuo {{has stated}} [...] "I'm {{culturally}} Chinese but politically not," [...] described <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> China policy as [...] "fitful" [...] and [...] "reactive", reiterated support for continued {{dialogue between the}} two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and has repeatedly advocated for the Democratic Progressive Party to suspend Taiwan independence as a core value. These actions have led to characterization of his political beliefs as supportive of China, a description he regards as inaccurate.|$|R
25|$|There {{are a few}} Taiwanese personalities (such as politicians) {{whose names}} are in obscure or {{idiosyncratic}} schemes. For instance, using any major romanization, former president <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> surname would have been Li. Vice-President Vincent Siew's surname is a rare form of Xiao, from Hokkien (also Sio or Siau). The given names of successive presidents Ma Ying-jeou and Tsai Ing-wen are romanized in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. The single closest romanization to Chen Shui-bian's name would be Hanyu Pinyin.|$|R
25|$|Chiang {{selected}} <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui,</b> a Taiwan born technocrat to be {{his vice}} president, first {{in the line of}} succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 Taipei's 16 {{districts were}} {{consolidated}} {{into the current}} 12 districts. Mass democracy rallies that year in the plaza around Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall led to an island-wide transition to multi-party democracy, where legislators are chosen via regularly scheduled popular elections, during the presidency of <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-Hui.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1999, ROC President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui</b> {{proposed}} a two-state theory (兩國論) {{in which both}} the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China would acknowledge that they are two separate countries with a special diplomatic, cultural and historic relationship. This however drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting Taiwan independence.|$|E

The current official residence is at the intersection of Chongqing South Road Section 2 and Aiguo West Road, Zhongzheng, Taipei, and has been in use since <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> presidency.

50|$|Taiwan's Ministry of Defence {{denied that}} Chang {{had been a}} CIA informant. Its retired Chief of General Staff (1981-1989), General Hau Pei-tsun, claimed that {{for more than a}} decade previously, Taiwan already had the {{potential}} to develop nuclear weapons. A former member of President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> national security team, Chang Jung-feng, has described Chang's actions as a 'betrayal'. The CIA has refused to discuss Chang's defection. James R. Lilley, who served as CIA station chief in Beijing, said the case should be 'publicly acknowledged as a success'.|$|R
25|$|Sun {{was once}} {{regarded}} as heir apparent to Chiang Ching-kuo, but {{he suffered a}} stroke during a legislative interpellation session in 1984, ending his political career. Instead, <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui</b> became Chiang's heir apparent and ultimate successor. Sun resigned as premier on May 20, 1984 and {{was appointed to the}} largely honorary position of senior advisor to the President of the Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{there was}} a shift in power away from the KMT to people native to Taiwan. This, {{combined}} with cultural liberalization and the increasing remoteness {{of the possibility of}} retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered view of history and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered. Taiwanization was strongly supported by President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui.</b>|$|E
25|$|Higher {{salaries}} and better organized trade unions in Taiwan, {{together with the}} reduction of the Taiwanese export quotas meant that the bigger Taiwanese companies moved their production to China and Southeast Asia. The civil society in a now developed country, wanted democracy, and the rejection of the KMT dictatorship was bigger day by day. A major step occurred when <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui,</b> a native from Taiwan, became President, and the KMT started a new path searching for democratic legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the 2000 presidential election, <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> supporters established the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which advocated a more radical brand of Taiwan independence than the DPP. For this, Lee was expelled from the KMT and the KMT gradually moved itself to a more conservative and pro-reunificationist position. This permitted the formation of two rival coalitions that have since dominated Taiwanese politics: the Pan-Blue Coalition formed by the KMT, People First Party, and New Party and the Pan-Green Coalition formed by the Democratic Progressive Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union.|$|R
50|$|The new {{cigarette}} brand {{was originally}} {{planned to be}} launched in Taiwan on May 20, 1999, to celebrate the anniversary of former president <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> inauguration as Taiwan's first democratically elected president. However, after receiving harsh criticism from several social and legislative groups, the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation announced on May 13, 1999, that it had suspended the production of 520. The primary concern of the critics was that the cigarette brand was targeted at young people with its name, design and flavor. Now 520 is only sold outside of Taiwan.|$|R

25|$|The {{society of}} Taiwan {{and other areas}} {{controlled}} by the ROC underwent a dramatic transformation {{in the years following}} the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975. In the next two decades, Chiang Ching-kuo and <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui</b> presided over a peaceful transition from single-party rule enforcing martial law to pluralistic democracy with protected human rights. The nature and meaning of Chiang Kai-shek's rule could be openly debated and, as details of the February 28 Incident and White Terror publicly emerged, they were.|$|E
25|$|Ma {{was able}} to repair the {{political}} damage and, in December 2002, became the leading figure in the KMT by easily winning reelection as mayor of Taipei {{with the support of}} 64% of Taipei voters while DPP challenger Lee Ying-yuan received 36%. His solid victory, especially in light of opposition from both President Chen and former President and KMT chairman <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui,</b> led many to speculate about his chances as the KMT candidate for the 2004 presidential elections, although nothing came of it.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004 Presidential campaign, President Chen Shui-bian {{publicly}} campaigned with <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui</b> {{and developed}} a campaign platform, including a call for a new constitution adopted by referendum, which {{could be interpreted as}} an opportunity to make the symbolic changes which Lee supports. There was concern in the United States and in the People's Republic of China that Chen would be supportive of Lee's positions, a belief which was reinforced by Lee's own actions while President and by Lee's public statements that Chen Shui-bian agreed with him.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1935, the Japanese {{began an}} island-wide {{assimilation}} project to bind the island more firmly to the Japanese Empire {{and people were}} taught {{to see themselves as}} Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese surnames. The [...] "South Strike Group" [...] was based at the Taihoku Imperial University in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the Japanese military. For example, former ROC President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> elder brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines in February 1945.|$|R
50|$|Chen {{served in}} the Legislative Yuan for one term from 1993 to 1996. He was then named the {{minister}} of the Government Information Office in 1998. The next year, he was appointed to lead the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chen planned to retire after stepping {{down at the end}} of President <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> final term in 2000. However, Lee's successor Chen Shui-bian asked Chen Chien-jen to reconsider. Chen eventually chose to accept the post of representative to the United States. He postponed retirement again in 2004 to become the representative to the European Union and Belgium. Chen was succeeded by Michael Kau in July 2006.|$|R
50|$|Departing {{from the}} former presidents <b>Lee</b> <b>Teng-hui's</b> special state-to-state {{relations}} and Chen Shui-bian's One Country on Each Side in which both define the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) as states {{and the relationship between}} the two as one between two states, Ma Ying-jeou defines the relations as a special relationship between two areas within one state. The ROC government considers that state as the ROC, while the PRC government considers that state as the PRC. While the governing authority in one area cannot recognise the authority in the other area as a legitimate government, neither would deny the other side being the de facto governing authority of one area of the state. According to this view the relations between the two areas are special and laws relating to international relations cannot be applied.|$|R
