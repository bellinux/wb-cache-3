Hazel, birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber.|$|E

Fast forward to a rainy night in 1933, when Gilda stumbles into the room of Guy Malyon, an Irishman who is a first-year scholarship student at Cambridge University. She has had a lover's quarrel with one of the dons, and rather than turn her out into the storm, Guy gallantly allows her to spend the night. Later, they become lovers, but the two are separated when Gilda's mother dies and she opts to leave England. A few years later, Guy sees her as an extra in a Hollywood film, and shortly after he coincidentally receives a letter from her inviting him to visit her in Paris, where she's working as a photographer.|$|E
25|$|Hans-Jürgen Stumpff's Luftflotte 5 was {{responsible}} for Axis air operations over the far north, along with the Finnish Air Force.

Only the 7th Army and 14th Army were deployed. The 7th almost covered the entire Soviet-Finnish border between Lake Ladoga and the southern portion of the Kola Peninsula. The 14th Army protected the northern Kola, the Kirov railway and Murmansk port. The Germans were also weak. Their forces suffered from huge logistics issues. It was only when the Swedish government allowed them to transport their forces through Sweden that these problems were eased. The aim of the Axis was to capture Murmansk, the severe the Kirov railway and isolate the Kola Peninsula.|$|E
