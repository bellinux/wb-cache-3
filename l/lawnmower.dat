5|$|Connie Smith {{was born}} Constance June Meador on August 14, 1941 to Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana. Her parents were {{originally}} from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there. They would later move to Dungannon, Ohio. Her father was abusive {{when she was}} a child, which would eventually cause her to suffer a mental breakdown {{when she was a}} teenager. When she was seven, her mother divorced her father and married Tom Clark. Clark brought 8 children to the new marriage; Meador brought five, including Smith. The couple would eventually have two more children together, which in total added up to fifteen children. As a child, Smith was surrounded by music. Her stepfather played mandolin, while her brother played fiddle, and her other brother played guitar. On Saturday nights Smith would listen to the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast. While she was a teenager, she was injured in a <b>lawnmower</b> accident, which nearly cut her leg off. While in the hospital recovering, she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords. Following the recovery, she began to perform in various local talent contests. In 1959, Smith graduated from Salem-Liberty High School as the class salutatorian.|$|E

25|$|George Jones famously drove a John Deere {{lawn tractor}} to {{a liquor store}} after his wife had taken away his car keys {{to keep him from}} driving drunk. The {{incident}} was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a <b>lawnmower.</b> Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have took my car keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere <b>lawnmower.</b> The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding <b>lawnmower.</b>|$|E
25|$|The modern {{rules of}} many {{football}} codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This {{also applies to}} other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first <b>lawnmower</b> in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.|$|E

25|$|Kart racing or karting is {{a variant}} of an open-wheel motor sport with simple, small four-wheeled {{vehicles}} called karts, go-karts, or gearbox karts depending on the design. Karts vary widely in speed and some can reach speeds exceeding 160mph, while go-karts intended {{for the general public}} in amusement parks may be limited to speeds of no more than 15mph. In the summer of 1956, hot rod veteran Art Ingels built the first go-kart out of old car frame tubing, welding beads, and a <b>lawnmower</b> motor, not realizing that he had invented a new sport and form of auto racing.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery {{held the}} first patent on a rotary blade mower. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, mowers were {{equipped}} with a rotating reel assembly that was either pushed by hand or was propelled by a small gasoline engine. This kind of mower worked well in short grass, but it clogged up in tall grass. Montgomery did not invent this mower, but he obtained the patent from a frustrated inventor in Chicago, Illinois. The first commercially produced rotary mower, the Yazoo Master Mower, was then produced by a small manufacturing plant in Jackson, Mississippi. Montgomery was the Louisiana distributor of Yazoo until 1981, when he closed his <b>lawnmower</b> business in Ruston.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these degradation products in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components {{makes it harder to}} start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not be}} eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, isopropyl alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as <b>lawnmower</b> and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, lawn heights are {{generally}} maintained by gasoline-powered <b>lawnmowers,</b> which contribute to urban smog {{during the summer}} months. The EPA found, in some urban areas, up to 5% of smog was due to small gasoline engines made before 1997, such as are typically used on <b>lawnmowers.</b> Since 1997, the EPA has mandated emissions controls on newer engines {{in an effort to}} reduce smog.|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to their unusual mix of musical styles, the Daddies became perhaps most notorious for their extravagant and often provocative stage shows. With the band donning a rotating array of flamboyant costumes, a typical Daddies performance would often feature go-go dancers, phallic stage scenery, prop-heavy vaudevillian skits and choreographed dance numbers. Perry — performing under the mad scientist stage persona of [...] "MC Large Drink" [...] — would engage in absurdist shock rock antics such as mock crucifixion, flag burning and slathering his body with various foods and liquids. The most infamous element of the Daddies' early stage shows, however, was the [...] "Dildorado" [...] (alternately [...] "Dildozer"), a penis-shaped modified ride-on <b>lawnmower</b> which mimicked ejaculation by shooting salvos of colorful fluids from its tip.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Brosnan {{moved to}} Southern California {{and rose to}} {{popularity}} in the United States playing the title role in the NBC romantic detective series Remington Steele. The Washington Post noted that same year that Brosnan [...] "could {{make it as a}} young James Bond." [...] After Remington Steele ended in 1987, Brosnan went on to appear in several films, including The Fourth Protocol (1987), a Cold War thriller in which he starred alongside Michael Caine, The Deceivers and James Clavell's Noble House both in (1988), and The <b>Lawnmower</b> Man (1992). In 1992, he shot a pilot for NBC called Running Wilde, playing a reporter for Auto World magazine. Jennifer Love Hewitt played his daughter. The pilot never aired, however. In 1993 he played a supporting role in the comedy film Mrs. Doubtfire. He also appeared in several television films, including Victim of Love (1991), Death Train (1993) and Night Watch (1995), a spy thriller set in Hong Kong.|$|E
500|$|Big Boi's {{lyrics are}} playful and irreverent, with clever wordplay and boasts, while {{incorporating}} non-sequiturs, pop culture references, and tongue-twisters. His rhymes are delivered through a fast, versatile flow and dexterous cadence. Rolling Stones Christian Hoard describes his flow as [...] "inimitably slick and speedy". Amos Barshad of New York notes his lyrics as [...] "playful, but his flow is stern and unpredictable". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker describes the album's mood as [...] "decidedly upbeat" [...] and writes of Big Boi's rapping, [...] "The musical DNA of Sir Lucious {{lies in a}} simple strategy that Big Boi has used for years: he often raps in double time, {{no matter what the}} tempo of the song is. This means that even the slower songs [...] don’t drag—Big Boi uses the space in the beat to provide another rhythm with his words". Frere-Jones describes him as [...] "simultaneously forceful and careful" [...] with his lyrics and compares his rapping technique to [...] "the clatter of a machine, like a <b>lawnmower,</b> where secondary rhythms whisper underneath the main beat [...] Big Boi is never laid-back when he raps: he defines wide-awake".|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] was viewed by an estimated 3.11 million viewers, {{one of the}} lowest ratings for the season. Conversely, writer Raelle Tucker won the Constellation Award for [...] "Best Overall 2007 Science Fiction Film or Television Script" [...] for her work on the episode, and the episode garnered positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide [...] "adored" [...] the episode, and considered it to be Jensen Ackles' best performance of the series. She experienced an [...] "emotional roller coaster the entire hour", finding Dean's monologue at his father's grave to be [...] "crushing" [...] but the <b>lawnmower</b> scene to be [...] "hilarious". Likewise, Diana Steenbergen of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.2 out of 10, praising the quick pace, [...] "heavy" [...] character development, and [...] "ton and a half of angst". She, too, felt that Ackles [...] "hits the ball out of the park", and noted that the episode's humor stemmed from Ackles' willingness to be a [...] "big goofball". Actresses Samantha Smith and Adrianne Palicki were [...] "a treat", although Steenbergen would have liked Jeffrey Dean Morgan to return.|$|E

500|$|... "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Westbrook and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It featured John Slattery, Matthew Weiner, and Kevin Michael Richardson as guest voices. Weiner is the creator, writer, and showrunner of the television show Mad Men, in which Slattery portrays the character Roger Sterling. The entire A-Plot of the episode was a parody of Mad Men. Homer transforms into the lead character from Mad Men, Don Draper, and Slattery's character Robert Marlowe shares similarities with Roger Sterling. Weiner's role in the episode was a brief cameo {{as one of the}} businessmen on the rafting trip with Mr. Burns. The lead actor of Mad Men, Jon Hamm, did not appear in the episode, but previously appeared in the season 22 episode [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] as a different character. [...] "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] even recreated a scene from Mad Men, in which a <b>lawnmower</b> runs loose in an office.

500|$|Alyeska {{reported}} {{that about half}} were too minor to affect {{the running of the}} pipeline, but questions lay with more than a thousand welds that might be dangerous. Re-examining the welds would be extremely difficult, since those sections of pipeline were sealed (and in many cases buried). By July, the U.S. Congress began holding hearings into the welding problems. President Gerald Ford sent a team to Alaska to oversee and examine Alyeska's work. At the recommendations of this team and to avoid further investigations, Alyeska began repairing the welds on its own. By September, more than 3,000 of the questionable welds had been redone or certified as safe. Alyeska asked for waivers on the remaining 612 welds, and more hearings resulted. By the end of November, only 34 welds were still at issue. The leader of Ford's team ordered 31 of the welds to be dug up and re-done. Waivers were granted for only three welds, all of which were buried [...] under the Koyukuk River south of the Brooks Range. Proof of the integrity of questionable welds were evaluated by a unique solution in Section Five north of the Brooks Range. [...] On either side of the Sagavanirktok River, the above ground pipeline was cut upon and 48 inch fans installed to circulate air. [...] Then a team of 12 men and inspectors riding on wheeled sleds pulled by a modified John Deere <b>lawnmower</b> entered the pipe. [...] Welds were counted during the passage. [...] After arriving at the questionable weld under the Sagavanirktok River, an ultrasound was taken {{on the inside of the}} pipe. [...] Then the team exited the pipe on the opposite side and the ultrasound was taken back to camp for evaluation. [...] Alyeska estimated the total cost of redoing the welds to be $55 million.|$|E
