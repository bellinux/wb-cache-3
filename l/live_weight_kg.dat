Data on animal live weight (LW), body length (BL), chest girth (CG) and body volume were collected from 221 stallions kept by traditional household farmers. Animal body volume was calculated using cylinder volume formula with CG and BL as the components of its formula. Regression analysis was carried out for LW with all the linear body measurements. The data were classified {{on the basis of}} age. Age significantly (P 0. 05). Animal live weight was predicted by simple regression models using dependent variable (Y) of the animal live weight and independent variable (X) of the animal body measurement, either body length, chest girth, or body volume. The correlations between all pairs of measurements were highly significant (P < 0. 01) for all age groups. Regression analysis showed that live weight could be predicted accurately from body volume (R 2 = 0. 92) and chest girth (R 2 = 0. 90). Simple regression model that can be recommended to predict horse live weight based on body volume with their age groups ranging from 3 to ≥ 10 years old was as follow: <b>Live</b> <b>weight</b> (<b>kg)</b> = 5. 044 + 1. 87088 body volume (liters).

Thirty-four male crossbred lambs (Texel x Bleu du Maine) with an initial <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 20 <b>kg</b> were used in the experiment. The lambs were randomly divided into three groups (group 1 : 14 weaning lambs fed intensively with concentrate, group 2 : 13 suckling lambs kept on pasture, group 3 : 7 weaning lambs kept on pasture). Animals were slaughtered at an average <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 40 <b>kg.</b> The carcass <b>weight,</b> the daily gain and the longissimus muscle area were significantiy (P < 0. 05) lower in weaning lambs kept on pasture (group 3) compared to concentrate fed lambs (group 1). The concentration of total n- 3 fatty acids was significantiy (P < 0. 05) increased up to 83 mg/ 100 g muscle in lambs kept on pasture compared to 33 mg/ 100 g in animals fed concentrate. The ratio of n- 6 and n- 3 fatty acids was beneficially low as well as in concentrate fed lambs (7 : 1) and in grazing lambs (2 : 1).

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} designed to investigate <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> error and analyse the effect fasting and multiple weighing has on <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> measurements were carried out. In the first experiment 24 mixed aged ewes were fasted during a 24 hour period with <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> measurements taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours fasted, with three measurements taken at each time point. At the conclusion of weighing all animals were slaughtered and their gutfill was weighed to enable calculation of their true (digesta-free) weight. In the second experiment 100 Coopworth ewes were weighed as described above on two separate occasions in May and July. On all occasion animals were individually identifiable with either visual ear tags or electronic identification tags (EID). In experiment one <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of ewes {{at the start of}} fasting ranged from 34. 4 – 79. 6 kg with a mean <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 61. 3 <b>kg.</b> The mean <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss displayed a curvilinear response peaking at 4. 1 ± 0. 23 kg or 6. 7 % ± 0. 348 at 24 h fasting, with a significant effect of time. The regression equations y = - 0. 0073 x² + 0. 3445 x for absolute <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss and y=- 0. 012 x²+ 0. 5636 x for proportional <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss both explained 98 % of the variation. The proportion of true <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> relative to measured <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> over 24 hours fasted increased from 0. 85 ± 0. 006 to 0. 91 ± 0. 004. Despite being fasted for 24 h the animals were only able to reach 91 % of their true <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> as final digesta ranged from 2. 5 - 7. 3 kg with an average of 5. 06 ± 0. 27 kg. Therefore it was determined that attaining a reliable estimation of an animal’s true body weight is unachievable when fasting them for 24 hours. In experiment two, the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 100 ewes was measured during a 24 hours fasting period with measurements taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours in May which was repeated again in July. The <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss peaked at 7. 87 % in May which was considerably greater than the maximum <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss of 3. 09 % seen in the July experiment. The difference was likely due to a difference in weather conditions, with snowy conditions in July influencing the amount of feed ingested by the animals. The relationship between <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss (<b>kg)</b> and (%) ranking at 24 hours fasted and the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss (<b>kg)</b> and (%) at fasting times 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 for experiment 2 (May and July) was analysed. The strongest relationships were seen at 12 hours fasted: y= 0. 9878 x (R² = 0. 8976); for May, y= 0. 9567 x (R² = 0. 6623) for July when expressed in kg. As a proportion of weight loss the greatest relationship was seen at 10 hours y= 0. 716 x (R² = 0. 8578) and y= 0. 8895 x (R² = 0. 8895) for May and July respectively. Probit analysis to fit 95 % of their 24 hr weight showed no significant difference was seen between the liveweight range from 0, 2 and 4 hours fasted; 4, 6, 8 hours fasted and 6, 8, 10, 12 hours fasted. In order to analyse the effect of multiple weighing a probit analysis to determine the range in weight which 95 % of average the of three weights would fall indicated the only significant difference was at 10 hrs fasted between one weight and the average of two <b>weights.</b> In summary, <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> is a fundamental measurement which is used to monitor the production in the sheep industry. However <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> is only an estimate of an animal’s true <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> which is unable to be reliably determined even following 24 h fasting due to the variation in digesta weights. Relative to their 24 h fasted <b>live</b> <b>weights,</b> fasting improved the accuracy and precision of the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> estimate with little advantage observed when animals were fasting for periods greater than 8 h. The method of multiple weighing had minimal effect on improving accuracy regardless of fasting time...|$|R
40|$|The {{voluntary}} intake, digestibility {{and mean}} retention time of six temperate forages differing in their chemical composition by 12 adult castrated male Scottish blackface sheep, aged 15 months, and fibre-producing castrated male goats, aged 27 months, and of similar <b>live</b> <b>weight,</b> 40 <b>kg,</b> were described. The creation {{of a range of}} chemical compositions was effected through the use of barley straw, and a low- and high-digestibility hay, and the use of ammonia treatment of these forages. A wide range of voluntary intakes (42 - 78 g DM/kg W⁰·⁷⁵/day), digestibility of dry matter (0. 46 - 0. 60) and {{mean retention time}}s of undigested residues (36 - 72 h) was achieved through feeding the six forages. Across all the forages fibre-producing goats had higher voluntary intakes, expressed on a metabolic <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> basis, and lower digestibility values than sheep, whereas the mean retention time of the undigested residues was similar for the two species. Within forages goats selected a diet of potentially higher nutritive value, as predicted from chemical composition, with a smaller particle size than sheep. It was concluded that the differences in intake and digestion of temperate forages between sheep and fibre-producing goats are broadly similar to those observed in other experiments between sheep and goats ingesting tropical forages...|$|R
