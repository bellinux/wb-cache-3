5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPreschool is {{a period}} that basic {{developmental}} and pedagogical needs have been supplied until primary school. In this process, the most basic requirements, which should be addressed, are affection and care. In preschool period, firstly children should be loved and motivated in order to enable successful education. Especially educators, who study with preschool children, should love children {{so as to be}} patient, have contact, set a bridge between children and have good relationships with them. In this study, we aimed to investigate the aptitude <b>of</b> preschool teachers’ <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> children that has great importance on children's basic learning and every developmental field. The Study group consisted of 150 preschool teachers, who are working in state schools in Antalya. As a measuring instrument, Barnett <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> children scale.

40|$|Food {{acceptance}} and food choice are largely driven by taste preferences and liking, particularly among children. It is often assumed that overweight individuals differ from their normal-weight counterparts {{in that they}} prefer foods that are thought implicated {{in the development of}} obesity. Despite this, previous findings concerning the relationship between adults' adiposity and food liking are inconclusive, and research in children is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship among body mass index (BMI), food neophobia and <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> fruits and vegetables (F&V) in a large cohort of Italian children (. n=. 528, aged 6 - 9. years) in an ecological environment. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the BMI was unrelated to either the food neophobia or the liking values. Food neophobia was negatively correlated with <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> both F&V, but <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> vegetables contributed more in discriminating children according to their neophobia level than fruits liking. This suggests that <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> vegetables is a better indicator of children's food neophobia than <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> fruits. This outcome was further confirmed as low, medium and highly neophobic children differed significantly for their vegetables liking but not for fruits liking. Food neophobia was higher in boys than in girls and decreased systematically with increasing age...|$|R

Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007.
