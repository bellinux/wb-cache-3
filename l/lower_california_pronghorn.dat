40|$|These {{vertebral}} counts {{indicate that}} sardines from British Columbia to Pt. San Eugenio in central <b>Lower</b> <b>California</b> comprise {{a mixture of}} populations, the young of {{which may have been}} reared on nursery grounds in any of these localities. For most seasons, presumably, the nursery grounds off <b>California</b> and northern <b>Lower</b> <b>California</b> make the greatest contributions to the population. Sardines living off southern <b>Lower</b> <b>California</b> and in the Gulf of California probably comprise a distinct group which does not mix with the northern fish; or if a mixture occurs, the proportion of southern fish to the total northern population is small. The interchange between nursery grounds begins early, perhaps before the sardines are a year old. The number of vertebrae varies between year-classes, and certain year-classes are characterized by high or low averages in all localities. The average number of vertebrae is approximately 51. 7 for all sardines north of southern <b>Lower</b> <b>California</b> and about 51. 2 for sardines from southern <b>Lower</b> <b>California...</b>|$|R
50|$|Animals {{that have}} adapted to these extreme {{conditions}} include a variety of nocturnals such as coyotes, rodents, and hares; others {{have adapted to}} only ingesting water from succulents. Outstanding among the mammals is the Baja <b>California</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana peninsularis), an endemic subspecies of the Pronghorn, {{which is one of}} the swiftest mammals on Earth. The last populations of this subspecies can be found in the region. The Vizcaíno is also the habitat of the desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus peninsulae), and dozens of resident and migratory birds. Of special importance: the ospreys, cormorants, herons, and gulls—and four species of sea turtles. On the coastline and islets there are many marine mammals, such as northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), dolphins, and gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus).|$|R
