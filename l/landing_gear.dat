5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> doors. Placing the regular <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} {{failure of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> forced an emergency landing with the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> configuration with a nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> leg and two main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> legs.

5|$|On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The {{investigation into the}} incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32million.|$|E
5|$|The front <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is offset to the aircraft's {{right to}} allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{examines the}} influence of <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> and runway roughness on the physical loading of glider pilots. To simulate glider landings on uneven runways a numerical simulation procedure was developed. An experimental method to measure roughness on grass runways is described. <b>Landing</b> <b>gears</b> of single and twin gliders with and without additional springs were systematically shock tested. It reveals that nearly all <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> would require an additional spring to properly fulfill the current landing shock airworthiness requirements. Additionally it is shown that only <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> acceptable <b>landing</b> shock load factors achieve acceptable whole-body vibration during runway operation. Uncritical values are only possible by (well adapted) additional springs. Therefore a slightly modified landing shock criterion can be applied instead of an extensive proof of acceptable whole-body vibration. Out of several possibilities to improve the landing shock requirements, one favourable modification is suggested. (orig.)

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} stringence of the ICAO Chapter- 3 noise certification limits necessitates {{the development of}} source noise reduction technologies for subsonic commercial aeroplanes. The noise from such aeroplanes during landing approach is largely dominated by airframe noise, i. e. the noise generated by the interaction of flow and those aircraft components deployed for landing, such as the <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> and the wing high-lift devices. In the mid-nineties, DLR had been under contract to Airbus Industrie to investigate the noise from Airbus-type aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>gears.</b> More recently, DLR has entered into two major - still ongoing - pertinent research programs: first, a German National Program on commercial aeroplane airframe noise reduction (sponsored by the German Ministry of Research and Education, BMBF) to specially investigate the noise from high-lift devices, and, second, a European program {{under the auspices of}} the EU entitled Reduction of Airframe and Installation Noise (acronym RAIN), dealing with airframe noise from both <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> and high lift devices.

5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was the ability to pivot the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> up to 20Â° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the carrier-based {{aircraft}} landing laws landed on the carrier, the dynamics model of carrier-based aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> <b>landed</b> on dynamic deck is built.
