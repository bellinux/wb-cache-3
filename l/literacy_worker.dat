40|$|Pre-literate {{children}} experience written text as {{a meaningless}} material object, the word-object, but the compulsory and institutional aspects of reading pedagogy make this an experience {{from which they}} cannot escape. Some children begin to associate their own negative experiental sense with the word-object before {{they are able to}} learn to read. As reading pedagogy continues, these children begin to read back experiental sense which prevents them from converting the word-object to meaningful text. Experiental sense is repressed because it is psychically painful. It retains qualities of phenomena repressed from childhood: it is active and intractable to reason. The result is an intractable illiteracy which may be interpreted as biologically based �dyslexia. � Further attempts at reading pedagogy in childhood and adulthood generally result in reproduction of the inability because this pedagogy requires learners to attempt to read linguistically which elicits experiental sense. As these children become adults, their avoidance of reading sometimes structures their social relations to accommodate and compound their problems. The method to overcome the problem replaces experiental sense with positive feelings about written language. The power of language to denote emotions of pleasure and affirmation from learners� lives is used. These emotions are enhanced through a technique of affirmative intersubjectivity. Short spoken affirmative texts are made by learners, tape recorded and reproduced as written texts by the <b>literacy</b> <b>worker.</b> Through allowing learners control and autonomy over their spoken and written texts, the positive emotions in them are associated by learners with the written texts. Exercises on the affirmative written texts are used to demonstrate regularities about written language. Learners then progress to reading suitable independent texts and other activities. There are suggestions about how to enhance learners� feelings as competent readers and writers. The thesis uses a methodology of action research and includes five case studies of adults with literacy problems. Concepts from social theory, psychoanalysis and object relations theory are used and adapted to understand written language, schooling and illiteracy...|$|E

The current study is seeking to better understand what supports and what hinders making change in literacy programs so that the programs can more fully support learning for all women, and in particular those who have experienced violence. In this paper the author tries to reveal the processes of "dominant discourses " that exclude the issue of violence from education, thus making change unlikely.

40|$|Women {{have been}} silenced through their {{exclusion}} from the dominant discourse of il/literacy. The {{construction of an}} illiterate population {{has been part of}} an "othering " process by the state and serves to create a national ideology of illiteracy that locates the blame for educational deficiencies in the individual, rather than in the structural inequalities within society. Women must move beyond looking at individuals to the processes of production to see how the practices of the dominant discourse are lodged in social relations. An emerging feminist discourse is exploring the issue of literacy. First, it is examining the social forces that restrict women from pursuing their desire to engage in literacy practices that reflect the specificity of their needs, including social disapproval and situational barriers, the sexual division of labor, the control of women's sexuality. Second, this feminist discourse is exploring what must change to meet women's needs. Research shows that women in literacy programs want both social contact and an educational event. Women-positive programs can be a first step in reducing women's isolation. Small groups could move from the personal to the political. Third, the feminist discourse is investigating what resistance <b>literacy</b> <b>workers</b> might encounter as they actively begin to support women. The resistance comes from funders, colleagues, male students, and the male partners of the women students. (Contains 44 references.)

However, {{little is known about the}} extent to which workers recognize and respond to mental health and behavioral concerns. A sample of 124 residential group care workers completed an online survey in which vignettes of children experiencing either internalized or externalized symptoms of depression and ‘typical’ behavior were presented. In order to explore aspects of mental health <b>literacy,</b> <b>workers</b> were asked to rate each vignette for severity of a specific mental health concern (adolescent depression), portrayed as internalized or externalized behavior.

Depression in the presence of externalized behavior was rated as both more severe and more concerning than depression accompanied by internalized behaviors. Furthermore, workers had greater confidence in endorsing the presence of a mental health issue when accompanied by externalized behavior compared to an internalized presentation. Residential group-care workers are able to recognize the existence of depression amongst children in their care.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a high-quality, experience-based, {{accredited}} training course that would bring black <b>literacy</b> <b>workers</b> into the ABET materials writing field. The report begins by setting the context of ABET in South Africa, then describing the literature on a wide variety of materials development projects in South Africa and other developing countries, some of which can be used as models for the proposed course. Training courses in fields outside ABET also inform the study. Through a combination of questionnaires and interviews, the study explores the needs of institutions concerned with ABET materials as well as the needs and skills of potential trainees. Ten specialists were interviewed: Seven were ABET practitioners representing a tertiary institution, NGOs and government and three were involved in educational publishing. They identified the need for relevant practical materials in all South African languages and learning areas, and said a training course should stress thinking skills, writing skills, visual literacy and a firm grasp of the process and economics of book production. Thirty eight potential trainees were contacted through questionnaires and focus groups. They were positive about the proposed course and alerted the researcher to logistical issues regarding finances and timing. All respondents said the course must be accredited in line with NQF requirements. The main tension that arose in the interviews was around priorities.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a critical}} ethnography about the power that storytelling offers in creating sustainable community literacy programs. The research for this dissertation was conducted at a ten year-old grassroots community literacy organization, VOICES: Community Stories Past and Present, Inc., {{which is based in}} Tucson, Arizona. Interviews for this project were conducted over a period of two years and includes feedback from thirty-three board members, staff members, volunteers, and youth participants at the organization. The dissertation begins with the assertion that gaps in understanding between theory and practice lead to damaging assumptions about difference and inequality, especially in the realm of community-based programming. I argue that an expanded understanding of storytelling as reciprocal and transformative can bridge these misunderstandings. In order to bridge the divide between theory and practice, this project offers the concept of reciprocity, fleshed out by the work of Ellen Cushman and Pierre Bourdieu, to encourage both participants in community literacy programs, as well as administrators, to be more transparent about their goals by sharing individual experience. This concept of reciprocity is the foundation on which storytelling as an agent of transformation rests. The process of storytelling that this project proposes establishes advocacy journalism and witnessing as a precedent. In the stories about interviewing and storytelling that the narrators from VOICES share, reciprocity is performative in that it can be manipulated to fit the needs of specific rhetorical situations. But this performance is dependent on the audience. I suggest that contrary to many discussions in composition and rhetoric, the tension between "addressed" and "invoked" audiences is an accurate one, and can be used to generate conversation about the assumptions and expectations of low-income youth and community literacy participants. An addressed audience is necessary in order for stories to be transformative; which is ultimately the way that they create large-scale social change. The conclusion of this project argues that administrators and <b>literacy</b> <b>workers</b> must foster an ethic of sustainability, which can be achieved through storytelling in order to both honor difference and challenge inequality in ways that are meaningful to the participants in these programs...|$|R
40|$|Stories That Speak to Us—a digital {{collection}} of scholarly, curated exhibits—is designed to investigate literacy narratives {{from a number}} of perspectives: to explore why they are important, what information they carry about reading and composing, why they might be valuable, not only for scholars and teachers, but also for librarians, community <b>literacy</b> <b>workers,</b> individual citizens and groups of people. As the editors and authors collectively suggest, literacy narratives are powerfully rhetorical linguistic accounts through which people fashion their lives; make sense of their world, indeed construct the realities in which they live. Literacy narratives are sometimes laden so richly with information that conventional academic tools and ways of discussing their power to shape identities; to persuade, and reveal, and discover, to create meaning and affiliations at home, in schools, communities, and workplaces, are inadequate to the task. For this reason, the collection focuses on the work of both narrative theorists and literacy educators. The curated exhibits in Stories That Speak to Us provide analyses of narratives selected by the author/scholars from among the more than 3, 500 narratives preserved in the Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives (DALN), a publicly available online archive of personal literacy narratives in a variety of formats (text, video, audio) that recount contributors’ literacy practices and values in their own words. The motif of exhibits and curators is employed in part to suggest the relationship between the narratives “on display” in this particular project and the much larger {{collection of}} narratives in the DALN as a whole—the narratives “on display” here constitute less than two percent of the entire archive. The Stories That Speak to Us collection allows visitors to study the literacy narratives in the exhibits directly via links to the DALN, while the essays in this collection constitute something analogous to exhibit catalogs. The individual exhibits examine themes such as “betweenity,” scaffolding, digital divides, ethnolinguistic vitality, ludic literacies, black women’s literacy narratives, the convergence of local and global discourses about literacy, feminism and digital literacy, and transnational “thirdspaces” of literacy. At the end of the collection, we suggest some ways to explore, and provide some tools for exploring, these and other topics in the entire archive...|$|R
