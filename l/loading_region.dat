40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{simulation}} framework called the <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> {{for the performance}} evaluation of admission control policies for high speed networks. The <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> provides a means to assess the performance characteristics of an admission control policy {{in terms of its}} sensitivity to traffic mix, traffic characteristics, cell loss constraints, and cell delay constraints. The <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> also facilitates the direct comparison of different admission control policies, both graphically and quantitatively, with respect to these criteria. In this paper, three different admission control policies are evaluated using simulation to demonstrate the use of the <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> framework. Among the three policies evaluated, the Joint Scheduling and Admission Control policy is the most aggressive, and has the greatest sensitivity to QOS constraints. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{yield stress}} changes during the {{straightening}} process, {{because of the}} Bauschinger effect. This effect leads to a different reduction rate in each straightening roller. To accurately estimate the straightening effect of the rolled piece, the Bauschinger effect {{must be considered in}} calculating the reduction rate. In this paper, the straightening model is described by the fast multipole boundary element method. The Bauschinger effect model is discussed in the elastic <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> and elastic plastic <b>loading</b> <b>region.</b> Young’s modulus reduction and the reverse yield stress reduction are obtained for the straightening force model. The straightening force formula including the Bauschinger effect is determined by analyzing the tension and compression processes. This formula reflects the changes of the yield stress and the straightening force in the tension and compression processes. It is concluded that the Bauschinger effect is a very important factor for the precise estimation of the straightening force...|$|E

In the work reported in this paper the auto–ignition (AI) <b>load</b> <b>region</b> specific to a small two–stroke engine has been investigated. Our objective was to gain a better understanding regarding the characteristics of AI operating regime by studying combustion stability and exhaust emissions. AI combustion was achieved by trapping hot exhaust gases inside the cylinder with an exhaust throttle valve. The intake throttle, exhaust throttle and fuelling rate were manually adjusted to obtain the required engine operating points. The nature of combustion and implications of exhaust emissions have been discussed in relation to the <b>load</b> <b>regions</b> of AI operation. The operation of AI in the medium to high load ranges demonstrated a higher degree of cyclic stability. In contrast to this, AI operation at lower loads demonstrated a higher degree of cyclic instability...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} to design user load-achieving pilot sequences that mitigate pilot contamination in multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. To this end, we first derive expressions for the user load and the <b>load</b> <b>region</b> {{of the network}} considering both small-scale and large-scale propagation effects. We then develop the pilot sequence algorithm for multi-cell massive MIMO networks as per the rules of generalized Welch bound equality design. Notably, we find that our algorithm and the corresponding downlink power allocation ensure that the user load is achieved when the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for the users lie within the <b>load</b> <b>region.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance advantage of our proposed design relative to the existing designs, {{in terms of a}} larger <b>load</b> <b>region</b> and a higher maximum permitted SINR. Finally, we show that our proposed design can satisfy the pre-defined SINR requirements for users with a finite number of antennas at the base station (BS), while the existing designs cannot satisfy the same requirements even with an infinite number of antennas at the BS.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of an infinite bar {{subjected to a}} self-equilibrated load distribution is investigated using the peridynamic formulation of elasticity theory. The peridynamic theory differs from the classical theory and other nonlocal theories in {{that it does not}} involve spatial derivatives of the displacement field. The bar problem is formulated as a linear Fredholm integral equation and solved using Fourier transform methods. The solution is shown to exhibit, in general, features that are not found in the classical result. Among these are decaying oscillations in the displacement field and progressively weakening discontinuities that propagate outside of the <b>loading</b> <b>region.</b> These features, when present, are guaranteed to decay provided that the wave speeds are real. This leads to a one-dimensional version of St. Venant's principle for peridynamic materials that ensures the increasing smoothness of the displacement field remotely from the <b>loading</b> <b>region.</b> The peridynamic result converges to the classical result in the limit of short-range forces. An example gives the solution to the concentrated load problem, and hence provides the Green's function for general loading problems.

The analysis {{takes into account the}} variation of Young’s modulus of ice in the thickness direction. The Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is used to obtain the elastic solution for the deflections and bending moments, while the viscoelastic solution is obtained from the elastic response using the correspondence principle. Closed form Bessel-type elastic and viscoelastic solutions are obtained for infinite floating ice plates. Comparisons are made between the time-dependent response of infinite and finite square floating ice plates. ...|$|E

40|$|Exercise during {{growth and}} {{adolescence}} increases bone mineral density (BMD) in weight-loaded skeletal regions. The development of BMD in unloaded or minimally <b>loaded</b> <b>regions</b> during activity is unclear. We measured BMD in one unloaded, one partly loaded and one highly <b>loaded</b> skeletal <b>region</b> in 67 active soccer players, mean age 22. 7 years (range 17 - 35 years), 128 former soccer players, mean age 54. 0 years (range 19 - 85 years) and 138 controls, mean age 50. 6 years (range 19 - 80 years). The active soccer players played at three different levels: premier league, 3 rd league or 6 th league. Duration of exercise {{in these three}} grou s was 12, 8 and 6 h/week, respectively. BMD (g/cm) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in {{the upper part of}} the skull (the unloaded skeletal region), the arms (the partly <b>loaded</b> <b>region)</b> and the femoral neck (the maximal <b>loaded</b> <b>region).</b> Data are presented as mean +/- SD. Active soccer players had 10. 3 +/- 10. 4 % lower BMD in {{the upper part of the}} skull (p < 0. 001), 1. 4 +/- 6. 3 % higher BMD in the arm (NS) and 12. 7 +/- 9. 8 % higher BMD in the femoral neck (p< 0. 001) compared with age- and gender-matched controls. All three levels of soccer players demonstrated, independent of activity level, the same discrepancies in BMD compared with controls. Former soccer players had lower BMD in the upper part of the skull until age 70 years and higher BMD in the femoral neck until age 50 years compared with controls. The BMD of the arm was not different in former soccer players compared with controls. In summary, active soccer players had lower BMD in the unloaded skeletal region, no difference in BMD in the partly <b>loaded</b> <b>region</b> and higher BMD in the weight-loaded region compared with controls. The discrepancies compared with controls diminished with age so that no differences were found in BMD after age 70 years. In conclusion, unloaded and weight-loaded skeletal regions may respond differently to increased and decreased physical activity...|$|R

The friction coefficients have little difference between dry and lubricants lubrication condition at initial friction test. With the friction test time prolonged, friction coefficient of PVA hydrogel under dry condition increased rapidly.

To generate a well-posed topology optimization problem we use relaxation which requires homogenization theory. Examples are provided to demonstrate our algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Stacks, each {{comprising}} {{a number}} of thin, ‘flat ’ layers of tin-coated steel, were compressed in a direction normal to the individual layers under loadings of up to 8 x 106 Nm-’. Two distinct modes of deformation occurred: a layer-flattening region at low loads (P / M < lo-’), and a surface-waviness deformation region under higher loading pressures. The thermal resistance per unit area per unit length of each stack (in a vacuum of better than 7 x lo- ’ Nm- *) was inversely proportional to the compression per layer for freshly-assembled stacks throughout the <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> corresponding to macroscopic conformity. Hystereses in the thermal resistance and compression characteristics were observed during the initial loading/unloading cycles. A dimensionless correlation relating conductance to applied loading is proposed for stacks of bedded-down thin layers. ...|$|E

The blast resistance capability of sandwich panels was moderately sensitive to the core relative density and graded distribution. For the graded panels with relative density descending core arrangement, the core plastic energy dissipation and the transmitted force attenuation were larger {{than that of the}} ungraded ones under the same loading condition.

Stress components σ 11 and σ 13 are of more interests since σ 12 is completely {{determined by the}} boundary conditions. For isotropic materials, {{it is known that}} under uniform normal loading σ 11 is constant in the <b>loaded</b> <b>region</b> and vanishes in the unloaded part. Under uniform shear loading, σ 11 will have a logarithmic singularity at the end points of shear loading. In this paper, the behavior of the stress components σ 11 and σ 13 induced by traction-discontinuity on general anisotropic elastic surfaces is studied. By analyzing the problem of uniform tractions applied on the half-plane boundary over a finite <b>loaded</b> <b>region,</b> exact expressions of the stress components σ 11 and σ 13 are obtained which reveal that these components consist of in general a constant term and a logarithmic term in the <b>loaded</b> <b>region,</b> while only a logarithmic term exists in unloaded region. Whether the constant term or the logarithmic term will appear or not completely depends on what values of the elements of matrices Ω and Γ will take for a material under consideration.

The isotropic material is a special case of the present results...|$|R

The maximum loading without PEV loads at this transformer is 40 % of the rated power. The peak and lowest demands occur around 21 : 00 and 05 : 00, respectively. The time frame where peak loading occurs also coincides with the vehicle home arrival times. According to the triple tariff determined by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK) of Turkey, the peak times correspond to the hours between 17 : 00 and 22 : 00. As shown in the figure, peak loading mostly occurs in these hours but also extends beyond 24 : 00. If the loads were shaved according to the peak hour definition by EPDK, the peak shaving operation would not be fulfilled effectively. Therefore, to determine the peak <b>loading</b> <b>region</b> depending on the load profile, a new reference line is used which was described in Section III-B.|$|E

Therefore, an experimental design of direct planar impact experiments with longitudinal and transverse strain gauges is analyzed in predictive hydrocode simulations using an elastic-plastic damage model for concrete. The calculations and first experimental results on mortar show decreasing phase velocities of stress waves both in longitudinal and lateral gauges. The model clearly associates it with the onset of damage, possibly interpreted as a failure wave. Numerical analysis is furthermore used to compare a monolithic target block to a thoroughly assembled concrete sample in order to include flat gauges in the material. The planned experimental procedure to derive wave speeds, particle velocities and strain rates from stress measurements is anticipated and validated on the basis of simulated gauge signals. The most important finding is the prediction and first experimental confirmation that concrete ultimate strength and damaged yield stress call be derived at strain rates in the order of 10 (4) /s from the proposed type of experiments.

In line with the results presented in [15] and [20] for the dense small cell case, the scheduling algorithm which provides the best results in terms of these two metrics is GPF, both for the macro-cell and the small cell scenario. The reason is that this scheduler assigns a higher priority to users under better SINR conditions than PF and BET. These users get served faster and, given the chosen open-loop traffic model, they can leave the network more quickly, reducing the generated interference. This results in an overall performance gain in the network. Therefore, we will only show the statistics obtained under the GPF scheduler in the following figures.|$|R
