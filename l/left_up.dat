5|$|There are no written {{rules as}} to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the {{decision}} of eligibility in that regard is <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to the nominators and voters, rather than to SFWA.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 {{categories}} for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories {{had the effect}} of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.|$|E
5|$|Scheduling was <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to each team. There {{were wide}} variations, {{both in the}} overall number of games played and in the number played against other Association members. Thus, no {{official}} standings were maintained. In addition, football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated with the league. For instance, the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL, not the APFA.|$|E

5|$|The World Fantasy Awards {{are split}} into ten categories, {{including}} both awards for written works and for {{professionals in the}} field. Eligibility requirements are loosely defined: works must {{have been published in}} the prior calendar year, and professionals must still be living. All types of fantasy works are accepted, regardless of subgenre or style, though whether a given work is considered to be fantasy is <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to the discretion of the nominators and judges.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of SR-103, {{outside of the}} roadway renumbering, have received some technical changes as well. In November 1992, UDOT confirmed that the interchange of I-15 and SR-103 (exit 335) was to be given traffic lights to help monitor traffic. The mayor at the time, Neldon Hamblin, approved of the project, and put the project up for bids for construction. The interchange was holding up motorists needing to turn <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} targets was <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to the midget commanders, with advice {{that they should}} {{primarily}} target aircraft carriers or battleships, with cruisers as secondary targets. The midgets were to operate {{to the east of}} the Harbour Bridge, although if no suitable targets were to be found in this area they were to move under the Bridge and attack a battleship and large cruiser believed to be in the inner harbour. When the second reconnaissance flyover revealed that the expected British battleship——was nowhere to be found, USS Chicago became the priority target.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to the players.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Celia, a Category3 hurricane that slammed South Texas in early August. Celia resulted in about $930million in damage and was the costliest hurricane in Texas until Alicia in 1983. There were 28fatalities, with four in Cuba, eight in Florida, and sixteen in Texas. Later that month, Tropical Storm Dorothy caused severe flooding in Martinique, which <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to 51deaths and $34million in damage. One death occurred in Mexico {{as a result of}} Hurricane Ella after a house collapsed. In October, Tropical Depression Fifteen brought a devastating flood to Puerto Rico. At least 22fatalities and $65.5million in damage occurred. Collectively, the storms of this season left at least $1.03billion in damage and 115deaths.|$|E
5|$|Arrangements for naval gunfire {{support to}} the landings, had {{originally}} included bombarding the beaches and approaches but was changed to engagement of the ridges during the landings, with the beaches only to be shelled prior to the landings. No decision was ultimately made {{on the issue of}} close-support, and it was <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to the initiative of individual ships' captains. A reluctance to approach the shore later impacted on landings at 'V' and 'W' beach where some of the heaviest losses among the infantry occurred, while naval gunfire was of some assistance at 'S', 'X' and Anzac. Even then its effectiveness was limited by the initial confusion ashore, the broken terrain, thick vegetation, and the lack of observation. Kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Allies employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from 3 Squadron, RNAS (Commander Charles Samson) which arrived at Tenedos at the end of March. The aircraft were unopposed by the small Ottoman air force at first and during the planning, the force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance, although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet the Allies' intelligence needs and make up for the lack of adequate maps. After the landings, Allied aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance, observed naval gunfire, reported on Ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the legions {{underwent}} these transformations, the auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the auxilia had previously been <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as turmae (for cavalry alae) and centuriae (for infantry cohortes). Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ala quingenaria of 512 horsemen, or an ala millaria of 1,000 horsemen. Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.|$|E
5|$|In February 1920, Chauvel was {{promoted}} to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement {{in the face of}} defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When conscription was abolished by Prime Minister James Scullin's government in 1929, it was <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.|$|E
5|$|The area most {{affected}} by the cyclone was in and around Trincomalee: 57people checked into the local hospital {{as a result of}} falling trees or debris, with one person killed due to a falling tree. An entire fishing village was completely destroyed, and heavy rainfall flooded rivers, lakes, and canals, covering roads and crops with floodwaters. The flooding destroyed about 77squaremiles (200km²) of rice fields, and an additional 19square miles (50km²) of other crops. Strong winds damaged or destroyed around 83,000houses across the country, including 2,000houses destroyed in Kinnia and 6,600 in Trincomalee. The passage of the cyclone <b>left</b> <b>up</b> to 500,000temporarily homeless on the island, most of whom fled to churches, schools, temples, and shopping centers. The winds blew off the roofs of several police stations and military camps, and flooded several refugee camps. The winds damaged electrical systems and disrupted about 3,000telephone systems, and many roads were left impassable. Large areas remained without power for several days. No damage reports exist for regions under control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, despite the fact the storm made landfall there. Throughout the country, at least nine people {{died as a result of}} the cyclone, and over 48,000families were affected.|$|E
