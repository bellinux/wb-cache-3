5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17 {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Leeward Islands. It was upgraded to a tropical storm <b>late</b> <b>that</b> evening. This marked the third time that the 'P' name had been used to name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950. The previous times were for Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. In subsequent seasons, 'P' names would be given to Paloma in 2008, Paula in 2010, Philippe in 2011, and Patty in 2012.|$|E
5|$|After the tornado, {{there was}} an {{investigation}} into whether the students should have been dismissed before the tornado stuck the school. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due to the extreme damage {{in the parking lot}} and the area nearby. In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise <b>late</b> <b>that</b> morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41am CST) made evacuating the area unsafe.|$|E
5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating <b>late</b> <b>that</b> day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E

They were one of the nine {{original}} teams in the first New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) season, albeit admitted after the first round of matches had already been played. They are the shortest lived team in the history of first-grade rugby league in Australia after disbanding <b>late</b> <b>that</b> year. Statistically, they are the club with the poorest all-time record, only lasting eight games in their inaugural and only season.|$|E

5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met <b>late</b> <b>that</b> morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Going into {{production}} in summer 1984 – with studio recordings in September and October – the first series of As Seen On TV {{was intended for}} broadcast <b>late</b> <b>that</b> year. As a theatre tie-in, Wood arranged a short stand-up tour with the same name as the show, to capitalise on her television appearances around the same time. This backfired when the BBC put back the opening broadcast to early the following year.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle {{began as}} a {{vigorous}} tropical wave over Africa. As the wave emerged into the Atlantic, it quickly became more organized due to favorable conditions, including low wind shear. The circulation consolidated and spawned Tropical Depression Four {{on the morning of}} August13 south-southeast of the Cape Verde islands. The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79°F (26°C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. <b>Late</b> <b>that</b> evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle.|$|E

5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made them very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too <b>late</b> <b>that</b> the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E

Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly {{as a result of}} an eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category3 hurricane.

At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E

The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias's suzerainty.
