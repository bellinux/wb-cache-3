50|$|In Hong Kong, the <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> is {{abundant}} in lightly wooded areas, cultivated land and shrubland, whereas the red-whiskered bulbul {{is the common}} bulbul of suburbs and urban parks. In Taiwan, however, the <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> dominates all of these habitats, though it is replaced along the east coast by Styan's bulbul.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{pollination}} {{biology of}} many individual plant species {{has been investigated}} in the Oriental region, there have been very few community-level studies. The two most comprehensive of these were in the primary mixed dipterocarp forest of Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak (4 째 20 [prime prime or minute]N: Momose et al. 1998, Sakai et al. 1999) and in the warm temperate evergreen broad-leaved forest and cool temperate mixed forest on Yakushima Island (30 째N: Yumoto 1987, 1988). Hong Kong (22 째 17 [prime prime or minute]N) lies midway between these sites, at the northern margin of the tropics, where winter temperatures fall below 10 째C at sea-level {{for a few days}} every year and there are occasional frosts above 400 m (Dudgeon & Corlett 1994). Latitudinal effects, however, are compounded in comparisons with other well-studied East Asian sites, by centuries of massive human impact, leaving a degraded landscape of steep, eroded hillsides, covered in fire-maintained grassland, secondary shrublands and, locally, secondary forests (Zhuang & Corlett 1997). This history has left a relatively impoverished fauna but a surprisingly diverse flora, including 400 native tree species (Corlett & Turner 1997). In these circumstances, failures of pollination and dispersal mutualisms might be expected to accelerate the loss of plant species from the landscape (Bond 1994, Kearns & Inouye 1997). Previous studies have shown that most woody vegetation in Hong Kong is dominated by species whose seeds can be dispersed by the commonest avian frugivores, the <b>light-vented</b> and red-whiskered <b>bulbuls</b> (Pycnonotus sinensis (Gmelin) and P. jocosus (Linn.)) and the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus Swinhoe) (Corlett 1996, 1998), but there is no equivalent information available on pollination biology. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
50|$|The <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus sinensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the bulbul family. It is found in central and {{southern}} China, northern Vietnam and Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|Alternate {{names for}} Styan's bulbul include the Formosan bulbul and Taiwan bulbul. The latter name {{is also used}} to refer to a {{subspecies}} of the <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Styan's bulbul has a {{very similar}} {{appearance}} to the <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul,</b> but they differ in the patterns on the head. The Styan's bulbul has a completely black crown with white feathers around its eye, except for a black moustachial stripe below the beak. Hybrids are intermediate between the two species, with the moustachial stripe and white feathers around the eye, but the white feathers extend behind the crown.|$|E
5000|$|The Styan's bulbul (Pycnonotus taivanus, [...] ) is an {{endemic species}} of bulbul found in eastern and {{southern}} Taiwan. Though common in some areas, it has been listed as a species vulnerable to extinction. Its decline has been caused by habitat destruction and hybridisation with the closely related Chinese or <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul.</b> The two species' ranges overlap in several areas, partly because birds of the latter species have been released for Buddhist ceremonies. The species has already become extinct in Yilan County (Taiwan).|$|E
40|$|Aim Two {{alternative}} genetic {{patterns are}} typical in recently established populations. One is reduced genetic diversity but significant population structuring compared with original populations. The {{other is the}} persistence of genetic polymorphisms {{and the lack of}} differentiation in frontier populations. This study aims to test for these patterns by examining population genetics of the <b>Light-vented</b> <b>Bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus sinensis), an Oriental bird that has been undergoing rapid range expansion. Location Eastern China. Methods Molecular analyses were conducted on mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite datasets from 256 individuals. Intraspecific phylogeny was reconstructed by Bayesian inference and network analysis. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and Bayesian clustering were applied to determine population structure. Genetic diversity was tested to determine whether there were significant differences between frontier and source populations. Population expansions were tested in mtDNA and microsatellites. Gene flow and recent migrants were estimated by Bayesian methods. Results Both high- and low-nucleotide diversities were recorded in frontier populations, and differences in genetic diversity between frontier and source populations were not statistically significant. Population differentiation was recorded in some source but not in frontier populations. Population size expansion was detected both in frontier and in source populations, and for the whole dataset, commencing before the Last Glacial Maximum. Main conclusions Genetic diversity can be maintained in expanding populations of the <b>Light-vented</b> <b>Bulbul,</b> and genetic differentiation can be avoided, where substantial genetic exchanges are occurring. This study also discusses the potential effects of evolutionary properties such as historical population growth on recently recorded range expansion. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} bioaccumulation of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in terrestrial ecosystem. Eggs of <b>light-vented</b> <b>bulbul,</b> yellow-bellied prinia, plain prinia, and dark green white-eye were collected from an ecological station in the Pearl River Delta, South China to investigate the occurrence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and several alternative HFRs, including decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), dechlorane plus (DP), hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromotoluene (PBT), and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrab-romo-p-xylene (pTBX). Concentrations of PBDEs, DBDPE, DP, HBB, PBEB, BTBPE, PBT, and pTBX ranged from 53 - 423, 6. 1 - 609, 4. 6 - 268, not detected (nd) - 10, nd- 1. 4, nd- 1. 7, nd- 7. 5, and nd- 3. 2 ng g(- 1) lw, respectively. <b>Light-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> exhibited significantly lower levels of PBDEs, DBDPE, DP, and HBB than other three bird species due to its phytophagy and the other three bird species' insectivores. PBDEs were the predominant HFRs in bird eggs, followed by DBDPE and DP. Significant negative relationship between the fraction of anti-DP and DP concentrations was observed in bird eggs, suggesting that DP levels {{play an important role in}} determining the isomeric composition. Anti-Cl- 11 -DP, the dechlorinated products of DP, was found in bird eggs with concentrations ranging from nd to 0. 86 ng g(- 1) lw and its source is worth further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
