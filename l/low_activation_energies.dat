40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the results of}} NMR relaxation studies of fast ion glasses {{in the light of}} variable frequency electrical conductivity measurements. We show that the <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> observed for relaxation processes studied at constant frequency below the temperature of the T 1 minimum is reproduced by the corresponding constant frequency conductivity measurements. Other characteristics of the constant frequency conductivity in this <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> regime, such as the unphysically low pre-exponent, match with the corresponding observations for NMR measurements. Since the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> observed at constant frequency in the frequency-dependent regime for conductivity depends on the characteristic departure from exponential relaxation for the conductivity process, we conclude that the NMR <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> is likewise a simple consequence of the nonexponential character of ionic relaxation in the glass. In this case, the <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> attributed to processes probed by NMR relaxation is simply a misinterpretation since it is found, in the wide frequency range studies available to admittance bridge measurements, that all elements of the relaxation spectrum have essentially equal <b>activation</b> <b>energies...</b>|$|R

The energy of the bubble defect is a factor of ∼ 3 smaller than that of the lowest energy defect in a Hartree-Fock crystal.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the Meyer-Neldel rule (MNR) arises {{naturally}} for a quantity where both an intrinsic process {{as well as a}} process involving impurities contribute. The strength of the latter depends solely on the density of the impurities. This leads to a spread in the apparent activation energy of the measured quantity and the observation of the MNR, even though the intrinsic processes have fixed activation energies. A consequence of the MNR is the occurrence of a temperature T[sub MN] where a measured parameter is independent of the activation energy. For the system studied, the MNR does not accurately predict the results at temperatures larger than T[sub MN].

40|$|Many glasses show {{relatively}} high lithium ion conductivities which result from <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies.</b> Following Anderson and Stuart, the activation energy {{is attributed to}} (i) the elastic distortion of "doorways" and (ii) the separation of cationic from anionic charges.
