Mukasey, per ponente Justice Kennedy ruled (5-4) [...] "that {{someone who is}} here {{illegally}} may withdraw his voluntarily agreement to depart and {{continue to try to}} get approval to remain in the United States." [...] The Court held that complying with a deportation order did not strip an immigrant of the right to appeal that deportation order. The lawsuit is about 2 seemingly contradictory provisions of immigration law. One prevents deportation by voluntary departure from the country. The other section allows immigrants who are here illegally but whose circumstances have changed to build their case to immigration officials, and who must remain in the US. In the case, Samson Dada, a Nigerian citizen, overstayed beyond the expiration of his tourist visa in 1998. Immigration authorities ordered him to leave the country as he agreed to leave voluntarily, but to allow his <b>legal</b> <b>re-entry,</b> unlike if he had been deported.|$|E
