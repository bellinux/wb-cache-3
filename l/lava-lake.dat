Nonetheless, it has been particularly efficient in detecting low thermal activity related to the slow extrusion of viscous lava bodies at Ubinas (Perù) and Nevado de Chillan (Chile) (Coppola et al. 2015, 2016 b) as well as to identify the development of an high-temperature fumaroles field at Santa Ana Volcano, El Salvador (Laiolo et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Volcanic explosions at the Minamidake crater of Sakurajima Volcano are {{classified}} intosix types, {{according to the}} mode of the occurrence of the volcanic micro-earthquakes beforeand after the explosion. The main results are as follows; 1) The same type explosions are often repeated. This may be explained that the each typeexplosion represents {{the condition of the}} volcanic vent and the energy supply from the reservosr. 2) The type of the large explosions are almost The D IV or the D IV' type. 3) After the formation of the <b>lava-lake</b> in the crater, the D I type explosions occurre frequent-ly. From the arrival time difference of the sismic wave and the sonic one, the origin of the D Itype explosion is seemed to be shallower than that of the other type explosions. This fact isascertained by the another observation also, that is the observation of the angle of the incidence ofthe explosion earthquakes. Moreover the process of the occurrence of the D I type explosion isconsidered...|$|E
40|$|The Early Carboniferous Arthur’s Seat volcano {{in central}} Edinburgh is of {{geological}} significance and landscape value but lacks a precise chronology. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar step-heating plateau analyses date the lowest Lava 1 of the eruptive sequence to 341. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 8 [*]Ma (Visean, Holkerian), with Lava 3 a at 336. 7 [*]±[*] 4. 7 [*]Ma. Intrusive or <b>lava-lake</b> basalts within the Lion’s Haunch Vent are precisely dated at 338 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]Ma at Dunsapie and 335. 1 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]Ma at Crow Hill (Visean, Asbian). Taken together with existing 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates recalculated to recent decay constant and standard values, and U/Pb dates, a revised magmatic chronology consistent with biostratigraphy is presented for the Midland Valley of Scotland.

40|$|The {{activity}} of open-vent volcanoes with an active <b>lava-lake,</b> such as Nyiragongo, {{is characterized by}} persistent degassing, thus continuous monitoring of the rate, volume and fate of their gas emissions is of great importance to understand their geophysical state and their potential impact. We report results of SO 2 emission measurements from Nyiragongo conducted between 2004 and 2012 with a network of ground-based scanning-DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) remote sensors. The mean SO 2 emission rate {{is found to be}} 13 ± 9 kg s− 1, similar to that observed in 1959. Daily emission rate has a distribution close to log-normal and presents large inter-day variability, reflecting the dynamics of percolation of magma batches of heterogeneous size distribution and changes in the effective permeability of the lava lake. The degassed S content is found to be between 1000 and 2000 ppm from these measurements and the reported magma flow rates sustaining the lava lake. The inter-annual trend and plume height statistics indicate stability of a quiescently degassing lava lake during the period of study...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-year archive of thermal observations made before, during, {{and after the}} January 2002 eruption of Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo. Infrared satellite data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (modis), a multi-spectral scanner carried onboard the National Aeronautical and Space Administration’s (nasa) Terra and Aqua satellites, indicate an absence of significant thermal activity {{prior to the start}} of the eruption on January 17, 2002. Thermal radiance data acquired during the eruption record both the approximate size and spatial distribution of the two main flow units that encroached on the city of Goma, and the subsequent cooling of these flows. In June 2002, four months after the end of the initial effusive episode, magmatic activity resumed in the summit crater of the volcano. modis has recorded thermal emission from the summit crater lava lake on a further 114 days, as of February 29, 2004. Trends in the amount of radiance detected from the active <b>lava-lake</b> indicate a gradual increase in the level of activity, and constitute a variable for monitoring the level of magmatic activity in the crater remotely. The data we present were, and continue to be, made available to the Goma Volcano Observatory via the Internet, within 24 hours of modis overpas...|$|E
40|$|On 5 March 2011, {{the lava}} lake within the summit eruptive vent at Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, began to drain as magma withdrew {{to feed a}} dike {{intrusion}} and fissure eruption on the volcano’s east rift zone. The draining was monitored {{by a variety of}} continuous geological and geophysical measurements, including deformation, thermal and visual imagery, and gravity. Over the first ~ 14 hours of the draining, the ground near the eruptive vent subsided by about 0. 15 m, gravity dropped by more than 100 μGal, and the lava lake retreated by over 120 m. We used GPS data to correct the gravity signal for the effects of subsurface mass loss and vertical deformation in order to isolate the change in gravity due to draining of the lava lake alone. Using a model of the eruptive vent geometry based on visual observations and the lava level over time determined from thermal camera data, we calculated the best fit lava density to the observed gravity decrease—to our knowledge, the first geophysical determination of the density of a lava lake anywhere in the world. Our result, 950 ± 300 kg m- 3, suggests a lava density less than that of water and indicates that Kīlauea’s lava lake is gas-rich, which can explain why rockfalls that impact the lake trigger small explosions. Knowledge of such a fundamental material property as density is also critical to investigations of <b>lava-lake</b> convection and degassing and can inform calculations of pressure change in the subsurface magma plumbing system...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{and present}} {{volcanism}} in the Vanuatu arc (South West Pacific Ocean) occurs {{at a variety}} of volcano types that exhibit a wide range of eruptive behaviour: from post-caldera <b>lava-lake</b> activity and lava flows at shield volcanoes (Ambrym), moderately explosive sub-plinian events and associated pyroclastic-flows and lava flows at stratovolcanoes (Lopevi), to persistent strombolian and vulcanian-style eruptions at scoria cones (Yasur). This precludes a generic model of magmatic and eruptive behaviour for the Vantuatu arc volcanoes and necessitates a detailed study of each system. Uranium-series disequilibria in volcanic rocks offer unique insights into pre-eruptive magmatic systems over process-relevant timescales e. g., ²³⁸U-²³⁰Th (380 Ka), ²³⁰Th-²²⁶Ra (8 Ka) and ²²⁶Ra-²¹⁰Pb (100 a). The short half-life of ²¹⁰Pb (t½ = 22. 6 years) and the volatile nature of the intermediate isotope, ²²²Rn, (intermediate between the ²²⁶Ra parent and ²¹⁰Pb daughter) provide valuable information on magma transport, evolution and degassing over a timescale more pertinent to the processes leading up to volcanic eruptions. We present new Uranium-series isotope data (U-Th-Ra-²¹⁰Pb) for young (1) in the most mafic samples suggesting that ²²²Rn gas accumulation and fluxing preceding and/or during eruption (on a decadal timescale) may be responsible for the more explosive-style of eruption witnessed at this volcano. Significant accumulation of recently crystallised plagioclase phenocrysts can also create ²¹⁰Pb excesses in volcanic rocks, however, this process is not supported by the petrographic and geochemical data. In summary ²¹⁰Pb-²²⁶Ra disequilibria in Vanuatu volcanic rocks reveal a strong link between pre-eruptive magma degassing systematics and the resultant style of volcanic activity. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Scoria cones are {{generally}} considered to grow rapidly in days to weeks or months. During their growth lava flows may be fed onto the cone surface from <b>lava-lake</b> breaches, or form by coalescence of spatter; such flows are preserved interbedded with scoria lapilli and ash beds. On Tongoa, an island of the Vanuatu volcanic arc in the South Pacific, a series of scoria cones developed during the Holocene, forming a widespread monogenetic volcanic field. Half sections of scoria cones along the coast expose complex interior architecture cone architectures. On {{the western side of}} Tongoa Island a scoria cone remnant with steeply crater-ward dipping beds of scoria ash and lapilli contains various dm-to-m thick lava flows, which are connected by irregular dikes cutting obliquely across the beds of the cone. The lava flows are coherent igneous bodies with well-developed flow top and basal breccias. The lavas interbedded with the cone-forming layers are part of a larger (up to 7 m thick) body that is connected to dykes and sills of irregular geometries that intrude the cone's pyroclastic layers. This 3 D relationship suggests that the lava flows were buried quickly under the accumulating scoriaceous deposits. This allowed subsequent escape of magma from the fluid interiors of flows, with the magma then squeezed upward or laterally into the accumulating pyroclastic pile. Movement of the pile above the partly mobile lava, and potential destabilisation during intrusion into the pile of lava squeezed from the flows, may signal the onset of localised cone failures, and could be implicated in development of major cone breaches (e. g. Paricutin) ...|$|E
40|$|A vigorously {{degassing}} lava lake appeared {{inside the}} Santiago pit crater of Masaya volcano (Nicaragua) in December 2015, {{after years of}} degassing with no (or minor) incandescence. Here, we present an unprecedented-long (3 years) and continuous volcanic gas record that instrumentally characterizes the (re) activation of the <b>lava-lake.</b> Our results show that, before appearance of the lake, the volcanic gas plume composition became unusually CO 2 -rich, as testified by high CO 2 /SO 2 ratios (mean, 12. 2 ± 6. 3) and low H 2 O/CO 2 ratios (mean, 2. 3 ± 1. 3). The volcanic CO 2 flux also peaked in November 2015 (mean, 81. 3 ± 40. 6 kg/s; maximum, 247 kg/s). Using results of magma degassing models and budgets, we interpret this elevated CO 2 degassing as sourced by degassing of a volatile-rich fast-convecting (3. 6 - 5. 2 m 3 ·s- 1) magma, supplying CO 2 -rich gas bubbles from minimum equivalent depths of 0. 36 - 1. 4 km. We propose this elevated gas bubbles supply destabilized the shallow (< 1 km) Masaya magma reservoir, leading to upward migration of vesicular (buoyant) resident magma, and ultimately to (re) formation of the lava lake. At onset of lava lake activity on 11 December 2015 (constrained by satellite-based (MODIS) thermal observations), the gas emissions transitioned to more SO 2 -rich composition, and the SO 2 flux increased by a factor ~ 40 % (11. 4 ± 5. 2 kg/s) relative to background degassing (8. 0 kg/s), confirming faster than normal (4. 4 vs. ~ 3 m 3 ·s- 1) shallow magma convection. Elevated shallow magma circulation is also supported by gradual increase in irradiated thermal energy, captured by MODIS, from which we calculate that 0. 4 - 0. 8 m 3 ·s- 1 of magma have been surface-emplaced since December 2015...|$|E
40|$|The Quaternary-aged (1. 59 – 0. 51 Ma) intraplate, monogenetic, basaltic South Auckland Volcanic Field {{consists}} {{of at least}} 82 volcanic centres that span an area of 300 km². This study focusses on the volcanic and sedimentary histories of the Onewhero and Kellyville maars, interpreted from additional geological observations, which build upon previous geological studies, and gravimetric and magnetic surveys. New geological observations of the Onewhero maar reveal the presence of diatomaceous sediment, {{and at least one}} lava flow, that probably originated from the nearby Klondyke cone to the south, and which occupies a significant area of the crater floor. A geological investigation of the Kellyville maar reveals a crater that has been partially filled by a thick accumulation of basalt and scoria and overlain by Karapiro Formation sediments and diatomite. Available borehole stratigraphy suggests that the Glass Hill basalt cone present in the Kellyville maar was an early-stage volcanic product rather than a late-stage product as previously thought. Gravimetric surveys in the Onewhero and Kellyville maars revealed contrasting crater fill deposits. Raw gravity data was acquired in the field, corrected for drift and then reduced to a Bouguer anomaly. The Onewhero maar is characterised by an anomaly of - 5. 8 mGal that has a concave profile. The post-eruption geological body present at Onewhero is two-dimensionally modelled with a density of 1. 3 g/cm³, and has a maximum thickness of 100 m in the northwest of the crater. The Kellyville maar is characterised by an anomaly of + 2. 5 mGal that has a convex profile. The dominant geological body present in the crater is a <b>lava-lake</b> deposit that is two-dimensionally modelled with a density of 2. 9 g/cm³, and has a maximum thickness of 60 m. The total magnetic field strength of the Onewhero and Kellyville maars was recorded with a proton magnetometer and the values were mapped in ArcMap. In the Onewhero maar, two subdued anomalies were outliers. A positive magnetic anomaly (213 nT) with a broad crescent shape was identified {{in the middle of the}} crater and interpreted to be either an extrusive feeder dyke or an accumulation of highly magnetic volcanic sediment deposited in a topographic trough. A circular negative anomaly (- 1057 nT) in the northwest of the crater is an accumulation of lake sediment with a low magnetic susceptibility. In the Kellyville maar, two contrasting anomalies were observed. The strongly positive anomaly (1275 nT) corresponds to the geographical position of Glass Hill, a basaltic cone. A strong negative anomaly (- 3315 nT) in the middle of the crater corresponds to a known deposit of diatomite. Overall, the structure of the Onewhero maar, as inferred by this investigation, is similar to many other maars globally and its sedimentary fill is remarkably similar to the Dottingen maar in Germany. The Kellyville maar has a more unique structure but can be compared to the Domain maar in the nearby Auckland Volcanic Field...|$|E
