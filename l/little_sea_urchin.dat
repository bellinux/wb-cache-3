40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However {{there has been}} much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> was exposed to three sizes of rock lobsters in a caging experiment, juvenile <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> were eaten more frequently than larger <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> by all sizes of rock lobster, but only the largest rock lobsters (N 120 mm CL) were able to consume large adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins.</b> Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> to rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, rock lobsters were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly rock lobsters, exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of rock lobsters is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations...|$|R

40|$|The traits {{related to}} {{foraging}} and eating {{are crucial to}} our understanding of food webs. The use of signals to detect predators has strong relevance for prey survival. The black <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Echinometra lucunter cohabits with the green <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Lytechinus variegatus and a generalist echinivorous predator, the cushion sea star Oreaster reticulatus. Because black <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> evolved under the same predation pressure as green <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> and, consequently, were exposed to the same sensory cues, they are hypothesised to be able to detect echinivorous predator odours and chemical cues from green <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> as well as from injured conspecifics to elicit antipredator responses. Black <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> responded strongly to predators fed on a diet of conspecifics, showed a weak response to predators fed on green <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> and did not respond to a starved predator. The failure of black <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> to respond to hungry cushion sea stars probably increases their risk of being consumed.

The reseeding project was done in 2002. One thousand pieces of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> juveniles were stocked in submerged plastic cages in the reef area of the said bay. These were grown to adult size in four months, maintained as spawners, and allowed to naturally spawn to repopulate the area. In 2004, <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> abundance in the bay and neighboring towns increased to 30 - 60 pcs 100 m⁻². Another case was done at Nalvo, Sta.

Growth models were fitted to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> (Heliocidaris erythrogramma) data, based on tag-recapture information from two distinct community types, a native macroalgal bed and a <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barren colonized by U. pinnatifida. Despite the distinct contrast in habitats, size-at-age relationships and age frequency distributions were not significantly different between the two populations.

The content of PUFA increased during cold climatic conditions with a simultaneous decrease in the content of SFA. These changes were reversed during warm seasons. In cultured <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> PUFA content increased with increasing feeding period with a concurrent decrease in SFA content. [...] Glycine was the dominant amino acid in the total amino acids (TAA) of wild <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> gonads and viscera. On the contrary, TAA of cultured <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> gonads was dominated by tyrosine on week 9 after feeding on the artificial diet.
