The non-zero <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass in non-isotropic non-equlibrium situations has fundamental importance in that it acts as a natural cut-off to remove infrared divergences in the magnetic sector. Thus it allows one to avoid infrared problems which previously made it difficult to use a transport theory approach using perturbative QCD or QED scattering kernels to study the thermalization of a QED or QCD plasma.

40|$|We {{study the}} gluon propagator in Landau gauge in the deconfined phase of SU(2) gauge theory. From the long-distance {{behaviour}} of correlation functions of {{temporal and spatial}} components of the gauge fields we extract electric (me) and <b>magnetic</b> (mm) <b>screening</b> masses. For temperatures larger than twice Tc we find no additional temperature dependence in me(T) /T, while mm(T) /T drops with increasing temperature.

Metamaterials are introduced, being some of their possible uses and some applications (according to referenced papers) will be exposed. Specifically, a type of metamaterials will be explained: <b>magnetic</b> <b>screens.</b> The tools used for the design and simulation of multi-antenna structures involving these artificial materials will be commented. A multi-antenna system design based onm etamaterial separators will be designed {{in order to reduce the}} size of the multi-antenna structure keeping the isolation level between antenna elements. Firstly, a unit cell to be used in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> will be analysed and designed. Next, a monopole will be tuned at an operating frequency of 2. 45 GHz. Secondly, two multi-antenna systems will be designed, a first having two monopoles and another one with four monopoles. These designs will be compared with the performance of: 1) a conventional system where the decoupling is achieved by the separating the antennas; 2) a system where the decoupling is achieved by the inclusion of a metal screen; and 3) a system that includes an artificial <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> (metamaterial) composed with a periodic arrangement of a pre-designed unit cell. The parameters evaluated for comparison between the three types of decoupling systems are: reflection coefficient, isolation, and radiation pattern, all of them at frequency of 2. 45 GHz because this frequency corresponds to a free band in the National Frequency Table and consequently this system may be used in Wi-Fi systems.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of the kaon condensed color-flavor locked (CFL) phase of dense quark matter with regard to the formation of a non-zero Goldstone boson current. In the kaon condensed phase there is an electrically charged fermion which becomes gapless near μ_s^(1) ≃ 1. 35 Δ and a neutral fermion which becomes gapless near μ_s^(2) ≃ 1. 61 Δ. Here, μ_s=m_s^ 2 /(2 p_F) is the shift in the Fermi energy due to the strange quark mass m_s and Δ is the gap in the chiral limit. The transition to the gapless phase is continuous at μ_s^(1) and first order at μ_s^(2). We find that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> masses are real in the regime μ_s μ_s^(2). We show that there is a very weak current instability for μ_s>μ_s^(1) and a more robust instability in a small window near μ_s^(2).

Moreover, we calculate the corrections due to the magnetic field to all orders of B and demonstrate that in the case when magnetic field is large the Debye mass grows linearly with B, while the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass vanishes. The whole effect of the magnetic field turns out to stem from the Chern-Simons action. We also discuss the zero temperature case in the chiral perturbation theory.

At separations z≤ 2 /T the correlators are {{shown to be}} dominated by a power [...] law behavior even for finite gluon screening masses. This continuum behavior is well approximated on current 4 × 16 ^ 3 [...] lattices in the perturbative limit and leads to a considerable overestimate of screening masses deduced from fitting the lattice correlators with conventional exponential forms.
