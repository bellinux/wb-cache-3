5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
5|$|In the 1500m, Talbot {{decided that}} Windle would {{attack from the}} outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race. They also worked on Windle's technique, curing his habit of {{dropping}} his elbow to a <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> when he was tired. Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats {{with a time of}} 17min 15.9s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17min 1.7s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{seems to}} have {{continued}} even after the coronation. According to William of Malmesbury, an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan {{on account of his}} supposed illegitimacy, although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was acting on behalf of Edwin, Ælfweard's younger brother. Blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder. Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years. The Bishop of Winchester, Frithestan, did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan's known charters until 928. After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931, but was listed in a <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> than entitled by his seniority.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} south chancel stained glass is {{in memory of the}} wife, son, and {{daughter}} of Hugh Wynne Jones, who died in the mid-19th century. He was the first priest to be vicar of the parish (1868–1888); his predecessors had been curates, a <b>lower</b> <b>position.</b> He is depicted as Simeon, who in Luke's Gospel receives Jesus and his family when they visit the Temple of Jerusalem after the birth of Jesus (an event celebrated as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). The north transept has a three-light window to the north depicting St Edern, by Franz Mayer & Co. There are also windows with two lights on the east and west sides of the transept, one of which has a window from 1951 by Celtic Studios.|$|E

Apart from the inevitable small leakages, no significant amount of water had been used in the process.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} disagreement {{of the letter}} reversals has been over the Haha–Hung pair. The most convincing evidence suggesting this reversal is {{in the names of}} the letters: The unvoiced letter Haha is deep, while the voiced Hung, which suggests a <b>lower</b> <b>position,</b> is tall. This is often assumed to be a clerical error introduced in the rushed printing of the Shavian edition of Androcles and the Lion. This reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants.|$|E

25|$|In the Paleogene period {{southern}} Sweden {{was at a}} <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> {{relative to}} sea level but was likely still above it as it was covered by sediments. Rivers flowing over the South Småland peneplain flowed also across Scania which {{was at the time}} covered by thick sediments. As the relative sea level sank and much of Scania lost its sedimentary cover antecedent rivers begun to incise the Söderåsen horst forming valleys. During deglaciation these valleys likely evacuated large amounts of melt-water. The relief of Scania's south-western landscape was formed by the accumulation of thick Quaternary sediments during the Quaternary glaciations.|$|E

These holsters are not standard issue but are issued to members upon request, and are commonly requested by members who suffer from back aches (as a result of heavy utility belt), or those who find it more operationally sound to draw their firearms from a <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> (as this option offers a more comfortable reach).|$|E

25|$|With much ingenuity, the Treaty {{limitations}} were (nearly) {{adhered to}} and displacement {{was a little}} over 1500 tons. Despite this, the Hatsuharus retained {{all but one of}} the Special Types' 5inch guns and introduced the oxygen-powered version of the 24inch torpedo. They introduced a forward, superfiring single 5inch gun and retained the tall bridge structure. The impact of the Tomozuru incident, which exposed the instability of contemporary Japanese warship designs, affected the Hatsuharus and the two that had been completed and four more under construction were significantly redesigned. The forward single gun was moved aft to a <b>lower</b> <b>position,</b> the bridge and other structures were reduced or removed and ballast was added. Displacement increased to 2,090 tons and speed was consequently reduced.|$|E
25|$|A {{cone crusher}} {{is similar in}} {{operation}} to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber {{and more of a}} parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening {{at the bottom of the}} crusher.|$|E
25|$|The {{charges of}} disloyalty were {{eventually}} dropped, {{partly because of}} the intervention of his brother, Wang Jin, who held high government rank (as Undersecretary of the Board of Punishments) and whose loyal efforts in the defense of Taiyuan were well known. Furthermore, the poems he had written during his captivity were produced, and accepted as evidence in favor of his loyalty. Following his pardon, Wang Wei spent much of his time in his Buddhist practice and activities. Then, with the further suppression of the rebellion, he again received a government position, in 758, at first in a <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> than prior to the rebellion, as a tàizǐ zhōngchōng (太子中充), in the court of the crown prince rather than that of the emperor himself. In 759 Wang Wei was not only restored to his former position in the emperor's court, but he was eventually promoted. Over time, he was moved to the secretarial position of jǐshìzhōng (給事中) and his last position, which he held until his death in 761, was shàngshū yòuchéng (尚書右丞), or deputy prime minister. As these positions were in the city of Chang'an, they were not too far from his private estate to prevent him from visiting and repairing it. During all this time, he continued his artistic endeavors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} gender earnings gaps in Hong Kong {{using the}} 2006 by-census data. To explore {{the sources of}} gender earnings gaps, we decompose the gaps using the method proposed by Machado and Mata (2005). We have three major findings. First, gender earnings gaps are larger both in <b>lower</b> <b>positions</b> and in higher positions in the earnings distribution. Both the "glass ceiling effect" and the "sticky floor effect" exist in Hong Kong. Second, gender earnings gaps in higher positions are much explained by gender differentials in productivity-related characteristics; however, gender earnings gaps in <b>lower</b> <b>positions</b> are barely explained by these characteristics. Third, the effect of occupational segregation on gender earnings gaps depends on specific positions in the earnings distribution. In <b>lower</b> <b>positions,</b> occupational segregation {{is not a big}} problem and has little impact on gender earnings gaps; in higher positions, however, occupational segregation favors male workers and enlarges gender earnings gaps.

25|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for endothermy {{is provided by}} the body shape of derived ichthyosaurs, which with its short tail and vertical tail fin seems optimised for a high cruising speed that can only be sustained by a high metabolism: all extant animals swimming this way are either fully warm-blooded or, like sharks and tuna, maintain a high temperature in their body core. This argument does not cover basal forms with a more eel-like body and undulating swimming movement. In 1996, Richard Cowen, while accepting endothermy for the group, presumed that ichthyosaurs would have been subject to Carrier's constraint, a limitation to reptilian respiration pointed out in 1987 by David Carrier: their undulated locomotion forces the air out of the lungs and thus prevents them from taking breath while moving. Cowen hypothesised that ichthyosaurs would have overcome this problem by porpoising: constantly jumping out of the water would have allowed them to take a gulp of fresh air during each jump. Other researchers have tended to assume that for at least derived ichthyosaurs Carrier's constraint did not apply, because of their stiff bodies, which seems to be confirmed by their good diving capacity, implying an effective respiration and oxygen storage system. For these species porpoising was not a necessity. Nevertheless, ichthyosaurs would have often surfaced to breathe, probably tilting their heads slightly to take in air, because of the <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> of the nostrils compared to that of dolphins.|$|E
500|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} Amir accepts his <b>lower</b> <b>position</b> in {{relation}} to God; in several cases, Jassin writes, Amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and protests God's absoluteness. Teeuw likewise notes a sense of dissatisfaction throughout the poems, writing that Amir seems to treat God as an entity that [...] "only toys with humans, allowing them to be pushed aside and erased". Elsewhere Teeuw writes that Amir questions fate and the need for him to separate from his love.|$|E
