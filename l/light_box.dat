5|$|Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{has been}} taken to a disused medical {{facility}} by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and his agents. She {{is placed in the}} same room along with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), also secured to a chair, revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before. Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia. He presents a <b>light</b> <b>box</b> test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind, torturing Nina to create the emotional driver, but Olivia admits she can't do it without rest. During this period, Olivia, her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) timeline, asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection, but she recognizes that this Nina is not the real one but instead the one from the parallel universe. Olivia continues to play along, explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room, where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter.|$|E

25|$|Writing ink {{is usually}} {{water-based}} and {{is much less}} viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption, enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife {{can be used to}} erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a <b>light</b> <b>box</b> or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with litterea unciales (hence the name), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline well.|$|E
500|$|In Ann Arbor, {{organizers}} of a [...] "Bad Hombres and Nasty Women" [...] event featuring live performances expected an attendance of 600 people; proceeds benefited Planned Parenthood. The event {{took place at}} the Neutral Zone and included performance art and comedy. Another artistic outlet protesting Trump took place in Detroit, where performers and audience members met at a venue called the <b>Light</b> <b>Box,</b> where they raised money for the ACLU of Michigan. In downtown Grand Rapids, between 200 and 300 demonstrators gathered at Rosa Parks Circle and marched to Calder Plaza. The protest was organized by Indivisible West Michigan. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the U.S. Postal Service building at the corner of Third and Washington streets in Marquette. The event was led by Anne Stark.|$|E
500|$|Olivia convinces Harris {{to let her}} see Jones alone, {{attributing}} the agent's {{death to}} his misfire. In the interrogation room, Olivia discovers that Jones believes {{she is one of}} the soldiers in his war, having been a test subject on a Massive Dynamic nootropic drug known as [...] "Cortexiphan" [...] when she was a child. Jones claims that she is special, and instructs her to a remote site with a key in his possession to retrieve a package. Olivia follows his instructions, finding a package full of strange puzzles. The first puzzle is a <b>light</b> <b>box</b> containing a number of lights which Jones' instructions require her to disable with her thoughts only. Olivia, having learned from Nina Sharp that the only Cortexiphan trials were done in Ohio, far from her childhood Jacksonville, Florida home, is confident Jones is mistaken.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by David LaChapelle, who previously directed the music videos for [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002) and [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] (2003). He explained to MTV News that the video's concept, [...] "There's all kinds of connotations to the word 'stripped.' I wanted to strip it down to one take. Just her and this incredible voice. And really not have anything {{that is going to}} overshadow that. She's trying to grow as an artist and along the way she's taking all kinds of risks {{and a lot of times}} people let those things overshadow her ability and her talent. I wanted to bring it all back as a sort of bookend to this album". The video begins with a close-up scene of Aguilera and zooms out to her wearing a slip and sitting in an abandoned prop room. In one continuous black and white shot, Aguilera walks through several rooms, exits the building, and finally lays on a <b>light</b> <b>box.</b> The video was filmed at a deserted theater in downtown Los Angeles. It was inspired by neorealist works. The video was nominated for three 2004 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Female Video, Viewer's Choice, and Best Cinematography.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, Brent Lane of the First Colony Foundation was {{studying}} the Virginia Pars Map, {{which was made}} by John White during his 1585 visit to Roanoke Island, and noticed two patches where the map had been corrected. The patches are made of paper contemporaneous {{with that of the}} map. Lane asked researchers at the British Museum in London, where the map has been kept since 1866, what might be under the patches, sparking a research investigation. On May 3, 2012, at Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, members of the Foundation and representatives of the museum announced the discovery of [...] "a large, square-shaped symbol with oddly shaped corners." [...] This symbol, presumed to represent a fort, is visible when the map is viewed on a <b>light</b> <b>box.</b> Some scholars speculate that the colonists relocated to that location, on what is now called Salmon Creek in the Bertie County community of Merry Hill. The Scotch Hall Preserve golf course community was planned on the site, but it has not been fully developed.|$|E

60|$|Another {{thing they}} did was to watch for butterflies, in order to catch any new species that they might find, {{to add to the}} teacher's cabinet of natural history. For this purpose one of the boys had a gauze net {{on the end of a}} long but light handle; and when a {{butterfly}} came in sight that seemed at all curious or new, one of the boys set off with the rest to catch him. If the specimen was found valuable, it was preserved. The specimens thus kept were secured with a pin in the bottom of a broad, but flat and very <b>light</b> <b>box,</b> which one of the older boys carried with his knapsack. The boy opened this box, and showed Rollo the butterflies which they had taken. They had quite a pretty collection. There were several that Rollo did not recollect ever to have seen before.|$|E
