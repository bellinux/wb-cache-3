40|$|At an Eastern Hungarian {{protected}} grassland, namely at the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Mole</b> <b>Rat</b> (Spalax leucodon Nordmann, 1840). Reservation of Hajdúbagos Nature Conservation Area, {{grazing animal}} husbandry formed the façade {{of the land}} for hundreds of years. Though, due to the unfavourable changes {{of the last few}} decades in this sector of agriculture, the primeval sand steppe meadow (Pulsatillo hungaricae-Festucetum rupicolae (Soó 1938) Borhidi 1996) plant association is endangered by the increasingly accelerating succession. To stop or at least to slow down this process the rehabilitation of the area could be necessary. The target of the restoration ecology actions is to restore the previously existing, more favourable natural status of a particular area. However, the lack of knowledge according to the conditions that refer to the original circumstances often complicates this activity. To define these reference conditions the exploration of the history of a certain landscape is very important as restoration is only successful if the restored ecosystem is similar to the original. We examined the land use changes of the research area during the last 250 years according to historical and present geographical databases using GIS technology and completed this work with the study of archival data. By our results we stated that these examinations are crucial in the proper - agriculture related - management of protected areas...|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the species richness and diversity of a loess grassland influenced by the digging of the <b>lesser</b> blind <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> [Nannospalax (superspecies leucodon) ] and to study the effect of this disturbance to diversity. The study was conducted in the Külső-gulya loess grassland (Körös-Maros National Park), which is unique in Hungary due to its excellent soil quality and the large spatial extent of natural loess meadow steppe. We recorded the cover of species in 50 x 50 cm plots. Altogether 12 plots were sampled on mounds of <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> and 12 plots as a control in the area with no mounds. Differences in species richness, Shannondiversity, evenness and total cover between disturbed and control plots were tested by One-Way ANOVA. There were no significant difference neither in the number of species, nor in the Shannondiversity and evenness. There were differences in the species composition detected by PCO ordination. We can conclude that the presence and disturbance of the <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> influence the composition of the grassland significantly but it does not cause a difference in the species richness, diversity and total cover. Our results suggest that this grassland has adapted to these natural disturbances...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mole</b> <b>rats</b> are {{exclusively}} subterranean {{and highly}} specialized rodents. Their long lifespans, remarkable anti-cancer mechanisms, and various distinctive adaptive features {{make them a}} useful research model. Moreover, opposing convergence of morphological traits, they have developed extremely high karyotype variability. Thus, 74 chromosomal forms have been described so far and new ones are being revealed continuously. These evolved {{during the process of}} rapid radiation and occur in different biogeographical regions. During research into their reproductive biology we have already provided substantial evidence for species-level separation of these taxa. Here, we review diverse chromosomal forms of the <b>lesser</b> blind <b>mole</b> <b>rat,</b> Mediterranean Nannospalax leucodon, distributed in South-eastern Europe, their karyotype records, biogeography, origin, and phylogeny from our extensive research. In the light of new data from molecular genetic studies, we question some former valuations and propose a cryptospecies rank for seven reproductively isolated chromosomal forms with sympatric and parapatric distribution and clear ecogeographical discrepances in their habitats, as well as new experimental and theoretical methods for understanding the courses of speciation of these unique fossorial mammals...|$|R

40|$|The {{rudimentary}} {{eyes of the}} <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> Spalax ehrenbergi {{have lost}} their visual function, but are still required for the control of circadian rhythms. It has previously been found that αA-crystallin, a major eye lens protein in other mammals, evolved much faster in the <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> than in rodents with normal vision. Yet, although <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αA-crystallin seems superfluous as a lens protein, its rate of change is still much slower than that of pseudogenes, suggesting some remaining function. The authors therefore studied the structure and function of recombinant <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αA-crystallin. Circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence and gel permeation analyses indicated that the overall structure and stability of <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αA-crystallin are {{comparable to that of}} rat αA-crystallin. However, the chaperone-like activity of <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αA-crystallin is considerably lower than that of its rat orthologue. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αA-crystallin suggests that this may be in part due to a diminished flexibility of the C-terminal extension, which is thought to be important for the chaperoning capacity. Overall, <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αA-crystallin appears to still be a viable protein, confirming that it has some as yet elusive role, despite the loss of its primary lens function. Ronald H. P. H.

25|$|In blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> (genus Spalax), {{the process}} of {{necrosis}} replaces {{the role of the}} systematic apoptosis normally used in many organisms. Low oxygen conditions, such as those common in blind mole rats' burrows, usually cause cells to undergo apoptosis. In adaptation to higher tendency of cell death, blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> evolved a mutation in the tumor suppressor protein p53 (which is also used in humans) to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. Human cancer patients have similar mutations, and blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> were thought to be more susceptible to cancer because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis. However, after a specific amount of time (within 3 days according to a study conducted at the University of Rochester), the cells in blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> release interferon-beta (which the immune system normally uses to counter viruses) in response to over-proliferation of cells caused by the suppression of apoptosis. In this case, the interferon-beta triggers cells to undergo necrosis, and this mechanism also kills cancer cells in blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats.</b> Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> and other spalacids are resistant to cancer.|$|R

Here we show that the full-length <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> αB-crystallin intergenic region behaves similarly in transgenic mice. A two-nucleotide mutation (− 273 CA→G) in the mouse αB-crystallin enhancer/promoter fragment mimicking the wild-type <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> sequence functionally converted the mouse promoter fragment {{to that of the}} wild-type <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> promoter when tested in transgenic mice.

Our data support the idea that blind mole rats' αB-crystallin promoter activity was modified during the evolution of subterranean life and shows that tissue-specific promoter activity can be modulated by changing as few as two apparently neutral nucleotides in the mouse αB-crystallin enhancer region, implying the importance of the context of regulatory sequences for promoter activity...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: The maximum {{lifespan}} of {{the naked}} <b>mole</b> <b>rat</b> is over 28. 3 years, which exceeds {{that of any}} other rodent species, suggesting that age-related changes in its body composition and functionality are either attenuated or delayed in this extraordinarily long-lived species. However, the mechanisms underlying the aging process in this species are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether long-lived naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> display more autophagic activity than short-lived mice. Methods: Hepatic stellate cells isolated from naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> were treated with 50 nM rapamycin or 20 mM 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA) for 12 or 24 h. Expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC 3 -II and beclin 1 was measured with western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The induction of apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Our results demonstrate that one-day-old naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> have higher levels of autophagy than one-day-old short-lived C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and that both adult naked <b>mole</b> <b>rats</b> (eight months old) and adult C 57 BL/ 6 mice (eight weeks old) have high basal levels of autophagy, which may be an important mechanism inhibiting aging and reducing the risk of age-related diseases. Conclusion: Here, we report that autophagy facilitated the survival of hepatic stellate cells from the naked <b>mole</b> <b>rat,</b> and that treatment with 3 -MA or rapamycin increased the ratio of apoptotic cells to normal hepatic stellate cells...|$|R
