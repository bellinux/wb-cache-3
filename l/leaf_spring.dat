5|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed from the}} prototype T2 tank built by Rock Island Arsenal, which had a Vickers-type <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspension. The suspension {{was replaced by the}} superior vertical volute system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the pre-world-war-II period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37mm gun as the main armament. A total of 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.|$|E
5|$|The <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile {{industry has}} declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{research}} results of ability vibration’s suppression steel and composite <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were presented. Polymeric composite <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> and steel were studied. Composite <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> {{were made from}} epoxy-glass composite reinforcement by glass fibre. Composite springs became designed to can replace steel spring of van. Executed investigations base on dynamic loadings of <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> and registering of vibrations amplitude and reaction of props. Load was realized through lowering from definite height of mass which hit into spring wresting it from balance. Mass stayed on spring to total atrophy of vibrations. Measured and registered parameters permitted to count logarithmic decrement suppressions of tremblings and coefficient of suppression of tremblings. This coefficient was counted for composite and steel <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> Basic exploational parameters of <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were compared as well as basic advantages of applying to vehicles building of composite materials were analysed. Analyses lead to conclusion that composite <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> in comparison to steel springs: about three times better suppress of tremblings, they are about five times lighter and give smaller dynamic burdens of vehicles body. Wide applying of composites materials on carrying structures of vehicles will contribute to lower of vehicles mass and to decrease of emission greenhouses' gases...|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{consists of a}} De Dion tube that located the wheels and which was sprung by the usual longitudinal <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The first year of production (1998) used lightweight carbon fiber monolithic <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> which had insufficient lateral stiffness to provide lateral location of the suspension; these early versions also featured a Watt's linkage. Later versions used conventional steel <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> {{and did not have}} the Watt's linkage.|$|R

This included the tailwheel <b>leaf</b> <b>spring,</b> wing spars, wing ribs (aluminum on later kits), lift struts, firewall, elevator and fuel tank. A variety of engines may be used such as the Hirth F33, Hirth F-23, Zanzottera MZ 34, 1/2 Volkswagen air-cooled engine and the Zanzottera MZ 201.|$|E
25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate {{rack and pinion steering}} while still using transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspension. The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced in the summer of 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
5000|$|Geislinger {{couplings}} {{are constructed}} inside robust enclosed steel housings. An outer housing and a central hub or [...] "inner star" [...] form the {{input and output}} drive members.

25|$|New in 1971 were tubular {{landing gear}} legs with a 16% greater width (6feet 6inches (1.98m) to 7feet 7inches (2.31m) for better ground handling. These {{replaced}} the previous flat steel <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> gear. Also in 1971, the landing and taxi lights were {{moved from the}} wing leading edge to the nose bowl to better illuminate the ground. They were an improvement, but bulb life was reduced due to the heat and vibration of that location. They were {{moved back to the}} wing on the 1984 model Cessna 152.|$|E
25|$|Packaging {{is cited}} as both an {{advantage}} and disadvantage of the transverse FRP <b>leaf</b> <b>spring,</b> {{as compared to}} coil springs, depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufactures to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping {{the diameter of the}} shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to coil springs. Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to coil springs on production road cars.|$|E
25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was <b>leaf</b> <b>spring,</b> tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, steering manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was 6x6, {{with three}} live beam axles, adapted and {{strengthened}} for {{conditions in the}} USSR. It had a reinforced ladder frame with three live beam axles, the front on semi elliptical <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> the rear tandem on quarter elliptical <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with locating arms.|$|R

25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the anti-roll bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the anti-roll bar) to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> across the vehicle results in an anti-roll bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter anti-roll bar, and even eliminating the rear anti-roll bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|E
25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield 513 {{was built}} by Charles Roberts & Co. of Wakefield to a design by Sheffield Transport, {{as one of a}} batch of 35 double deck trams {{constructed}} between 1950-1952. Fitted with comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, it ran on a 4-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspension, powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors with a pair of Crompton-West CT/TJ controllers (fitted in restoration). Braking systems feature air brakes acting on all wheels, with electric braking for emergency use. It only operated in Sheffield for eight years, as they abandoned their trams in 1960. It ran in the closing procession held on 8 October.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>springs</b> {{have been}} around since the early Egyptians. Ancient {{military}} engineers used <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> in the form of bows to power their siege engines, with little success at first.
