40|$|Abstract – This study {{explored}} {{predictors of}} residential satisfaction among the newly arrived and <b>long-term</b> <b>residents</b> of a rural community following a rapid influx of immigrants into the community. Regression analyses indicated that issues concerning housing predicted residential satisfaction in <b>long-term</b> <b>residents</b> but not recently-arrived residents. In addition, stress-related issues predicted residential satisfaction in both short and <b>long-term</b> <b>residents.</b> Correlation analyses revealed important {{differences between the}} groups concerning status in the community and relations with neighbors. Future directions for research and practice are discussed in this chapter...|$|R

25|$|The fiscal {{difficulties}} affected {{also the}} Commonwealth diplomacy and foreign policy. John III kept resident diplomats in several major capitals, but the Sejm imposed limits {{on what they}} could undertake. The Sejm also banned <b>long-term</b> <b>resident</b> foreign representations in Warsaw, a prohibition ignored by the papacy and numerous governments. The Sejm itself had rather frequently sent its own missions abroad. The magnates, including top state officials, especially the hetmans, conducted their own foreign activities and at times served foreign powers for their private gain. When French dominated European diplomacy, in Poland the official language was still Latin. The 1684 treaty of Holy League, which ignored the recent Polish military contributions and Polish interests alike, was {{just one example of}} the Commonwealth's diplomacy lack of effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Detroit blues artist John Lee Hooker {{became a}} <b>long-term</b> <b>resident</b> in the city's {{southwest}} Delray neighborhood. Hooker, among other important blues musicians migrated {{from his home}} in Mississippi bringing the Delta blues to northern cities like Detroit. Hooker recorded for Fortune Records, the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the Black Bottom neighborhood. Prominent emerging Jazz musicians of the 1960s included: trumpet player Donald Byrd who attended Cass Tech and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career and Saxophonist Pepper Adams who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums. The Graystone International Jazz Museum documents jazz in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|While Tornado {{was based}} at the NRM, on 21 January 2009 a £250,000 funding appeal, Save Our Scotsman, was {{launched}} for completion of the restoration of LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman, a <b>long-term</b> <b>resident</b> of the NRM workshops since being taken out of service for overhaul in December 2005. Inevitable comparisons were drawn with the Tornado project, with it being highlighted that as {{of the end of}} 2008 the cost to the NRM since 2004 of restoring Flying Scotsman (£2.2m purchasing and £742,000 overhauling) was almost the exact cost of building Tornado from scratch. In particular, as of January 2008, the believed cost of £800,000 for Tornado's brand new boiler from Germany was less than the latest NRM budget of £850,000 for restoring Flying Scotsman's A3 boiler, which had risen from earlier estimates due to the boiler's poor condition and the rising cost of copper.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of new European immigrants (from Albania, Bulgaria, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro and Ukraine) in the UK labour market, {{in relation to their}} education and training at home, as well as the extent of occupational mobility within the UK.

The study does not show signs of heavy competition for jobs between the immigrants and <b>long-term</b> <b>residents.</b> Labour shortages appear to remain, with East Europeans reporting low levels of unemployment and <b>long-term</b> <b>residents</b> reporting little antipathy towards these newcomers...|$|R

This research examines change in socioeconomic status during the 1990 s for <b>long-term</b> <b>residents</b> of high-amenity, high-growth rural counties in the U. S. Methods. Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in combination with county-level information, we estimate growth curve models to examine {{the extent to which}} the socioeconomic status of <b>long-term</b> <b>residents</b> is associated with amenity-related in-migration. Results. We find that, on average, residents in high-growth, amenity-rich rural areas have higher income growth over time and higher levels of initial occupational prestige compared to those from other rural areas, but socioeconomic gains are primarily for individuals with low baseline prestige. Conclusions. The socioeconomic gains made by <b>long-term</b> <b>residents</b> of high-growth, amenity-rich, rural areas associated with net in-migration may be limited to individuals with low initial prestige and growth may be due to low-skill service sector jobs...|$|R

2500|$|In 2014 Forbes {{wrote that}} the numbers of those renouncing their {{citizenship}} are understated. According to a survey reported by Forbes, [...] "5.5 million Americans eye giving up U.S. citizenship". There are serious differences between the figures cited by the Federal Register (which include renunciations, relinquishments, and loss of <b>long-term</b> <b>resident</b> (green-card) status to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System gun control database ("NICS") which only contain renunciations. Whereas the Federal Register stated that 3,415 people renounced or relinquished their citizenship or long-term residence in 2014, the IRS stated that 1,100 people renounced citizenship at only one particular US consulate during the first ten months of 2014. This contradicted prior claims that such statistics are not maintained at the consulates.|$|E
2500|$|Texas law {{provides}} for police officer discretion in arresting any person caught committing a misdemeanor, such as violating its mandatory seat belt laws. Violation of its seat belt law in 1999 was punishable with the maximum fine of $50. [...] In March 1997, Gail Atwater, a <b>long-term</b> <b>resident</b> of Lago Vista, Texas, was driving her pick-up truck with her three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter from soccer practice. [...] One {{of the children}} had lost a toy and she allowed them to unbuckle their seat belts to stand {{to search for the}} toy; hence, none of them were wearing seat belts. Police officer Bart Turek, then with the city of Lago Vista, recognized Ms. Atwater and pulled her over. According to court records, witnesses observed that Atwater and her children remained in her pick up when Turek approached the driver's side window and aggressively jabbed his finger toward Atwater’s face. According to Atwater's complaint (allegations, previously supported by witnesses at the scene, that the court also presumed to be true for its purposes), Turek screamed at Atwater about the seatbelts, frightening her children. When Atwater calmly and in a normal tone requested that Turek lower his voice. Turek immediately yelled [...] "you’re going to jail." [...] According to the record, Atwater remained calm when Turek told her she was going to jail. She did not act suspiciously, she did not pose any threat to Turek, and she did not engage in any illegal conduct other than failing to wear a seat belt. Turek continued to verbally abuse Atwater, accusing her of not caring for her children. Atwater's children and bystanders, including friends and other Lago Vista residents who drove or walked by, witnessed Turek's tirade.|$|E
