As Cao Gun's condition worsened, he maintained the same humility he showed throughout his life by {{saying that he was}} undeserving of such generosity from the emperor. Although he knew that his funeral had to be in accordance with Confucian traditions, he requested for a simple funeral and to be buried near the tomb of Quyuan (蘧瑗), a famous official from the Wey state in the Spring and Autumn period. Before his death, he told Cao Fu (曹孚), his son and heir apparent, to conduct himself with humility and virtue, to empathise with his subordinates and the common people, to respect his grandmother Lady Du and uncle Cao Lin, and to <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a loyal and faithful subject of the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} {{missions}} was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, {{was the most important}} industry of any mission. Prior to the establishment of {{the missions}}, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries discovered that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine, had to be taught industry in order to <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-supportive. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions {{under the supervision of the}} padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. Wheat, corn, wine grapes, barley, beans, cattle, horses, and sheep were the major crops at San Diego. In 1795, construction on a system of aqueducts was begun to bring water to the fields and the Mission (the first irrigation project in Upper California). The building manager was , who was poisoned by his Indian cook Nazario before the project was completed. In his testimony, in the trial that followed, Nazario stated that he had poisoned the friar due to constant beatings inflicted by Friar Panto.|$|E

The general belief in Australian professional wrestling {{at the time was}} that a wrestler had to go to North America and <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pro before the bookers would even consider pushing them up the card. Costello travelled across Asia, where he did see some success; he won the Malaysian Heavyweight title in 1939, as well as the South Africa trophy in 1949. During the 1950s, Costello finally started to turn heads at home by winning the Australasian title. In 1952, Costello began wrestling in America, hoping to finally break through and make a big name of himself.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit [...]285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen base count, which led the AL, also broke a {{franchise}} record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, [...] "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast." [...] Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, [...] "He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the infield {{to a guy who}} could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player." [...] The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his [...]349 batting average would be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, [...] "What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise." [...] Lofton would join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form [...] "the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any." ...|$|E

2500|$|The story {{introduces}} Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Gilgamesh, two-thirds god {{and one-third}} man, is oppressing his people, who cry {{out to the}} gods for help. For the young women of Uruk this oppression {{takes the form of}} a droit du seigneur, or [...] "lord's right", to sleep with brides on their wedding night. For the young men (the tablet is damaged at this point) it is conjectured that Gilgamesh exhausts them through games, tests of strength, or perhaps forced labour on building projects. The gods respond to the people's pleas by creating an equal to Gilgamesh who will be able to stop his oppression. This is the primitive man, Enkidu, who is covered in hair and lives in the wild with the animals. He is spotted by a trapper, whose livelihood is being ruined because Enkidu is uprooting his traps. The trapper tells the sun-god Shamash about the man, and it is arranged for Enkidu to be seduced by Shamhat, a temple prostitute, his first step towards being tamed. After six days and seven nights of continuous lovemaking she takes Enkidu to a shepherd's camp to <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> civilized.

He lets them find themselves weak that they may <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong in His strength. Then sometimes He lets them follow their own devices and be filled with the fruits of their own inventions. He lets their sinful hearts have free course down into the depths of idolatry and covetousness, and filthy pleasure and mad self- conceit, that they may learn to know the bitter fruit that springs from the accursed root of sin, and come back to Him in shame and repentance, entreating Him to inform their thoughts, and guide their wills, and gather them to Him as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing, that they may never more wander from Him, their life, their light, and their Saviour. Then, sometimes, if His children forsake His laws and break His covenant, He visits their offences with the rod, and their sin with the stripes of the children of men. That is, He punishes them as He punishes the heathen, if they sin as the heathen sin. He lets loose upon them His wrath, war, disease, or scarcity, that He may drive them back to Him.|$|E
