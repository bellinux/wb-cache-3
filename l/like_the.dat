5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs <b>like</b> <b>the</b> swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines {{able to cope with}} higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.|$|E

Then, Cox, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E

[...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was [...] "only half a mess", and that Ratner [...] "could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did."

Famitsu thought the visuals felt outdated, but called the story stimulating. Czop <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> story, especially the vision quests, but thought that the Spookies members, while appearing often, do not develop as characters through their dialogue. Charter and Wallace also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> story, but disagreed about the Spookies: Charter called them timeless characters, praising Hitomi and Nemissa as good enough to carry the whole story; and Wallace called the dialogue between Hitomi and Nemissa well written, and <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> story's focus on the importance of family. Riendau commented on the character Beta, who has a lisp and calls the protagonist attractive; she called him an outdated and uncomfortable caricature of feminine homosexual men, and said that he distracts from the game.|$|R
