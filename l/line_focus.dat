40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} effect of {{geometry}} on single focusing of particles in the passive microfluidic channels. There is a quantitative analysis of focusing on non-axisymmetric straight channels with two different unique designs as well as curved channels having symmetrical and asymmetrical radius of curvatures in one turn. We found {{that there is a}} clear relationship in existence of single <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> with the degree of non-symmetry in microchannels. One-degree of asymmetry in straight channels does not induce any formation of single <b>focusing,</b> but single <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> is pronounced by two-degree of asymmetry in straight channels. On the other hand, single <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> in the curved channels is enhanced with asymmetrical radius of curvatures in one turn. The single <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> in curved channels is seen at Rep values higher than 1, which gives us better continuous and high-throughput performance. The position of single focused particles in the microchannels is found to be 50 µm with respect to the channel wall in the asymmetrical curved microchannels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of efficient solar receivers for {{different types of}} solar collectors such as point <b>focusing,</b> <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> and external towers have received major attention in solar thermal power conversion process. The point focusing or parabolic concentrators need the receiver with internal cavity absorber and heat transfer system design with limited length and diameter. The <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> collectors are not limited by its receiver length {{with respect to the}} trough. In this regard an experimental simulation was carried out to enhance the overall heat transfer coefficient by effective design of shell and helical tube heat exchanger using silver (Ag) Nano particles with water as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF), which reduces the length of the receiver in point <b>focusing</b> collector. The <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> collector was analysed by 3 D numerical model with porous discs of top half, bottom half, combination of top & bottom half and full shape with silicon carbide ceramic foam as a material to evaluate the performance of the receiver to suit for <b>line</b> <b>focusing</b> collectors.
