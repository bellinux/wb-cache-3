40|$|Caking during {{storage is}} a serious problem for {{manufacturers}} of bulk lactose. This study was carried out to investigate the causes of caking and identify solutions as to how such problems can be eliminated. The mechanisms for caking in crystalline <b>lactose</b> <b>powders</b> were identified. Liquid bridging between adjacent particles was shown to occur in high relative humidity environments (> 80 % RH). These liquid bridges could form crystalline solid bridges if the material was subsequently dried out. The potential mechanism of amorphous lactose flow and bridging in conditions where the glass transition temperature is exceeded was shown to be insignificant in predominantly crystalline <b>lactose</b> <b>powders</b> (< 5 % amorphous lactose). The presence of amorphous lactose is still important as the amorphous matrix acts as a sink of moisture, which can be released upon crystallisation. This increases the moisture available in the system which can contribute to caking by the liquid bridging mechanism. Both of these mechanisms involve changes in the local temperature and moisture conditions within the bulk powder. Such changes were known to be caused by moisture migration under the influence of a temperature gradient. A model which describes the transport of moisture in one dimension as a result of temperature gradients was developed and validated. The microscopic scale processes of liquid bridging and amorphous lactose moisture relations were included into this model. The model predictions agreed well with experimental trials for completely crystalline <b>lactose</b> <b>powders.</b> Comparison of model predictions for the case where amorphous lactose was present {{on the surface of the}} particles showed some inadequacies exist in the model. These were the rate of amorphous lactose crystallisation and the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium between the crystallising amorphous matrix and the air present in the interstices of the bulk lactose. Using the model it was shown that for expected storage conditions, the product should be stored with a water activity below 0. 57 aw if no amorphous lactose is present and below 0. 25 aw if it is present.

40|$|Concentration of {{acid whey}} {{followed}} by spray drying is severely obstructed due to presence of lactic acid (LA) and calcium (Ca). These compounds first prevent lactose crystallisation and consequently cause stickiness during spray drying and caking upon storage of the powders. The present {{study examined the}} effects of the presence of LA, Ca and their mixtures on the physio-chemical and thermal properties of spray dried <b>lactose</b> <b>powders.</b> Spray drying of pure lactose achieved a yield of ∼ 81 %, which was significantly reduced in the presence of high concentrations of LA (1 % w/w) or Ca (0. 12 % w/w) yielding only ∼ 52 %. Powder particles increased in size giving a D[4, 3] of 956 μm, with SEM images confirming the presence of linked strands instead of well separated spherical powder particles as observed for pure lactose. The yield of crystalline lactose increased with subsequent decrease in Ca concentration (∼ 81 %) resulting in well separated spherical powder particles. FTIR analysis suggested that water molecules in the hydration layer of lactose and the structural changes of the lactose molecules at the molecular level appeared to play major roles governing the thermal anomeric characteristics of the spray dried <b>lactose</b> <b>powders</b> in the presence of both LA and Ca. Formation of calcium lactate, which apparently restricted the diffusion of lactose molecules, partly played a role in changing the anomeric properties of the spray dried <b>lactose</b> <b>powders,</b> once the appropriate stoichiometry was reached.

Two straight baseline pre-processing methods gave the best and almost equal performance. By the succeeding quantification methods, PCA performed best, although the classical least square analysis (CLS) gave comparable results, while peak parameter analysis displayed to be inferior.

40|$|Caking is a {{recurrent}} problem in various industries, which occurs during the production, storage or transport of powders, {{and leads to}} lower production rates and decreased product quality.

The complexity of this topic lies in the many parameters which can influence the caking phenomenon in an industrial context. Taking crystalline <b>lactose</b> <b>powder</b> as an example, the present study investigates how the washing and control {{of the size of the}} crystals along the production process influence the caking tendency of the final product under representative storage conditions.

Several drug delivery systems includingdifferent kinds of microspheres and liposomes have been tried for encapsulation of drugs and increasing the residence time in nasal cavity. In this study the clearance rate of three kinds ofliposomes: neutral [phosphatidylcholin (PC) and cholesterol (Chol) ], cationic (PC, Chol and stearylamine) and fusogenic (PC, Chol, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine) was determined by gamma scintigraphy with <b>lactose</b> <b>powder</b> being used as negative control. Liposomes were prepared by dehydration-rehydration method. 99 mTc labeled liposomes were prepared using technetium pertechnetate {{in the presence of}} a potent reducing agent, stannus chloride. The labeling procedure was set in a manner that each 150 μl of liposome suspensions contained 2 MBq of radioactivity. Labeling efficiency was calculated by paper chromatography using acetone as mobile phase. Each delivery system containing 2 MBq of activity was sprayedinto right nostril of four healthy volunteers and one-minute static views were repeated each half hour until 4 hours. Clearance rates were compared using two Regions of Interest (ROIs); the initial site of deposition of particles, and all of nasopharynx region. The clearance rate of each one of liposomes was calculated after applying the physical decay corrections. The mean labeling efficiencies for neutral, cationic and fusogenic liposomes were calculated as 91 %, 20 % and 69 %, respectively. The cleared percent of preparations from nasopharynx region after 4 hours was determined as follows: neutral liposomes 18 ± 2. 9 %; fusogenic liposomes 53. 5 ± 1. 2 %; cationic liposomes 69. 7 ± 4. 2 %; <b>lactose</b> <b>powder</b> 74. 5 ± 4. 9 %.

During the manufacture of spray-dried milk products, the lactose may crystallize (a process during which the α-lactose picks up a molecule of water), while the hygroscopicity and caking properties decrease. In order to determine the degree of crystallization of α-lactose monohydrate, the water bound to the crystals (water of crystallization or hydrate water) is calculated as the difference between total moisture and free moisture or non-hydrate water. The free moisture content is determined in a drying oven at 87 or 105 oCat constant weight. The totalmoisture is determined by a newmethod using a vacuum-drying desiccator with dried zeolite powder as a function of temperature, vacuum and time.

South Africa reported 864 notified new cases between 2001 and 2004 (Department Of Health, 2005), with {{an estimated}} 3 - 4 million chronic HBV infected black South Africans (Kew, 2008). Kwa-Zulu Natal and Free State were the most affected provinces; while 20 - 39 years was the most affected age group as of 2005 (Department Of Health, 2005). Workers in the health industry, intravenous drug users and children {{of women who have}} Hepatitis B are at the most risk for contracting this disease from blood products and body fluids (Immunization Action Coalition, 2007; Boon et al., 2006), where contraction of the disease can lead to liver cirrhosis, fibrosis and hepato-cellular carcinoma (Highleyman, 2008). The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) of the South African Department of Health (2009) suggests vaccination for Hepatitis B should be administered at six, ten and fourteen weeks, or a dose every month for 3 months. Adverse reactions associated with the vaccine include “Guillain-Barre Syndrome, arthritis, demyelinating nervous system disease” (Pratt, 2008) and anaphylaxis (Danis & Halm, 1997). Alternatives that may assist in avoiding such symptoms include: waiting until adolescence to vaccinate (Slonim et al., 2005); only vaccinating high risk groups (Francois et al., 2002); or researching an alternative (Romm, 2001). Homeoprophylaxis is the use of homeopathy to prevent the contraction or development of disease (Zoltan, 2000) and its successful use has been recorded in various disease types and locations. There have been very few studies to show the effect of individual homeopathic nosodes used as prophylactic treatment in their related diseases, with almost none of these utilising any means of serological testing (Bevan-Jones, 2009; Frost et al., 2003; Sheffield, 2006).

The Active group received <b>lactose</b> <b>powders</b> medicated with Hepatitis B 12 cH, whereas the Placebo group received <b>lactose</b> <b>powders</b> medicated with 96 % alcohol. Participants underwent a repeat of the serum/plasma antibody testing at the conclusion of the study to determine if there were anti-HBs present in their blood. The results were then statistically analysed using nonparametric testing: Chi-squared independent test, Mann-Whitney test and Sign test. These showed that there was no change measurable effect on the surface antigen of hepatitis B (anti-HBs) of either the Verum (active medication) or Placebo group. Primary preventative medicine is becoming increasingly popular (Kuehlein et al., 2010). Both vaccination and homeoprophylaxis are examples of primary preventative medicine, where the aim is to prevent future disease. Vaccinations encourage the production of antibodies via the activation of T-helper cells and B-lymphocytes, thus providing a template for immunity against future infections (Miller, 2000; Janeway et al., 2001). While the mechanisms of vaccination are well understood, those of homeoprophylaxis are still being investigated. One theory is that nosodes enable the body to overcome diseases. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of nosodes (Bracho et al., Prophylactic vaccination against human papilloma virus infection and disease in women: a systemic review of randomized control trial.; Gosavi et al., 2012; Shuller, 2010) and have shown favourable results in the prevention of diseases associated with those homeopathic nosodes. However, only two studies have investigated the effects that nosodes have on the antibodies of the immune system (Hoover, 2006; Neustaedter, 2002) showing the need for further studies conducted in this area. The study showed that homeopathically prepared Hepatitis B 12 cH nosode is not capable of eliciting an immune response that would result in the production of the antibody to the surface antigen of Hepatitis B, and thus not able to provide immunity against Hepatitis B...|$|R
