[...] Not incidentally, Wen and Clement identify a cultural trait that places value on resisting [...] "outsider culture", which may result in additional difficulty in adapting to different norms of verbal participation (p. 21-22).|$|R

Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers {{were found to}} be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E

5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E

30|$|Notwithstanding {{the role}} of digital {{technologies}} in compounding the detrimental impacts of marketisation on HE, there are − somewhat paradoxically − many practical, cultural, and pedagogical issues that may make entry into, and participation in the global HE market <b>less</b> straightforward, and <b>likely</b> <b>less</b> successful, than is claimed in the strategies. For example, there may be issues relating to recognition, accreditation, and transferability of UK qualifications further afield, limiting the actual potential for successful global provision. (Paulsen, 2009). Moreover, many global HE ventures have failed due to overestimation of demand (Bacsich, 2010; Jokivirta, 2006; Keegan, Lõssenko, Mázár, Michels, Paulsen, et al., 2007).|$|R
