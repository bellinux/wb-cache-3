5|$|On {{his first}} day at Edwards, Armstrong was tasked his first assignments, which were to pilot chase planes during {{releases}} of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and {{on one of these}} missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, Armstrong was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat,</b> {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
60|$|On {{either side}} of the porch was a seat, and here a {{somewhat}} remarkable sight would have been revealed to any inquisitive eye peering through the aforesaid keyhole. Upon the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> lay seven dolls, upon the right-hand seat lay six; and so varied were the expressions of their countenances, owing to fractures, dirt, age, and other afflictions, that one would very naturally have thought this a doll's hospital, and these the patients waiting for their tea.|$|E
50|$|Covers {{were placed}} on the left hand cockpit windows to provide the same view as from a Shuttle cockpit, and the <b>left-hand</b> pilot's <b>seat</b> was fitted with the same {{controls}} as a Shuttle. The STA's normal flight controls were moved to the right, where the instructor sat. Both seat positions had a head-up display (HUD).|$|R
5000|$|The {{helicopters}} {{used were}} British Army Westland Lynx AH.7s. One is an AH.7(DAS) variant, noticeable for the distinctive [...] "disco ball" [...] infra-red jammer under the tail. The {{other is a}} [...] "stock" [...] AH.7, albeit with a TOW antitank missile sight mounted over the <b>left-hand</b> front <b>seat.</b> Although only two helicopters were used, post-production techniques such as split screen editing, camera angles and CGI produced the huge number of helicopters seen in the video.|$|R
5000|$|The Karma is a range-extended {{electric}} vehicle or series hybrid {{driven by a}} pair of [...] electric motors that receive power from a 20.1 kWh lithium ion battery supplied by A123 Systems and/or an engine powered generator. The battery pack runs {{down the center of the}} car, between the pairs of <b>left-hand</b> and right-hand <b>seats,</b> preventing a rear bench and seating four rather than five passengers. Once the battery is depleted, or when the driver activates the [...] "Sport" [...] paddle on the steering wheel, the front-mounted 260-hp, 2.0-liter Ecotec four-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged gasoline engine powers a generator that sends electricity directly to the drive motors. The engine is sourced from General Motors. The battery can also be charged from the grid, making the vehicle a type of plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicle}} (PHEV).|$|R
50|$|A MAG 58 medium {{machine gun}} is also {{commonly}} fitted {{in front of}} the passenger's (<b>left-hand)</b> <b>seat.</b> In addition, LRPVs can also carry a Suzuki DRZ 250cc motorbike on their tailgate to be used for scouting purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} is located behind the {{right-hand}} seat. The quantity {{can be read}} directly through a sight gauge behind the seat. The standard tank is 70 litres (18 US gallons) with 87 litres (23 US gallons) optional. Behind the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> is a small baggage compartment, with additional baggage space above and behind both seats.|$|E
50|$|The {{crew were}} awakened at 4:19 am EST. After brief medical exams, they ate breakfast with the backup and support crews. They then {{put on their}} spacesuits and were taken by van to the launch site, where they arrived at 6:45 am. This was about 2½ hours before launch. During the launch phase of the flight, Scott sat in the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> of the CSM, Worden in the center seat, and Irwin in the {{right-hand}} seat.|$|E

50|$|The average {{tenure of}} a SKAT pilot {{is about three}} years. Two new pilots join the team every six months. Starting at high {{altitude}} with a single aircraft sortie, with the team leader or the deputy team leader in the Kiran’s <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat,</b> the trainee moves on to two-aircraft and then three-aircraft formation flying. After mastering the skill of flying with two aircraft on either side, the trainee then goes in for four-aircraft and six-aircraft sorties before finally graduating on to nine-aircraft sorties. All types of rolls, loops, dives and formations are flown at various training stages.|$|E
50|$|Versions of the Sycamore {{up to and}} {{including}} the Mk.3A retained the standard two-seat cockpit layout, placing the pilot in the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> and the co-pilot in the right. However, on the main production model, designated as the Sycamore Mk.4, this seating arrangement had been switched to the standard American practice of positioning the pilot's seat on the right. There were also a number of other developments that had featured upon the earlier versions, such as a four-door design, which had been standardised upon the Sycamore Mk.4. This version entered RAF service, receiving the military designation of HR14.|$|E
50|$|The FF also {{suffered}} from a design problem, and not one easily cured: the system was set up for a driver in the right hand seat, and no considerations {{had been made to}} making it left-hand drive. In particular, the central transfer case and both propeller shafts protruded into the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> space. The steering gear and brake servo were fitted on the right-hand side, and there was no space for them on the left. By the early 1970s, Jensen's primary markets were in overseas markets where cars were driven on the right hand side of the road (particularly the United States), and the FF could not be sold there.|$|E
50|$|The Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle was an {{electric-powered}} vehicle designed {{to operate in}} the low-gravity vacuum of the Moon and to be capable of traversing the lunar surface, allowing the Apollo astronauts to extend the range of their surface extravehicular activities. Three LRVs were used on the Moon, one on Apollo 15 by astronauts David Scott and Jim Irwin, one on Apollo 16 by John Young and Charles Duke, and one on Apollo 17 by Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. The mission commander served as the driver, occupying the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> of each LRV. Features are available in papers by Morea, Baker, and Kudish.|$|E
5000|$|April 27, 1982: A Beech B23 Musketeer, {{registration}} number N6502T, sharply pitches upwards, stalls, and enters a spin immediately after takeoff from Runway 17 at Aero Valley; the ensuing crash kills both pilots and destroys the airplane. The post-crash investigation {{reveals that the}} <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat</b> was not securely locked in place, and uncovers evidence that the seat traveled to the extreme aft position prior to the crash, likely causing the student pilot to inadvertently pull up and thus provoke the stall. Examination of the wreckage reveals that the seat locking mechanism could be operated normally. The accident report cites the pilot's [...] "improper" [...] preflight inspection as a primary cause, as the unlocked seat evidently went unnoticed.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a nose-mounted, [...] Renault 4Pb, a four-cylinder, air-cooled, upright inline engine, though its mountings, part of the tubular {{fuselage}} structure, could accept engines with powers in the range [...] The exhaust was fitted with a silencer and its outlet was aft of the cabin. Fuel was held in two tanks in the wing centre-section and oil in the fuselage aft of the engine firewall. Its enclosed cabin, entered via centrally hinged, multi-part glazing, had two forward seats, equipped with dual controls, and a rear bench seat. It was normally flown from the <b>left-hand</b> <b>seat,</b> where the rudder bar was fitted with brake pedals. The flap lever was placed centrally. The fuselage was fabric covered apart from the engine area and the sloping fuselage roof and upper part aft of the cabin, which was covered with electron metal sheet.|$|E
