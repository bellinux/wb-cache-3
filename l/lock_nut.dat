50|$|Further {{investigations}} by the HSE {{found that}} heavy and constant vibrations on the stretcher bars and their bolts caused them {{in turn to}} vibrate and oscillate until their nuts literally fell off the bolts. These have since been replaced by two-part <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> instead of the main <b>nuts</b> having half-size <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> to hold them in place.|$|R

50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of <b>nuts.</b> Only one <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|R

50|$|Headset {{wrenches}} are oversized (32 - 36 mm) flat open-end wrenches for tightening headset {{cups and}} lock nuts on threaded steering tubes. May {{be designed to}} contact 7 sides of an 8 sided (8-point) <b>lock</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} types of headset distinguishable {{by the way the}} bearings are held in place (with a <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> or with a clamping stem), or by where they are located (inside or outside the head tube).|$|E

50|$|The Presta valve (also called Sclaverand valve or French valve) is a valve {{commonly}} found in high pressure road style and some mountain bicycle inner tubes. It comprises an outer valve stem and an inner valve body. A <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> to secure the stem at the wheel rim and a valve cap may also be present.|$|E
50|$|Somewhat counterintuitively, {{the term}} {{threadless}} derives not from whether the stem itself is threaded, but from whether a headset <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> threads onto the fork steer tube. Quill stems require a threaded headset of specific length for each bicycle model. Threadless stems require an unthreaded steerer tube, which may vary in length for each bicycle model.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide a cable stop for front {{cantilever}} brakes or centerpull brakes, a hanger may {{be incorporated into the}} headset, either as part of the washer between the top race and the <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> in the case of threaded headsets, or as part of a spacer between the top race and the stem in the case of threadless headsets.|$|E
5000|$|Another type is a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|R
50|$|Aerotight is a tradename for a {{specific}} type of split beam nut. Other names for this type of nut are stiff nut and Allmetal self <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|The RGX 621D had a Yamaha height-adjustable <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> This allowed {{players to}} {{customize}} {{the action and}} feel of their guitar based on playing style and string gauge preference.|$|R
50|$|A locknut, {{also known}} as a <b>lock</b> <b>nut,</b> locking nut, {{prevailing}} torque nut, stiff nut or elastic stop nut, is a nut that resists loosening under vibrations and torque. Elastic stop nuts and prevailing torque nuts are of the particular type where some portion of the nut deforms elastically to provide a locking action. The first type used fiber instead of nylon and was invented in 1931.|$|E
5000|$|The final Report on the {{investigation}} of the incident was published (only in German) on 21 March 2006 by the Air Accident Investigation Board (Flugunfalluntersuchungsstelle) of the Austrian Federal Office for Transport (Bundesanstalt für Verkehr, BAV). [...] The Report identified the cause of the failure of landing gear retraction as a minor oversight during maintenance; an inadequately secured <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> allowed a screw to gradually turn, eventually leading to a 10 mm adjustment error that prevented complete retraction.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though a}} {{determined}} thief could eventually defeat the skewer's <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> {{by using a}} power tool, e.g. by grinding a screwdriver slot into it or simply cutting it off, locking skewers provide convenient protection against theft of bicycle parts in areas where locked bicycles should not be left unattended {{for long periods of}} time. The highest quality products currently found on the market use stainless steel to avoid a number of disadvantages presented by carbon steel and aluminum including corrosion (rust) and damage to the locking mechanism's unique key indentations caused by key slip-out.|$|E
50|$|Center <b>lock</b> <b>nuts</b> {{are similar}} to {{elliptical}} offset nuts, except that they are distorted {{in the middle of}} the nut. This allows the nut to be started from either side.|$|R
50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> clamps the strings behind a plastic nut, as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the jack socket is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|R
50|$|V2 - Introduced in 2000, {{discontinued}} 2002. Has a side jack, back-routed control cavity, reverse headstock, licensed Floyd Rose bridge, bolt-on 24 fret neck, and a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> Versions were HH, HSS, HSH. These 2-octave {{models were}} made in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587), and Purple Metallic (593). The V2 models also offered HH 7-string versions. The 7 string version came in two models: a Floyd Rose bridge with <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> (7FR) and a hard tail fixed bridge (7HT) with a regular nut. The 7 string models came in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587) and Purple Metallic (593). All came with black hardware.|$|R
50|$|The revolutionary Y-shaped steel chassis had a {{backbone}} {{that divided}} around {{the engine and}} gearbox, and was very light. The suspension was independent all round, making a first for MG and possibly the British motor industry, and used wishbones and longitudinal torsion bars allowing {{a large amount of}} wheel travel to allow for the poor surfaces on many of the contemporary racing circuits, especially Brooklands. Lever arm hydraulic shock absorbers were used. The brakes were cable-operated using 12-inch (305 mm) drums and the wheels were wire spoked and secured by a centre <b>lock</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|E
50|$|While bolts {{are commonplace}} in rock and gym {{climbing}} {{there is no}} universal vocabulary to describe them. Generally, a bolt hanger or a fixed hanger {{is a combination of}} a fixed bolt and a specialized stainless steel hanger designed to accept a carabiner, whereas in certain regions a bolt runner or a carrot describes a hangerless bolt (where the climber must provide their own hanger bracket and sometimes <b>lock</b> <b>nut).</b> A ring bolt has a loop on one end so it presents as a U-shape embedded in the wall.|$|E
50|$|A {{panel nut}} is very thin nut with a {{relatively}} large hole commonly used to mount threaded electrical switches.These are often used where light duty precision fasteners are needed. They have width close to {{the diameter of the}} fastener they secure. These usually have low thread count. They are of two types hexagonal panel nut and knurled round panel nut.Applications : Panel nuts are used in potentiometer control, light weight <b>lock</b> <b>nut,</b> switch hardware.Material :Brass, stainless steel, aluminium are the materials commonly used for this nut. Panel Nut Wrench: It is a double ended tube socket type tool for removing nuts.|$|E
50|$|Shave-horses are {{commonly}} workshop-made by their user and entirely wooden, though modern screws, washers, metal sleeves and threaded bolts with <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> {{are a very}} welcome and practical innovation, allowing re-tightening or capability to be knocked-down as necessary.|$|R
50|$|Wheel {{steering}} is standard. The pedestal {{system is}} cable-linked with the radial driver being {{connected to the}} rudder post by a keyway and <b>lock</b> <b>nuts.</b> Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{the same}} with 24-fret necks. I put money into a company because I couldn't get guitars built the way I wanted them. I had to prove it to the manufacturers. So I put money into John Birch guitars, and he built my guitars. I had to prove it worked. All of this was done by experimenting and trial and error. I paid for that myself {{in the early days}} to show it could be done. And I paid for all these {{companies}} to get the benefits nowadays. Back then they all said it couldn't be done. I also used <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> years and years ago without a tremolo, before <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> were the norm." [...] Tony Iommi ...|$|R
50|$|Like {{threadless}} headsets, threaded headsets {{can also}} be internal. Under the internal design, the races and cones are embedded into the head tube, creating a tidy, streamlined appearance. No component is visible between the fork crown and head tube except for perhaps a plastic ring, and only the locknut protrudes {{from the top of}} the head tube. In the image shown of the 2016 Brodie Quantum's steering assembly, the <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> is hidden from view by a plastic cover. The widened top and bottom sections of the head tube contain the bearings. A quill stem inserts into the steering tube.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the front}} {{anti-dive}} geometry which was introduded on the Lotus 31, and the rear anti-squat geometry with unparallel radius arms (that counters the rear camber and toe-in reductions under braking) which was introduced with the 41C, were fully developed on the 41X (which had multiple suspension arm attachment points), and the setup {{found to be}} the best is incorporated into the 59 frame. While the 59 used Triumph Herald front uprights, the 59B used the Formula Two version Lotus 41X uprights and brakes shared with Lotus 47A. Hubs and wheels were knock-off type with spin-on central <b>lock</b> <b>nut,</b> except for the Formula Ford version, which had the Ford production 4 lugnut configuration as per the formula.|$|E
50|$|Box {{connectors}} join conduit to a {{junction box}} or other electrical box. A typical box connector is inserted into a knockout in a junction box, with the threaded end then being secured with a ring (called a <b>lock</b> <b>nut)</b> {{from within the}} box, as a bolt would be secured by a nut. The {{other end of the}} fitting usually has a screw or compression ring which is tightened down onto the inserted conduit. Fittings for non-threaded conduits are either secured with set screws or with a compression nut that encircles the conduit. Fittings for general purpose use with metal conduits may be made of die-cast zinc, but where stronger fittings are needed, they are made of copper-free aluminum or cast iron.|$|E
5000|$|Ibanez Fixed Edge {{while it}} still uses the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> and <b>locking</b> bridge, it was mounted {{on top of}} the body, and was used not as a vibrato system, but to provide a {{familiar}} feel to vibrato users, and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar.|$|R
50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{apply the}} Junker Test {{to determine the}} point at which fastener securing elements - such as <b>lock</b> <b>nuts,</b> wedges and <b>lock</b> washers - fail when subjected to vibration. The data collected by the test enables design engineers to specify fasteners that will perform under a wide range of conditions without loosening.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the MTM2, the MTM20 has a {{mahogany}} body, 5pc Maple and Walnut bolt on neck, <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> FX Edge III bridge, and the Duncan Designed active pickups. However the 'seven' inlays normally {{featured on}} higher end models was present. The MTM20 comes only in white with black binding. The MTM20 also featured a volute on the headstock.|$|R
