5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including {{the lights on the}} stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> the base of Millennium Force and 16 <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The state did not add traffic <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E

5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or flashing <b>lights,</b> <b>to</b> provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of a}} lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E
5|$|Spruance {{failed to}} regain contact with Yamamoto's forces on 5 June, despite {{extensive}} searches. Towards {{the end of}} the day he launched a search-and-destroy mission to seek out any remnants of Nagumo's carrier force. This late afternoon strike narrowly missed detecting Yamamoto's main body and failed to score hits on a straggling Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall, prompting Spruance to order Enterprise and Hornet to turn on their <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> aid the landings.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of SR-103, {{outside of the}} roadway renumbering, have received some technical changes as well. In November 1992, UDOT confirmed that the interchange of I-15 and SR-103 (exit 335) was to be given traffic <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> help monitor traffic. The mayor at the time, Neldon Hamblin, approved of the project, and put the project up for bids for construction. The interchange was holding up motorists needing to turn left up to 20 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> which they are attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique {{that is similar to}} winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|Echols {{recalled}} {{that the first}} scenes shot were those of Madonna walking down Lenox Avenue. While filming, the singer noticed a black leather coat with fur trim, worn by Fatima, the assistant director. Madonna asked for the coat from Fatima and ended up wearing it in the video. Echols also noted that Madonna had {{a close relationship with}} the cinematographer, and knew from which angle her shots would be the best and which <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> be used. After the misunderstandings regarding looks and the plot direction were cleared, the filming resumed and was finished within three days. The final scenes were with model Jason Olive in a Marlem house, with Madonna climbing steps and reaching him and their supposed child.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking <b>lights,</b> <b>to</b> suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
50|$|Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) {{has succeeded}} in {{developing}} a transparent solar cell that uses ultraviolet (UV) <b>light</b> <b>to</b> generate electricity but allows visible <b>light</b> <b>to</b> pass through it. Most conventional solar cells use visible and infrared <b>light</b> <b>to</b> generate electricity. Used to replace conventional window glass, the installation surface area could be large, leading to potential uses that {{take advantage of the}} combined functions of power generation, lighting and temperature control.|$|R

5|$|The Cubs paid Bresnahan for the {{remaining}} two years on his contract and aided Bresnahan in purchasing the Toledo Mud Hens, then in the American Association, in 1916. The club had moved to Cleveland to block the Federal League from placing a team there, but returned to Toledo under Bresnahan's control. Bresnahan played for the team until 1918, when he announced his retirement. He played for a semi-professional team in 1919, and appeared in five games for the Mud Hens in 1921. Bresnahan worked to add <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> Toledo's stadium, {{so that they could}} play night games.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire station}} {{contained}} flats for 32 firemen {{and their families}} and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street <b>lights.</b> <b>To</b> clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|Fluorescent {{lighting}} converts ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>to</b> visible <b>light.</b> In order <b>to</b> produce ultraviolet <b>light,</b> electrons {{flow through}} the fluorescent lamp and collide with mercury atoms. The collision with mercury causes photons of UV <b>light</b> <b>to</b> be released; the UV light is then converted <b>to</b> visible <b>light</b> as it passes through the phosphor coating in the glass tube.|$|R

25|$|The diaphaneity of {{a mineral}} {{describes}} {{the ability of}} <b>light</b> <b>to</b> pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through it. An {{example of such a}} mineral is muscovite (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some <b>light</b> <b>to</b> pass, but less than those that are transparent. Jadeite and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow <b>light</b> <b>to</b> pass are called opaque.|$|R
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, it {{received}} positive reviews from music critics. Some complimented the composition, noting {{a departure from}} her previous J-pop influenced music, and commended the songwriting. Commercially, the song fared better in Japan than her previous releases, peaking at number 47 on the Oricon Singles Chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Nozomi Tanaka, which featured Chisuga in a large aquarium surrounded by bright <b>lights.</b> <b>To</b> promote the single, Chisuga appeared on radio stations throughout Japan including Rajira Sunday and Hiroshi Kamiya's All Night, and {{was used as the}} closing theme song for the second season of Japanese anime television series, The Asterisk War.|$|E
5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the faults lay in Siemen's 1992 take-over of MaK, in which {{a large number of}} veteran employees, who had the necessary competence to build diesel-locomotives, were retired. In 1998, Siemens sold the Kiel facilities to Vossloh. Following the return to Germany, the locomotives were modified to meet German standards and designed ME26. They were made narrower by removing outside stairs and railings, and moving <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> meet International Union of Railways standards. There were also changes to the cab walls, with internal railings added and the toilets removed. The speed was also reduced to , although this has later been reverted. Number 664 was rebuilt in Kiel, but {{because of the lack of}} capacity at MaK, the remaining units were rebuilt by DSB in Copenhagen. After the upgrades, ownership was transferred to Dispolok, a leasing pool originally owned by Siemens.|$|E

40|$|Summary In {{recent years}} {{electronics}} {{has had an}} impact on almost every aspect of lamps and lighting from escape <b>lighting</b> <b>to</b> son et lumi&egrave;re, from reduction of gear losses to reduction of flicker, from tunnel <b>lighting</b> <b>to</b> theatre <b>lighting,</b> from automobile <b>lighting</b> <b>to</b> automation of lamp making machinery. Electronics is helping safety with hazard warning lights, automatically compensated tunnel lighting and measuring equipment <b>to</b> correlate street <b>lighting</b> with road accidents. The use of electronic ignitors to start high intensity discharge lamps assists energy conservation and reduces the material content of the control gear while invertor operated fluorescent tubes for transport <b>lighting</b> has <b>to</b> meet stringent requirements on transients. ...|$|R

5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with <b>lights,</b> <b>to</b> film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
