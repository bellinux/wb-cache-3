5|$|Later in the 1960s {{and into}} the 1970s, locally {{prominent}} bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period {{has been called the}} Normaltown River of Music, and included long-time local performers like Mad Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett, many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen's Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. Allen's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> Resort (currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} small walls to climb, {{but they may}} all be outflanked {{on the right side}} if the {{conditions}} are good. From the Western summit the flank seems nearly as forbidding as the wall itself, but at a close distance it is not too difficult and no equipment should be necessary. However, on poor conditions, the Talus may be very loose and great caution is advised. On days with fresh snow, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> picture, equipment will probably be necessary on all routes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first series}} of rand {{banknotes}} {{was introduced in}} 1961 in denominations of 1, 2, 10, and 20 rand, with similar designs and colours to the preceding pound notes to ease the transition. They bore the image of what was believed {{at the time to}} be Jan van Riebeeck, the first V.O.C. administrator of Cape Town. It was later discovered that the image was not in fact Van Riebeeck at all. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> pound notes, they were printed in two variants, one with English written first and the other with Afrikaans written first. This practice was continued in the 1966 series which included the first 5-rand notes, but did not include the 20-rand denomination.|$|E

However, Imogen (having this time lost her nerve completely and left a cafe abruptly) returns early and catching him watching the video, much to her disgust. The following day, Stewart returns the video to Charlotte, again dropping compliments, he tries to kiss her, but Charlotte backs away, so Stewart leaves in guilt.|$|E

25|$|Antony's {{reluctance}} {{to deal with}} his cousin was either because he was unwilling or that he was incapable of achieving the task. His {{reluctance to}} deal with his cousin greatly angered the Capitán-Pasha because he was causing much damage to Ottoman lands in Laconia and Messenia. To teach Antony a lesson the Capitán-Pasha descended upon Gytheio with a larger force of Muslim Albanians than in 1803 and ravaged the surrounding country. He then started besieging Antony in his fort on Cranae. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time he blockaded Cranae from the sea with his fleet and bombarded the fort with his artillery. But Antony and his Maniots continued to fight bravely and they managed to hold off the Ottomans long enough for them to abandon the siege.|$|E
25|$|Unusually among basal sauropodomorphs, Xingxiulong {{has four}} sacral vertebrae. This is a trait {{typically}} seen in more derived sauropodomorphs, like Melanorosaurus, Leonerasaurus, Barapasaurus, and Shunosaurus. The {{first of these}} sacral vertebrae, the dorsosacral, is not very well-fused to the next sacral vertebra; neither is it entirely fused to the corresponding sacral rib on the transverse processes. Collectively, the dorsosacral and first pair of sacral ribs extend forward to contact the ilium. The second and third sacral vertebrae, the two primordial sacrals, {{are about the same}} length, and are well-fused to each other. Like other basal sauropodomorphs, the transverse processes of the third sacral vertebra project backwards and outwards. The same is true of the transverse process and sacral ribs for the fourth sacral vertebra, which contact the ilium again at the back. All of the neural spines are plate-like, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few dorsal vertebrae.|$|E

500|$|The Cello Concerto (1932) was Bax's {{first attempt}} at a {{full-scale}} conventional concerto. It calls for a smaller orchestra than he customarily employed, with no trombones or tuba, and no percussion apart from timpani. Foreman points to many subtleties of scoring, but notes that it has never ranked high among the composer's mature works. The Violin Concerto (1937–38) is, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> symphony, in a more relaxed vein than most of Bax's earlier music. Cardus singled it out as [...] "unusually fine", although Heifetz may have felt it not virtuosic enough. The composer described it as in the romantic tradition of Joachim Raff.|$|E

It's not one of those ones that you'll put it on and every song sounds <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> one. It's got everything from anthems to more radio friendly stuff to hard-hitting thrash and some cool, dark-sounding stuff." [...] In a later interview, Broderick again touted the sonic diversity of the album, noting that it is [...] "like a cut in time from each CD of the past Megadeth discography".|$|E
500|$|On November 26, 2002, {{the group}} {{released}} its second album, Does This Look Infected? The special edition {{came with a}} DVD, Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's.

[...] The album featured a harder and edgier sound, and the lyrics featured a more serious outlook. The album peaked at No.32 on the Billboard 200 chart and at No.8 on the Top Canadian Albums chart. The album was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States, but was not as successful as its predecessor.|$|E
