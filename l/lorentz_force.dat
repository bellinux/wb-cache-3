5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The <b>Lorentz</b> <b>force</b> resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a Unipolar generator. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the <b>Lorentz</b> <b>force,</b> which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the electrical circuit is closed through it. A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting <b>Lorentz</b> <b>force</b> accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the <b>Lorentz</b> <b>force</b> that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E

5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the <b>Lorentz</b> <b>force</b> law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of large, charged dust grains in turbulent giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in primarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated {{the dynamics of}} neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of GMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~ 1000 on small scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar abundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral gas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and <b>Lorentz</b> <b>forces</b> are non-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the effects of <b>Lorentz</b> <b>forces</b> on charged grains (in addition to drag).
