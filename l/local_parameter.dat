40|$|Abstract A data {{smoothing}} method is described where the roughness penalty de-pends on a parameter {{that must be}} estimated from the data. Three levels of parameters {{are involved in this}} situation: <b>Local</b> <b>parameters</b> are the coefficients of the basis function expansion defining the smooth, global parameters define low-dimensional trend and the roughness penalty, and a complexity parameter controls the amount of roughness in the smooth. By defining <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> as regularized functions of global param-eters, and global parameters in turn as functions of complexity parameter, we define a parameter cascade, and show that the accompanying multi-criterion optimization problem leads to good estimates of all levels of parameters and their precisions. The approach is illustrated with real and simulated data, and this application is a prototype {{for a wide range of}} problems involving nuisance or <b>local</b> <b>parameters...</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the usual}} local fields (typically {{completions}} of number fields or the quotient fields of local rings of algebraic curves) {{there is a}} unique surjective discrete valuation (of rank 1) associated to a choice of a <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> of the fields, unless they are archimedean local fields such as the real numbers and complex numbers. Similarly, there is a discrete valuation of rank n on almost all n-dimensional local fields, associated to a choice of n local parameters of the field. In contrast to one-dimensional local fields, higher local fields have a sequence of residue fields. There are different integral structures on higher local fields, depending how many residue fields information one wants to take into account.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{geometry}} of complex algebraic curves, a <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> for a curve C at a smooth point P is just a meromorphic function on C that has a simple zero at P. This concept can be generalized to curves defined over fields other than [...] (or even schemes), because the local ring at a smooth point P of an algebraic curve C (defined over an algebraically closed field) is always a discrete valuation ring. This valuation will endow us {{with a way to}} count the order (at the point P) of rational functions (which are natural generalizations for meromorphic functions in the non-complex realm) having a zero or a pole at P.|$|E
50|$|A {{gauge theory}} {{is a theory}} that admits a {{symmetry}} with a <b>local</b> <b>parameter.</b> For example, in every quantum theory, the global phase of the wave function is arbitrary and does not represent something physical. Consequently, the theory is invariant under a global change of phases (adding a constant to the phase of all wave functions, everywhere); this is a global symmetry. In quantum electrodynamics, the theory is also invariant under a local change of phase, that is - one may shift the phase of all wave functions so that the shift may be different at every point in space-time. This is a local symmetry. However, {{in order for a}} well-defined derivative operator to exist, one must introduce a new field, the gauge field, which also transforms in order for the local change of variables (the phase in our example) not to affect the derivative. In quantum electrodynamics, this gauge field is the electromagnetic field. The change of local gauge of variables is termed gauge transformation.|$|E

40|$|Arteries {{respond to}} changes in global {{mechanical}} parameters (pressure, flow rate, and longitudinal stretching) by remodeling to restore <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> (circumferential stress, shear stress, and axial strain) to baseline levels. Because a change in a single global parameter results in changes of multiple <b>local</b> <b>parameters,</b> the effects of individual <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> on remodeling remain unknown. This study uses a novel approach to study remodeling in organ culture based on independent control of <b>local</b> mechanical <b>parameters.</b> The approach is illustrated by studying the effects of circumferential and shear stress on remodeling-related biological markers. Porcine carotid arteries were cultured for three days at a circumferential stress of 50 kPa or 150 kPa or, in separate experiments, a shear stress of 0. 75 Pa or 2. 25 Pa. At high circumferential stress, matrix synthesis, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and cell death are significantly greater, but matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and pro-MMP- 2 activity are significantly less. In contrast, biological markers measured were unaffected by shear stress. Applications of the proposed approach for improved understanding of remodeling, optimizing mechanical conditioning of tissue engineered arteries, and selection of experimentally motivated growth laws are discussed.

40|$|The authors study {{velocity}} {{profiles of}} turbulent fluid flows, if their cross sections have different shapes. The research {{is performed using}} the Karman constant value equal to 0. 4 and a <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> of the variable along the velocity profile. An experimentally obtained value of the Karman constant is treated as an integral parameter describing the inclination angle of the velocity profile being constant within the turbulent flow core. In turn, the <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> describes the local inclination angle of the velocity profile. The authors demonstrate that the <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> calculated {{on the basis of}} maximal and average flow velocities does not relate to the Karman constant, and therefore, it cannotbe used for its validation. The local coefficient can be considered as a supplementary characteristic of the turbulent flow profile. The <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> and its distribution over the cross section of the flow can be used to clarify the law of resistance, obtained by using the assumption that the Karman constant value is equal to 0. 4. Availability {{of the value of the}} <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> distribution over the cross section of the flow may be used to clarify the alteration pattern of the turbulent structure of the flow.

Whereas {H_ 1 ^per, S_z} and {H_ 1 ^per, C_z(i,j)} are both sloppy quantum simulation models, the influential CPD for the former is much simpler in form - its form remains invariant across the phase diagram and with varying temperature. An immediate consequence is that if the goal of a quantum simulation of the 1 D-TFIM is to characterize the phase diagram and the phase transition, one should utilize the transverse magnetization as an experimental observable as opposed to correlation functions since the former is more robust to independent <b>local</b> <b>parameter</b> fluctuations.

40|$|International audienceRandom {{uncertainties}} in {{finite element}} models in linear structural dynamics are usually modeled by using parametric models. This means that: (1) the uncertain <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> occurring in the global mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the finite element model have to he identified; (2) appropriate probabilistic models of these uncertain parameters have to be constructed; and (3) functions mapping the domains of uncertain parameters into the global mass, damping and stiffness matrices have to be constructed. In the low-frequency range, a reduced matrix model can then be constructed using the generalized coordinates associated with the structural modes corresponding to the lowest eigenfrequencies. In this paper we propose an approach for constructing a random uncertainties model of the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model does not require identifying the uncertain <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> and consequently, obviates construction of functions that map the domains of uncertain <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> into the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model of random uncertainties is based on direct construction of a probabilistic model of the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices, which uses only the available information constituted of the mean value of the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices. This paper describes the explicit construction {{of the theory of}} such a nonparametric model...|$|R

The corresponding curves with a shape parameter α, defined by the introduced base functions, include the B-spline curves and can approximate the B-spline curves from both sides. The curves can be adjusted easily by using the shape parameter α, where dpi(α,t) is linear with respect to dα for the fixed t. With the shape parameter chosen properly, the defined curves can be used to precisely represent straight line segments, parabola segments, circular arcs and some tran-scendental curves, and the corresponding tensor product surfaces can also represent spherical surfaces, cylindrical surfaces and some transcendental surfaces exactly. By abandoning positive property, this paper proposes a new C 2 continuous blended inter-polation spline based on piecewise trigonometric polynomials associated with a sequence of <b>local</b> <b>parameters.</b> Illustration showed that the curves and surfaces constructed by the blended spline can be adjusted easily and freely. The blended interpolation spline curves can be shape-preserving with proper <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> since these <b>local</b> <b>parameters</b> can be considered to be the magnifica-tion ratio to the length of tangent vectors at the interpolating points.
