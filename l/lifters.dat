25|$|The Rebel's engine also {{differed}} from the 327s installed in the 1957 Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models because it used mechanical valve <b>lifters</b> and a higher compression ratio. Since both engines were rated at 255hp, {{it is probable that}} the Rebel's was underrated.|$|E
5000|$|One {{approach}} is to use an identical <b>lifter</b> to the ones being installed {{that has been made}} [...] "solid". Making a <b>lifter</b> solid is a process where the <b>lifter</b> piston is prevented from moving - this can be done with small welds made to the <b>lifter,</b> or by dis-assembling the <b>lifter,</b> removing the internal spring, and installing washers to take up the space and prevent the <b>lifter</b> piston from compressing. Some <b>lifter</b> manufacturers also sell solid versions of the hydraulic <b>lifter</b> being installed.|$|R
50|$|Oil under {{constant}} pressure is supplied to the <b>lifter</b> via an oil channel, {{through a small}} hole in the <b>lifter</b> body. When the engine valve is closed (<b>lifter</b> in a neutral position), the <b>lifter</b> is free to fill with oil. As the camshaft lobe enters the lift phase of its travel, it compresses the <b>lifter</b> piston, and a valve shuts the oil inlet. Oil is nearly incompressible, so this greater pressure renders the <b>lifter</b> effectively solid during the lift phase.|$|R

25|$|The rockers or cam {{followers}} sometimes incorporate {{a mechanism to}} adjust the valve lash through manual adjustment, but most modern auto engines have hydraulic <b>lifters,</b> eliminating the need to adjust the valve lash at regular intervals as the valvetrain wears, in particular the valves and valve seats in the combustion chamber.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lifter</b> - Using tactics {{similar to}} a wedge, the <b>lifter</b> uses a powered arm, prow, or {{platform}} to get underneath the opponent and lift {{it away from the}} arena surface to remove its maneuverability. The <b>lifter</b> may then push the other robot toward arena hazards or attempt to toss the opponent onto its back. The <b>lifter</b> is typically powered by either an electric or pneumatic actuator. Two-time US Robot Wars and four-time BattleBots heavyweight champion Biohazard was an electric <b>lifter.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the path of a ball on the inside of a ball mill for <b>lifter</b> bars with rounded or worn profiles. The model predicts the response of a single ball with particular reference to the balls trajectory after departure from the <b>lifter</b> bar and incorporates the effect of friction, mill rotational speed, <b>lifter</b> height as well as different <b>lifter</b> bar profiles. The out of plane travel of the particles are ignored and hence the system is reduced to a two dimensional problem. A set of experiments were performed on a model perspex mill in order to obtain data by which the theory could be compared. The <b>lifter</b> bar is analysed using a parabolic expression which allows the shape to be changed to model various stages oflifter wear. Two possible formulations are investigated in determining the motion of the particle on the <b>lifter</b> bar. The first formulation assumes the ball to roll on the <b>lifter</b> bar until a limiting friction is reached after which the ball will slide along the <b>lifter.</b> The second formulation considers the ball to have a pure sliding motion on the <b>lifter...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc {{countries such as}} East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight <b>lifters.</b> In response {{to the success of}} Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. Ziegler's work resulted in the production of methandrostenolone, which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight <b>lifters.</b> Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.|$|E
25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} poppet valves {{driven by}} pushrods and <b>lifters</b> on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances.|$|E

50|$|As the {{camshaft}} lobe travels through its apex, the load is reduced on the <b>lifter</b> piston, {{and the internal}} spring returns the piston to its neutral state so the <b>lifter</b> can refill with oil.

50|$|The lift {{starts with}} the <b>lifter</b> {{standing}} erect and the bar loaded with weights resting on the <b>lifter's</b> shoulders. At the referee's command the lift begins. The <b>lifter</b> creates {{a break in the}} hips, bends his knees and drops into a squatting position with the hip crease (the top surface of the leg at the hip crease) below the top of the knee. The <b>lifter</b> then returns to an erect position. At the referee's command the bar is returned to the rack and the lift is completed.|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to examine the types of materials to be used while handling the collection. If collection objects are to be moved, the use of flatbeds, carts, dollies, or pallet <b>lifters</b> may be warranted, with these objects being dubbed structurally sound prior to use. Tote pans or support trays are sometimes used for smaller objects, and liners such as polyethylene foam pads, quilted furniture pads, and acid-free tissue are commonly used as an added layer of protection. When necessary, handlers may also don lab coats, safety glasses, dust masks, or respirators.|$|E

25|$|On 15 June 2016, it was {{announced}} that four London 2012 Olympic weightlifting champions have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. They include Kazakhstan's Ilya Ilyin (94kg), Zulfiya Chinshanlo (53kg), Maiya Maneza (63kg) and Svetlana Podobedova (75kg). If confirmed, Kazakhstan would drop from 12th to 23rd in the 2012 medal standings. Six other <b>lifters</b> who competed at the 2012 Games also tested positive after hundreds of samples were reanalysed. Among them are Russia's Apti Aukhadov (silver at 85kg), Ukraine's Yuliya Kalina (bronze at 58kg), Belarusian Maryna Shkermankova (bronze at 69kg), Azerbaijan's Boyanka Kostova and Belarus duo Dzina Sazanavets and Yauheni Zharnasek. On 27 July 2016, IWF has reported in the second wave of re-sampling that three silver medalists from Russia, namely Natalia Zabolotnaya (at 75kg), Aleksandr Ivanov (at 94kg) and Svetlana Tsarukayeva (at 63kg), together with bronze medalists Armenian Hripsime Khurshudyan (at 75+ kg), Belarusian Iryna Kulesha (at 75kg) and Moldovan Cristina Iovu (at 53kg) have tested positive for steroid dehydrochlormethyltestosterone.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to the}} {{question}} as to where these pods should be located. An obvious solution would be to load them into the aircraft's huge fuselage. However, this would require the nose or tail to open, adding some complexity. It was noticed early on that it could be loaded much faster if the cargo was placed under the wings instead; the cargo containers could be driven up to either side of the aircraft at the same time. As soon as this was considered another major advantage became clear; by locating the pods closer to the landing gear, the total amount of cargo that could be carried was dramatically increased. This allowed the gear to be placed on the wings as on traditional designs, instead of the complex fuselage-mounted systems normally found on heavy <b>lifters.</b> This led to a further modification by placing two sets of gear on either side of each cargo pod, for a total of eight sets of main landing gear, further spreading out the loads.|$|E

500|$|Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave a warm review, {{calling it}} [...] "inspired" [...] and {{comparing}} {{the work to}} other successful recent Broadway musicals: [...] "Like The Full Monty (choreographed by Mr. Mitchell) and Billy Elliot the Musical, it {{is set in a}} hard-times British factory town, where jobs are in jeopardy and spirits need lifting. Like La Cage aux Folles and Priscilla Queen of the Desert, it presents drag queens as the show’s official spirit <b>lifters.</b> And like Hairspray, the musical this production most resembles in tone, Kinky Boots is about finding your passion, overcoming prejudice and transcending stereotypes." [...] Brantley wrote that Lauper's [...] "love- and heat-seeking score" [...] wowed with her [...] "trademark ... mix of sentimentality and eccentricity", and that the costumes and boots courtesy of Gregg Barnes made for [...] "big red scene stealers". He also praised “Raise You Up/Just Be,” as [...] "one of the best curtain numbers since 'You Can’t Stop the Beat' sent Hairspray audiences dancing out of the theater.” Brantley, however, did not extend his praise to Fierstein's script, writing that his [...] "sticky, sermonizing side" [...] comes through in the second half, where [...] "all the clichés stand naked before you." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the end of the Vietnam War, the Hercules {{continued}} to take part in military exercises and support overseas peacekeeping commitments. They also became well known in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following natural disasters, including tsunami in New Guinea, cyclones in the Solomon Islands and Tonga, and fires and floods in Australia. The Hercules played a significant part in the evacuation of civilians following Cyclone Tracy in 1974–75; a No.37 Squadron C-130E was the first aircraft to touch down in Darwin following the disaster. Eight of No.36 Squadron's aircraft were involved in the relief effort, flying over 550hours, and carrying 2,864passengers and almost 800,000lbs of cargo, while No.37 Squadron contributed 11aircraft, flying 700hours, and carrying 4,400 passengers and 1,300,000lbs of cargo. [...] On 19January 1978 a C-130E returning to Australia from Butterworth was used to intercept a drug-smuggling aircraft near Darwin; the smuggler eventually landed at Katherine, and was arrested. After clocking up 147,000accident-free flying hours over the course of 20years, No.36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced in 1978 by C-130H models. The C-130Hs were primarily used as tactical air <b>lifters</b> throughout their service with the RAAF, and worked closely with the Army's special forces units.|$|E
2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the cam follower which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve <b>lifters</b> slightly domed, causing the <b>lifters</b> to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new <b>lifters</b> on an old cam but never old <b>lifters</b> on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|E
50|$|After {{several years}} out of print, all of the {{original}} <b>Lifter</b> Puller records were re-issued digitally with bonus tracks in December 2009. These reissues were accompanied by a limited-edition book entitled <b>Lifter</b> Puller vs. The End of.|$|R
50|$|Small ape indices {{can also}} be beneficial. For example, in the bench press, a <b>lifter</b> with shorter arms must move the weight a shorter {{distance}} to complete the lift when compared to a <b>lifter</b> with longer arms, so the smaller-indexed <b>lifter</b> does less total work to bench press the same weight. In contrast, long arms are an advantage in the Deadlift, where longer arms reduce the range of motion required to complete the lift.|$|R
