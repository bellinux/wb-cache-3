40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{artificial}} <b>landmark</b> model and a robust <b>landmark</b> tracking algorithm for mobile robot localization. The <b>landmark</b> model, consisting of symmetric and repetitive color patches, produces color histograms that are invariant under the geometric and photometric distortions. A stochastic approach {{based on the}} CONDENSATION tracks the <b>landmark</b> model robustly even under the varying illumination conditions. After the <b>landmark</b> detection, relative position of the mobile robot to the <b>landmark</b> is calculated. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed <b>landmark</b> model is effective and can be detected and tracked in a cluttered scene robustly. The tracked single <b>landmark</b> is enough to determine the position of the robot. Copyright © 2001 IFA...|$|R
