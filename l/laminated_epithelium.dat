30|$|Histological {{examination}} of animal skin on day 21 after CrHFC application showed {{a reduction in}} the area and depth of the burns compared to the control (Fig.  3). Formed granulation tissue was moderately infiltrated by lymphocytes. There was determined a young connective tissue on the border with the area of wound defect that had an unordered collagen and elastic fibers among which quite a big number of fibroblast-like cells was located. A <b>laminated</b> <b>epithelium</b> was growing from the edges of the wound and began to differentiate into layers. The epithelium exfoliated and eliminated only in separate minor areas {{in the center of the}} wounds. Immune fluorescence of type I collagen was intense and covered 52.06 [*]±[*] 11.12  % of the specimens. The areas of type III collagen positive fluorescence occupied 23.63 [*]±[*] 8.61  % and were intense along the edges of the specimens. The ratio of collagen type I/III was 2.2. In general, this research group showed a more active course of regenerative processes than the control group.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the cell-cell interactions {{necessary for the}} formation of retinal layers, we cultured dissociated zebrafish retinal progenitors in agarose microwells. Within these wells, the cells re-aggregated within hours, forming tight retinal organoids. Using a Spectrum of Fates zebrafish line, in which all different types of retinal neurons show distinct fluorescent spectra, we found that by 48 h in culture, the retinal organoids acquire a distinct spatial organisation, i. e. they became coarsely but clearly <b>laminated.</b> Retinal pigment <b>epithelium</b> cells were in the centre, photoreceptors and bipolar cells were next most central and amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells were on the outside. Image analysis allowed us to derive quantitative measures of lamination, which we then used to find that Müller glia, but not RPE cells, are essential for this process.
