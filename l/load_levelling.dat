However, in such an approach the chronological information between individual hours is lost. In this paper we propose a novel approach to power system models which constitutes an alternative to the traditional <b>load</b> <b>levels.</b> In particular, we introduce the concept of system states as opposed to <b>load</b> <b>levels,</b> which allows us to better incorporate chronological information in power system models thereby resulting in a more accurate representation of system outcomes such as electricity prices and total cost. Moreover, the system states can be defined taking into account various important system features at once, as opposed to <b>load</b> <b>levels</b> which are defined using just one specific feature, i. e., demand or net demand. Therefore the system states approach better captures other results such as reserve prices, which are not driven by the usual feature used to define <b>load</b> <b>levels.</b> In a case study we compare the newly proposed methodology to a standard <b>load</b> <b>level</b> approach, which validates that the system states approach better captures power system outcomes. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

However, the contribution of these systems in Malaysia is still minor in comparison with their potential. Therefore, the feasibility and potentiality of employing ice thermal storage (ITS) systems for office building cooling applications is studied to investigate their economical and environmental benefits. The air conditioning systems in Malaysia are considered as the major energy consumers in office buildings with around 57 share. The economical analysis of the cost benefits is carried out for a system including chiller and storage system. The installation costs are mainly dominated by the total system capacity; hence the study was conducted for a range of 100 - 2000 tons of refrigeration (TR) (352 - 7034 kW) for two storage strategy of full storage and <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> storage strategy. The results indicate that considering the special off-peak tariff rate of 0. 06 /kWh for the total system capacities of 500 and 1500 TR (1758 kW and 5275 kW), the annual cost saving varies from 230, 000 to 700, 000 and from 65, 000 to 190, 000 for full storage and <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> storage strategy, respectively. The overall results show that the full storage strategy can reduce the annual costs of the air conditioning system by up to 35 while this reduction is limited to around 8 for a <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> strategy. The comparison study reveals that for the full storage strategy the payback period varies between 3 and 6 years while the payback period for the <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> strategy varies between 1 and 3 years.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of air conditioning for indoor cooling in offices and large commercial buildings in Kuwait represents {{a major part of}} the power and electricity consumption in that country. The main objective of this research was to investigate ice and chilled water cool thermal storage technologies and operating strategies for air conditioning. This was motivated by the extreme climatic conditions in Kuwait and the necessity to reduce both maximum power demand and energy consumption whilst being economically feasible. This work represents the first such study undertaken. In Kuwait approximately 45 % of the total annual exported electrical energy is consumed solely by air conditioning systems as a result of the very high ambient temperatures occurring between March and October. Furthermore, it was estimated air conditioning systems represent about 62 % of the peak electrical load. To assess the potential of cool thermal storage, the air conditioning system for an existing clinic building, representing a typical medium size building in Kuwait, was designed with and without a cool thermal storage system. The results demonstrate that internal ice-on-coil and chilled water storage systems are suitable storage technologies that can be implemented in Kuwait. The cooling demand of the clinic building was first estimated using the ESP-r building energy simulation program, following which the different components in the air conditioning systems were sized including chiller, storage tanks, pumps, air handling units for conventional, ice and chilled water storage air conditioning systems operating with <b>load</b> <b>levelling,</b> 50 % demand limiting and full storage strategies. The heat gains by different auxiliary components in the air conditioning systems were estimated and the final cooling demand profiles were developed. For each air conditioning design, the power and energy consumption for the design day condition and over the whole year were calculated and analysed. Furthermore, the life cycle costs were determined based on the estimated capital, maintenance, operating costs and a financial analysis was carried out. For the Kuwaiti climate, the results demonstrate ice and chilled water storage systems can reduced the maximum power consumption during the day time when the electricity demand is high and largest reduction in the maximum power achieved full storage strategy. However, the energy consumption of ice storage system operating with 50 % demand limiting and full strategies were found were found to be higher than the conventional air conditioning system. Nevertheless, the energy consumption in the ice storage system with a <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> operating strategy was slightly lower. Chilled water storage system was found to be unlike ice storage system, the energy consumption in all operating strategies improved over the conventional system. Based on the estimated life cycle cost using the actual operating costs for both the government and user, it was established that for the government, ice storage operating with <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> strategy and all other strategies of the chilled water storage systems would be more economical than conventional systems. However, for the user, <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> ice storage, <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> chilled water storage, and 50 % demand limiting chilled water storage systems would be more cost effective. Out of all alternatives, chilled water storage system with a <b>load</b> <b>levelling</b> strategy was found to be the most cost effective for the climate of Kuwait and for similar climates of Kuwait. Although, the outcome from this research work can not be generalised however, the method of sizing and energy and economic analysis, which was discussed in this thesis can be generalised and followed to evaluate the impact of cool thermal storage systems on energy performance and economy of the air conditioning systems.
