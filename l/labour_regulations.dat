5|$|India's {{labour force}} is growing by 2.5% every year, but {{employment}} is growing only at 2.3% a year. Official unemployment exceeds 9%. Regulation and other obstacles have discouraged {{the emergence of}} formal businesses and jobs. Almost 30% of workers are casual workers who work only when {{they are able to}} get jobs and remain unpaid {{for the rest of the}} time. Only 10% of the workforce is in regular employment. India's <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> are heavy even by developing country standards and analysts have urged the government to abolish them.|$|E

The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of <b>labour</b> <b>regulations,</b> education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
40|$|Can soft {{regulatory}} {{approaches and}} {{corporate social responsibility}} ever be substitute methods for pursuing meaningfully across the globe violations of labour standards?

40|$|Abstract: The World Bank’s Doing Business survey {{seeks to}} measure and compare the costs to {{business}} of various types of <b>regulation,</b> including <b>labour</b> <b>regulation.</b> As such {{it is an important}} driver of labour market ‘reform’ globally and in South Africa. It may also be encouraging a tendency of different systems of regulation to converge. Focussing on <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> the study considers the validity of endeavours to measure <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and identifies a number of methodological problems that constrain any such endeavour. It then focuses specifically on the methodology utilised in the Doing Business survey, and its results for South Africa. It presents evidence that certain scores arrived at in the case of South Africa are incorrect, materially affecting South Africa’s ranking in terms of the survey. These errors can be attributed to shortcoming in the survey’s methodology as well as the simplistic conceptions of law reflected in the surveys. This finding does not imply endeavours to measure the costs of regulation are without value. Instead the study advocates developing different indicators to measure the impact of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and drawing on existing data and research to arrive at more objective results.

5|$|In {{taking his}} {{seat at the}} National Assembly in the Palais Bourbon {{alongside}} compatriots Ouezzin Coulibaly and Zinda Kaboré, Houphouët-Boigny had to first decide with which group to side, and he opted for the Mouvement Unifié de la Résistance (MUR), a small party composed of Communist sympathizers but not formal members of the Communist Party. He was appointed {{a member of the}} Commission des territoires d'outre-mer (Commission of Overseas Territories). During this time, he worked to implement the wishes of the SAA, in particular proposing a bill to abolish forced labor—the single most unpopular feature of French rule. The Assembly adopted this bill, known as Loi Houphouët-Boigny, on 11 April 1946, greatly enhancing the author's prestige not only in his country. On 3 April 1946, Houphouët-Boigny proposed to unify <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> in the territories of Africa; this would eventually be completed in 1952. Finally, on 27 September 1946, he filed a report on the public health system of overseas territories, calling for its reformation. Houphouët-Boigny in his parliamentary tenure supported the idea of a union of French territories.|$|E

25|$|There {{are plenty}} of causes {{that lead to the}} {{occurrence}} of this yet to be solved this global issue. Among them, globalisation is the main cause undeniably. Globalisation originally symbolises a worldwide trend that helps to balance the economy between developed and developing countries, however the unfair outsourcing attempts of manufacturing labour from rich to the poor countries have led to extreme poverty which is defined as living on less than US$1 a day. (Atal, 2015) Balko (2010) suggests that when the world markets are opened to free trade under globalisation, a phenomenon of “race to the bottom” happens. Sweatshop is an obvious example of such phenomenon. Without transnational guidelines and regulations, large corporations in developed countries are moving their manufacturing plants to the countries that are more vulnerable, such as with less environmental restrictions and lower labour standards. To meet the demands and compete for the patronage, factories in developing countries start to lower their <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> by providing minimum wages and ignoring workplace safety requirements. As a result, workers in developing countries face the hardship while the large corporations gain profit.|$|E
40|$|Even {{though the}} South African economy is {{formally}} categorised as an upper-middle income country, {{it has one}} of the highest unemployment rates in the world. The economy’s unemployment rate stands officially at 26. 7 per cent and 38. 8 per cent. This characteristic, more than any other, has placed market regulation high on the agenda of pertinent policy issues in South Africa. This paper, then, in trying to mature the debate on <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> and worker protection, has two key objectives. Firstly, we attempt to provide more nuanced and empirically-based measures of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> and worker protection for South Africa, within an international comparative context. Secondly, we attempt a legal overview of some of the key legislative and institutional challenges that exist within the South African labour market. We also attempt an overview of the evidence relating to the degree of actual and perceived rigidity within the South African labour market. The evidence utilised will hopefully add value to the debates thus far on the extent and nature of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in South Africa.

25|$|Unemployment in India is characterised by chronic (disguised) unemployment. Government {{schemes that}} target {{eradication}} of both poverty and unemployment – which {{in recent decades}} has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt {{to solve the problem}} by providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing skills, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decline in organised employment, due to the decreased role of the public sector after liberalisation, has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and created political pressure for further reforms. India's <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> are heavy, even by developing country standards, and analysts have urged the government to abolish or modify them {{in order to make the}} environment more conducive for employment generation. The 11th five-year plan has also identified the need for a congenial environment to be created for employment generation, by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic clearances required. Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system have been identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased employment opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.|$|E

40|$|This chapter has {{two main}} aims. First, {{it seeks to}} {{describe}} the changing pattern of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in Australia {{at the national level}} over the past 15 years or so, specifically from 1990 to 2005. This is important in two ways. On the one hand, as Chapter 1 showed, the national level of regulation {{is likely to be a}} central factor in explaining the pattern of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in different industries, especially the changes over time in the pattern of regulation. Knowing the national changes helps to explain industry changes. On the other hand, because the national system of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> is likely to be important in every industry reported in the subsequent chapters of this book, it is more efficient to describe these national changes in one place at the beginning of the book- this information is common to all chapters and its presentation here reduces repetition. The second aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the importance of industry as a unit of analysis in the study of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation.</b> Aggregated analysis at the national level, as important as it is, obscures profound differences between industries in the practice of employment relations. At the same time, more 'micro' studies of enterprises and workplaces, which have clearly become essential in recent times, neglect both key industry-level forms of regulation and vital trends that are common across individual enterprises. Industry-level studies, like those presented in this book, offer significant theoretical, policy and pedagogic opportunities. Before presenting the industry-level studies in the subsequent chapters, these opportunities will be surveyed in more detail...|$|R
