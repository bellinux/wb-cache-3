5000|$|The Khim’s string is a brass string. It {{is being}} hitched on the <b>hitch</b> <b>pins</b> {{on the left}} side of the sound box. There are 14 groups of strings on the khim, and each group has 3 strings. Overall, the khim has a total of 42 strings ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{action of}} these small {{instruments}} {{is known as the}} [...] "English single" [...] and is unusually simple (for instance, it is far simpler than the original piano action as invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori.) It consists of a small [...] "sticker" [...] simply pushing up on a hammer, while a rod passing through the <b>hitch</b> <b>pin</b> plank lifted up a damper lever hinged from a rail attached to the spine. The action is illustrated below.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hitch</b> <b>pins</b> are on {{the left}} side of the soundbox and tuning pins {{are on the}} right side. There are 42 pins on each side. Tuning this {{instrument}} is very easy but time consuming. The player inserts a type of wrench on the prongs that stick up from the sides, but only turns the prongs {{on the left side}}. Turning the prongs on the right side can cause the string to break. Then the player turns the wrench which tightens or loosens the string to the desired pitch.|$|R
5000|$|It was Jean-Henri Pape (1789-1875), {{the teacher}} of Carl Bechstein, who invented and put into use the system of high tension steel strings and copper wound over steel in pianos. Pape, who was also the true {{inventor}} of the overstrung piano in 1826, {{along with many other}} successful and not so successful inventions, invented the design of an additional pressure bar or individual capo/s located between the <b>hitch</b> <b>pins</b> and the bridges (a similar system later patented by Theodore Steinway in 1872) now known as [...] "duplex scaling". He also introduced the use of compressed felt for hammers. A good number of these are still in use today.|$|R

25|$|The rim of a Bösendorfer {{grand piano}} is built quite {{differently}} {{from that of}} all other grands. Instead of veneers bent around a form, the rim is made in solid sections of spruce and jointed together. Spruce is better at transmitting sound than reflecting it. This is perhaps why Bösendorfers {{tend to have a}} more delicate treble and a bass that features the fundamental tone more than the higher harmonics. There are also two other features of Bösendorfers that are shared with only a few other piano brands: one is a removable capo d'astro bar in the treble, which facilitates rebuilding of the instrument and, Bösendorfer says, provides greater acoustic separation from the plate, decreasing tonal absorption; the other is single-stringing, providing each string its own individual <b>hitch</b> <b>pin</b> on the plate instead of connecting it to a neighboring string. This design may slightly improve tuning stability and is an advantage in case of string breakage.|$|R
5000|$|Both Fazioli and Mason and Hamlin (of Haverhill, Massachusetts) employ tunable duplex scaling. The {{idea behind}} duplex scaling, invented by Theodore Steinway in 1872, {{is that the}} non-speaking portion of the string, located between the non-speaking bridge <b>pin</b> and the <b>hitch</b> <b>pin</b> (formerly {{considered}} the [...] "waste end" [...] and damped with a strip of cloth), resounds in sympathy with the vibrating portion of the string. Steinway & Sons' earliest employment of the duplex scale made use of aliquots, individually positionable (hence tunable) contact points, where each note of the duplex scale bears a perfect harmonic, intervallic relationship to its speaking length, i.e., an octave or fifth whether doubled or tripled. Because it was time-consuming to correctly position each aliquot, Steinway abandoned individual aliquots for continuous cast metal bars, each comprising an entire section of duplex bridge points. Their feeling was that with an accurately templated bridge and carefully located duplex bar, the same result would be achieved with far less fuss.|$|R
5000|$|One {{innovation}} that {{helped create the}} powerful, loud sound of the modern piano {{was the use of}} a strong iron frame. Also called the [...] "plate", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons in a grand piano. The single-piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal <b>hitch</b> <b>pin</b> plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings, which further increased the strength of the instrument's tone. In 1834, the Webster & Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel; according to Dolge it was [...] "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly." ...|$|R

40|$|The three {{categories}} of agents involved in {{the largest number of}} agricultural fatalities in Iowa are tractors, other farm machinery, and motor vehicles. All are involved during harvest as grain is transported on public roadways. Forty-eight percent of all motor vehicle collisions involving farm equipment in Iowa occur from October through December. Tractors and wagons delivering grain to six elevators during fall harvest were evaluated. Vocational agriculture student teams inspected for compliance with Iowa code and ASAE standards for lighting, marking, hitch, and ROPS safety equipment. A majority of tractors complied with safety standards for: headlights, front amber flashing lights, slow moving vehicle (SMV) emblem, and roll over protection structure (ROPS). Tractors less than eight years old met Iowa code and ASAE safety standards for rear amber flashing lights and rear taillight. Tractors less than 15 years old {{were more likely to be}} equipped with ROPS (98 %) than were tractors more than 15 years old (67 %). Compliance with safety items other than ROPS did not significantly differ among tractor age groups. A majority of wagons at the elevators complied with ASAE safety standards for an SMV emblem and retainer on the <b>hitch</b> <b>pin.</b> Other wagon safety items all had lower compliance than all tractor safety items...|$|R
50|$|The three-point hitch was {{controlled}} with a lever for adjusting the position, or {{as with the}} earliest ones, just the function for raising or <b>lowering</b> the <b>hitch.</b> With modern electrical systems, it is often replaced with a potentiometer for the lower bound position and another one for the upper bound, and a switch allowing automatic adjustment of the hitch between these settings.|$|R
50|$|Three-point hitches are {{composed}} of three movable arms. The two <b>lower</b> arms—the <b>hitch</b> lifting arms—are controlled by the hydraulic system, and provide lifting, lowering, and even tilting to the arms. The upper center arm—called the top link—is movable, but is usually not powered by the tractor's hydraulic system. Each arm has an attachment device to connect implements to the hitch.|$|R
40|$|Traveling with a {{full size}} bicycle can be problematic. A light weight bicycle frame was {{designed}} to collapse {{to be able to}} fit into carry-on luggage for transport on an airplane. The required dimensions of the suitcase are 22 by 14 by 9 inches. This bicycle was also designed to be able to sustain a load of 200 pounds, with minimal deflection throughout the frame. The frame was constructed using aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes that were cut to a specific size to be used for telescoping tubes along the front triangle of the frame, known as the top, down, and seat tubes. The telescoping tubes are pin locked when extended to ensure the structural integrity of the frame. These <b>hitch</b> <b>pins</b> were selected due to the ball bearing {{at the end of the}} pin, which helps keep the pin in place while the bicycle is being used. The frame along the chain and seat stays of the frame use pin locking tube hinges. These hinges were specifically chosen for this project so that they could assist in easily collapsing the bicycle, while keeping the structural integrity of the bike intact. The designed frame was not to exceed 15 pounds and the finished product was successful, weighing in at less than 13 pounds. While the dimensions of the frame are 38 by 22 by 6 inches when fully extended, the final dimensions of the frame when it is collapsed are 22 by 14 by 5 inches. Other results include load and deflection testing...|$|R
5000|$|One {{innovation}} that {{helped create the}} powerful sound of the modern piano {{was the use of}} a massive, strong, cast iron frame. Also called the [...] "plate", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons (40000 lbf kN) in a modern grand. The single piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal <b>hitch</b> <b>pin</b> plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). Babcock later worked for the Chickering & Mackays firm who patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos in 1843. Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century. The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings. In 1834, the Webster & Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel; according to Dolge it was [...] "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly." [...] But a better steel wire was soon created in 1840 by the Viennese firm of Martin Miller, and a period of innovation and intense competition ensued, with rival brands of piano wire being tested against one another at international competitions, leading ultimately to the modern form of piano wire.|$|R
40|$|A vision {{sensing system}} for the {{measurement}} of auto-guidance pass-to-pass and long-term errors was implemented to test the steering performance of tractors equipped with auto-guidance systems. The developed test system consisted of an optical machine vision sensor rigidly mounted on {{the rear of the}} tested tractor. The center of the drawbar <b>hitch</b> <b>pin</b> point was used as the reference from which to measure the deviation of the tractor’s actual travel path from its desired path. The system was built and calibrated to a measurement accuracy of better than 2 mm. To evaluate the sensor, two auto-guidance systems equipped with RTK-level GNSS receivers were tested and the results for different travel speeds compared. Pass-to-pass and long-term errors were calculated using the relative positions of a reference at a collocated point when the tractor was operated in opposite directions within 15 min and more than 1 h apart, respectively. In addition to variations in speed, two different auto-guidance steering stabilization distances allowed for comparison of two different definitions of steady-state operation of the system. For the analysis, non-parametric cumulative distributions were generated to determine error values that corresponded to 95 % of the cumulative distribution. Both auto-guidance systems provided 95 % cumulative error estimates comparable to 51 mm (2 in.) claims and even smaller during Test A. Higher travel speeds (especially 5. 0 m/s) significantly increased measured auto-guidance error, but no significant difference was observed between pass-to-pass and long-term error estimates. The vision sensor testing system {{could be used as a}} means to implement the auto-guidance test standard under development by the International Standard Organization (ISO). Third-party evaluation of auto-guidance performance will increase consumer awareness of the potential performance of products provided by a variety of vendors...|$|R
50|$|At the 2008 Frankfurt Music Fair, Steingraeber & Söhne {{introduced}} a new grand piano that measures 232 cm in length, {{as well as a}} grand piano with a Carbon carbon fibre soundboard. This type of construction enhances stability when tuning instruments that are subject to extreme climatic fluctuations. If grand pianos are to be housed in the Tropics or played at outdoor concerts, for example, then carbon fibre soundboards make good sense. The left pedal mechanism has been enhanced: when a pianist depresses the left pedal, this causes the mechanism to shift in the usual way. If he/she continues to depress the pedal, the hammers move closer to the strings, which is similar to what happens in uprights. This facilitates playing at extremely soft, pianissimo dynamic levels. Steingraeber has developed an alternative means of guiding the strings over the bridge; it is based upon earlier ideas that were implemented in trials. Normally, the strings go over two bridge pins in a zigzag pattern. In the case of the Steingraeber alternative, bridge agraffes guide the string through a metal roller and press it down onto the bridge from above. In addition, height-adjustable <b>hitch</b> <b>pins</b> allow the string tension to be adjusted. The thinking behind this design feature is twofold: uniform string tension over the bridge improves energy transmission, and when significant string friction at the bridge pins no longer exists, the ability to tune and to hold a tuning is optimized. At the moment, these are not standard features in the production of grand pianos; clients may order them for an additional fee, however. At Steingraeber, a ball bearing mechanism is available {{as an alternative to the}} standard, leather-covered knuckle roller mechanism. Thus, a lower-friction release of the jack makes improved repetition possible. In upright pianos, Steingraeber incorporates a magnet, rather than a spring, into the tip of the jack and the hammer-butt. The magnet brings the jack back into operating position after the it releases. This system is maintenance free and results in faster, more precise repetition.|$|R

5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler {{attaches}} to the trailer ball. This forms a {{ball and socket connection}} to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the <b>hitch</b> receiver and <b>pinning</b> it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} in design of universal {{three point hitch}} dynamometer. Approaches in different hitch dynamometers are explained and pros and cons are mentioned. Also main parts and functional principle of draft sensor are clarified. The main goal {{of this research is}} clarification and examination of draft sensor output signal on angular draft force dependences. Utilization of draft sensor as a source for draft force sensing in lower arms is intended and examined. Research was focused on loading of draft sensor in different directions for proper screening of voltage output. Special loading device was designed and used with respect of real mounting conditions and force loading identically to bearing <b>pins</b> of tractor <b>hitch</b> <b>lower</b> arms. With usage of calibrated load cell and National instrument sensing control unit stage loading diagram of draft sensor was obtained. Results show basic feedback of voltage output on force load angle variation. In non-load condition, voltage output fluctuates around 5 V. In the main direction of draft force application voltage drop occurs from 5 V up to 3. 16 V. Reverse direction of loading brings the voltage output increment from 5 V up to 7. 06 V. When the load is applied with angular inclination voltage output changes are diminished up to 90 ° and draft sensor shows voltage output symmetry against the main axis. Based on stage loading diagram the appropriateness of draft sensor usage in design of universal three point hitch dynamometer is discussed in paper summary. Also further research opportunities and results application are suggested...|$|R
