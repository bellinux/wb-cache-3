60|$|Condiments.--The most {{portable}} {{and useful}} condiments for a traveller are--salt, red pepper, Harvey's sauce, <b>lime-juice,</b> dried onions, and curry-powder. They should be {{bought at a}} first-rate shop; for red pepper, <b>lime-juice,</b> and curry-powder are often atrociously adulterated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are told}} of these unfortunate men being laid low by scurvy,' said I. 'Since <b>lime-juice</b> has been {{regularly}} stored and served {{out in our}} navy, surely that disease, which used to devastate it, has almost disappeared? Was there <b>lime-juice</b> aboard this transport?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What price your latter-day <b>lime-juice</b> subaltern?' I {{whispered to}} Stalky behind my hand. His {{nostrils}} expanded, and he drummed {{on the edge}} of the Japanese jar with his knuckles.|$|E
60|$|At noon {{we picked}} up a ship ahead, a <b>lime-juicer,</b> {{travelling}} in the same direction, under lower-topsails and one upper-topsail. The only one of her courses set was the foresail.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's this way," [...] he condescended to explain. [...] "I've {{no use for}} {{a fourth}} boat at all; but a boat of this model tops the business. I don't say the type's not common in these waters; it's as common as dirt; the traders carry them for surf-boats. But the Flying Scud? a deep-water tramp, who was <b>lime-juicing</b> around between big ports, Calcutta and Rangoon and 'Frisco and the Canton River. No, I don't see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See! {{they were}} writing up the log," [...] said Nares, {{pointing}} to the ink-bottle. [...] "Caught napping, as usual. I wonder {{if there ever was}} a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.--What a regular <b>lime-juicer</b> spread!" [...] he added contemptuously. [...] "Marmalade--and toast for the old man! Nasty, slovenly pigs!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{played for}} one season. After {{that he gave}} it up and has not touched a club since. Ring the bell and get me a small <b>lime-juice,</b> and I will tell you all." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{short time}} he {{returned}} with a basin of ice and a jugful of iced <b>lime-juice.</b> Nat took a long drink, and then turned so that the ice {{could be applied to}} the wound.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish, Atkinson," [...] said he, [...] "that {{you could}} {{give me a little}} <b>lime-juice</b> and water. I have a beastly thirst upon me, and the more I take the more I seem to want." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{simply could}} not go below. In such auspicious {{occasions}} all watches were his, and he strode the poop perpetually with all age-lag banished from his legs. Margaret and I were {{with him in the}} chart-room when he hurrahed the barometer, down to 28.55 and falling. And we were near him, on the poop, when he drove by an east-bound <b>lime-juicer,</b> hove-to under upper-topsails. We were a biscuit-toss away, and he sprang upon the rail at the jigger-shrouds and danced a war-dance and waved his free arm, and yelled his scorn and joy at their discomfiture to the several oilskinned figures on the stranger vessel's poop.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the 1850s as <b>lime-juicer,</b> and was later shortened to [...] "limey". It was originally used as a derogatory word for sailors in the Royal Navy, because of the Royal Navy's practice {{since the beginning of the}} 19th century of adding lemon juice to the sailors' daily ration of watered-down rum (known as grog), in order to prevent scurvy (see James Lind). Initially, it was lemon juice that was used as the additive to grog on the British Royal Navy ships. At the time, the terms [...] "lemon" [...] and [...] "lime" [...] were used interchangeably to refer to citrus fruits. The vitamin C or ascorbic acid in citrus fruits, helped make these sailors some of the healthiest of the time as it prevented scurvy. The British Navy eventually switched from lemons (imported from Europe) to limes (grown in British colonies), not realizing that limes did not contain sufficient Vitamin C to prevent the disease.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Polly," [...] said Ben one sultry forenoon {{when she}} {{brought him a}} glass of {{sweetened}} <b>lime-juice</b> and water, [...] "you're a kind little nurse. I really don't know how I should get on without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, the loftiest {{hopes on}} earth [...] Draw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts, [...] Breathing bad air, ran risk of pestilence; [...] Or, lacking <b>lime-juice</b> when {{they cross the}} Line, [...] May {{languish}} with the scurvy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Watty, don't be jealous," [...] said Ben; [...] "it's not {{the glass}} of <b>lime-juice,</b> but Polly's {{sympathetic}} face beaming behind it, that does me so much good. Besides, you know, Polly's a girl, and a girl is always a better nurse than a man; you must admit that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fetch me the scales; now then, doctor, hold 'em," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{carefully}} weighing out {{a portion of}} biscuit and meat which he handed {{to one of the}} men. This process was continued until all had been supplied, after which a small quantity of water and <b>lime-juice</b> was also measured out to each.|$|E
60|$|Scurvy has {{attacked}} travellers even in Australia; and I have myself felt {{symptoms of}} it in Africa, when living wholly on meat. Any vegetable diet cures it: <b>lime-juice,</b> treacle, raw potatoes, and acid fruits are especially efficacious. Dr. Kane insists {{on the value of}} entirely raw meat as a certain anti-scorbutic: this is generally used by the Esquimaux.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm of one {{mind with}} you there. That's {{the thing for}} me. I want no other doctor. If I don't get to sea to-morrow I'll have an illness. There are no two ways about it." [...] He drank off the tumbler of <b>lime-juice,</b> and clapped his two hands with his {{knuckles}} doubled up into {{the small of his}} back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. She put to sea a week ago. I have {{a letter}} {{here that the}} captain gave me to hand {{to you when you}} were fit to read it. I should not open it now if I were you. You are very weak, and sleep is the best {{medicine}} for you. Now, drink a little of this fresh <b>lime-juice.</b> I have no doubt that you will doze off again." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{official}} {{friend was}} beginning 'the {{best of all}} possible--' when an inconvenient medical forefinger pointed out another passage in the evidence, from which {{it appeared that the}} <b>lime-juice</b> had been bad too. Not to mention that the vinegar had been bad too, the vegetables bad too, the cooking accommodation insufficient (if there had been anything worth mentioning to cook), the water supply exceedingly inadequate, and the beer sour.|$|E
60|$|We stored {{ourselves}} likewise with {{oranges and}} lemons; and, buying a great quantity {{of very good}} limes, we made three or four hogsheads of <b>lime-juice,</b> which was a great relief to our men in the hot season, to mix with their water; as for making punch, we had some arrack and some sugar, but neither of them in such quantity as to have much punch made afore the mast.|$|E
60|$|And now, on the leeward bow, another gray {{mountain}} island rose; {{and on the}} windward another, {{lower and}} longer. The former was Montserrat, which I should have gladly visited, as I {{had been invited to}} do. For little Montserrat is just now the scene of a very hopeful and important experiment. {27b} The Messrs. Sturge have established there a large plantation of limes, and a manufactory of <b>lime-juice,</b> which promises to be able to supply, in good time, vast quantities of that most useful of all sea-medicines.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought me}} also {{a box of}} sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of <b>lime-juice,</b> and {{abundance}} of other things: but besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, {{and a very good}} suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little. In a word, he clothed me from head to foot.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Jim {{appeared}} {{with none of}} the disruptive violence Mr. Polly had dreaded. He came quite softly. Mr. Polly was going down the lane behind the church that led to the Potwell Inn after posting a letter to the <b>lime-juice</b> people at the post-office. He was walking slowly, after his habit, and thinking discursively. With a sudden tightening of the muscles he became aware of a figure walking noiselessly beside him. His first impression was of a face singularly broad above and with a wide empty grin as its chief feature below, of a slouching body and dragging feet.|$|E
60|$|They {{found his}} Excellency {{seated in a}} great easy-chair, {{under the shadow of}} a slatted veranda, the floor whereof was paved with brick. He was clad, for the sake of coolness, only in his shirt, breeches, and stockings, and he wore {{slippers}} on his feet. He was smoking a great cigarro of tobacco, and a goblet of <b>lime-juice</b> and water and rum stood at his elbow on a table. Here, out of the glare of the heat, it was all very cool and pleasant, with a sea-breeze blowing violently in through the slats, setting them a-rattling now and then, and stirring Sir Thomas's long hair, which he had pushed back for the sake of coolness.|$|E
60|$|Pratt's Ordinary was at {{that time}} a very fine and famous place of its sort, with good tobacco and the best rum in the West Indies, and had a garden behind it that, sloping down to the harbor front, was planted pretty thick with palms and ferns, grouped into {{clusters}} with flowers and plants. Here were a number of tables, some in little grottos, like our Vauxhall in New York, with red and blue and white paper lanterns hung among the foliage. Thither gentlemen and ladies used sometimes to go of an evening to sit and drink <b>lime-juice</b> and sugar and water (and sometimes a taste of something stronger), and to look out across the water at the shipping and so to enjoy the cool of the day.|$|E
60|$|Major Horsley had {{not spoken}} to him, but he {{had given him a}} little nod of {{satisfaction}} when the corporal gave his report. The cavalry moved across at a walk towards the wells of El-Teb, the wounded being carried between the lines, as there was no saying how many Arabs might be lurking among the bushes. On reaching the wells they were taken to the field hospital, which had already been organized. There their wounds were more carefully examined and re-dressed; and after a drink of <b>lime-juice</b> and water, with a little brandy in it, Edgar soon dropped off to sleep. In the morning Major Horsley and Captain Atkinson came round to see how the men of their regiment were getting on. The surgeon's report was favourable except in the case of Corporal North.|$|E
6000|$|I {{collect the}} {{following}} notes upon the diseases and medical {{treatment of the}} Northern Hijaz. Al-Madinah has been visited four times by the Rih al-Asfar[FN#11] (yellow wind), or Asiatic Cholera, which {{is said to have}} committed great ravages, sometimes carrying off whole households. In the Rahmat al-Kabirah, the [...] "Great Mercy," [...] as the worst attack is piously called, whenever a man vomited, he was abandoned to his fate; before that, he was treated with mint, <b>lime-juice,</b> and copious draughts of coffee. It is still the boast of Al-Madinah, that the Taun, or plague, has never passed her frontier.[FN#12] The Judari, or smallpox, appears to be indigenous to the countries bordering upon the Red Sea; we read of it there in the earliest works of the Arabs,[FN#13] and even to the present time it sometimes sweeps through Arabia and the Somali ...|$|E

60|$|As {{twilight}} fell {{a number}} of the enemy took possession of the top of a hill some twelve hundred yards away on the right and opened fire, to which the three guns of the artillery replied with shrapnel-shell. The guns ceased firing when darkness came on, but the enemy kept up an occasional fire all night. A drink of <b>lime-juice</b> and water was served out to all the men, who then lay down, with their arms in readiness to repel an attack, by the little wall. All night the enemy kept on beating tom-toms and occasionally yelling, approaching at times comparatively close to the position. Knowing, however, that the sentries were out in front, the men for the most part slept quietly in spite of the noise and firing. As the Arabs could fire only at random but two men were hit during the night.|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} {{additional}} liberty {{with my friend}} Pangloss, when I had left the sergeant with good wishes, of asking Pangloss whether he {{had ever heard of}} biscuit getting drunk and bartering its nutritious qualities for putrefaction and vermin; of peas becoming hardened in liquor; of hammocks drinking themselves {{off the face of the}} earth; of <b>lime-juice,</b> vegetables, vinegar, cooking accommodation, water supply, and beer, all taking to drinking together and going to ruin? 'If not (I asked him), what did he say in defence of the officers condemned by the Coroner's jury, who, by signing the General Inspection report relative to the ship Great Tasmania, chartered for these troops, had deliberately asserted all that bad and poisonous dunghill refuse, to be good and wholesome food?' My official friend replied that it was a remarkable fact, that whereas some officers were only positively good, and other officers only comparatively better, those particular officers were superlatively the very best of all possible officers.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a quiet}} {{night in}} the Shovel. At the bar, which ranged along {{one side of the}} large chinked-log room, leaned half a dozen men, two of whom were {{discussing}} the relative merits of spruce-tea and <b>lime-juice</b> as remedies for scurvy. They argued with an air of depression and with intervals of morose silence. The other men scarcely heeded them. In a row, against the opposite wall, were the gambling games. The crap-table was deserted. One lone man was playing at the faro-table. The roulette-ball was not even spinning, and the gamekeeper stood by the roaring, red-hot stove, talking with the young, dark-eyed woman, comely of face and figure, who was known from Juneau to Fort Yukon as the Virgin. Three men sat in at stud-poker, but they played with small chips and without enthusiasm, while there were no onlookers. On the floor of the dancing-room, which opened out at the rear, three couples were waltzing drearily to the strains of a violin and a piano.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at present, Glover; {{you need}} {{absolute}} quiet, {{and if the}} frigate got into a heavy sea it might undo all our work, {{and in that case}} there would be little hope of saving your arm. Madame Demaine told the French doctor that she would nurse you as if you were her own child, and that everything was to be done to make you comfortable. The house is cool, and your wound will have a much better chance of getting well here than in our sick-bay. She wanted to come in to thank you, but I said that, now we had dressed your arm, it was better that you should have nothing to disturb or excite you. When the girl's father returns--and I have no doubt he will do so soon, for as yet, though half-a-dozen boys have been sent down to the town, they {{have not been able to}} find him--he must on no account come in to see you at present. Here is a tumbler of fresh <b>lime-juice</b> and water. Doctor Lepel will remain here all night and see that you have everything that you require." ...|$|E
60|$|Unfortunately {{their stock}} of <b>lime-juice</b> was now getting low, {{and the crew}} {{had to be put}} on short allowance. As this acid is an {{excellent}} anti-scorbutic, or preventive of scurvy, as well as a cure, its rapid diminution was viewed with much concern by all on board. The long-continued absence of the sun, too, now began to tell more severely than ever on men and dogs. On the very day the expeditions took their departure, one of the latter, which had been left behind on account of illness, was attacked with a strange disease, of which several of the team eventually died before the winter came to an end. It was seized with spasms, and, after a few wild paroxysms, lapsed into a lethargic state. In this condition the animal functions went on apparently as well as usual, the appetite continued not only good but voracious. The disease was clearly mental. It barked furiously at nothing, and walked in straight or curved lines perseveringly; or at other times it remained for hours in moody silence, and then started off howling as if pursued. In thirty-six hours after the first attack the poor animal died, and was buried in the snow on Store Island.|$|E
60|$|We {{watched a}} Raratongan woman, with swollen, {{distorted}} limbs, prepare our cocoanut cream, {{and then went}} out to the cook-shed where Tehei and Bihaura were cooking dinner. And then it was served to us on a dry-goods box in the house. Our hosts waited until we were done and then spread their table on the floor. But our table! We were certainly in the high seat of abundance. First, there was glorious raw fish, caught several hours before from the sea and steeped the intervening time in <b>lime-juice</b> diluted with water. Then came roast chicken. Two cocoanuts, sharply sweet, served for drink. There were bananas that tasted like strawberries and that melted in the mouth, and there was banana-poi that made one regret that his Yankee forebears ever attempted puddings. Then there was boiled yam, boiled taro, and roasted feis, which last are nothing more or less than large mealy, juicy, red-coloured cooking bananas. We marvelled at the abundance, and, even as we marvelled, a pig was brought on, a whole pig, a sucking pig, swathed in green leaves and roasted upon the hot stones of a native oven, the most honourable and triumphant dish in the Polynesian cuisine. And after that came coffee, black coffee, delicious coffee, native coffee grown on the hillsides of Tahaa.|$|E
6000|$|Any {{thing like}} a {{scientific}} {{use of the}} method of experiment, in these complicated cases, is therefore out of the question. We can generally, {{even in the most}} favorable cases, only discover by a succession of trials, that a certain cause is very often followed by a certain effect. For, in one of these conjunct effects, the portion which is determined by any one of the influencing agents, is usually, as we before remarked, but small; and it must be a more potent cause than most, if even the tendency which it really exerts is not thwarted by other tendencies in nearly as many cases as it is fulfilled. Some causes indeed there are which are more potent than any counteracting causes to which they are commonly exposed; and accordingly there are some truths in medicine which are sufficiently proved by direct experiment. Of these the most familiar are those that relate to the efficacy of the substances known as Specifics for particular diseases, “quinine, colchicum, <b>lime-juice,</b> cod-liver oil,”(151) and a few others. Even these are not invariably followed by success; but they succeed in so large a proportion of cases, and against such powerful obstacles, that their tendency to restore health in the disorders for which they are prescribed may be regarded as an experimental truth.(152) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lads," [...] said Captain Dall, {{sitting down}} in the stern of his boat, and {{grasping}} the tiller, [...] "it has pleased the Almighty to sink our ship and to spare our lives. Let us be thankful that we didn't go to the bottom along with her. To {{the best of my}} knowledge we're a long way from land, and all of us will have to take in a reef in our appetites for some time to come. I have taken care to have a good supply of salt junk, biscuit, water, and <b>lime-juice</b> put aboard, so that if the weather don't turn out uncommon bad, we may manage, with God's blessing, to make the land. In circumstances of this kind, men's endurance is sometimes tried pretty sharply, and men in distress are occasionally driven to forgetting their duty to their comrades. I tell you beforehand, lads, that I will do all that in me lies to steer you to the nearest port, and to make your lot as comfortable as may be in an open boat; but if any of you should take a fancy to having his own way, I've brought with me a little leaden pill-box (here the captain drew aside the breast of his coat and exposed the handle of a revolver) which will tend to keep up discipline and prevent discord. Now, lads, ship your oars and hoist the foresail close-reefed, and look alive, for it seems to me that we'll have a squally night." ...|$|E
