5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified <b>landing</b> <b>procedure</b> allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
25|$|Curiosity {{successfully}} {{landed in}} the Gale Crater at 05:17:57.3 UTC on August 6, 2012, and transmitted Hazcam images confirming orientation. Due to the Mars-Earth distance {{at the time of}} landing and the limited speed of radio signals, the landing was not registered on Earth for another 14 minutes. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter sent a photograph of Curiosity descending under its parachute, taken by its HiRISE camera, during the <b>landing</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the {{findings}} of the official MAK investigation, the crash can be blamed on both the airport services, which did not inform the pilot about the reduced visibility in time due to organizational problems, and on the pilot, who did not give the dispatcher the correct information about his landing trajectory and, consequently, did not decide to stop the <b>landing</b> <b>procedure</b> and try to take another approach at the time he should have done so.|$|E

25|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. <b>Landing</b> <b>procedure</b> was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|E
25|$|Flight 213 was on {{approach}} to Benazir Bhutto International Airport piloted by Captain Noor Afridin and First Officer Javid Malik. Airport AFIS told {{the crew of}} Flight 213 that the weather in the area was thundery with heavy precipitation. The crews acknowledged the report and continued the approach. Flight 213 had only experienced some turbulence while approaching therefore it continued the approach. The Flight crew was still at normal mood condition, as Captain Noor's jokes and laugh were heard in the CVR. But a few minutes later, the flight finally encountered bad weather conditions. The flight crew entered bad weather, but still continued the approach, even though Bhoja Air's operational manual told crews to discontinue approach if bad weather was encountered. They continued the approach until finally they realized that they had entered an active cell. At this time, Captain Noor {{was worried about the}} condition, but continued the approach. Autopilot was later disengaged by flight crews. Islamabad Tower then told Flight 213 to land on Runway 30. The landing checklist was completed and done. Flight crews followed the <b>landing</b> <b>procedure</b> on ILS approach. The autopilot later engaged again.|$|E
