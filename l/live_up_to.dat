5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments and the opening scenes, they found the game too short and felt it failed to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the dramatist's conception.|$|E

He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade.|$|E

Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|Reversing the {{traditional}} Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link {{and her father}} the king who have not returned from their quest. As with Faces of Evil, the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, , and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes. Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces of Evil, modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception.|$|E

5|$|The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} wild birds. The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpecker species <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their name and feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall {{the family is}} characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic.
