However, less is known about the influence of flow parameters on turbine performance particularly swirl distribution. Based on the influence of draft tube flow characteristics on the overall performance of a <b>low-head</b> <b>turbine,</b> this research proposes a methodology for optimizing draft tube inlet velocity profiles as a new approach to con-trolling the flow conditions in order to yield better draft tube and turbine performance. Numerical optimization methods have been used successfully for a variety of design prob-lems. However, addressing the optimization of boundary conditions in hydraulic turbines poses a new challenge. In this paper, three different vortex equations for representing the inlet velocity profile are applied to a cone diffuser, and the behavior of the objective func-tion is analyzed. As well, the influence of the quantitative correlation between the swirl-ing flow at the cone inlet and the analytical blade shape, flow rate, and swirl number using the best inlet velocity profiles is evaluated. We also include a discussion on the development of a flow structure caused by the inlet swirl parameters. Finally, we present an analysis of the influence of flow rate and swirl number on the behavior of the optimiza-tion process. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4029837]...|$|E

The effect of five different geometry control scenarios on the overall hydraulic efficiency and overall hydraulic power of OWECs has been simulated for three possible deployment sites using empirical prediction formulae. The results show that the effect of an adaptive slope angle is relatively small. On the other hand, adapting the crest freeboard of the OWECs to the wave characteristics increases the overall hydraulic efficiency and power.

Circulation models indicate that the peak power resource in narrow straits such as Letete Pas-sage and Lubec Narrows exceeds 10 kw per square meter of installed turbine aperture. Modern helical turbines have efficiencies of about 30 percent, so in those locations a moored installation with 30 m 2 of aperture could produce about 0. 1 megawatt during each of the four peak flow intervals in a tidal day, and perhaps a factor of two greater during spring tides.

40|$|Hydropower is a {{clean and}} {{sustainable}} energy resource that has been developed and used since the late 19 th century. In Sweden, power plants have been constructed over the entire 20 th century, with a peak {{in the period of}} 1950 - 1970. Currently, many of the older plants are in need of refurbishment. A modern hydropower turbine can have efficiency up to 95 %. By upgrading older turbines, substantial gain can be achieved. As part of this thesis, a detailed experimental investigation of the flow in a Kaplan turbine model has been performed with a main focus on the draft tube. Besides the goal of describing the flow, the result will serve as validation data for CFD simulations and for scale-up studies (corresponding prototype is available for similar measurements). The investigation is performed with time-resolved pressure measurements in which different periodic flow phenomena are captured. The turbine is investigated at three different loads: part load, best efficiency point and near full load. During the refurbishment of a turbine, site efficiency tests are common practice to verify the improvements. A key feature of many methods regarding efficiency tests is flow rate measurements. Several commonly used methods exist for this task, such as current meter, Gibson's and ultrasonic (acoustic) methods. These methods can provide trustworthy results, but the difficulty to obtain satisfactory accuracy for low-head machines, below 50 m, is common to most of them. Gibson's method is rather economical and is easily performed on site. However, it has some limitations that make it difficult to apply to <b>low-head</b> <b>turbines,</b> such as short and non-uniform water passages. This thesis also aims to extend Gibson's method for use on low-head machines, i. e., outside the criteria stated in the IEC 41 standard. The investigation is performed with both numerical and experimental methods. In the numerical investigation, the physical quantities in rapidly decelerated flows are studied in detail. Unsteady friction terms are implemented in Gibson's method to enhance the accuracy under non-preferred conditions. A test rig was developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Norway for investigation with Gibson's method outside the criteria stated in the standard, as well as the validation of the numerical model and the updated Gibson method.

40|$|Construction of large-scale, {{hydroelectric}} {{tidal power}} {{developments in the}} upper Bay of Fundy is receiving serious consideration. Potential designs involve ebb-generation with 1400 - 5300 -MW plants using 7. 6 m diameter, straight-flow, <b>low-head</b> <b>turbines</b> installed in dams up to 8 km in length. Discharge through individual turbines will be 400 m 3 /second at 50 rev/minute with draft tube velocities of 11. 4 m/second. Calculated parameters for these turbines are a water length of 2. 26 m, impact velocity of 23. 99 m/second, blade tip velocity up to 28. 7 m/second and a total pressure flux of 1. 7 atm. The existing environment is macrotidal (tide range 11 - 16 m). Embayments are homogeneous estuaries with extremely turbid water. The intertidal biological community is a salt marsh-mudflat biome. The pelagic zone supports large populations of migratory fishes, particularly the alosids, Alosa sapidissima, A. aestivalis, A. pseudoharengus, and Clupea harengus. Striped bass, spiny dogfish, Atlantic salmon, and Atlantic sturgeon also constitute {{a significant portion of}} the fish community. Tagging experiments indicate this region is a northern migration terminus for American shad populations from all Atlantic coast rivers and abundance in an individual tidal basin is about 1. 5 million adults during a single tidal cycle. Striped bass and alewife tagged in this region have been taken as far south as North Carolina. Upstream tidal headponds will have reduced tide ranges of 5 - 6 m and the lower energy will result in stratification of the water column and less turbidity. Increased sedimentation above and below the dams is expected to affect local soft-shell clam fisheries. Tidal barrages may alter fish migration routes and repeated passage through turbines during tide-related movements will cause significant mortality to both fish and marine mammals.

40|$|The Bay of Fundy {{in eastern}} Canada is {{renowned for its}} high tides, which are among the world 2 ̆ 019 s largest; and for this reason, the Bay of Fundy (BoF) has long been {{recognized}} as one of the world 2 ̆ 019 s premier locations for deployment of tidal power generation systems. The large tides are a result of the near-resonant response of the BoF-GoM system to the M 2 tidal forcing. The tidal barrage at Annapolis Royal has been operating successfully since 1984; however, because of hydrodynamic and environmental impacts upstream of this barrage, this type of tidal power development remains highly controversial. Tidal power lagoons are an alternative approach to tidal power conversion that attempts to achieve high efficiency while avoiding some of the environmental problems associated with tidal barrages. A typical tidal power lagoon consists of a large impoundment structure (a rubble-mound dyke or caisson) and a power-house containing sluices and conventional low-head hydroelectric generating equipment, situated a mile or more offshore in an area with shallow depths and high tides. While tidal power lagoons are believed to be technically feasible and efficient, their potential effects on the hydrodynamics of the BoF-GoM tidal system has not been investigated previously and remains unknown. The main objective of the study described in this report was to discover and assess the scale and character of the changes in tidal hydrodynamics that would be caused by tidal power lagoons operating in the upper part of the Bay. A detailed two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, based on the TELEMAC modelling system, has been developed to simulate tidal flows in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine. The model has been well calibrated and validated against water level and velocity data. Twenty different versions of the model have been developed to simulate existing conditions and nineteen hypothetical scenarios with one or more tidal power lagoons operating in the upper Bay. Methods were developed to simulate, numerically, the flows through <b>low-head</b> <b>turbines</b> and sluices, and the storage and release of water from a lagoon impoundment. Tidal power lagoons, varying in size from 12 km 2 up to 58 km 2, have been simulated at six prospective sites, three sites in Minas Basin and three in Chignecto Bay. In one scenario, the effect of six lagoons working together, one at each site, was investigated. The changes in tidal hydrodynamics throughout the BoF and GoM due to the presence and operation of one or more tidal lagoons have been estimated by differencing results from simulations with lagoons and an equivalent simulation of existing conditions without lagoons. The sensitivities to changes in lagoon location, lagoon size, lagoon type, the number of lagoons and their location have all been investigated. Moreover, relationships that describe the trade-off between power generation from lagoons and the magnitude of the resulting hydrodynamic change have been developed for several major communities around the BoF and GoM. The methods employed in the study and the results of these simulations are presented and discussed in this report. These results will help inform current and future policies concerning the development of the vast tidal energy resources in the Bay of Fundy. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The tidal power lagoon concept involves temporarily storing seawater behind an impoundment dike and generating power by gradually releasing the impounded seawater through conventional <b>low-head</b> hydroelectric <b>turbines.</b> A tidal power lagoon will inherently modify the tides and tidal currents in the vicinity of the lagoon, and possibly induce effects that may be felt throughout the entire BoF and Gulf of Maine. The nature of these hydrodynamic impacts will likely depend on the size of the tidal lagoon, its location, and its method of operation. It is important to have reliable estimates of these potential impacts, since any changes in tidal hydrodynamics caused by a tidal lagoon may upset ecosystems that are well adapted to existing conditions. The scale and character of the potential hydrodynamic impacts due to tidal power lagoons operating in the BoF have not been previously investigated.

40|$|The idea of {{harnessing}} {{energy from}} the ocean waves is a seductive one, a limitless resource. But the road from idea to success is long and has been traveled by many, the great achievements {{are few and far}} between. This thesis proposes a novel idea to convert ocean wave energy to electric energy. The principle is an enclosed barge-like floating device with an internal fluid volume. The device, being moored offshore, is excited by ocean waves which in turn excite the internal fluid, forming internal waves in a sloshing motion. This motion together with internal ramps at each end, force the fluid upwards where some of it overtops the ramp. The fluid, now being at a higher level than the internal mean waterline, is led through a <b>low-head</b> hydro-power <b>turbine,</b> utilizing the height difference to produce electric energy, which in turn can be exported to shore in cables. The concept benefits from its simplicity and reliability, the only moving part is the turbine which in turn require little maintenance. Only one mooring point is required and installation at site is as simple as towing out and hooking up the mooring and cables. A numerical model was set up on the basis of ocean wave data at a position offshore west of the Norwegian shore. The results showed promise of an increase in the tanks free surface elevations {{at the end of the}} ramps, an increase which was a small magnitude larger than the incoming waves for a wide band of wave periods. A model was built based on the geometrical model used in the numerical testing. Model testing was performed in a wave basin to provide the physical data needed to get information of the non-linear sloshing this concept relies on. Results turned out to be dubious, but some few test data showed promise of the idea being interesting. There is an obvious need for more testing, with greater accuracy in both the numerical models and the physical test models. </p...|$|R

The experiments give encouraging results on the turbine efficiency. They also intuitively demonstrate the new turbine 2 ̆ 7 s capability of improving downstream water quality. The experimental results are used to confirm creditability of the numerical models. The numerical flow computations provide detailed flow information in flow passage of both the pilot turbine and the sample prototype turbine. Turbine hydraulic efficiency is estimated based on the computational results. The numerical flow analysis approach is also used to extend the turbine performance curves obtained in the experiment, to identify the initial pilot turbine design insufficiency, and to predict the turbine efficiency under optimal inflow conditions. The flow analyses for the sample prototype turbine evaluate the validity of the proposed design methods for the new turbine. They also identify the potential areas of design improvement for the sample turbine. Initial design optimizations are performed. The improved sample prototype turbine can reach a hydraulic efficiency of 82. 2...|$|R
40|$|Among {{sources of}} {{renewable}} energy, development of tidal energy {{has traditionally been}} plagued by relatively high costs and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal amplitudes or flow velocities. However, many recent technology developments and improvements, both in design (e. g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e. g. new axial turbines, crossflow turbines), showed that the economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels comparing to other conventional energy sources. It has long been identified that the Bay of Fundy {{is one of the}} world’s premier locations for the development of tidal power generating systems, since it has some of the world’s largest tidal ranges. Consequently, several proposals {{have been made in the}} recent years to find economical ways to harness the power of tides. Presently, there is considerable interest in installing tidal lagoons in the Bay of Fundy. The lagoon concept involves temporarily storing seawater behind an impoundment dike and generating power by gradually releasing the impounded seawater through conventional <b>low-head</b> hydroelectric <b>turbines.</b> A tidal lagoon will inherently modify the tides and tidal currents regime in the vicinity of the lagoon, and possibly induce effects that may be felt throughout the entire Bay of Fundy. The nature of these hydrodynamic impacts will likely depend on the size of the tidal lagoon, its location, and its method of operation. Any changes in the tidal hydrodynamics caused by a tidal lagoon may also impact on the transport of sediments throughout the region and upset ecosystems that are well adapted to existing conditions. The scale and character of the potential hydrodynamic impacts due to tidal lagoons operating in the Bay of Fundy have not been previously investigated. The present study endeavours to investigate these potential impacts to help the development of sustainable, science-based policies for the management and development of clean energy for future generations. After outlining fundamental aspects of tidal power projects taken in consideration in the Bay of Fundy, an analysis of present knowledge on tidal lagoons was conducted in order to provide a focus for subsequent investigations. Hydrodynamic modeling was used to quantify any of the potential hydrodynamic changes induced in the Bay of Fundy due to the presence of tidal lagoons. In the last part of the thesis, new relationships were derived in order to describe the amount of energy removed from tidal lagoons associated with its hydrodynamic impacts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Co-location of {{hydropower}} turbine outfalls {{with fish}} pass entrances {{has been suggested}} as current best practice to optimise the attraction flows for the fish pass and to mitigate the perceived negative impacts of small run-of-river hydropower schemes. To test this a five year acoustic tracking study was instigated to monitor the installation of a <b>low-head</b> Archimedes screw <b>turbine</b> alongside an existing pool-traverse fish pass on Ruswarp Weir, at the tidal limit of the River Esk (England). The study tracked the behaviour of salmon and sea trout {{as they approached the}} weir and fish pass and determined the overall passage rate (% of tagged fish ascending the weir by any route), the attraction efficiency (% of tagged fish entering the pool below the fish pass) and the fish pass efficiency (% of tagged fish detected in the pool below the fish pass that ascended the weir via the pass). Over the five years (3 years pre and 2 years post) 138 sea trout and 18 salmon were tracked using acoustic tags with arrays of fixed and mobile hydrophones to determine large-scale behaviour in the tideway and in the approach to the fish pass (a pool-traverse pass, replaced by a Larinier pass during construction of the turbine). The study showed that following the co-location of the turbine and the construction of the Larinier pass there was {{a significant increase in the}} attraction efficiency (35 % to 69 %) and the overall passage rate (35 % to 53 %) but a significant reduction in fish pass efficiency (100 % to 69 %) for sea trout. These results support the concept of colocating outfalls to increase attraction efficiency whilst at the same time raise concerns that this also reduced the fish pass efficiency; perhaps causing a distraction and delay to migrants, with an associated increased risk of predation...|$|R
