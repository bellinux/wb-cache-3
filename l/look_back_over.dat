As a result, Ó Gráda says that the tables undercount the number of deaths, because information was gathered from surviving householders having to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the previous 10 years, and death and emigration had cleared away entire families, leaving few or no survivors to answer the census questions.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, after {{finishing}} the world tour {{in support of}} their sixth studio album Hail to the Thief (2003), Radiohead went on hiatus. As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with EMI, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely {{time to take a}} break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected. And we’d {{come to the end of}} our contract, which gives you a natural point to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> at what you've achieved as a band." [...] Singer and songwriter Thom Yorke worked on his first solo album, The Eraser (2006), and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood composed his first soundtracks, for Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007).|$|E
2500|$|President Richard Nixon made an unannounced {{visit to}} Xenia {{a few days}} later. It {{would be the first}} (and only) city {{affected}} by the 1974 Super Outbreak that he would visit. Upon inspecting the damage, he said: [...] "As I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the disasters, I saw the earthquake in Anchorage in 1964; I saw the hurricanes... Hurricane Camille in 1969 down in Mississippi, and I saw Hurricane Agnes in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. And it is hard to tell the difference among them all, but I would say in terms of destruction, just total devastation, this is the worst I have seen." [...] President Nixon immediately declared Xenia a disaster area. Although the Federal Disaster Relief Act was already introduced in 1973, it still had not passed Congress. The 1974 Super Outbreak disaster was a catalyst for accelerated passage of the act through Congress in 1974, according to Nixon. It took several months for the city to recover from the tornado, {{with the help of the}} Red Cross and the Ohio National Guard assisting the recovery efforts. Most of the town was quickly re-built afterward. In recognition of their coverage of the tornado under difficult circumstances, the staff of the Xenia Daily Gazette won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting in 1975. The Xenia tornado was one of two rated F5 that affected Ohio during the outbreak, the other striking the Cincinnati area (see Cincinnati/Sayler Park area tornado, below). [...] Xenia was later struck by two other tornadoes—both a smaller one in April 1989 and a larger one in September 2000, which was an F4 twister that killed one and injured about 100 in an area parallel to and just north of the 1974 path. Before the 1974 storm, the city had no tornado sirens. After the F5 tornado hit on April 3, 1974, ten sirens were installed across the area.|$|E

There were moments when I held and kissed them, when something within me melted: moments when I was away from them, and thought of them. But these moments did not last. The something within me hardened again, I became indifferent, my family was wiped out of my consciousness as though it had never existed.|$|E
