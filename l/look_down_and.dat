500|$|It was August 20 by {{the time}} that they reached a point in the {{mountains}} where they could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see the Great Salt Lake. [...] It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Mountains. The men began to argue, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular James Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families.

2500|$|In {{the second}} act, with all {{lighting}} but the storm lanterns failed, they return. Annabel notices {{the letter is}} forged, meaning they killed Alice for nothing. Annabel thinks she hears some scratching from the well. Miriam <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> says Alice must be dead, but Annabel's anxiety increases further. Miriam starts telling of the spooky things that used to happen, saying [...] "Who's coming up the stairs?" [...] and [...] "Who's going to kiss you goodnight" [...] and starts on a [...] "ghost story". Twelve years old, she sneaked {{out of the house}} to go to a party with, in her father's words, [...] "unsavoury youths", partied away in a silver dress and got propositioned by three boys she didn't fancy. When she returned, her father was waiting in the garden for his disobedient daughter, he would have to “punish” Miriam said she chose to be punished in the garden over indoor, but the punishment was worse ... before she finishes with [...] "Wasn't that a good ghost story!" ...|$|E

60|$|The two {{men looked}} at each other, and each felt it {{incumbent}} to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> sigh deeply--not hypocritically, but perfunctorily, as over a past grief, although anger had been the dominant expression of the speaker.|$|E
60|$|Two Prussian corps {{had passed}} {{and a third}} was coming up, when I heard a great fuss {{and the sound of}} several voices in the sitting-room. By {{altering}} my position I was able to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> see what was going on.|$|E

60|$|The princess rode {{up without}} seeing {{anything}} to frighten her, when a sudden {{puff of smoke}} and flame from beneath her feet, caused her to <b>look</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> there was the horrible creature twisted and writhing, its twelve heads reared up as if to seize her between them.|$|E
60|$|The breeze blew fresher and fresher; but, {{with even}} our main-royal set, we dashed along through a cream-coloured ocean of {{illuminated}} foam.

60|$|Anne, {{looking over}} the Princess's head, feared that she saw a twinkle in the man's eye, and could only <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> try to ignore him through the {{catechism}} that ensued, on {{when she came to}} Whitehall, on the Prince of Wales's health, the management of him, and all the circumstances connected with his birth.|$|E

60|$|I {{failed to}} {{recognize}} him, but before I could speak I trod upon something that was alive and that squirmed under my foot.
