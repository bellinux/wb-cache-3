2500|$|This {{economic}} {{growth has been}} primarily attributed to strong commodity prices, particularly mineral but also agricultural, with the high demand for mineral products largely sustained even during the crisis by the buoyant Asian markets a booming mining sector, and particularly since 2009 by a buoyant outlook and the construction phase for natural gas exploration, production, and exportation in liquefied form (Liquefied Natural Gas or [...] "LNG") by LNG tankers (<b>LNG</b> <b>carrier),</b> all of which will require multibillion-dollar investments (exploration, production wells, pipelines, storage, liquefaction plants, port terminals, LNG tanker ships).|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the [...] <b>LNG</b> <b>carrier</b> Ob River {{became the}} first ship of its kind to transit the Northern Sea Route. The vessel {{completed}} the westbound voyage in ballast in only six days and planned to sail back in Asia in November with a full load of liquified natural gas. The growth in traffic has been startling. 46 ships sailed the entire length from Europe to East Asia during 2012. By July 2013, the administrators of the Northern Sea Route had granted permission to 204 ships to sail during the season. By that time, Arctic sea ice had declined substantial especially on the Atlantic side of the Arctic. [...] "On July 15 extent came within 540,000 square kilometers (208,000 square miles) of that seen in 2012 on the same date... (Compared to the 1981 to 2010 average, ice extent on July 15, 2013 was 1.06 million square kilometers (409,000 square miles) below average.)" [...] (Summer 2012 Arctic sea ice volume reached a record low.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of small scale <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> (<b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> below 40,000 cbms), the optimal size of a ship is {{determined}} by the project for which it is built, taking into consideration volume, destination and vessel characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] is the world's first LNG powered {{container}} ship. <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> {{are sometimes}} {{powered by the}} boil-off of LNG from their storage tanks, although Diesel powered <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> are also common to minimize loss of cargo and enable more versatile refueling.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, {{the size}} and {{capacity}} of <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> has increased greatly. Since 2005, Qatargas has pioneered the development of two new classes of <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers,</b> referred to as Q-Flex and Q-Max. Each ship has a cargo capacity of between [...] and {{is equipped with a}} re-liquefaction plant.|$|R
2500|$|LNG is transported {{using both}} tanker truck, railway tanker, and purpose built ships known as LNG carriers. LNG will be {{sometimes}} taken to cryogenic temperatures {{to increase the}} tanker capacity. The first commercial ship-to-ship transfer (STS) transfers were undertaken in February 2007 at the Flotta facility in Scapa Flow with 132,000 m3 of LNG being passed between the vessels Excalibur and Excelsior. [...] Transfers have also been carried out by Exmar Shipmanagement, the Belgian gas tanker owner in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved the transfer of LNG from a conventional <b>LNG</b> <b>carrier</b> to an LNG regasification vessel (LNGRV). Prior to this commercial exercise LNG had only ever been transferred between ships {{on a handful of}} occasions as a necessity following an incident. SIGTTO - the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators is the responsible body for LNG operators around the world and seeks to disseminate knowledge regarding the safe transport of LNG at sea.|$|E
2500|$|The Cleveland plant failed on October 20, 1944 {{when the}} {{cylindrical}} tank ruptured spilling thousands {{of gallons of}} LNG over the plant and nearby neighborhood. The gas evaporated and caught fire, which caused 130 fatalities. The fire delayed further implementation of LNG facilities for several years. However, over the next 15 years new research on low-temperature alloys, and better insulation materials, {{set the stage for}} a revival of the industry. It restarted in 1959 when a U.S. World War II Liberty ship, the Methane Pioneer, converted to carry LNG, made a delivery of LNG from the U.S. Gulf coast to energy starved Great Britain. In June 1964, the world's first purpose-built <b>LNG</b> <b>carrier,</b> the [...] "Methane Princess" [...] entered service. Soon after that a large natural gas field was discovered in Algeria. International trade in LNG quickly followed as LNG was shipped to France and Great Britain from the Algerian fields. One more important attribute of LNG had now been exploited. Once natural gas was liquefied it could not only be stored more easily, but it could be transported. Thus energy could now be shipped over the oceans via LNG the same way it was shipped by oil.|$|E
50|$|At the {{opposite}} (discharge and regasification) {{end of the}} LNG chain, the first ever conversion of an <b>LNG</b> <b>carrier,</b> Golar LNG owned Moss type <b>LNG</b> <b>carrier</b> into an LNG floating storage and regasification unit {{was carried out in}} 2007 by Keppel shipyard in Singapore.|$|E
40|$|In {{the global}} {{demand for the}} {{environment}} friendly energy, LNG based trade has been increasing steadily, and demand for <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> by customers has become more diversified. Under these circumstances, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) has established the building record of Moss type <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers,</b> and also has been carrying out the technical developments, repair, and maintenance work of membrane <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> first started in the 1970 s. Thanks to the customer's evaluation for those activities, MHI was awarded the contract for six large membrane ships in 1999, which were the first large sized ships {{to be built in}} Japan. These ships were built and delivered by 2004 by MHI. Advanced design and building methods with new technologies were incorporated in the building of these ships which were endorsed by spherical tank technique as well. Accordingly, the most advanced and distinguished, largest class membrane type <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> in the world were completed. Now MHI is continuing work {{on the development of the}} next generation <b>LNG</b> <b>carriers</b> to meet the further needs of customers. 1...|$|R
