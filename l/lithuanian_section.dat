40|$|Integrated {{correlation}} of bentonites (altered volcanic ashes) and graptolite biozonation is presented. Detailed study of two <b>Lithuanian</b> drill core <b>sections</b> extended previous {{knowledge of the}} occurrence and composition of bentonites to the south. Identification of graptolite species allowed bentonites to be assigned their proper stratigraphical position. Silurian bentonites in Lithuania are mostly characterized by wide and very wide XRD 201 reflections of {{the main component of}} sanidine phenocrysts. Only fourteen of the 69 samples studied contained sanidine with a sharp reflection, which gave the best correlation potential. In the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>sections</b> one bentonite was found in the Rhuddanian, five bentonites were recognized in the Aeronian, 17 bentonites in the Telychian, 26 in the Sheinwoodian, 10 in the Homerian and six in the Ludlow. All bentonites found in Lithuania are characterized by the main component of sanidine. A large number of Lithuanian bentonites are not known in Latvia and Estonia, indicating that volcanic ashes reached the East Baltic area from two source regions – the Central European and Norwegian Caledonides...|$|R

50|$|Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (Lietuvos demokratinė darbo partija, LDDP) was {{a social}} {{democratic}} political party in Lithuania, {{that emerged from the}} <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>section</b> of the CPSU in December 1989 LDDP was led by Algirdas Brazauskas, the first president of independent Lithuania. Because Brazauskas was elected as the first president, he was required to stop his activities in any parties. Adolfas Šleževičius became the party leader and the Prime Minister. After Šleževičius was charged with corruption, he was replaced by Česlovas Juršėnas.The LDDP won the 1992 parliamentary elections, gaining 43% of the vote giving it 73 seats in the Seimas. In 1996 Seimas elections, LDDP got about 9.5% of the votes and won 10 seats in the parliament. In 2000 elections LDDP formed a coalition with other three parties named after Algirdas Brazauskas and won majority of the votes.

40|$|The KG B of the Lithuanian S. S. R. devoted {{most of its}} {{attention}} to those Lithuanian emigrants to Europe and their organizations about which it had the most information. In comparison to other countries West Germany had the most favorable conditions for carrying out subversive activities. There were more Lithuanian organizations there than in other West European countries, and Soviet security services had acquired work experience there from 1945 onwards. That’s why the KG B monitored more organizations and persons in West Germany than in other European countries. The main objects of interest for Soviet security investigations were the local chapters of the World Lithuanian Community. Together with other departments of the Soviet KG B the <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>section</b> also monitored Radio Liberty and the Baltic Institute in Sweden. Even though it tried the KG B was unable to create any network of agents worth menti oning from among the Lithuanian emigrants who for a longer or shorter time settled in Western Europe. The most intense recruiting efforts were directed at those who had repatriated to West Germany, with the KG B trying to infiltrate secret collaborators {{into the ranks of}} the repatriated. A frequently used method of pressure was the discrediting of people and organizations. Attempts were made to exploit the reality of World War II crimes and to depict certain people as secret agents of security services. This went hand in hand with attempts to create as favorable an image of Soviet Lithuania as possible among the emigrants living in Western Europe. But despite their efforts Soviet security operatives did not reach their initial goals: not a single emigrant organization discontinued its activities or swerved from its...|$|E
