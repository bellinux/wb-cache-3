500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Insane Clown Posse albums, The Tempest is {{not connected}} to the Dark Carnival mythology, which {{formed the basis for}} ICP's [...] "Joker's Cards" [...] series, which began in 1992 with Carnival of Carnage and concluded with the albums [...] and Hell's Pit; however, it references themes, concepts and songs from previous albums. Joseph Bruce (Violent J) said that The Tempest is a concept album in its own right. Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster. According to Bruce, [...] "That's a lot <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> on a violent roller coaster, I'd assume. You get jerked to the left, jerked to the right, sucked way up into the sky, and then you go shooting down to the floor, and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, The Tempest is a storm {{in the form of a}} roller coaster." [...] As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods.|$|E
500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (<b>like</b> <b>riding</b> animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). It seems reasonable to conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 6, Psy {{appeared}} at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards performing his [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] dance alongside comedian Kevin Hart. After the event, he would make several more appearances on US TV programs. On September 10, he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in Burbank, California, introducing himself as [...] "Psy from Korea", before teaching Britney Spears the dance. He described the dance as [...] "pretending to bounce <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> on an invisible horse" [...] and when Ellen told Britney {{she would have to}} remove her high-heeled shoes to perform the dance Psy protested that no, the point was, 'to dress classy, and dance cheesy.' On September 14, he appeared on NBC's morning program Today in New York City for its Toyota Concert Series, where he performed the song and also taught the anchors the dance. The September 15 season premiere episode of Saturday Night Live featured a sketch based on the song and its video. Bobby Moynihan portrayed Psy, but was joined mid-sketch by Psy himself. He also made his second appearance on The Ellen Shows September 19 episode to perform the song along with his backup dancers. On September 22, Psy made an appearance at the iHeartRadio Music Festival to perform [...] "Gangnam Style". Psy, dressed in a black jacket, blue pants, two-tone shoes and his signature shades, appeared on the US national TV show The View on October 25 and performed the song for Barbara Walters and the ladies of the show who donned sunglasses and got out of their seats.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{evolution}} of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle manoeuvres <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> on only two wheels ("wheelie" [...] or [...] "manual"), spinning only on the back wheels (a [...] "pivot"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, {{also known as a}} [...] "hippie jump", long jumping from one board to another, (often over small barrels or fearless teenagers), or slalom. Another popular trick was the Bertlemann slide, named after Larry Bertelemann's surfing manoeuvres.|$|E
2500|$|Respectively {{equivalent}} to syntagmatic and paradigmatic are the terms [...] "diachronic" [...] and [...] "synchronic". Diachronic covers {{the sort of}} analysis that conveys a sense of traversing the highs and lows of a story, <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> the pattern of a sine wave. The second term, synchronic, is where the story is instead absorbed as a whole, like the pattern of a circle. Most literary analyses are synchronic, offering {{a greater sense of}} unity among the components of a story. Although both structural analyses convey partial information about the story, each angle of analysis delivers a different set of information.|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Cohan and {{his family}} toured {{most of the year}} and spent summer {{vacations}} from the vaudeville circuit at his grandmother's home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, where Cohan befriended baseball player Connie Mack. The family generally gave a performance at the town hall there each summer, and Cohan had a chance to gain some more normal childhood experiences, <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> his bike and playing sandlot baseball. Cohan's memories of those happy summers inspired his 1907 musical 50 Miles from Boston, which is set in North Brookfield and contains one of his most famous songs, “Harrigan". As Cohan matured through his teens, he used the quiet summers there to write. When he returned to the town in the cast of Ah, Wilderness! in 1934, he told a reporter, [...] "I've knocked around everywhere, but there's no place like North Brookfield." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a sanctioning body then new to BMX, it {{was pretty}} {{efficient}} in terms of running an event (taking into consideration the multiple qualifying runs). However, because of its inexperience it was plagued with tracks of inferior quality, {{both in terms of}} difficulty, they were deemed far too easy for venues of an international event; and the building materials used, for example during the 1988 Championships in Mol, Belgium the track was built out of white sand, which became particularly boggy in the turns. [...] "It feels <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> on the beach" [...] was a refrain from many American racers. This inexperience of track construction was rectified by 1991 when the FIAC and the IBMXF started holding combined World Championship series in 1991 after four years of holding separate championship events. The two bodies formally unified in 1993 (FICP was disbanded along with the FIAC by the UCI). After a three-year transition period, The UCI held its first World Championship in 1996 after absorbing the IBMXF and abolishing FIAC. With the increasing relaxation of the rules of Professionalism in the IOC, the merged governing body, run directly by the UCI, retained the professional division.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient times, when Wang Liang and Zaofu went driving, [...] they mounted their chariots {{and took}} hold of the reins, the horses set {{themselves}} in order and wanted to work together. They obediently paced in step with one another; [...] pulling hard or easing off, they were as one. Their hearts were in tune and their qi harmonious; their bodies [...] more and more light and coordinated. They were content to work hard and happy to go forward; they galloped away as if they would vanish. They went right and left like [...] a whip; they circled around like a jade bracelet. All people of that era considered [...] to be superlative , but that was because they had not yet seen any [...] worthy ones. Now consider the charioteering of Qian Qie and Da Bing. They considered reins and bits superfluous, got rid of whips and cast aside goads. Before the chariot began to move, it was starting on its own. Before the horses were given the signal, they were walking on their own. They paced [...] sun and moved [...] moon. They flashed [...] stars and advanced [...] dark. They raced [...] lightning and leaped [...] ghosts. Advancing or withdrawing, gathering strength or stretching out, they did not see the slightest barrier. Thus, with no gesturing or pointing, with no cursing or scolding, they overtook the wild geese flying to Piled Stone Mountain, passed the jungle fowl [...] Guyu Mountain. Their galloping was like flying; their bursts of speed like thread snapping. [...] <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> an arrow or mounting the wind, like following a cyclone and returning in an instant. At dawn they started from Fusang and set with the sun at Luotang. This was taking something unused and obtaining its usefulness: it was not done by examining things through reason or thought or through the exercise of manual skill. Whenever urgent desires took form in the breasts , their quintessential spirits were [...] communicated to the six horses. This was a case of using non-driving to go driving. (6.6, tr.

2500|$|While record-breaking {{years can}} attract {{considerable}} public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists {{have criticized the}} attention that the popular press gives to [...] "warmest year" [...] statistics; for example, Gavin Schmidt stated [...] "the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are {{far more important than}} whether any single year is a record or not." [...] Of the 2015 and 2016 records, Schmidt stated that the 2014–16 El Niño event was [...] "a factor ... but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it"; he attributed about 90% of the warming in 2016 to anthropogenic climate change. [...] Consistent with Schmidt's comment, the NASA / NOAA announcement stated that [...] "lobally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean" [...] and that the impact of El Niño warming was estimated to have [...] "increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)." [...] Comments from climate scientists reported in The Washington Post showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change, with some contribution from El Niño warming, though there were differing views on the significance of individual records. [...] Deke Arndt leads the monitoring group at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and offered an analogy in a report on NPR: [...] "The long-term warming is a lot <b>like</b> <b>riding</b> up an escalator over time. The longer you're on the escalator, the higher you go. And the El Niño phenomenon is like jumping up and down while you're on the escalator." [...] Arndt also stated that the [...] "long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases." [...] Peter Stott, acting director of the Met Office, noted the influence of the El Niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that [...] "the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere." [...] Tim Osborn, Director of Research at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, agreed stating that [...] "ultiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years: warmer oceans, warmer land, warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice. This long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016, surpassing all previous years – even ones with strong El Niño events." ...|$|E
