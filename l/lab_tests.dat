National Renewable Energy Laboratory <b>lab</b> <b>tests</b> of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Surkin, {{who ran the}} {{intensive}} care unit at Tel Aviv Medical Centre, wondered whether a toxin might be the culprit behind the infections. He contacted David Pargament, chief of the Yarkon River Authority, who explained that 36 hours before the collapse, mosquito larvicide oil, a mixture of jet fuel and oil, had been sprayed {{on the surface of the}} Yarkon to suppress mosquitoes.

25|$|The {{evidence}} for ectomycorrhizal priming {{is so far}} inconclusive. Field evidence suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi may be increasing the rate of soil carbon degradation, however <b>lab</b> <b>tests</b> show that exudation from fine roots decreases with increasing ectomycorrhizal colonization, which suggests that abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi should reduce priming effects. Brzostek et al. (2012) report variation in form of nitrogen produced in the rhizosphere of trees that vary in mycorrhizal type, however the effects of root and mycorrhizal priming could not be separated.|$|E

25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the <b>lab</b> <b>tests,</b> but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step on the brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E

Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced <b>lab</b> <b>tests</b> from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion. By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a [...] "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".|$|E
500|$|Reckless's {{entry into}} the United States was not without its challenges. The Customs Bureau was {{not much of a}} problem but the United States Department of Agriculture insisted a medical check and <b>lab</b> <b>tests</b> be {{completed}} before she disembarked from the ship once it reached San Francisco, which would make her late for the Marine banquet where she was to be the guest of honor. The Marines contacted Agriculture Department officials in Washington, D.C. who agreed to allow her off the ship after her blood was drawn for <b>lab</b> <b>tests,</b> with the understanding that if she had glanders or dourine, she would be destroyed or sent back to Japan. Many of the Marines who actually knew her were incensed at what they considered an affront to her honor when they learned that dourine was an equine sexually transmitted disease. The night before she arrived, she once again ate her blanket, but a new one with ribbons and insignia was made just in time for her disembarkation. She was led off the ship by Lieutenant Pedersen and set foot on American soil in San Francisco on November 10, 1954, coincidentally the birthday of the [...] Marine Corps. For the Marine Corps Birthday Ball held that day, she rode an elevator, and then ate both cake and the flower decorations.|$|E

500|$|In May 2014, Nestlé Purina Petcare began a {{legal dispute}} with Blue Buffalo {{regarding}} its advertising practices. In 2015, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Purina, {{claiming that the}} dog food manufactured by the company was hazardous for pets. Blue Buffalo advertised that its products contain no meat byproduct or corn, whereas Purina said independent <b>lab</b> <b>tests</b> confirmed that they do. Blue Buffalo made similar allegations against Purina in a counter-suit {{less than a week}} later. It also alleged Purina was engaging in what it characterized as a [...] "smear campaign". The National Advertising Review Board and the [...] Advertising Self-Regulatory Council found that Blue Buffalo's advertising was misleading and its claims that competitors were hiding information about their ingredients were unsubstantiated. Blue Buffalo said it disagreed, but would obey the ruling.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013 Purina {{recalled}} {{some of its}} Purina ONE Beyond dog food, {{because of}} one bag that was found to contain salmonella. In 2012 a consumer sued Nestlé Purina Petcare when his pet died after eating Waggin' Train treats. The Food and Drug Administration received more than 900 reports from grieving pet owners that alleged the treat was causing illness or death in their pets due to chicken products from China. The FDA had issued warnings regarding these ingredients, but <b>lab</b> <b>tests</b> repeatedly confirmed there were no contaminants. Later that year, another consumer started a petition on Change.org asking retailers to voluntarily stop carrying the product. The petition attracted 60,000 signatures. The following year, Waggin' Train and Canyon Creek dog treats were voluntarily taken off the market temporarily after the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets identified trace amounts of antibiotic residue, which is allowed in Europe and China, but not approved in the US. In early 2014, a $6.5 million settlement was reached, pending approval by the court.
