Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam.

The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E

50|$|After oral {{administration}} of <b>loprazolam</b> {{on an empty}} stomach, it takes 2 hours for serum concentration levels to peak, significantly longer than other benzodiazepine hypnotics. This delay brings into question the benefit of <b>loprazolam</b> {{for the treatment of}} insomnia when compared to other hypnotics (particularly when the major complaint is difficulty falling asleep instead of difficulty maintaining sleep for the entire night), although some studies show that <b>loprazolam</b> may induce sleep within half an hour, indicating rapid penetration into the brain. The peak plasma delay of <b>loprazolam,</b> therefore, may not be relevant to loprazolam's efficacy as a hypnotic. If taken after a meal it can take even longer for <b>loprazolam</b> plasma levels to peak and peak levels may be lower than normal. <b>Loprazolam</b> significantly alters electrical activity in the brain as measured by EEG, with these changes becoming more pronounced as the dose increases.

50|$|Insomnia can be {{described}} as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. <b>Loprazolam</b> is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or have difficulty falling asleep.

50|$|<b>Loprazolam,</b> {{like all}} other benzodiazepines, is {{recommended}} only for the short-term management of insomnia in the UK, owing {{to the risk of}} serious adverse effects such as tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, as well as adverse effects on mood and cognition.

50|$|Flurazepam {{is officially}} {{indicated}} for {{mild to moderate}} insomnia and as such it is used for short-term treatment of patients with mild to moderate insomnia such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings {{or a combination of}} each.

50|$|<b>Loprazolam</b> is a benzodiazepine, {{which acts}} via {{positively}} modulating the GABAA receptor complex via a binding to the benzodiazepine receptor which is situated on alpha subunit containing GABAA receptors.

This action allows more chloride ions to enter the neuron which in turn produces such effects as; muscle relaxation, anxiolytic, hypnotic, amnesic and anticonvulsant action. These properties can be used for therapeutic benefit in clinical practice. These properties are also sometimes used for recreational purposes in the form of drug abuse of benzodiazepines where high doses are used to achieve intoxication and or sedation.|$|E

40|$|A double-blind, {{parallel}} group, randomized {{trial was}} carried out to compare the hypnotic efficacy, tolerance and psychometric effects of two doses of <b>loprazolam</b> and placebo in 89 elderly hospital in-patients.

The sleep of patients in all three treatment groups, as measured by patient self-rating scales, substantially improved during the study, with <b>loprazolam</b> being superior to placebo for measures of sleep latency, satisfaction with sleep, number of nocturnal awakenings and feeling refreshed on waking. Differences in hypnotic efficacy between the 0. 5 mg and 1. 0 mg <b>loprazolam</b> groups were not significant. The incidence of side-effects was low and, although there was a significant relationship with <b>loprazolam</b> treatment, this was not dose-related. Performance tests for residual effects (critical flicker fusion threshold and choice reaction time) showed no difference between the placebo and active treatment groups, suggesting that <b>loprazolam,</b> even in a dose of 1. 0 mg, is unlikely to produce hangover effects.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a new 1, 4 {{benzodiazepine}} hypnotic, <b>loprazolam</b> (1. 0 mg) and alcohol (0. 7 g/kg body weight) were investigated over a 15 h period in eight healthy male medical students, in a placebo controlled balanced design. <b>Loprazolam</b> when given alone impaired performance on a manual dexterity task, on a test of mental arithmetic, on a tracking task and it impaired memory as judged by {{the name and address}} memory test. Given alone, alcohol impaired performance on the simple reaction time task and on the tracking task. Performance on the memory test and choice reaction time test actually improved. No evidence was found suggesting a potentiation of effect when <b>loprazolam</b> and alcohol were given together. However, (a) on the manual dexterity task the alcohol, having no effect on its own, alleviated the loprazolam-induced impairment. (b) In the tracking task both alcohol and <b>loprazolam</b> impaired performance when given alone but not when given together. (c) The memory test was impaired by <b>loprazolam,</b> improved by alcohol and the effect of the combination is the expected sum of the two effects. Similarly for the arithmetic task the effect of the combination of the alcohol and <b>loprazolam</b> effects is the expected sum of the independent effects.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that older adults have more difficulty maintaining sleep than younger adults, and that sleep also becomes more fragmented with increasing age. The aim of this thesis was to assess sleep patterns in older adults, and to investigate some pharmacological agents taken by older adults as sleep aids. A survey of 5846 older adults identified sleep complaints and methods of alleviation. Results supported previous findings, and pain and nocturia {{were found to be}} the main reasons for nocturnal awakenings. Respondents reported the use of hypnotics, antidepressants, over-the-counter preparations and herbal remedies as sleep aids. Respondents also used whisky, hot milky drinks and reading at bedtime to aid sleep. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials were implemented to assess the effects of a herbal remedy (valerian), three hypnotics (<b>loprazolam,</b> zopiclone and zolpidem), and two antidepressants (dothiepin and moclobemide) on sleep and daytime performance. Results showed few advantageous effects of an acute dose of valerian. <b>Loprazolam,</b> zopiclone and zolpidem were given to younger adults to assess these treatments without the confounds of old age. These treatments were found to be effective hypnotics from the first night of use, but there were more residual sedative effects under <b>loprazolam</b> than zopiclone or zolpidem. Neither dothiepin nor moclobemide were found to be suitable for use as sleep aids, also using a younger population. Findings indicate most older adults do not have sleep complaints, but those who do are likely to have sleep problems due to physical reasons. More research is necessary into the duration of valerian use and doses for efficacy. Residual sedative effects under <b>loprazolam</b> may increase the risk of accidents, and shorter acting hypnotics, such as zopiclone and zolpidem, may reduce this risk. Dothiepin showed more sedative effect than moclobemide, but there was little evidence of improved sleep.

This drug undergoes three different reduction steps. The first, a four‐electron transfer, corresponds to {{the reduction of the}} nitro group to give the corresponding hydroxylamine. The second, a two‐electron transfer, corresponds to the reduction of the azomethine group, either before or after (in an acidic solution) hydrolysis. The third wave corresponds to a four‐electron transfer in an acidic medium and to a two‐electron transfer in an alkaline medium. In an acidic solution, this third step involves the two‐electron reduction of the hydroxylamine group to the corresponding amine plus the two‐electron reduction of the double bond between N‐methylpiperazine and the imidazol group. In an alkaline solution, only the latter reduction takes place. Such behavior holds promise for analytical measurements of the drug. Copyright © 1990 VCH Publishers, Inc.

40|$|Editorial Group: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. Published Online: 18 JAN 2012. Assessed as up-to-date: 6 SEP 2011 BACKGROUND Pain {{management}} {{is a high}} priority for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Muscle relaxants include drugs that reduce muscle spasm (for example benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and non-benzodiazepines such as metaxalone (Skelaxin) or a combination of paracetamol and orphenadrine (Muscol)) and drugs that prevent increased muscle tone (baclofen and dantrolene). Despite a paucity of evidence supporting their use, antispasmodic and antispasticity muscle relaxants have gained widespread clinical acceptance as adjuvants in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to determine the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants in pain management in patients with RA. The muscle relaxants that were included in this review are the antispasmodic benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide,cinolazepam, clonazepam, cloxazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, <b>loprazolam,</b> lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, pinazepam, prazepam, quazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam), antispasmodic non-benzodiazepines (cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, meprobamate, methocarbamol, metaxalone, orphenadrine, tizanidine and zopiclone), and antispasticity drugs (baclofen and dantrolene sodium). SEARCH METHODS We performed a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 4 th quarter 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to week 1 November 2010), EMBASE (Week 44 2010), and PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 November 2010). We also searched the 2008 to 2009 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials which compared a muscle relaxant to another therapy (active, including non-pharmacological therapies, or placebo) in adult patients with RA and that reported at least one clinically relevant outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two blinded review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta-analyses were used to examine the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain, depression, sleep and function, as well as their safety. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (126 participants) were included in this review. All trials were rated at high risk of bias. Five cross-over trials evaluated a benzodiazepine, four assessed diazepam (n = 71) and one assessed triazolam (n = 15). The sixth trial assessed zopiclone (a non-benzodiazepine) (n = 40) and was a parallel group study. No trial duration was longer than two weeks while three single dose trials assessed outcomes at 24 hours only. Overall the included trials failed to find evidence of a beneficial effect of muscle relaxants over placebo, alone (at 24 hrs, 1 or 2 weeks) or in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (at 24 hrs), on pain intensity, function, or quality of life. Data from two trials of longer than 24 hours duration (n = 74) (diazepam and zopiclone) found that participants who received a muscle relaxant had significantly more adverse events compared with those who received placebo (number needed to harm (NNTH) 3, 95 % CI 2 to 7). These were predominantly central nervous system side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness (NNTH 3, 95 % CI 2 to 11). AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Based upon the currently available evidence in patients with RA, benzodiazepines (diazepam and triazolam) {{do not appear to be}} beneficial in improving pain over 24 hours or one week. The non-benzodiazepine agent zopiclone also did not significantly reduce pain over two weeks. However, even short term muscle relaxant use (24 hours to 2 weeks) is associated with significant adverse events, predominantly drowsiness and dizziness.
