5|$|Lanthanum oxide {{is a white}} solid {{that can}} be {{prepared}} by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> is evolved in the reaction and a hissing sound is heard. Lanthanum hydroxide will react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the basic carbonate.|$|E
5|$|The Sun formed about 4.6 {{billion years}} ago from the {{collapse}} of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars. This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology. The result {{is consistent with the}} radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 {{billion years ago}}. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity. As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion. Thus, the Sun was born.|$|E

25|$|In {{a vacuum}} or in outer space, {{there is no}} {{convective}} heat transfer, thus in these environments, radiation is the only factor governing heat flow between the heat sink and the environment.

25|$|For {{profitable}} hemp farming, particularly deep, humus-rich, nutrient-rich {{soil with}} controlled water flow is preferable. Waterlogged acidic, compressed or extremely light (sandy) soils primarily affect the early development of plants. Steep and high altitudes {{of more than}} 400m above sea level are best avoided. Hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to −5°C. Seeds can germinate down to 1–3°C. Hemp needs a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat,</b> so earlier varieties come to maturation. The water requirement is 300–500l/kg dry matter. Up to 3 feet growing roots into the soil can also use water supplies from deeper soil layers.

I killed five or six of them, and found that some of the young ones were furry enough to make coats of. As I was sitting on the ground by them next morning, lamenting I had nothing to boil down their blubber in, an idea struck me. I might use the blubber as candles, sticking wicks into it. I set to work and stripped the blubber off all the seals, and cut it in squares of about six inches. Then I got a bit of one of the fresh skins, bent it up all round, of the right size for the squares to fit into, fastened it, and spread it on the rocks to dry. The thought of how I was to make wicks bothered me. I could not spare my clothes. At last, after trying different things, I found that some of the grass was very tough. I put a bundle of this in a pool, and let it lay there for a week; for I was a North of Ireland boy, and knew how they worked flax. At the end of that time I took it out, let it dry, and then bruised it between flat stones, and found that it had a tough fibre. I thanked God, and picked a lot more of it and put it to soak. You may guess I tried the experiment that night; I made six big wicks and put them in one of the cakes of blubber and lighted them, and found that they burned famously and gave out a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b> I killed some more seals; {{and by the time the}} winter set in in earnest I had a stock of meat enough to last me for months, and two or three hundredweight of cakes of blubber.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and lighting {{characteristics of the}} LED depend on cooling condition because the power LED generates <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b> In this paper, the effect <b>of</b> the generated <b>heat</b> from power LED module on lighting characteristics and performance is measured and evaluated. For experiments, the transient temperature of a power LED module with cooling condition is measured. In addition, the temperature and lighting characteristics of the LED module are measured during the steady state. As a result, the cooling condition is less effective on the lighting characteristics of the LED module at rated current but the cooling condition extremely affects those of the LED module over the rated current. Because high temperature of the power LED module causes the low phosphor conversion, luminance efficiency becomes low and color temperature becomes high. When power LED module are driven over the rated condition, higher temperature {{is directly related to}} lighting characteristics an...|$|R
