5|$|After the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of <b>Luanda,</b> and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and <b>Luanda.</b> South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. Zaire, in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards Zaire. The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital <b>Luanda.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the Portuguese Air Force sent 25 {{of their}} {{remaining}} F-84G to Angola. There they formed the Esquadra 91 (91st Squadron), based at <b>Luanda</b> Air Base. From then on, the F-84s {{were engaged in}} the Angolan Theater of the Portuguese Overseas War, being mainly employed in air strike missions against the separatist guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 15th century, Portuguese {{settlers}} {{made contact}} with the Kongo Empire, maintaining a continuous presence in its territory and enjoying considerable cultural and religious influence thereafter. In 1575, Portugal established a settlement and fort called Saint Paul of <b>Luanda</b> on the coast south of the Kongo Empire, in an area inhabited by Ambundu people. Another fort, Benguela, was established on the coast further south, in a region inhabited by ancestors of the Ovimbundu people.|$|E

5|$|In early November 1975, the South African {{government}} warned Savimbi and Roberto {{that the}} South African Defence Force (SADF) would soon end operations in Angola despite {{the failure of}} the coalition to capture <b>Luanda</b> and therefore secure international recognition for their government. Savimbi, desperate to avoid the withdrawal of South Africa, asked General Constand Viljoen to arrange a meeting for him with Prime Minister of South Africa John Vorster, who had been Savimbi's ally since October 1974. On the night of 10 November, the day before the formal declaration of independence, Savimbi secretly flew to Pretoria to meet Vorster. In a reversal of policy, Vorster not only agreed to keep his troops in Angola through November, but also promised to withdraw the SADF only after the OAU meeting on 9 December. The Soviets, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into <b>Luanda</b> the week before independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on 12 November. The Soviet leadership expressly forbade the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa.|$|E
5|$|There was {{an exodus}} {{from rural areas}} {{in most of the}} country. Today the urban {{population}} represents slightly {{more than half of the}} population, according to the latest census. In many cases, people went into cities outside the traditional area of their ethnic group. There are now important Ovimbundu communities in <b>Luanda,</b> Malanje, and Lubango. There has been a degree of return, but at a slow pace, while many younger people are reluctant to go to a rural life that they never knew.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to <b>Luanda</b> to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in <b>Luanda</b> attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him out of his car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E

Following the club's failure {{to participate in}} the 2014 women's league and cup due to financial reasons, Mecanagro, the club's major sponsor, announced that the club's basketball department had been discontinued. In January 2014, Universidade Lusíada announced that it would take over Juventude de Viana's basketball athletes and technical staff to form the women's wing of its own club. Until then, Universidade Lusíada only competed in the men's category. Juventude de Viana still competes in the sports of roller hockey and judo.|$|R

In the outdoor track season he ran 26:51.09 minutes for the 10,000m at the Prefontaine Classic and came close to a personal best with a win at the Barcelona Meeting {{with a time of}} 12:59.32 minutes. Making his fourth consecutive appearance in the event, he took fourth place in the men's 10,000m at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. He ended the year with road wins at the Porto Half Marathon and the São Silvestre de <b>Luanda,</b> setting course records of 59:30 minutes and 27:44 minutes, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} Portuguese {{settlement}} efforts was launched {{for the purpose}} of territorial conquest. It is true that both gradually came to occupy and farm a broad area around their initial bridgeheads (in the case of <b>Luanda,</b> mostly along the lower Kwanza River). However, their main function was trade – overwhelmingly the slave trade. Slaves were bought from African intermediaries and sold to Brazil and the Caribbean. In addition, Benguela developed a commerce in ivory, wax, and honey, which they bought from Ovimbundu caravans which fetched these goods from among the Ganguela peoples {{in the eastern part of}} what is now Angola.|$|E
5|$|President Steyn {{played a}} minor role in Operation Savannah, the South African covert {{intervention}} in the Angolan Civil War, most notably when she rescued 26 advisors to the National Liberation Front of Angola who had been cut off after a failed attack on <b>Luanda</b> on 28 November. To provide manpower for the French corvettes under construction, the ship was placed in reserve in early 1977. The United Nations arms embargo imposed later that year put paid to that plan and she was recommissioned the following year. Shortly before President Kruger was recommissioned on 15 August 1980, President Steyn was permanently decommissioned on 1 August, after the navy decided to only keep two of the sisters active.|$|E

By 21h00 on 1 August, the SAN submarine had rendezvoused with the two SAN strike craft and the attack team were transferred to the vessels. The two SAN would arrive back at Saldanha Bay on 3 August while the submarine would arrive back, after make repairs, on 7 August.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of independence, over 90% of the Angolan {{population}} was illiterate. Starting in June 1977, an educational programme began to take shape. 2,000 students were granted scholarships in Cuba and by 1987 there were 4,000 Angolan students studying on the [...] "Isla de la Juventud" [...] (Isle of Youth). In March 1978, the first Cuban 732-strong secondary school teacher brigade (Destacamento Pedagógico Internationalista) took up its work in Angola. These were later joined by 500 primary school teachers and 60 professors at <b>Luanda's</b> university. Through the 1980s the level was constantly held at about 2,000 teachers of all levels.|$|R
5000|$|Music {{and dance}} {{are central to}} the {{expression}} of angolanidade. Historian Marissa Moorman argues that it is [...] "in and through popular urban music, produced overwhelmingly in <b>Luanda's</b> musseques, that Angolan men and women forged the nation." [...] Angolan music began to be explicitly political in the 1950s, drawing from and supporting the budding Angolan liberation movements that were starting to take root. A number of members of Angolan bands were members of the MPLA, and their policical experiences informed their music, which in turn influenced the politics of their audiences. In choosing to use local instruments and national languages - primarily Kimbundu and Umbundu - in heir music, Angolan musicians rejected assimilation and reinforced the concept of angolanidade.|$|R
5|$|Since its {{formation}} in the 1950s, the MPLA's main social base {{has been among the}} Ambundu people and the multiracial intelligentsia of cities such as <b>Luanda,</b> Benguela and Huambo. During its anti-colonial struggle of 1962–74, the MPLA was supported by several African countries, {{as well as by the}} Soviet Union. Cuba became the MPLA's strongest ally, sending significant contingents of combat and support personnel to Angola. This support, as well as that of several other countries of the Eastern Bloc, e.g. Romania and East Germany, was maintained during the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|During the First Congo War, the Angolan {{government}} {{joined the}} coalition to overthrow Mobutu's government {{due to his}} support for UNITA. Mobutu's government fell to the opposition coalition on 16 May 1997. The Angolan government chose to act primarily through Katangese gendarmes called the Tigres, which were proxy groups formed from the descendents of police units who had been exiled from Zaire and thus were fighting {{for a return to}} their homeland. <b>Luanda</b> did also deploy regular troops. In early October 1997, Angola invaded the Republic of the Congo during its civil war, and helped Sassou Nguesso's rebels overthrow the government of Pascal Lissouba. Lissouba's government had allowed UNITA the use of cities in the Republic of Congo in order to circumvent sanctions. Between 11–12 October 1997, Angolan air force fighter jets conducted a number of air strikes on government positions within Brazzaville. On 16 October 1997 rebel militia supported by tanks and a force of 1,000 Angolan troops cemented their control of Brazzaville forcing Lisouba to flee. Angolan troops remained in the country fighting militia forces loyal to Lissouba engaged in a guerrilla war against the new government.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} Alves and the coup, the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) 8th Brigade broke into São Paulo prison on 27 May, killing the prison warden and freeing more than 150 Nitistas. The 8th brigade then {{took control of}} the radio station in <b>Luanda</b> and {{announced}} their coup, calling themselves the MPLA Action Committee. The brigade asked citizens to show their support for the coup by demonstrating in front of the presidential palace. The Nitistas captured Bula and Dangereaux, generals loyal to Neto, but Neto had moved his base of operations from the palace to the Ministry of Defence in fear of such an uprising. Cuban troops loyal to Neto retook the palace and marched to the radio station. The Cubans succeeded in taking the radio station and proceeded to the barracks of the 8th Brigade, recapturing it by 1:30p.m. While the Cuban force captured the palace and radio station, the Nitistas kidnapped seven leaders within the government and the military, shooting and killing six.|$|E

This significant development demonstrates Africa's growing contribution to the overall global energy security. This study examines the oil outlook of the major producers in the continent: Nigeria, Angola and Sudan. It also analyses the growing interdependence between major oil consuming nations (the United States, China and the European Union) and African producers. The contention is that increasing production from Africa and consolidating partnership with OPEC Members will contribute to global energy security and further enhance cooperation between producers and consumers.

50|$|Roberto {{spent the}} night of Angola's independence, 10 November, at his base in Ambriz, about 70 mi north of Quifangondo where he had {{maintained}} his command in the previous several months. When Roberto arrived near Quifangondo the next morning, he discovered some of his forces in disarray retreating north-east in fragmented groups. The capital's skyline had lit up with fireworks at midnight on 10 November in celebration of the country's independence from Portugal. FNLA troops on the ridge northeast of Quifangondo, who had never previously seen fireworks, saw the skyrockets on <b>Luanda's</b> skyline and panicked again, thinking they were more of the dreaded Cuban 122mm rockets that had hit their advancing column hard in the valley earlier in the day.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} human-rights groups operate in Angola, {{with some of}} them {{experiencing}} government interference. In 2008 the UNHRO closed its Angola office because the government, which had promised to work more closely with it, became less cooperative after winning a term on the UN Human Rights Council. In August 2011, according to Amnesty International, “immigration authorities at <b>Luanda’s</b> international airport refused entry into Angola to delegates of various civil society organizations who were to attend the Civil Society Forum of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), planned around the SADC Heads of State Summit. Arrangements had been made for them to receive visas upon arrival at the airport. Two Mozambican journalists who were to cover the Summit were also refused entry, despite having valid visas.” ...|$|R
5|$|The {{borders of}} German South-West Africa had been settled via {{treaties}} with Portugal (1886) and Britain (1890), but the coast line {{had not been}} surveyed in detail. Falke was tasked with locating a suitable port to connect to the capital at Windhuk. She departed <b>Luanda</b> on 23 January 1893 and arrived in Cape Cross four days later. The ship surveyed the area thoroughly, and discovered a Portuguese padrão. It had been placed there by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in the late 15th century. Falkes crew removed it {{to protect it from}} further weathering and placed a wooden cross to mark the location. The ship's crew received a period of rest from 14 to 16 March, after which time Falke steamed back to Kamerun, stopping in several ports along the way and arriving in Duala on 29 April. There, the stone monument was unloaded and later transported back to Berlin for preservation by the steamer , which departed Duala on 29 October. A granite copy, carried by the cruiser , was installed in its place in 1895.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{departed}} Portuguese civilians, many {{were able to}} take with them only a single suitcase, while some were able to dispatch their household goods and even cars by ship. The majority left everything behind. They boarded planes at <b>Luanda's</b> Craveiro Lopes Airport at the rate of 500 a day, but there were not enough flights to cover demand. On arrival in Portugal, those who had been able to draw their savings in Angola could not exchange more than 5,000 Angolan esculos (about USD 200) into Portuguese escudos. Back in Angola, the new government gave all remaining Portuguese settlers a few months period to choose between Angolan citizenship or to leave the country. A significant minority of them opted for Angola and some of them actively took part in the Civil War, generally {{on the side of the}} MPLA.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Cubans, the {{overriding}} priority of their mission in Angola was humanitarian, not military. In {{the wake of}} Operation Carlota, around 5,000 Cuban technical, medical and educational staff were constantly posted in Angola to fill the gaps the Portuguese had left behind. [...] "For a generation of Cubans, internationalist service in Angola represented the highest ideal of the Cuban Revolution" [...] and for many it became {{a normal part of}} life to volunteer for an internationalist mission, principally in Angola, which lasted 18 to 24 months. In the following years, tens of thousands of volunteers were processed each year. By 1978, Angola's health system was almost completely run by Cuban doctors. After the Portuguese left the country, there was only one doctor per 100,000 inhabitants. The Cubans posted a large medical team at <b>Luanda's</b> University and Prenda hospitals and opened clinics in remote areas all across Angola.|$|R
25|$|Given the {{limitations}} of the 3ª CCE to deal with the uprising in such a large region, the Command of the 3rd Military Region in <b>Luanda</b> decided to organize an operation with a stronger military force to subjugate it. A provisional battalion under the command of Major Rebocho Vaz was organized by the <b>Luanda</b> Infantry Regiment, integrating the 3ª CCE, the 4ª CCE (stationed in <b>Luanda)</b> and the 5ª CCE (that was still in route from the Metropole to Angola). On 4 February, the 4ª CCE was already embarked in the train ready to be dispatched to Malanje, when an uprising at <b>Luanda</b> erupted, with several prisons and Police facilities being stormed. Despite the indefinite situation at <b>Luanda</b> and despite having few combat units available there, General Libório, commander of the 3ª Military Region decided to go forward with the sending of the 4ª CCE to Malanje, which arrived there on 5 February. The provisional battalion started gradually the operations to subdue the uprising.|$|E

25|$|During the Portuguese Restoration War, the Dutch West India Company {{occupied}} the principal settlement of <b>Luanda</b> in 1641, using alliances with local peoples {{to carry out}} attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere. A fleet under Salvador de Sá retook <b>Luanda</b> in 1648; reconquest {{of the rest of}} the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with the Kongo were signed in 1649; others with Njinga's Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo followed in 1656. The conquest of Pungo Andongo in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from <b>Luanda,</b> as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from <b>Luanda</b> and Benguela were very limited. Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.|$|E
50|$|Angola has {{extensive}} {{hydroelectric power}} resources that far exceed its present needs. The Capanda Dam, on the Cuanza River, provides <b>Luanda's</b> industries with cheap power. Two dams on the Catumbela River produce {{power for the}} Lobito and Benguela areas (Lomaum Dam). Matala Dam 180 km of Lubango provides power to Lubango and Namibe. The Ruacaná Falls Dam, near the Namibian border, was completed in the late 1970s, but the power station is in Namibia. A 520 MW hydroelectric station on the Cuanza River at Kapanda was tentatively scheduled to have begun production in early 2003. As of late 2002, {{only three of the}} country's six dams (Cambambe, Biopo, and Matala) were operational; US$200 million has been allocated to repair the remaining dams, which suffered major damage in the civil war. In 2002, electricity generation was 1.728 TW·h, of which 34.5% came from fossil fuels and 65.5% from hydropower. In the same year, consumption of electricity totaled 1.607 TW·h. Total capacity in 2002 was 700 MW. Electricity is produced by Empresa Nacional de Electricidade de Angola.|$|R
50|$|School enrollment, {{which rose}} very slowly {{considering}} Angola's youthful population, reflected the dire {{effects of the}} insurgency. In 1977 the government reported that more than 1 million primary school students were enrolled, as were about 105,000 secondary school students, roughly double the numbers enrolled in 1973. What proportions of the relevant age groups these students constituted was not known, {{but in the case}} of the primary school students it may have been almost two-thirds, and in that of secondary school students, perhaps a tenth to an eighth. Official government statistics released in 1984 showed that primary school enrollment had declined to 870,410, while secondary school enrollment (including vocational school and teacher training students) had increased to 151,759. This made for combined primary and secondary school enrollment consisting of 49 percent of the school-age population. By 1986 the primary school enrollment had increased to 1,304,145. <b>Luanda's</b> Agostinho Neto University, the country's only university, had an enrollment of 4,493 students in 1984, which had declined to 3,195 by 1986. A total of 72,330 people were enrolled in primary adult education programs in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|His next {{novel of}} the decade, O Desejo de Kianda, {{published}} in 1995, continues to manifest the disillusionment exhibited in A Geração da Utopia. The novel takes more of a magical realist approach than any of Pepetela's former works, positing a situation where several of <b>Luanda's</b> largest buildings collapse into Kinaxixi square with all the inhabitants left unharmed. The heroine, a character named Carmina Cara de Cu, leaves {{her career as a}} government bureaucrat and becomes an arms dealer.In an essay on the novel comparing the collapse of the buildings that is {{the focal point of the}} novel to the attacks of September 11, 2001, Phillip Rothwell writes that the novel [...] "in some ways continues Pepetela's profound and damning portrayal of a betrayed utopia". The next year he published a different sort of novel, A Gloriosa Família. This work examines the story of the Van Dúnem family, a prominent Angolan family of Dutch descent. Pepetela spent years researching the story of the Dutch in Angola in order to write the novel. This novel does not display the same cynical and disillusioned tone as his other novels of the decade did, instead being a broad historical narrative that does incorporate a somewhat magical realist tone. While this novel stands quite apart from much of the author's other work, the fascination with Angolan history prominent throughout his career probably comes to its truest fruition in this work.|$|R
