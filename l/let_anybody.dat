500|$|Harkins resented his {{decreasing}} relevance, {{especially as}} his term in Vietnam {{would be over}} in six months anyway, {{so he decided to}} try to regain influence lost to Lodge by altering the shape of the Saigon regime. The split between Harkins and Lodge was also kept unresolved by domestic political imperatives in Washington. The Defense Department would not drop their support for Harkins, so he was not recalled early. Although Johnson said of Lodge [...] "He ain't worth a damn. He can't work with anybody. He won't <b>let</b> <b>anybody</b> else work", the president chose not to try to force any changes due to the upcoming US Presidential election. Lodge was the front-runner for the Republican nomination at the time, and Johnson wanted to keep him in Saigon rather than having the ambassador in the US campaigning against him and the Democratic Party. Aside from Harkins, General Maxwell Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also known to regard Khánh as the nation's foremost general, while Undersecretary of State George Ball told Lodge that [...] "Our [...] impression is that Khánh {{is one of the best}} of the generals, both courageous and sophisticated." [...] Khánh was known for his pro-American views, and Lodge's aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Khánh was not only a fluent speaker of English, but [...] "he spoke American; American Army in fact." [...] On one occasion Khánh had told American officials that South Vietnam [...] "must rely on American support".|$|E

[...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] as well as the unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs.

[...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E

2500|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart studied {{counterpoint}} {{when young}} with Padre Martini in Bologna. However, the major impetus to fugal writing for Mozart was {{the influence of}} Baron Gottfried van Swieten in Vienna around 1782. Van Swieten, during diplomatic service in Berlin, had taken the opportunity to collect as many manuscripts by Bach and Handel as he could, and he invited Mozart to study his collection and also encouraged him to transcribe various works for other combinations of instruments. Mozart was evidently fascinated by these works, and wrote a set of transcriptions for string trio of fugues from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, introducing them with preludes of his own. In {{a letter to his}} sister, dated in Vienna on April 20, 1782, Mozart recognizes that he had not written anything in this form, but moved by the interest of Constance he composed one piece, which is sent with the letter. He begs her sister does not <b>let</b> <b>anybody</b> to see the fugue and manifests the hope to write five more and then present them to Baron van Swieten. Regarding the piece, he said [...] "I have taken particular care to write andante maestoso upon it, so that it should not be played fast -for if a fugue is not played slowly the ear cannot clearly distinguish the new subject as it is introduced and the effect is missed". Mozart then set to writing fugues on his own, mimicking the Baroque style. These included the fugues for string quartet, K. 405 (1782) and a fugue in C Minor K. 426 for two pianos (1783). Later, Mozart incorporated fugal writing into his opera Die Zauberflöte and the finale of his Symphony No. 41. The parts of the Requiem he completed also contain several fugues (most notably the Kyrie, and the three fugues in the Domine Jesu; he also left behind a sketch for an Amen fugue which, some believe, would have come {{at the end of the}} Sequentia).|$|E
