5000|$|Exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR), on diesel engines, {{can be used}} to achieve a richer fuel to air mixture and a <b>lower</b> <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature.</b> Both effects reduce NOx emissions, but can negatively impact efficiency and the production of soot particles. The richer mix is achieved by displacing some of the intake air, but is still lean compared to petrol engines, which approach the stoichiometric ideal. The lower peak temperature is achieved by a heat exchanger that removes heat before re-entering the engine, and works due to the exhaust gases' higher specific heat capacity than air. With the greater soot production, EGR is often combined with a particulate matter (PM) filter in the exhaust. In turbocharged engines, EGR needs a controlled pressure differential across the exhaust manifold and intake manifold, which can be met by such engineering as use of a variable geometry turbocharger, which has inlet guide vanes on the turbine to build exhaust backpressure in the exhaust manifold directing exhaust gas to the intake manifold. It also requires additional external piping and valving, and so requires additional maintenance.|$|E
40|$|The latest {{generation}} of high-efficiency {{gasoline direct injection}} (GDI) engines {{continues to be a}} significant source of dangerous ultra-fine particulate matter (PM) emissions. The forthcoming advent in the 2017 – 2020 timeframe of the real driving emission (RDE) standards affords little time for the identification of viable solutions. The present research work aims to contribute towards a much-needed improved understanding of the process of PM formation in theoretically-homogeneous stoichiometric spark-ignition combustion. Experimental measurements of engine-out PM have been taken from a wall-guided GDI engine operated at part-load; through parallel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the test-engine, the process of mixture preparation was investigated. About 80 % of the total particle number is emitted on average in the 5 – 50 nm range, with the vast majority being below the regulated lower limit of 23 nm. The results suggest that both improved charge homogeneity and <b>lower</b> <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> contribute to lower particle number density (PNDen) and larger particle size, as engine speed and load increase. The effect of engine load is stronger and results from greater injection pressure through better fuel droplet atomisation. Increases in pre-combustion homogeneity of 6 % are associated with one order of magnitude reductions of PNDen. A simplified two-equation functional model was developed, which returns satisfactory qualitative predictions of PNDen as a function of basic engine control variables...|$|E
40|$|It {{is today}} undoubted that humans {{have to reduce}} their impacton the environment. Internal {{combustion}} engines, being the major power source in the transportation sector as well as inindividual transport, {{play an important role}} in the man-made emissions. While the mobility in the world is growing, it is important to reduce the emissions that result from transportation. The diesel engine provides a high efficiency and hence it canhelp to reduce CO 2 emissions, which are believed to be themain cause of global warming. Diesel exhaust also contains toxic gases, mainly nitrogen oxides (NOX) and soot particles. These emissions are therefore limited by the authorities in most countries. A way to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions of a diesel engine is the use of exhaust gas recirculation, EGR. Here, a part of the exhaust gases is rerouted into the combustion chamber. This leads to a <b>lower</b> <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> which in turn reduces the formation of NOX. In modern turbocharged engines it can be problematic to provide the amount of EGR that is needed to reach the emission limits. Other concerns can be the transient response of both the EGR-system and the engine. This work provides a simulative comparison of different EGRsystems,such as long-route EGR, short-route EGR, hybrid EGR, a system with a reed valve and a system with an EGR pump. Both the steady-state performance and transient performance are compared. In steady-state the focus is the fuel efficiency.

50|$|Emissions output was {{controlled}} by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, <b>lowering</b> <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or Positive Crankcase Ventilation system, introduced oil vapor and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{diesel engines}} are unthrottled, EGR does not lower {{throttling}} {{losses in the}} way that it does for SI engines. Exhaust gas—largely nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air, so it still serves to <b>lower</b> <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures.</b> However, adding EGR to a diesel reduces the specific heat ratio of the combustion gases in the power stroke. This reduces the amount of power that can be extracted by the piston. EGR also tends {{to reduce the amount of}} fuel burned in the power stroke. This is evident by the increase in particulate emissions that corresponds to an increase in EGR.|$|R
40|$|Spray {{combustion}} finds a {{wide range}} of application in gas turbines, internal combustion engines, industrial furnaces, etc. In turbulent spray combustion, liquid fuel is injected into the combustion chamber in the form of droplets. In order to improve the combustion efficiency and to reduce the thermal NOx emissions released during combustion, spray combustion could be operated in flameless mode. In a flameless combustion, the oxidizer is mixed with recirculated hot combustion gases to preheat and to dilute it. The dilution of oxidizer results in <b>lower</b> <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> which reduces the NOx emissions and oxidizer preheating improves the thermal efficiency of combustion. In order to fully understand the combustion mechanics for its effective implementation in various applications, numerical simulations of flameless turbulent spray combustion are potentially useful because simulations are cost effective and serve as basis for further experimental studies based on the validation of numerical models. Turbulent spray combustion is a complex phenomenon involving two phases namely the gaseous phase and liquid phase. These two phases interact with each other through mass, momentum and energy transfer between them. This is complicated further by the interaction between the turbulence in the flow field and chemistry of the reacting species. Hence simplified models are necessary to simulate and understand the phenomenon of turbulent spray combustion. In this thesis, numerical validation study of turbulent ethanol spray flame using open-source software package OpenFOAM is carried out for the experiments done in Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow (DSHC) burner operated in flameless mode. The modeling approach used is Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations (RANS) with Eulerian-Lagrangian framework for the continuous phase and discrete phase respectively. Models like evaporation and turbulence models used in the sprayFoam solver are optimized for the spray combustion and validated with experimental data for one flame. The evaporation models studied are Gradient diffusion model and Spalding model. It is found that Gradient diffusion model gives better prediction of droplet properties at higher axial locations than Spalding model. The standard and realizable k-? model turbulence models comparative analysis showed that standard k-? model has much better gas phase temperature prediction than realizable k-? model due to the dependence of combustion model (Partially Stirred Reactor model) on the turbulence mixing frequency, ?/k. These optimized models are extended to simulation of HI and HIII flames. The peak gas phase temperature was under-predicted by the PaSR model. The results showed the importance of analyzing the different initial spray conditions. Sustainable Process and Energy TechnologyProcess and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

5000|$|A high {{compression}} ratio is desirable {{because it allows}} an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of air-fuel mixture due to its higher thermal efficiency.

The remarkable feature of gaseous fuels are the absence of mineral impurities, the consistency in quality and the convenience and efficient in use. LPG is used widely as a co-fuel with diesel since {{it is possible to}} obtain high energy storage density. For a diesel engine, fuel injection timing is a major parameter that affects the combustion and exhaust emissions. The state of air into which the fuel injected changes as the injection timing is varied, and thus ignition delay will vary.

40|$|One of the {{important}} goals in diesel engine research {{is the development of}} means to reduce the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and soot particulates, and in this endeavour advanced techniques like split injection/multiple injection, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) etc. are being developed. The principle of split injection is that when fuel is injected in two pulses it engenders a reduction in the <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>temperature</b> which ensures the reduction in NOx emission. In this study to achieve split injection in an economical manner, a double lobed cam has been designed incorporating the optimum split and dwell. Experimental study indicates that 50 - 50 split with 10 degree crank angle dwell is the optimum to achieve a viable reduction in NOx without any major penalty in soot and power. A 15...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{thermodynamic}} cycle analysis of diesel engines using the engine cycle simulation programs is feasible. The comparison of dual and LIVC miller cycles engine fueled with ED 10 diesel/ethanol blends on temperature and emissions are investigated by simulation. From the comparison, + 0. 85 EIVC miller cycle is a selection for an optimizing point of miller cycle ratio, i. e, the intake valve {{timing of the}} engine is good for NO emission, SOOT emission and the engine power output. The difference of EIVC and LIVC miller cycle was studied. The results show the tendency of performance with EIVC miller cycle {{is similar to that}} of LIVC miller cycle. But the <b>peak</b> cylinder <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> of EIVC miller cycle become lower relative to LIVC miller cycle, which lead to slightly lower NO emission and slightly higher SOOT emission for EIVC miller cycle...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in the use}} of {{alternative}} fuels and combustion regimes is increasing as the price of petroleum climbs. The inherently higher efficiency of Diesel engines has led to increased adoption of Diesels in Europe, capturing approximately 40 % of the new passenger car market. Unfortunately, lower CO{sub 2 } emissions are countered with higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, and higher noise. Noise and PM have traditionally been the obstacles toward consumer acceptance of Diesel passenger cars in North America, while NOx (a key component in photochemical smog) has been more of an engineering challenge. Diesels are lean burning (combustion with excess oxygen) and reducing NOx to N 2 in an oxygen rich environment is difficult. Adding oxygenated compounds to the fuel helps reduce PM emissions, but relying on fuel alone to reduce PM is unrealistic. Keeping <b>peak</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> below 1700 K prevents NOx formation. Altering the combustion regime to burn at temperatures below the NOx threshold and accept a wide variety of fuels seems like a promising alternative for future engines. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a possible solution. Fuel and air are well mixed prior to intake into a cylinder (homogeneous charge) and ignition occurs by compression of the fuel-air mixture by the piston. HCCI is rapid and relatively cool, producing little NOx and PM. Unfortunately, it is hard to control since HCCI is initiated by temperature and pressure instead of a spark or direct fuel injection. We investigate biofuel HCCI combustion, and use intrinsically labeled biofuels as tracers of HCCI combustion. Data from tracer experiments are used to validate combustion modeling...|$|R
