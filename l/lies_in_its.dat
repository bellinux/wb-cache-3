5|$|Altar M this modest {{monument}} is {{the earliest}} known monument dedicated by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. The importance of this monument <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> text, in which this preeminent king of Quiriguá claimed the title of k'uhul ajaw, holy lord, and began his bid for independence from Copán. This rhyolite sculpture was dedicated on 15September 734 and has {{the form of a}} monstrous head, possibly that of a crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan's most {{important}} economic sector <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> {{role as the}} headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. The borough's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine for Manhattan, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700. Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E

5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> claim {{of a new}} and useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain {{as compared to the}} human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} a ritual <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> repetition. A pure disciple will attain the supreme state even by simply staying {{for a short time}} in {{presence}} of a guru without any instruction, but less prepared ones need reinforcement and gradual accumulation.|$|E

Crossed keys are in the upper arm, an eagle's head lies in the left arm, and a scroll <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> right arm. In the bottom arm lie two clasped hands and seven stars.|$|E
25|$|Trans fat {{levels may}} be measured. Measurement {{techniques}} include chromatography (by silver ion chromatography on {{thin layer chromatography}} plates, or small high-performance liquid chromatography columns of silica gel with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions). The role of silver <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds. Gas chromatography and mid-infrared spectroscopy are other methods in use.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, it {{was clear}} that north Alabama had {{possibly}} the densest concentration of Paleo-Indian sites within the United States, as evidenced by the discovery of the Quad Site near Decatur, Alabama. The importance of the Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter, one such Paleo-Indian site, <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to establish an accurate timeframe for Dalton projectile points. This resulted in references to the site in almost every summary of eastern North American prehistory.|$|E

25|$|The map's {{historical}} importance <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> {{demonstration of}} the extent of global exploration of the New World by approximately 1510, and in its claim to have used a map of Christopher Columbus, otherwise lost, as a source. Piri also stated that he had used ten Arab sources and four Indian maps sourced from the Portuguese. More recently, the map {{has been the focus of}} pseudohistoric claims for the pre-modern exploration of the Antarctic coast.|$|E
25|$|The most {{accessible}} {{and possibly the}} greatest wildlife resource of the Irish Sea <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> estuaries: particularly the Dee Estuary, the Mersey Estuary, the Ribble Estuary, Morecambe Bay, the Solway Firth, Loch Ryan, the Firth of Clyde, Belfast Lough, Strangford Lough, Carlingford Lough, Dundalk Bay, Dublin Bay and Wexford Harbour. However, a lot of wildlife also depends on the cliffs, salt marshes and sand dunes of the adjoining shores, the seabed and the open sea itself.|$|E
25|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall {{is perhaps}} amongst the most {{shocking}} of contemporary Victorian novels. In seeking to present the truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery was profoundly disturbing to 19th-century sensibilities. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her past {{as an artist and}} wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.|$|E

50|$|Causality (also {{referred}} to as causation, or cause and effect) is the natural or worldly agency or efficacy that connects one process (the cause) with another process or state (the effect), where the first is {{partly responsible for the}} second, and the second is partly dependent on the first. In general, a process has many causes, which are said to be causal factors for it, and all <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> past. An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> future. Causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space.|$|R
25|$|Transform boundaries, {{such as the}} San Andreas Fault system, {{resulted}} in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move {{across the surface of}} the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.|$|E
25|$|At {{absolute}} zero temperature, {{a crystal lattice}} <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ground state, and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero temperature has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates randomly about some mean value. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which {{can be viewed as}} a gas of phonons. (The random motion of the atoms in the lattice is what we usually think of as heat.) Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} decade the Finite element method (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector {{highlighting}} further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself {{as an alternative to}} in vivo surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions. This has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. BioSpine).|$|E

25|$|The Phillips-head screw is a {{crosshead}} screw design <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> self-centering property, useful on automated production lines that use power screwdrivers. The Phillips-head screw was invented and patented by Henry F. Phillips in 1936.|$|R
50|$|The game {{received}} average scores, rating a Metacritic of 61. Reviewers pointed that <b>its</b> high qualities <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> {{visual and}} sound effects, {{and on its}} game mechanics, but it lacks re-playability and overall appeal.|$|R
25|$|Iron is an {{essential}} bioelement for most forms of life, from bacteria to mammals. Its importance <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to mediate electron transfer. In the ferrous state, iron acts as an electron donor, while in the ferric state it acts as an acceptor. Thus, iron plays {{a vital role in}} the catalysis of enzymatic reactions that involve electron transfer (reduction and oxidation, redox). Proteins can contain iron as part of different cofactors, such as iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) and heme groups, both of which are assembled in mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|Such is {{the system}} in outline. The {{historical}} position of the system <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned {{in the form of}} infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or {{effort on the part of}} and something different from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.|$|E
25|$|The {{attractiveness}} of a constructed wetlands solution <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> relative low cost. They {{are limited by}} the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine constructed wetland) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), {{and it is very}} important that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.|$|E
