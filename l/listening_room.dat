25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{can provide}} very high efficiencies, making {{them a good}} match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as single-ended triode amps or other tube amplifiers. After WWII, some early hi-fi fans {{went so far as}} to build low frequency horns whose mouths took up much of a wall of the <b>listening</b> <b>room.</b> The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} {{rectangular}} <b>listening</b> <b>room,</b> the hard, parallel {{surfaces of the}} walls, floor and ceiling cause primary acoustic resonance nodes {{in each of the}} three dimensions: left-right, up-down and forward-backward. Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving three, four, five and even all six boundary surfaces combining to create standing waves. Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium size rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the Schroeder frequency– typically around 200–300Hz, depending on room size.|$|E

500|$|Since {{even the}} early days of {{stereophonic}} sound, designers were faced with the issue of directionality and the listener who was not located exactly in between the two speaker units. Col. Richard R. Ranger, a pioneer of stereophonic sound in the film industry, conceptualised the {{solution to the problem of}} reproducing stereo sound for all and not just the centrally-positioned listener. He devised a loudspeaker system where the sound from the speaker drive units would be ed against curved surfaces (wood panels) within a cabinet to create a wide, uniform stereo image that would hold stable in any location within the <b>listening</b> <b>room.</b> Ranger elaborates on the JBL-Ranger Radial Refraction system of stereophonic reproduction thus: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Boston-style" [...] songwriting {{refers to}} the introspective and literate breed of singer-songwriter so {{prevalent}} in the modern folk music landscape. According to Paul, Boston-style songwriting grew out of Boston's thriving folk scene with its dense collection of colleges, college radio stations and listening rooms. [...] Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts' WUMB, the country's foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24-hours a day. [...] Paul said the Boston songwriters {{tend to be more}} thoughtful and soft because in an intimate <b>listening</b> <b>room,</b> [...] "all you've got is you and your words." [...] Boston-style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than melody, is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant, often addressing social issues. [...] Boston-style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians, but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin, John Gorka, Susan Werner, Bill Morrissey, and Dar Williams. [...] In an interview with Paul Freeman for the East Bay Daily News, Paul commented on how he hopes audience members relate to his songs, [...] "Each song is supposed to be like a little three-dimensional world. I'm hoping to invite them in, have them make out the details and the reasons for being there, and apply them to their own lives. But I'm also hoping to entertain them." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} some {{preliminary}} formulations for the simulation {{and design of}} critical <b>listening</b> <b>rooms</b> using optimization techniques aiming at nearly flat frequency response are discussed. Emphasis {{is given to the}} computation of an approximation of frequency response {{as a function of the}} design variables, i. e. without directly measuring this response in a real room or a scale model. Optimization models for room design are given, which take into account a range of listening positions (e. g. an audience) and sound sources (e. g. a stage). Some implementation issues are pointed out and further research directions are laid out. 1 Introduction The design of critical <b>listening</b> <b>rooms</b> (e. g. project studios, small concert halls, home theaters) is a problem which poses important questions before it can be defined: in the first place the question of what exactly is to be designed; secondly, what is it at which the design aims...|$|R
