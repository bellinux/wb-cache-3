40|$|Carbon {{is present}} in various forms in the Earth <b>s</b> upper <b>mantle</b> (carbonate- or diamond-bearing mantle xenoliths, {{carbonatite}} magmas, CO 2 emissions from volcanoes [...] .). Moreover, there is enough carbon in chondritic material to stabilize carbonates into the mantles of Mars or Venus {{as well as in}} the Earth. However, the interactions with iron have to be constrained, because Fe is commonly thought to buffer oxygen fugacity into planetary mantles. [1] and [2] show evidences of the stability of clinopyroxene Ca(Mg,Fe) Si 2 O 6 + magnesite (Mg,Fe) CO 3 in the Earth <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> around 6 GPa (about 180 km). The stability of oxidized forms of carbon (like magnesite) depends on the oxygen fugacity of the system. In the Earth <b>s</b> <b>mantle,</b> the maximum carbon content is 10000 ppm [3]. The fO 2 parameter varies vertically as a function of pressure, but also laterally because of geodynamic processes like subduction. Thus, carbonates, graphite, diamond, C-rich gases and melts are all stable forms of carbon in the Earth <b>s</b> <b>mantle.</b> [4] show that the fO 2 variations observed in SNC meteorites can be explained by polybaric graphite-CO-CO 2 equilibria in the Martian mantle. [5] inferred from thermodynamic calculations that the stable form of carbon in the source regions of the Martian basalts should be graphite (and/or diamond). After [6], a metasomatizing agent like a CO 2 -rich melt may infiltrate the mantle source of nakhlites. However, according to [7] and [8], the FeO wt% value in the Martian bulk mantle is more than twice that of the Earth <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> (KLB- 1 composition by [9]). As iron and carbon are two elements with various oxidation states, Fe/C interaction mechanisms must be considered...|$|R
50|$|The short {{opens with}} Masked Man M taking on an {{extremely}} obese female wrestler in the ring. She traps {{him in her}} skin folds, but Masked Man M manages to escape. The obese wrestler taps out to <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> who kicks Masked Man M in the chest - a move he appears to greatly enjoy. This prompts him to accidentally swap out with his partner Chicken, who tries and fails to attack <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> She proceeds to beat him while an envious Masked Man M watches, begging for Chicken to swap out with him. Chicken succeeds, {{but at this point}} <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> also swaps out with the obese wrestler, to his dismay. Masked Man M manages to beat the obese wrestler, which angers The Boss. He storms down to the dressing room to confront Masked Man M and Chicken, as <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> was supposed to win the match. The Boss just barely misses the two as they flee the arena, Masked Man M carrying a box of <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> dolls he stole.|$|R

Romeo agrees, and, the next night, he eagerly goes out into the ring as Masked Man M. The two proceed to fight one another, much to Masked Man M's joy. The fight progresses until <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> traps Masked Man M in a headlock, suffocating him while telling him [...] "This is what you want, right?" [...] She brings him to a near death experience while telling him that he should just remain in his fantasy world. However, the children from his orphanage are attending that night and beg Masked Man M not to give up, which spurs him to touch one of the wrestling ring ropes with his foot. This forces <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> to release him from the headlock, but she then proceeds to continually beat him. <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> overestimates the power {{in one of her}} jumps and ends up getting knocked out by the impact when Masked Man M moves out of the way at the last minute. He holds her down and almost wins, but, at the last minute, is signaled to throw the match, which he does. After the match Masked Man M's popularity takes off and Romeo returns to the orphanage where he realizes that Sister Juliet is <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> as she has used the money to fix the place up.|$|R

40|$|U-Th-Pb isotopic {{systematics}} {{indicate that}} Asuka- 31 is of lunar origin and was formed 3940 ± 8 Ma. The Pb isotopic composition is extremely nonradiogenic {{compared with those}} of typical Apollo mare basalts. The Pb-Pb, U-Pb, and Th-Pb ages are concordant at 3. 94 Ga. The U-Pb data from maskelynitized plagioclase does not plot on the internal isochrons defined by other mineral separates, indicating that it was disturbed by a later shock event(s). The U-Th-Pb systematics of Asuka- 31,combined with previous results, suggest a scenario for the early Pb isotope evolution of the Moon. According to the currently popular hypothesis for lunar origin, following a collision between the Earth and another large planetesimal, the Moon was formed mainly from the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> and partially from the other impactor. The primary ^ U/^ Pb (μ) value of the Moon had been increased four to five times that of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> value (∿ 8) by volatilization of Pb during the impact. Further depletion of Pb within the Moon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> is believed to have occurred during lunar core formation. The chalcophile behavior of Pb and large partition coefficient of Pb in silicate minerals compared to those of U and Th helped to decrease μ values of early cumulates that formed from the magma ocean and settled in the deep lunar mantle. The μ values of later cumulates gradually increased as a result of extensive fractionation. We suggest that Asuka- 31 originated from partial melting of early cumulates enriched with sulfides...|$|R
