5|$|Ryan Joseph Braun (born November 17, 1983) is an American {{baseball}} <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). While {{currently the}} starting <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> for the Brewers, Braun has also played right field {{during his career}} and was also a third baseman during his rookie season.|$|E
5|$|Ed Levy {{is listed}} by Baseball-Reference as a <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> and first baseman, but never {{appeared}} in a game {{in the field for}} the Phillies.|$|E
5000|$|For {{baseball}} scoring, seven {{represents the}} <b>left</b> <b>fielder's</b> position.|$|R
25|$|Soriano led {{all major}} league second basemen in errors {{every year from}} 2001 to 2005 (19 (tied), 23, 19, 23, and 21). In 2006, he was second {{in the major leagues}} of all <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in errors, with 11, but led all <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> with 22 assists, 9 double plays, and a 2.29 range factor.|$|R
50|$|Through 2011, he led all active <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> {{in career}} errors, totaling 60 errors.|$|R
5|$|Stan Jok {{is listed}} by Baseball-Reference {{as a third}} baseman and <b>left</b> <b>fielder,</b> but never {{appeared}} in a game {{in the field for}} the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Two Phillies {{played as}} {{pitchers}} and position players; Al Maul {{was both a}} <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> and a pitcher, and Elmer Miller played right field in addition to pitching.|$|E
5|$|One player, Jack Neagle, {{has made}} 30% {{or more of}} his Phillies {{appearances}} as a pitcher and a position player. He amassed a 1–7 pitching record with a 6.90 ERA while batting in four runs as a <b>left</b> <b>fielder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Players can be {{characterized}} as either corner outfielders or a center fielder. Corner outfielders are often slower and have less defensive value than the center fielder. However, there are some important differences between right <b>fielders</b> and <b>left</b> <b>fielders.</b> Right fielders tend to have the best throwing arms of the outfield so they can make the long throw to third base, but often are not as fast as <b>left</b> <b>fielders.</b> Center fielders are generally the fastest and most athletic of the three, because they have to run the farthest in order to field balls in the gaps and back up the other outfielders when balls are hit to them.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, Soriano led {{all major}} league <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in errors, with 11, {{and had the}} lowest fielding {{percentage}} among them (.950).|$|R
50|$|Corner outfielders are outfielders {{who play}} the corner {{positions}} of right field and left field. Corner outfielders often have less speed than center fielders, but {{make up for}} this deficiency with their offensive play. The main differences between <b>left</b> and right <b>fielders</b> are, first, that <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> handle more chances because right-handed pull hitters tend to hit balls to left; second, that right fielders typically have stronger arms; third, that right fielders are frequently (not always) slower and less agile defensively. Many <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> have had the speed to play center field, but have lacked the throwing ability required.|$|R
5|$|Barry Lamar Bonds (born July 24, 1964) is an American former {{professional}} baseball <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants. Bonds received seven NL MVP awards and 14 All-Star selections, {{and is considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest baseball players of all time.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award, the prize is {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one <b>left</b> <b>fielder,</b> one center fielder, and one right fielder. It is also possible for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E
5|$|Burrell {{filed for}} free agency on November 6. On December 16, the Phillies signed <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> Raúl Ibañez to a three-year contract, ending Burrell's tenure in Philadelphia. Burrell's 104 double plays {{grounded}} into were the seventh-most in Phillies history, and his 1,273 strikeouts were {{second only to}} Schmidt. However, Burrell was fifth in walks (785), eighth in RBI (827), and fourth in home runs (251) as a Phillie. His eight straight seasons with at least 20 home runs were topped only by Schmidt.|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{finished}} 2007 with a [...]296 batting average, 20 home runs, and 88 RBIs, {{ending his}} streak of 30 home run and 100 RBI seasons at 9. His season {{was cut short}} when he strained his left oblique in late August during a Yankees series, but he did return to the lineup for the final homestand of the season. In 2007, he had the highest fielding percentage (.990) among <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in the AL, tied for second {{in the major leagues}}; he was ranked sixth-highest in range factor of all AL <b>left</b> <b>fielders,</b> 1.72, 16th in both leagues, but had the lowest zone rating among MLB <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> with 100+ games (.713). He made two errors during the 2007 season in left field, and tied for fifth overall in the major leagues in assists from left field.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, Braun led NL <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in putouts for {{the third}} year in a row (279), was second in range factor per game (1.86), and 4th in assists (6).|$|R
50|$|In 2009, he had {{the best}} range factor of all {{starting}} major league <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> (2.34). He won his second consecutive Fielding Bible Award and third overall at left field.|$|R
5|$|Eight Phillies first-round picks {{have won}} a {{championship}} with the franchise. Greg Luzinski (1968), Larry Christenson (1972), and Lonnie Smith (1974) were on the roster when the team won the 1980 World Series. Third baseman (later <b>left</b> <b>fielder)</b> Pat Burrell (1998), pitchers Adam Eaton (1996), Brett Myers (1999) and Cole Hamels (2002), and second baseman Chase Utley (2000) were {{all members of the}} team during the Phillies' 2008 World Series championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{prize is}} {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one <b>left</b> <b>fielder,</b> one center fielder, and one right fielder. In addition, only National League pitchers receive a Silver Slugger Award; lineups in the American League include a designated hitter in place of the pitcher in the batting order, so the designated hitter receives the award instead.|$|E
5|$|Of this list's 33 pitchers, Geoff Geary has {{the best}} win–loss record by winning percentage; he won {{thirteen}} games and lost four in five seasons with the Phillies. Gleason's 78 career victories lead all pitchers in this list, as do his 70 losses. The earned run average (ERA) leader is <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> Greg Gross, who made two pitching appearances during his ten-season career in Philadelphia, allowing no runs in five innings pitched; among pitchers, Gene Garber leads with a 2.68 ERA. Tommy Greene {{is one of the}} ten Phillies pitchers who have thrown a no-hitter, accomplishing the feat on May 23, 1991.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Braun led NL <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in putouts for {{the third}} year in a row (279), was second in range factor per game (1.86), and 4th in assists (6).|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, he led {{all major}} league outfielders in errors, with 10. [...] In 2004, he {{tied for the}} lead among all major league <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in errors, with 8.|$|R
50|$|By primary fielding {{position}} the nominees were starting pitchers (66), relief pitchers (9), catchers (10), first basemen (24), second basemen (8), third basemen (13), shortstops (19), <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> (18), center fielders (17) and right fielders (16).|$|R
5|$|The Phillies' {{offensive}} woes {{seemed in}} the distant past as the lineup broke out in a big way during Game 4. Led by Ryan Howard's 3-for-4, 2 home run performance, and home runs by Jayson Werth and starting pitcher Joe Blanton, the Phillies pushed 10 runs across the plate. Blanton became the first World Series pitcher to hit a home run in 34 years, in addition to a strong performance on the mound, pitching six innings and allowing two earned runs on four hits. Roster addition Eric Hinske hit a home run for the Rays, as did <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> Carl Crawford, his second of the series.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} three innings of the fifth game, both {{pitchers}} held the opposing team to no runs and {{a limited number of}} hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 spring training, Huff {{competed with}} Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants' first base job. Belt won the job, and Huff {{opened the season}} as the Giants' <b>left</b> <b>fielder.</b> He had two hits and three RBI on April 13, {{including}} a two-run home run against Joel Hanrahan in a 50 victory over Pittsburgh. On April 21, because the Giants {{did not have any}} infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base {{for the first time in}} his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential double play situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the doubleheader 54. After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on the 15-day disabled list with anxiety issues.|$|E
50|$|By primary fielding {{position}} the nominees were starting pitchers (67), relief pitchers (10), catchers (10), first basemen (21), second basemen (5), third basemen (11), shortstops (18), <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> (17), center fielders (22) and right fielders (19).|$|R
5000|$|For the 2011 season, he batted [...]255 with an on-base {{percentage}} of [...]289. Through 2011, {{he had the}} third-best career fielding percentage (.990) among all active major league <b>left</b> <b>fielders,</b> behind Ryan Braun and Reed Johnson.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, he batted [...]299, and led National League <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> {{in range}} factor/game (2.09). He tied for 8th {{in the voting}} for NL Rookie of the Year, behind Ike Davis of the New York Mets.|$|R
5|$|Ishikawa {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Giants on April 24. After languishing in the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, {{with the return of}} Belt to first base and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite being a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts in left field, Ishikawa became the Giants starting <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> during the 2014 postseason.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as <b>left</b> <b>fielder</b> Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E
5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a <b>left</b> <b>fielder,</b> as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Braun led {{all major}} league outfielders with a 1.000 fielding percentage. He also led all NL <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> in putouts (275), and {{was second in}} the league in range factor (1.95) and fourth in assists (9), in 1,310.1 innings.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, he had {{the lowest}} range factor of all {{starting}} major league <b>left</b> <b>fielders</b> (1.56). Despite his limited range, Lee was a force once again at the plate, driving in 102 rbi's while hitting exactly [...]300 in 160 games.|$|R
50|$|First basemen, with 6 winners, {{have won}} the most among all positions. One catcher has also won the award. Six outfielders {{have won the}} Player of the Year Award; three were right <b>fielders,</b> two were <b>left</b> <b>fielders,</b> and one was a center fielder.|$|R
