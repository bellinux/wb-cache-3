5|$|By 1952, {{the farm}} {{had become a}} burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> hard to come by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. The farm was sold, and Olga, {{her husband and her}} former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E
5|$|In April 1974, {{faced with}} {{attempts}} by the Opposition to obstruct supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam obtained the concurrence of the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, to a double dissolution. <b>Labor</b> <b>was</b> returned at the election on 18 May with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 Senate seats, with {{the balance of power}} held by two independents.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, slave <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
50|$|Braverman {{starts with}} noting that <b>labor</b> and capital <b>are</b> the {{opposite}} poles of capitalism, {{but at the}} same time, capital <b>is</b> <b>labor</b> and <b>labor</b> <b>is</b> capital. Capital <b>is</b> <b>labor</b> {{in the sense that it}} is the product of past labor that only becomes capital through control of the capitalist to accumulate more capital. <b>Labor</b> <b>is</b> capital because the capitalist buys it to move along his production processes.|$|R

5|$|<b>Labor</b> <b>was</b> {{always in}} short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged {{for them to}} work for families in the colonies until age 21, {{in exchange for their}} ocean passage. The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% of the population of New York. Most were house servants in Manhattan, or farmworkers on Dutch estates.|$|E
5|$|The Merina royal {{tradition}} of taxes paid {{in the form}} of <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo. Malagasy troops fought for France in World War I. In the 1930s, Nazi political thinkers developed the Madagascar Plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews. During the Second World War, the island was the site of the Battle of Madagascar between the Vichy government and the British.|$|E
5|$|The Sami {{were not}} the only people subject to repressions. Thousands of people were sent to Kola in the 1930s–1950s, and in 2007 over two {{thousand}} people—descendants of those forcibly sent here—still live on the peninsula. A significant portion of the people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization. Prisoner <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.|$|E
5000|$|Enterprises still {{strive to}} make a profit. However, [...] "profit" [...] in a worker-run firm is {{calculated}} differently than under capitalism.

5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after <b>Labor</b> <b>was</b> defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E

5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} confident that he would build upon his previous result. <b>Labor</b> <b>was</b> continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when he told his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{and their}} {{descendants}} were usually found in regions devoted to producing exports for foreign markets. Sugarcane plantations on the eastern coast of the northeast region during the 16th and 17th centuries are typical of economic activities dependent on slave labor. In northern Maranhão province, slave <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> used in cotton and rice production in the 18th century. In this period, slaves were also exploited in Minas Gerais province where gold was extracted. Slavery was also common in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo during the 19th century for the cultivation of coffee which became vital to the national economy. The prevalence of slavery was not geographically uniform across Brazil. Around 1870 only five provinces (Rio de Janeiro with 30%, Bahia with 15%, Minas Gerais with 14%, São Paulo with 7% and Rio Grande do Sul also with 7%) held 73% of the nation's total slave population. These were followed by Pernambuco (with 6%) and Alagoas (with 4%). Among the remaining 13 provinces none individually had even 3%.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Submarine Corporation {{construction}} {{facility was}} established on previously undeveloped {{land on the}} bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise any problems caused by workers unions. The state's bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states' proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary industrial base, New South Wales could not decide on the location of the construction facility, Victoria's proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when <b>Labor</b> <b>was</b> in power both federally and in all other states.|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where <b>labor</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E
