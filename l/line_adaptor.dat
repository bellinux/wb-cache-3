50|$|Line trip {{is one of}} {{the general}} {{disturbances}} in the power system. The outage of transmission lines affects the frequency and voltage stabilities of the system. By utilizing the measurement data in FNET system, the line trip events can be detected correctly and efficiently. The current project primarily focuses on the design of a professional <b>line</b> trip <b>adaptor</b> to realize the online line trip detection and to provide automatic alert notification for the clients.|$|R
50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1965, the Trimline included a lighted dial and was {{encased in a}} sleek, curved plastic housing that took up much less space than earlier Western Electric telephones. However, the glass-smooth and shallowly-curved plastic handset proved difficult to retain between cheek and shoulder for hands-free communication without slipping, and this problem was never corrected {{over the life of}} the model <b>line.</b> Cushioned clamp-on <b>adaptors</b> were manufactured and sold by third parties to make it easier to cradle the handset, but these add-ons would greatly compromise the aesthetic appearance of the telephone.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects, or SFAE and SAAE, are {{shifts in}} the {{perceived}} shape-frequency and perceived shape-amplitude of a sinusoidal test contour following adaptation to a similar-shaped contour. These shape-effects are the shape analogs of the well-known size after-effect discovered by Blakemore and Sutton (1969), so {{it is possible that}} they are mediated by a size-sensitive mechanism. We tested this possibility by comparing the magnitudes of SFAEs/SAAEs elicited by contour/edge adaptors with those from luminance grating and line-grating adaptors. The rationale was that if the shape after-effects using the two classes of adaptors were similar, then they would likely be mediated by the same mechanism. We found that the SFAE and SAAE were greatly reduced when using luminance and <b>line</b> grating <b>adaptors,</b> suggesting that the SFAE and SAAE are not mediated primarily by either first- or second-order size-sensitive mechanisms. Based on previous studies we conclude that SFAEs/SAAEs are mediated by mechanisms primarily sensitive to curvature...|$|R

While eukaryotes use membrane-bound organelles, bacteria and archaea rely primarily on protein-bound nanocompartments. Encapsulins constitute {{a class of}} nanocompartments widespread in bacteria and archaea whose functions have hitherto been unclear. Here, we characterize the encapsulin nanocompartment from Myxococcus xanthus, which consists of a shell protein (EncA, 32. 5 kDa) and three internal proteins (EncB, 17 kDa; EncC, 13 kDa; EncD, 11 kDa). Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined that EncA self-assembles into an icosahedral shell 32 nm in diameter (26 nm internal diameter), built from 180 subunits with the fold first observed in bacteriophage HK 97 capsid. The internal proteins, of which EncB and EncC have ferritin-like domains, attach to its inner surface. Native nanocompartments have dense iron-rich cores. Functionally, they resemble ferritins, cage-like iron storage proteins, but with a massively greater capacity (∼ 30, 000 iron atoms versus ∼ 3, 000 in ferritin). Physiological data reveal that few nanocompartments are assembled during vegetative growth, but they increase fivefold upon starvation, protecting cells from oxidative stress through iron sequestration. Synopsis Bacteria compartmentalize by sequestering components into protein shells. Here, such a nanocompartment is shown to structurally resemble virus capsids and to store large amounts of iron for protection under starvation conditions. Iron homeostasis in Myxococcus xanthus involves iron sequestration into large protein shells (encapsulin nanocompartments). The shell is <b>lined</b> with <b>adaptor</b> proteins with ferritin-like folds that nucleate iron-rich granules. The encapsulin system appears to complement a ferritin system. The encapsulin shell closely resembles capsids of bacteriophages and herpesvirus. Thus, phages may have arisen from cellular genes, or M. xanthus may have acquired the encapsulin shell gene from a bacteriophage. Bacteria compartmentalize by sequestering components into protein shells. Here, such a nanocompartment is shown to structurally resemble virus capsids and to store large amounts of iron for protection under starvation conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of expression configuration on cross-identity expression aftereffect. The expression configuration refers to the spatial arrangement of facial features in a face for conveying an emotion, e. g., an open-mouth smile versus a closed-mouth smile. In {{the first of two}} experiments, the expression aftereffect is measured using across-identity/cross-expression configuration factorial design. The facial identities of test faces were the same or different from the adaptor, while orthogonally, the expression configurations of those facial identities were also the same or different. The result shows that the change of expression configuration impaired the expression aftereffect when the facial identities of adaptor and tests were the same; however, the impairment effect disappears when facial identities were different, indicating the identity-independent expression representation is more robust to the change of the expression configuration in comparison with the identity-dependent expression representation. In the second experiment, we used schematic <b>line</b> faces as <b>adaptors</b> and real faces as tests to minimize the similarity between the adaptor and tests, which is expected to exclude the contribution from the identity-dependent expression representation to expression aftereffect. The second experiment yields a similar result as the identity-independent expression aftereffect observed in Experiment 1. The findings indicate the different neural sensitivities to expression configuration for identity-dependent and identity-independent expression systems...|$|R
