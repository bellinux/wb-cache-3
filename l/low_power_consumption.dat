25|$|The ARM2 {{featured}} a 32-bit data bus, 26-bit address space and 2732-bit registers. Eightbits {{from the program}} counter register were available for other purposes; the top sixbits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom twobits (available because the program counter was always word-aligned) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32bits in the ARM6, but program code still had to lie within the first 64MB of memory in 26-bit compatibility mode, due to the reserved bits for the status flags. The ARM2 had a transistor count of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000. Much of this simplicity came {{from the lack of}} microcode (which represents about one-quarter to one-third of the 68000) and from (like most CPUs of the day) not including any cache.

25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form.

The viewer cannot see through them and only sees {{an image of}} the reticle.

Singlepoint are two examples of commercially available ambient lit collimator sights. These sights have the advantage of requiring less illumination for the reticle for the same level of usability, due to the high contrast black background behind the reticle.
