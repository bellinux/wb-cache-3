40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} observations {{were made on}} the Loran-C in general aviation aircraft. The evaluation of Loran-C for both cross country flights and nonprecision approaches was conducted under simulated instrument flight rules conditions. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the reliability and failure of <b>Loran-C</b> <b>equipment</b> as well as its susceptibility to atmospheric effects such as P static. Efforts were made to quantify the long term stability of the Loran-C time difference grid. Several E field antenna configurations were also evaluated in terms of performance. Significant results are reported...|$|E
40|$|Current {{techniques}} for cycle identification in Loran-C radionavigation receivers are reviewed and compared. A new technique is presented {{for use in}} hard-limiting receivers. It {{is based on the}} widely used analogue "half-cycle peak ratio" technique, from which it differs by being entirely digital; no additional analogue signal processing or other hardware is required. Drawing on recent advances, the new method makes decisions based on a large number of sample points in each Loran-C pulse, thereby increasing the resilience of the identification process in the presence of noise. Performance of the algorithm in the face of continuous-wave interference is analysed and found to be equal to or better than that of other cycle-identification techniques. Ã“ - 2 - 1.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to the extraction of navigation information from Loran-C radionavigation signals. A reduced-rate, time-reversed sequence is derived from the RF signal and processed by an FIR filter. It is shown that proper design of the FIR filter and proper control of the sampling point guarantee the rejection of skywave contamination, and achieve excellent rejection of continuous-wave interference. The process is computationally efficient. Keywords: Radionavigation Loran-C Digital signal processing Filter design [...] 3 [...] 1. Introduction Loran-C is a very widely-used hyperbolic radionavigation system which can provide an accurate position "fix" using simple <b>equipment.</b> <b>Loran-C</b> uses networks of terrestrial transmitters. Although it is being supplanted by the satellite-based GPS system, it is likely that Loran-C will continue to be widely used well into the next century. Many national governments have given their commitment to the continuation of Loran-C, and the [...] ...|$|R
