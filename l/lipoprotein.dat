40|$|The direct {{vasoactive}} {{effects of}} native and oxidatively modified low density <b>lipoproteins</b> {{as well as}} their effects on endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5 -hydroxytryptamine were studied in isolated rings of pig right coronary artery. Slowly developing contractions were caused by native low density <b>lipoproteins</b> (100 micrograms protein/ml). The contractions were more pronounced in the absence than {{in the presence of the}} trace metal chelator, EDTA, and coincided with the formation of lipid peroxides during the response. The lipophilic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene, prevented the oxidation of, and contraction to, native low density <b>lipoproteins.</b> Low density <b>lipoproteins</b> oxidized by exposure to copper contracted coronary arteries more rapidly with a threshold of only 1 micrograms protein/ml, but with a similar maximal contraction at 100 micrograms protein/ml. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the contraction to native low density <b>lipoproteins,</b> but not to oxidized low density <b>lipoproteins.</b> Catalase blocked contractions to both native and oxidized low density <b>lipoproteins.</b> Contractions to oxidized low density <b>lipoproteins</b> were unaffected by indomethacin, but were abolished by removal of the endothelium or by inhibitors of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Oxidized low density <b>lipoproteins</b> but not native low density <b>lipoproteins</b> inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Thus, oxidized low density <b>lipoproteins</b> caused endothelium-dependent coronary artery contractions which are mediated by a hydroperoxide. Contractions to native low density <b>lipoproteins</b> are due to their oxidation in the organ chamber by the superoxide anion radical. Oxidized, but not native, low density <b>lipoproteins</b> impair normal endothelial cell vasodilator function in vitro. Oxidized low density <b>lipoproteins,</b> important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, may directly contribute to the increased risk of vasospasm seen in hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis...|$|R
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of <b>lipoprotein</b> lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of <b>lipoprotein</b> remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density <b>lipoprotein</b> receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density <b>lipoprotein</b> (LDL), normal level of high-density <b>lipoprotein</b> (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|Apolipoprotein B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the <b>lipoprotein</b> particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second {{chromosome}} (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E

Aspartate at this position makes <b>lipoproteins</b> specific to the inner membrane, whereas other residues cause the release of <b>lipoproteins</b> from the inner membrane in a manner dependent on both ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter LolCDE and molecular chaperone LolA, followed by LolB-dependent localization in the outer membrane. The function of lipoprotein-sorting signals was examined in proteoliposomes reconstituted from LolCDE and <b>lipoproteins.</b> The release of outer membrane-specific <b>lipoproteins</b> was inhibited on reconstitution with other outer membrane-specific, but not inner membrane-specific, <b>lipoproteins.</b> Outer membrane-specific <b>lipoproteins</b> stimulated ATP hydrolysis by LolCDE whereas inner membrane-specific ones did not.

40|$|As an {{extension}} of metabolic studies of the cholesteryl ester component of rat very low density <b>lipoproteins,</b> we have studied the metabolism of the B apoprotein component labeled by intravenous injection of [3 H]lysine. The B apoprotein separated from other apoproteins by delipidation and selective precipitation with tetramethylurea could not be distinguished from B apoprotein prepared by the conventional gel filtration technique. After injection of [3 H]lysine, specific activity of B apoprotein was maximal in very low density and low density <b>lipoproteins</b> 1 and 11 / 2 -h later, respectively, {{in a manner consistent}} with a precursor-product relationship. When protein-labeled very low density <b>lipoproteins</b> were injected into rats, the relationships of specific activity again indicated that B apoprotein of very low density <b>lipoproteins</b> may be the sole precursor of that of low density <b>lipoproteins.</b> However, less than 10 % of the B apoprotein that disappeared from very low density <b>lipoproteins</b> appeared in density <b>lipoproteins.</b> To evaluate the sites of removal of B aproprotein of very low density <b>lipoproteins</b> from plasma, protein-labeled very low density <b>lipoproteins</b> were incubated with unlabeled high density <b>lipoproteins</b> to reduce radioactivity in non-B apoproteins selectively by molecular exchange. Most of the B apoprotein was rapidly removed by the liver.

In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL). This suggests that it has more catalytic than structural functions, since there is less than one APOA5 molecule per one <b>lipoprotein</b> particle. APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also been detected on HDL particles.|$|E
5|$|The MAM {{may also}} {{be part of the}} {{secretory}} pathway, in addition to its role in intracellular lipid trafficking.

5|$|When a serpin {{inhibits}} {{a target}} protease, {{it forms a}} permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density <b>lipoprotein</b> receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the Drosophila serpin, necrotic, is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).|$|E

However, lipoprotein-macrophage interactions have the potential to modulate macrophage function in a variety of additional ways that may impact on atherosclerosis. These include modulating cellular cholesterol and oxysterol content, providing fatty acids as ligands for PPARs, and acting as ligands for macrophage scavenger and Toll-like receptors.

40|$|Streptococcus agalactiae is a {{significant}} pathogen causing invasive disease in neonates and thus {{an understanding of the}} molecular basis of the pathogenicity of this organism is of importance. N-terminal lipidation is a major mechanism by which bacteria can tether proteins to membranes.

Patterns searches with this pattern and other bioinformatic methods have been used to identify putative <b>lipoproteins</b> in the recently published genomes of S. agalactiae strains 2603 /V and NEM 316. A core of 39 common putative <b>lipoproteins</b> was identified, along with 5 putative <b>lipoproteins</b> unique to strain 2603 /V and 2 putative <b>lipoproteins</b> unique to strain NEM 316.

In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum <b>lipoprotein.</b> Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures.

Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response.

An inhibitor to {{the enzyme}} lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (5, 5 '-dithionitrobenzoic acid) was added in some experiments to prevent modification of substrate-lipids contained in secreted <b>lipoproteins.</b> The inhibitor did not detectably alter hepatic ultrastructure or gas exchange, but it inhibited the secreted lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase {{by more than}} 85 %. Very low density <b>lipoproteins</b> in perfusate were unaltered but the high density <b>lipoproteins</b> obtained from livers perfused with the inhibitor appeared disk-shaped in negative stain by electron microscopy with a mean edge thickness of 46 +/- 5 A and a mean diameter of 190 +/- 25 A. The high density <b>lipoproteins</b> were composed predominantly of polar lipids and protein with only small amounts of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. The major apoprotein of these discoidal fractions had the same electrophoretic mobility as the arginine-rich apoprotein, whereas plasma high density <b>lipoproteins</b> contained mainly the A-I approtein. In all these respects the discoidal perfusate high density <b>lipoproteins</b> closely resemble those found in human plasma which is deficient in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase.
