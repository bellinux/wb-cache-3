For example, increasingly effective political administration and reform with continued successful economic modernization would be generally compatible with U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests</b> in greater economic opportunity, foreign policy cooperation, and political liberalization in China. Alternatively, Chinese administration, economic vitality, and internal cohesion could degenerate, limiting U.

Finally, China could develop formidable economic power while retaining authoritarian political control, with China emerging as a world power less interested in accommodating U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests</b> than in opposing them...|$|R

The ratio M 2 /Reserves measures the degree of financial vulnerability and brings this literature closer to theoretical constructions.

Early marriages that occur in children is related with their sorroundings, such as family and peer groups. This research aims to determine the correlation of the intensity of parent – child communication, the intensity of communication with peer groups, an girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early. The method which is used in this research is the quantitative with positivistic approach. This research used The Reasoned Action Theory and The Reference Group Theory. This research is using non probability samling technique. The population in this research is girls age 10 - 16 in Indramayu district. While the sample is 60 respondens. The data is analyzed with the aid of SPSS aplication with Pearson correlation test. The result of this research indicate there is correlation between the intensity of parent – child communication and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early with significance value is 0, 001 and Pearson correlation value is - 0, 434. It means the correlation 2 ̆ 7 s power of the intensity of parent – child communication and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is medium with not unidirectional. So, if the intensity of parent – child communication is high, then girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is low. If the intensity of parent – child communication is low, then girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is high. And also there is correlation between the intensity of communication with peer groups and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early with significance value is 0, 006 and Pearson correlation value is 0, 353.

During this period, leftists committed 81 percent of the terrorism-related murders of U. S. citizens. In the 1970 s, leftists began targeting U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests,</b> including military personnel. By 1980, the left had killed ten Americans. Although severely crippled following Turkey's 1980 coup, Devrimci Sol-the most prominent group-re-emerged in 1990 and dramatically increased attacks against U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests</b> during the Gulf War, perpetrating 75 percent of all terrorist-related U. S. deaths in 1991. Although devastating Turkish security operations and an internal group schism following the Gulf War drastically reduced the organization's violent activities, the late 1990 s witnessed Devrimci Sol's renewed interest in targeting the U. S. The thesis explains leftist development and violence against U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests,</b> suggesting Turkey's rapid modernization and the resulting instability provided fertile ground for the extreme left's emergence. By the 1970 s, following periods of increased political liberalization, the rise of Marxist-Leninist ideology coupled with government intolerance to opposition groups elevated terrorism to the sole perceived avenue of change.

40|$|The authors offer {{evidence}} that U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy {{has an important}} influence in the determination of credit spreads on emerging market bonds over U.

Their analysis improves on the existing literature and understanding by addressing the dynamics of market expectations in shaping views on interest rate and monetary policy changes and by recognizing nonlinearities in the link between U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates and emerging market bond spreads, {{as the level of}} interest rates affect the market's perceived probability of default and the solvency of emerging market borrowers. For a country with a moderate level of debt, repayment prospects would remain good {{in the face of an}} increase in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates, so there would be little increase in spreads. A country close to the borderline of solvency would face a steeper increase in spreads.

We compare the forecast performance of the nonparametric fit to the performance of two benchmark linear models: an autoregressive model and a random-walk-with-drift model. The nonparametric model exhibits greater out-of-sample forecast accuracy than that of the linear predictors for most U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate series.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{stressed}} the role of movements in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates and country spreads in driving business cycles in emerging market economies. At the same time, country spreads have been found to respond to changes in both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate and domestic conditions in emerging markets. These intricate interrelationships leave open a number of fundamental questions: Do country spreads drive business cycles in emerging countries or vice versa, or both? Do U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates affect emerging countries directly or primarily through their effect on country spreads? This paper addresses these and other related questions using a methodology that combines empirical and theoretical elements. The main findings are: (1) U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate shocks explain about 20 percent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging market economies at business-cycle frequency. (2) Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of business-cycle movements in emerging economies. (3) About 60 percent of movements in country spreads are explained by country-spread shocks. (4) In response to an increase in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates, country spreads first fall and then display a large, delayed overshooting; (5) U. S. -interest-rate shocks affect domestic variables mostly through their effects on country spreads. (6) The fact that country spreads respond to business conditions in emerging economies significantly exacerbates aggregate volatility in these countries. (7) The U. S. -interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks identified in this paper are plausible {{in the sense that they}} imply similar business cycles in the context of an empirical VAR model as they do in the context of a theoretical dynamic general equilibrium model of an emerging market economy.

This Article argues that the current challenge to family-law exceptionalism has been largely one way, to the detriment of a central concern of family law: the protection of children and of the parent-child relationship. Family-law scholars have focused primarily on whether and how to import the tools and insights of other areas of law into the zone of family relations, while largely overlooking the possibility that the tools and insights of family law might instead be exported outward, into the rest of the legal canon. In the process, family-law scholars have contributed to an already existing blind spot regarding {{the extent to which the}} conditions of child rearing are affected, often profoundly, by jurisprudence that we do not think of as involving family relations, but that affects the conditions of children 2 ̆ 7 s development by affecting their parents or caretakers.

Using newly available intraday data, we investigate how surprises associated with U.

Our study covers the period February 1999 to April 2005. We find that FOMC announcements that lead to an increase in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates are associated with a systematic increase in Brazil's bond spread and a systematic decline in the stock price index. Several U. S. macro data surprises, including for nonfarm payrolls and the CPI, prompt an increase in the Brazilian bond yield spread and a fall in Brazilian share prices. These combined findings suggest that, for Brazil during this period, the financial risks of higher U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates in response to positive news about the U.
