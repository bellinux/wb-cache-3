500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group E, along with Dutch champions PSV, Greek club Panathinaikos and Norwegian side Rosenborg. An Alex own goal {{was enough for}} Arsenal to claim three points against PSV on the first matchday. The team drew away to Rosenborg and earnt a point at Panathinaikos, despite twice having taken the lead at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences. Wenger accepted referee Herbert Fandel's decision, but added his surprise that Mark van Bommel was not cautioned: [...] "If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fouls he made without being punished it is very surprising because he made some deliberate fouls.

50|$|The {{pit lane}} exit {{has also been}} criticised as it fed into the outside of Turn 1, despite {{original}} plans for a pit exit running around {{the outside of the}} turns 1 and 2 run off area. Although it was off the racing line, if a drivers locked up at the turn and ran wide, they could hit someone exiting the pits. This happened during practice for the 2011 Korean Grand Prix when Mercedes' Nico Rosberg ran wide and hit Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari. The exit was criticised by several drivers as well as Mercedes GP's team principal Ross Brawn. He said 'I have to say it's a little frustrating, with a brand new circuit like this, that we have that problem. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cars that went off at turn one in first practice. With wet, difficult conditions, I think it was 20 or 30.' Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said it was 'an accident that was going to happen' given the poor design of the exit.' Nico Rosberg and Jarno Trulli also felt that the exit 'needed to be improved'. Following complaints from the drivers, the FIA installed a set of traffic lights {{at the end of the}} pit lane, warning and drivers rejoining the race of cars approaching at race speeds. Teams also employed the use of spotters to warn drivers (both racing and exiting the pits) of any cars in the pit lane.|$|E

40|$|The NDLTD is an {{international}} consortium aimed at improving graduate education, enhancing universities ’ information infrastructure, and increasing scholarship by sharing through digital libraries.

For the ETDs themselves, we can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ETDs received, and at the quality of those ETDs. The NDLTD is emerging {{at a time when there}} are widespread efforts at establishing digital libraries. As digital libraries become central to the scholarly enterprise, it is necessary that all new works be prepared in electronic form. The success of the NDLTD depends on adopting sensible strategies for the future. Standards must be developed, interoperability must be insured by overcoming both technical and social issues, and the NDLTD must demonstrate the necessary scalability to continue to grow. During its first year the NDLTD has grown rapidly, opening its second year with over twenty members. There already has been encouraging interest in the ETD collection, and it appears that, on average, ETDs are accessed more than ten times as often as their paper counterparts. With continued corporate and academic support the NDLTD and its influence will continue to grow. We encourage everyone who reads this article to participate...|$|E

Regarding the execution time, D-ForenRIA (even using a single browser) is orders of magnitudes faster than the basic solution. On average, over all experiments, D-ForenRIA needs 12.7 s to detect an action while the basic solution needs around 8 min to detect an action.|$|E
