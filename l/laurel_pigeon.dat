50|$|The <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> or white-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Paloma rabiche) (Columba junoniae) is {{a species}} of bird in the Columba genus in the family Columbidae. It {{is a member of}} the family Columbidae of doves and pigeons, which is endemic to the Canary Islands, Spain. This wood pigeon is endemic to the laurel forest habitat. It is the animal symbol of the island of La Gomera.|$|E
50|$|The Bolle's <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba bollii) of the Canary Islands {{was named}} after him by Frederick DuCane Godman.|$|E
50|$|The similar Canarian species, the Bolle's pigeon or dark-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> Columba bollii has a pale grey sub{{terminal}} {{band and}} blackish terminal band to tail.|$|E

50|$|There are twenty two {{endemic species}} of {{terrestrial}} birds, three endemic genera and one family. The New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) {{is known for}} its intelligence. The <b>laurel</b> forest <b>pigeon</b> (Columba vitiensis hyponochroa), giant wood pigeon notou (Ducula goliath). Two genera are endemic: Drepanoptila (the green pigeon), and Eunymphicus, Ouvea parakeet. The New Caledonian parakeet known to be the basal species in the genus Cyanoramphus, which had its origins in New Caledonia from where it spread to many ocean Pacific islands.|$|R
50|$|It {{is present}} on seven islands and extinct on Flores island. This pigeon shared its habitat with the extinct <b>laurel</b> forest {{mountain}} <b>pigeon,</b> or black pigeon (pombo da serra). The extinct species was tamer than the Azores wood pigeon. However, {{the species is}} in danger of disappearing, like the related Madeiran wood pigeon, (Columba palumbus maderensis).|$|R
50|$|Pigeons can breed {{from their}} first year, and nesting occurs {{throughout}} the year, although mainly from February to June. The displays {{are similar to those}} of the common wood pigeon; the male climbs quickly in flight, gives a loud wing-clap, and then glides down with his wings and tail spread. The display may be repeated two or three times before the bird returns to a perch. On the ground the male performs a bowing display with his neck inflated to show off the iridescent neck patches; meanwhile, the tail is raised, fanned, then closed again. This display is usually accompanied by calling. The nest is a typical pigeon construction, a flimsy structure of twigs and grasses usually placed high in the floor of canyon walls with lots of vegetation. Nestled among the crevices in rocks, in gullies of the hills. The usual clutch has a white egg one smooth white egg. Breeding success and nest predation have effects on the two Canarian endemic pigeons, Bolle's <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> Columba bollii and white-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> Columba junoniae. Nest predation was the more important cause of nesting failure of both species (88%), but principally affecting the white-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon.</b> It showed a greater predation on the ground than in trees and a lower predation in the February-March period than in June-July and September October. The abundance of predators, estimated by bait consumption, showed a similar seasonal pattern, while fruit availability decreased over time from the first to third period. Predators identified by automatic cameras showed that black rat Rattus rattus was the major nest predator of both pigeons. These general patterns of nest predation affect the white-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> which breeds on the ground mainly during April-July, much more than Bolle's <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon,</b> which breeds in trees especially in February-June. All seems to indicate that rats are the key factor causing the scarcity of the white-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> on Tenerife.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is renowned}} {{as one of}} the best places to observe the two Canarian endemic pigeons, <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba junoniae) and Bolle's pigeon (Columba bollii).|$|E
50|$|A rare {{resident}} breeder in {{the mountain}} laurisilva and Canary pine forests, the <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> builds a stick nest in a tree. There it lays one white egg.|$|E
50|$|At 40-43 cm, a <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{looks like}} a very dark wood pigeon. It is a {{basically}} dark brown bird, with a dark pink breast. The lack of any white markings, together with its darker markings, distinguish it from the other species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{a rather}} plain, dark grey bird of 38 cm. Large, dark brown and grey pigeon. Mainly dark sepia-brown, redder on underparts. Pale grey tail with broad, whitish {{terminal}} band. Extensive green gloss to rear crown and hindneck becoming pink on upper mantle. Whitish bill and pale eye.|$|E
50|$|Bolle's pigeon (Columba bollii) is {{a species}} of the genus Columba of family Columbidae, doves and pigeons, endemic to the Canary Islands, Spain. This bird is named after the German naturalist Carl Bolle, {{who was the first}} to {{distinguish}} it from the <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon.</b> This wood pigeon is endemic to the laurel forest habitat.|$|E
50|$|The trocaz pigeon, Madeira <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> or {{long-toed pigeon}} (Columba trocaz) is a pigeon which is endemic {{to the island}} of Madeira. It is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast; its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing {{markings}} distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor, the common wood pigeon. Its call is a characteristic six-note cooing, weaker and lower-pitched {{than that of the}} wood pigeon. Despite its bulky, long-tailed appearance, this pigeon has a fast, direct flight.|$|E
50|$|Mainly dark grey with blacker flight {{feathers}} and paler grey tail with dark terminal band, hindneck with green and pink gloss and reddish tinge to breast. Only {{likely to be}} confused with white-tailed <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> Columba junoniae or dark feral pigeon. The voice is a guttural mournful cooing. Hints: Look for birds flying low and fast over laurel forest.Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, characteristic of pigeons in general. It takes off with a loud clattering.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{than the}} common pigeon, {{a length of}} 36 cm to 38 cm. It is a large dark grey pigeon. At 37-40 cm, {{it looks like a}} very dark wood pigeon. Its dark grey, rather than brown plumage, and the dark bands on the grey tail {{distinguish}} it from the other pigeon endemic to the Canary Islands, the <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon.</b> It is a basically dark grey bird, with a pinkish breast. It lacks any white markings, which together with its darker plumage distinguishes it from the other species.|$|E

50|$|The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canary Islands, Azores, and Madeira have a {{volcanic}} origin {{and have never}} {{been part of a}} continent. At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonized by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. One of these was the lineage of extinct species laurel forest mountain pigeon or Azores black pigeon (pombo da serra). Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle's pigeon may have arrived in the Canary Islands about 5 mya. An older lineage gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon,</b> C. junoniae, may date from 20 mya.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic archipelagos of the Canaries, Azores, and Madeira have a {{volcanic}} origin {{and they have}} never been part of a continent. The formation of Madeira started in the Miocene and the island was substantially complete by 700,000 years ago. At various times in the past, the major islands of these archipelagos were all colonised by ancestral wood pigeons, which evolved on their respective islands in isolation from the mainland populations. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that the ancestor of Bolle's pigeon may have arrived in the Canaries about 5 mya, but an older lineage that gave rise to another Canarian endemic, the <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon,</b> C. junoniae, may date from 20 mya. The most recent wood pigeon arrival on Macaronesia was that which gave rise to the subspecies C. palumbus maderensis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{exclusively}} herbivorous. Nearly 60% of its diet is fruit, {{with most}} of the rest being leaves, and just 1% is flowers. The fruits of Til, Azores Laurel and Persea indica, and the fruits and leaves of small-leaved holly are the most frequently detected food items. Most seeds pass through the digestive system intact, apart from those of Azores Laurel, which are usually damaged. Fruit is the main component of the diet when it is readily available in autumn and winter, and leaves are consumed in spring and summer when fruits are scarce. In one study, 27% of the leaves consumed came from native trees, especially Small-leaved Holly, 61% from herbs and shrubs, and nearly 10% from introduced trees, mainly apples and peaches. This pigeon will feed in agricultural areas, where cabbage is the most commonly taken crop plant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{endemic to}} the mountainous {{subtropical}} Atlantic west Canary islands, where it occurs {{on the islands}} of La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife and El Hierro. In the 1980s, the population was estimated at 1,200-1,480 individuals, but more recent surveys have shown {{that it is more}} numerous, and more widely distributed. The largest subpopulation is found on La Palma, where it occurs across much of the northern half of the island. The species is common on La Gomera, where it is found primarily in the north, and also occurs patchily on the northern slopes of Tenerife. It has recently also been recorded on El Hierro; however, breeding there has not yet been confirmed3,4. Although the species was recently suspected to be declining on Tenerife. Formerly also bred on the neighbouring Gran Canaria. It mainly occurs on the northern slopes of the mountains, but smaller numbers are found in the south where suitable patches of laurel forest remain.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{resident}} breeder {{in the mountain}} laurisilva forest zone. Bolle's pigeon builds a stick nest in a tree, laying one white egg. Columba bollii occurs on Tenerife particularly at Anaga and Teno, La Palma in a restricted area of the north-east), La Gomera in Garajonay National Park with some birds outside the park, and El Hierro where it occurs in Golfo and Sabinosa in the Canary Islands, Spain. It may formerly have occurred on Gran Canaria, as bones {{similar to those of}} a <b>laurel</b> <b>pigeon</b> have been found and there is a possible sight record from the late 19th century. It was common in the past, but disappeared from many areas owing to clearance of laurel forest in the islands. More recently the rate of laurel forest clearance has been slowed or stopped. Population estimates for the species are 1,160-1,315 birds in 1980, 6,000 individuals in 2001, and 5,000-20,000 most recently. Whether these figures reveal genuine population increases is unclear, but the area of occupied territory appears to be expanding and despite several potential threats the population is at least stable, probably increasing.|$|E

40|$|The diet of the endemic Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> Columba trocaz in {{agricultural}} and forest areas of Madeira Island was studied in 1997 {{by means of}} microhistological analysis of 157 faecal samples, 94 from two of the ma{{in agricultural}} zones and 63 from a laurel forest. Cabbage {{was the most important}} component of the diet in agricultural areas, representing more than 54 % of the optical fields analysed. Samples collected further from the forest contained a higher proportion of cabbage. Native fruits did not figure highly in the samples collected from agricultural areas and crop plants did not appear in the forest samples, suggesting a degree of dietary separation and that some individuals may concen-trate on crops. Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> is normally a highly frugivorous species and fruit availability is relatively high in winter when the birds go to agricultural areas to feed. This suggests {{that it is not a}} shortage of natural foods that causes them to leave the forest. The unpopularity of the pigeon as a result of its pest status is the main threat to its existence. More information on the seasonal physiological requirements of Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> and the pattern of individual use of crops is needed to ensure the future conservation of this species...|$|E
40|$|The Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> (Columba trocaz) {{is mainly}} {{restricted}} to the laurel forest areas located in the northern slopes of this island. Since its discovery in 1420, much of this relict forest has been cleared for agricultura and timber use. Nowadays, the laurel forest with 15 000 ha (about 20 % of the total 737 km 2 of the islnad surface) is well protected by Nature Reserves. Although most of the pigeon population, estimated as 8, 400 birds, is included within these areas, this species is threatened due to illegal hunting and poisoning. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{temporal}} diet {{variation of the}} endemic Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> (Columba trocaz) and fruit resource availability in the laurel forests of northwestern Madeira Island, during 1996 and 1997. We studied a total of 224 fecal samples using microhistological methods and conducted surveys of fuiting phenology throughout a year. Fruits (pulp and seeds) represented 57 % of the optical fields analyzed. Leaves and flowers constituted 38 % and < 1 % respectively. Over 33 plant species were identified in the fecal samples. Fruits of Ocotea foetens, Laurus azorica, Persea indica, and Ilex canariensis (fruits and leaves) were the most frequently detected food items. Most seeds were defecated intact (Ilex canartiensis, Myrica faya, Visnea mocanera, Ocotea foetens, and Apollonias barbujana), except {{in the case of}} Laurus azorica where most were damaged. The diet showed a marked seasonal variation. Fruits constituted the major component of the diet in winter and autumn, whereas leaves were frequent in spring and summer. The presence of fruits in the diet was concordant with their availability, and leaves and flowers became important when fruits were scarce. This fact suggests that the Madeira <b>Laurel</b> <b>Pigeon</b> is capable of dietary switching, corresponding to temporal variations in food resource availability. This microhistological technique shows promise for study of the diets of pigeons and other herbivorous bird species. Se estudiÃ³ la dieta estacional de Columba trocaz y la disponibilidad de frutos en los bosques de laurisilva de la zona noroeste de la Isla Madeira, durante 1996 y 1997. Se analizÃ³ un total de 224 excrementos mediante mÃ©tdos microhistolÃ³gico, y se realizÃ³ un seguimiento estacional de la disponiblidad de frutos, por medio de transectos, a lo largo de un aÃ±o. Los frutos (pulpa y semillas) representaron un 57 % de los campos Ã³pticos analizados; las hojas y las flores constituyeron un 38 % y < 1 %, rewspectivamente. MÃ¡s de 33 especies fueron identificadas en los excrementos; restos de frutos de Ocotea foetens, Laurus azorica, Persea indica e Ilex canariensis (tanto frutos como hojas) resultaron ser los mÃ¡s frecuentes detectados. La mayorÃ­a de las semillas fueron defecadas intactas ((Ilex canariensis, Myrica faya, Visnea mocanera, Ocotea foetens y Apollonias barbujana), excepto en el caso de Laurus azorica, donde la mayorÃ­a de ellas aparecieron daÃ±adas. La dieta mostrÃ³ un marcado carÃ¡cter estacional, constituyendo los frutos el componente mÃ¡s importante en invierno y otoÃ±o, mientras que las hojas fueron mÃ¡s abundantes en primavera y verano. La presencia de frutos en los excrementos fue concordante con su disponibilidad, adquiriendo una mayor relevancia las hojas y las flores cuando la producciÃ³n de los frutos fue escasa. Este hecho sugiere que C. trocaz exhibe una alta flexibilidad en la dieta, aprovechando aquellos recursos que son estacionalmente abundantes. Los resultados obtenidos en estos anÃ¡lisis microhistolÃ³gicos ofrecen un aceptable nivel de fiabilidad para ser utilizados en estudios sobre dieta de palomas y, probablemente, extensibles a otras aves hervÃ­boras.
