The Tax Reform Act significantly contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s that resulted in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation, encouraging <b>loan</b> <b>origination.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>origination</b> is {{the process}} by which a {{borrower}} applies for a new loan, and a lender processes that application. Origination generally includes all the steps from taking a loan application up to disbursal of funds (or declining the application). For mortgages, there is a specific mortgage origination process. Loan servicing covers everything after disbursing the funds until the loan is fully paid off. <b>Loan</b> <b>origination</b> is a specialized version of new account opening for financial services organizations. Certain people and organizations specialize in <b>loan</b> <b>origination.</b> Mortgage brokers and other mortgage originator companies serve as a prominent example.|$|E
