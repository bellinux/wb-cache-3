He was {{initiated}} into the Oklahoma Kappa chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at OU. For a time McGhee worked for Conoco, working on a crew that made the first oil discovery on the Gulf Coast through reflection seismology. He was awarded a Rhodes scholarship, gaining a doctorate in physical sciences from Oxford University in 1937. Back in the United States he became vice president of the National Geophysical Company, where he managed reflection seismology surveys in Cuba. On his return to Texas, McGhee found employment with Everette <b>Lee</b> DeGolyer's <b>oil</b> services company DeGolyer and MacNaughton, scouting oilfields and marrying DeGolyer's daughter Cecilia. McGhee described Cecilia as [...] "the most beautiful and richest girl in Texas."

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} a methanolic extract of amurca (olive <b>oil</b> <b>lees)</b> was determined against both Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes and S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. enteritidis) foodborne pathogens at 10 &# 176;C or 37 &# 176;C using microdilution and disk diffusion methods, and its relative activity {{was compared to}} selected antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations of amurca extract ranged from 60 to 80 &# 181;l/ml at 37 &# 176;C after 24 h against all tested strains. At 10 &# 176;C, amurca was more inhibitory with MIC and MBC values of 40 and 60 &# 181;l/ml, respectively, after 7 d against tested strains. Amurca at 40 &# 181;l/ml reduced numbers of tested pathogens by 2. 5 to 3. 2 log 10 CFU/ml at 10 &# 176;C after 7 d, but was not inhibitory at 37 &# 176;C after 24 h. Protein prepared from amurca was not antimicrobial. The relative antimicrobial activity (inhibition zone ratio) of 80 &# 181;l/ml amurca methanolic extract compared to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamycin and tetracycline ranged from 0. 36 to 1. 0 against Gram-negative and from 0. 45 to 2. 0 against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, amurca extract inhibited E. coli O 157 :H 7 02 - 0628 and S. aureus 26127 which were resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the relationship between}} Singapore and West Asia, particularly the role of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), between 1981 and 2013, by looking into trade relationship established through trade missions, areas of coorporation, agreements sealed and trade statistics during the era of each Prime Minister of Singapore i. e. Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong. For this research, there are three objectives. The first objective {{of this study is}} to explain the history of early trade between Singapore and West Asia before the establishment of GCC in year 1981. Next, to study the pattern and changes in trade mission between Singapore and West Asia, especially GCC during the era of Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong. Lastly, to analyse trade cooperation between Singapore and West Asia, especially GCC, during the era of Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong. Library research method is used throughout the study. Primary sources used include newspaper, news, press release, occasional report, speech, agreement and statistical record while secondary sources used include book, article, conference working paper and dissertation. Sources used are obtained from the University of Malaya Libary, the National Library Singapore, website of the National Archives of Singapore, website of the Singapore Department of Statistics and other relevant sources. This research highlights the close trade relationship between Singapore and West Asia, particulary GCC. This is visible through the two-way trade missions between Singapore and GCC and also the number of trade agreements sealed especially during the administration of <b>Lee</b> Hsien Loong. <b>Oil</b> crisis and conflict in GCC does not hold back trade relationship between Singapore and GCC. Besides carrying out trade missions, Singapore has also exhibited Her products in GCC, promoted Halal foods produced by Singapore companies as well as shown Her talent in fields such as water technology, shipping and engineering in order to attract investors from GCC. Besides that, similarities between Singapore and GCC has also led to the cooperation between Singapore and GCC. The research also shows that Singapore stresses the importance of having GCC as one of Her most important trading partners. One significant incident is when Singapore, together with its Muslim minority group, ventured into Halal food industry...|$|R
