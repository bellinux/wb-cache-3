40|$|The sceneries of Ramayana sculpted on {{the wooden}} parts of the monasteries in Luang Prabang, do not depict the real Lao version of the Ramayana, the Phra Lak Phra Lam, but either the Valmiki Ramayana or the Ramakerti "Glory of Rama" (Khmer Reamker of the 16 th or 17 th century, more {{recently}} the Thai Ramakian). A sculpted beam in Vat May temple in Luang Prabang, describes the first episodes of the Ramakian; through very altered interpretations of the Indian myths, the artist told {{about the origin of}} the main characters in the epic. In Vat Xieng Thong monastery, a chapel erected by the last Laotian king to shelter the royal funeral furniture, is decorated with wall panels and wooden sculpted and guilded corbels. The panels depict the heroic exploits of Rama and are close to the Valmiki tradition whereas on the corbels, the sculptor was inspired by the Ramakerti. Isolated episodes ornament the folding panels and flash-screens of the <b>lighting</b> <b>brackets</b> of several sanctuaries. The pictures thus represented must glorify Rama but they often give the leading role to his allied, his brother Laksmana or the monkeys, especially Hanuman. The sculptor of Vat May is an image-carver who retained mostly the anecdotical side of the legends which he told with the animation of a story-teller. In Vat Xieng Thong, the artist, rejecting all realistic scenery, sought to adapt his compositions -to the surfaces he had to decorate and to the texts which inspired him; that is why he knew how to impregnate his heroes with the buddhistic atmosphere that is proper to the Ramakerti.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Light cure of {{resin-based}} adhesives is {{the mainstay}} of orthodontic bonding. In recent years, alternatives to conventional halogen lights offering reduced curing time {{and the potential for}} lower attachment failure rates have emerged. The relative merits of curing lights in current use, including halogen-based lamps, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and plasma arc lights, have not been analyzed systematically. In this study, we reviewed randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials to assess the risks of attachment failure and bonding time in orthodontic patients in whom brackets were cured with halogen lights, LEDs, or plasma arc systems. METHODS Multiple electronic database searches were undertaken, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL. Language restrictions were not applied. Unpublished literature was searched on ClinicalTrials. gov, the National Research Register, Pro-Quest Dissertation Abstracts, and Thesis database. Search terms included randomized controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, random allocation, double blind method, single blind method, orthodontics, LED, halogen, bond, and bracket. Authors of primary studies were contacted as required, and reference lists of the included studies were screened. RESULTS Randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials directly comparing conventional halogen lights, LEDs, or plasma arc systems involving patients with full arch, fixed, or bonded orthodontic appliances (not banded) with follow-up periods of a minimum of 6 months were included.

40|$|This report {{studies the}} {{behaviour}} of the Italian consumers of lighting fixtures, taking into consideration: lighting product characteristics, purchasing process, consumer's profile. Purchases of bulbs are also considered. The study {{is based on}} 420 telephone interviews with families who purchased lighting fixtures worth at least ITL 50, 000 over the previous 12 months. Purchases of lighting products are broken down by product type (floor lamps, table lamps, wall <b>lights</b> and <b>brackets,</b> chandeliers & multi arm fittings, flush fittings, bathroom mirror lights, spotlights projectors, built-in spotlights, outdoor and garden lights), style of lighting product (contemporary/modern/design or classical/traditional), material (glass/crystal, steel/aluminium/metal, bronze/brass, wood, plastic) and positioning {{of the source of}} light. The type of light source is also considered (traditional screw-type bulbs, halogen bulbs, fluorescent energy saving bulbs, fluorescent neon tubes). The average total spend on lighting appliances is also provided as well as spend on each type of lighting appliance. All the above mentioned data on purchases of lighting products and bulbs are broken down by socio-demographic characteristics of purchasers: geographic area, size of urban centre, sex, age and profession of head of family. The purchasing process is analysed according to: reasons for purchase, degree of recollection of names of lighting brands and retailers, criteria of choice in the purchase, distribution channels for lighting products, loyalty to the sales outlet, information channels about the lighting products (magazines, Internet), degree of customer satisfaction and reasons for any dissatisfaction. Purchases of lighting fixtures are broken down by product type and purchasing channel: design lighting retailer, traditional lighting retailer, furniture and lighting retailer, large furniture and lighting chain, retailers and wholesalers of electric materials, hypermarkets and department stores, DIY, other (direct sales, craft products, antiques, mail order, gift shops). The consumer's life-style is examined on the basis of socio-economic status, value models (choice of consumer goods, cultural consumption, leisure activities), decision-making process within the family nucleus, living conditions, type of furnishings. ...|$|R

Incognito lingual brackets (3 M Unitek), STb lingual <b>brackets</b> (<b>Light</b> Lingual System; ORMCO), and conventional 0. 018 inch slot brackets (Gemini; 3 M Unitek) were bonded on three identical maxillary acrylic resin models, with a palatally displaced right lateral incisor. The transfer trays for the indirect bonding of the lingual brackets were constructed in certified laboratories. Each model was mounted on the orthodontic measurement and simulation system and ten 0. 013 inch CuNiTi wires were used for each bracket type. The wire was ligated with elastomerics and each measurement was repeated once after re-ligation. The labiopalatal forces and the moments in the sagittal plane were recorded on the right lateral incisor. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc Scheffe pairwise comparisons were used to assess the effect on bracket type on the generated forces and moments. The magnitude of forces ranged from 1. 62, 1. 27, and 1. 81 N for the STb, conventional, and Incognito brackets, respectively; the corresponding moments were 2. 01, 1. 45, and 2. 19 N mm, respectively. Bracket type was a significant predictor of the generated forces (P < 0. 001) and moments (P < 0. 001).

50|$|In 1993, 291 {{buildings}} {{were identified as}} buildings to be preserved and restored out of nearly 900 buildings left standing after the war. Many of the surviving heritage {{buildings were}} in a hazardous and dilapidated state mainly due to small arms fire and subsequent deterioration. The main concentrations of retained buildings were in the Etoile and Foch-Allenby districts of Beirut’s historic core, Saifi Village and Wadi Abu Jamil. The Master Plan, completed and approved by a decree emanating from the Council of Ministers in March 1994, outlined {{the restoration of the}} retained buildings. Buildings identified for preservation were divided into three categories: governmental and religious, buildings of heritage and architectural value and ‘other category’ buildings. These were mainly modern structures in salvageable state. Buildings of heritage value had to be restored without external alteration, while limited alterations and additions were permitted for ‘other category’ buildings. Considerable local stonemasonry skills were required to complete the restoration of these buildings, especially with regard to the hand-carving of decorative features, copied from surviving fragments. An important aspect of restoration in the historic core was the parallel implementation of a pedestrian zone using basalt setts, salvaged from beneath existing streets, together with a unique vocabulary of street furniture. This included the re-creation of the original <b>lighting</b> poles and <b>brackets</b> designed for Beirut in the 1920s.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of brackets bonded to ceramic with Transbond XT resin, etching time intervals (1 and 2 minutes) and three Light sources (Xenon Plasma Arc, LED and Halogen Light), {{with and without}} silane. METHODS: In total, 12 feldspathic ceramic cylinders (15 mm x 20 mm), etched with 10 % hydrofluoric acid were used. For <b>light</b> activation, the <b>brackets</b> were divided according to the light source to be used (n- 15) : LED UltraLume 5 (L); Apollo 95 E plasma arc (AP) and Halogen light XL 2500 (H). After 24 h the samples were submitted to shear bond strength testing at crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. RESULTS: The data were submitted {{to the analysis of}} variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test (5 %). Bond Strength: UltraLume 5 (11. 4 ± 3. 56 MPa) was superior to XL 2500 (9. 12 ± 2. 83 MPa) and Plasma Arc (5. 11 ± 2. 93 MPa) (p< 0. 05). No difference was found between ceramic with silane (8. 31 ± 4. 17 MPa) and without silane (8. 68 ± 3. 86 MPa). Etching time of 2 minutes (9. 13 ± 3. 98 MPa) was superior to time of 1 minute (7. 86 ± 3. 96 MPa). CONCLUSION: The results showed that LED was shown to be more efficient for polymerizing the material for Transbond XT bonding. The use of silane did not influence the bond strength values.

40|$|Abstract: During bonding of {{orthodontic}} brackets to enamel, conventional adhesive systems use three different agents: an enamel conditioner, a primer solution, and an adhesive resin. A unique characteristic of some new bonding systems {{is that they}} need neither a priming agent nor a curing <b>light</b> to bond <b>brackets.</b> Such an approach should be more cost-effective for the clinician and indirectly also for the patient. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of using a cyanoacrylate adhesive on the shear bond strength of {{orthodontic brackets}} and on the bracket/adhesive failure mode. The brackets were bonded to extracted human teeth according to one of two protocols. Group 1 : Teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid. After applying the primer, the brackets were bonded with Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) and were light-cured for 20 seconds. Group 2 : Teeth were etched with 35 % phosphoric acid. The brackets were then bonded with Smartbond (Gestenco International, Göthenburg, Sweden). The present in vitro findings indicated that the use of the cyanoacrylate adhesive to bond orthodontic brackets to the enamel surface did not result in a significantly different (P 5. 24) shear bond force (mean 5 5. 8 6 2. 4 MPa) as compared to the control group (mean 5 5. 2 6 2. 9 MPa). The comparison of the Adhesive Remnant Index scores indicated that there was significantly (P 5. 006) less residual adhesive remaining on the tooth with the cyanoacrylate than on the tooth with the conventional adhesive system. In conclusion, the new adhesive has the potential to be used to bond orthodontic brackets while reducing the total bonding time. (Angle Orthod 2001; 71 : 466 – 469. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{composite}} sitting/sleeping car, VAM1, {{was built}} with 10 evenly-spaced windows per side, plus a closer window and a {{door at the}} No.2 end. Access to the car was via the doors at the No.2 end, or via coupled carriages and the diaphragms linking them to VAM1. The ten windows each represented a single compartment. The first and second compartments at the No.1 end were fitted with bench seats for four people each, while the other eight compartments were fitted with three-person seats divisible with retractable armrests. All seats could fold down to form a bed, and above that was a second bed, giving capacity for up to 20 sleeping passengers or up to 24 first-class and 8 second-class passengers. Generally speaking only the first four compartments at the No.1 end were used for sitting passengers, and the remaining six were used exclusively for sleeping passengers. Partially because of this, the public address system was only wired to the four compartments at the No.1 end, {{and not the other}} six. Each compartment also had its own cupboard, shower, toilet, card table and wardrobe. The interior was sheathed with laminex panels.At the No.2 end a small curtained-off area was reserved for the carriage conductor, with a seat to work at. Weight of the car was 51 tons 13 cwt. Water capacity was 280 gallons of cold water, plus 75 gallons of hot water for the showers. The car was fitted with marker <b>lights,</b> backup lamp <b>brackets</b> and tail discs at both ends, allowing it to trail any train.

Incognito lingual brackets (3 M Unitek), STb lingual <b>brackets</b> (<b>Light</b> Lingual System; ORMCO), In-Ovation L lingual brackets (DENTSPLY GAC), and conventional 0. 018 inch slot brackets (Gemini; 3 M Unitek) were bonded on identical maxillary acrylic resin models with levelled and aligned teeth. Each model was mounted on the orthodontic measurement and simulation system and 10 0. 0175 x 0. 0175 TMA wires were used for each bracket type. The wire was ligated with elastomerics into the Incognito, STb, and conventional brackets and each measurement was repeated once after religation. A 15 degrees buccal root torque (+ 15 degrees) and then a 15 degrees palatal root torque (- 15 degrees) were gradually applied to the right central incisor bracket. After each activation, the bracket returned to its initial position and the moments in the sagittal plane were recorded during these rotations of the bracket. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc multiple comparisons (Tukey test at 0. 05 error rate) was conducted to assess the effect on bracket type on the generated moments. The magnitude of maximum moment at + 15 degrees ranged 8. 8, 8. 2, 7. 1, and 5. 8 Nmm for the Incognito, STb, conventional Gemini, and the In-Ovation L brackets, respectively; similar values were recorded at - 15 degrees: 8. 6, 8. 1, 7. 0, and 5. 7 Nmm, respectively. The recorded differences of maximum moments were statistically significant, except between the Incognito and STb brackets. Additionally, the torque angles were evaluated at which the crown torque fell well below the minimum levels of 5. 0 Nmm, as well as the moment/torque ratio at the last part of the activation/deactivation curve, between 10 and 15 degrees.

40|$|Available {{commercial}} ceramic brackets {{are made}} of alumina either monocrystalline or polycrystalline. One major drawback of these brackets is fracture during archwire torsion or tipping. Another drawback is that each type comes in one shade only: transparent or translucent. Objectives: To fabricate orthodontic brackets from different esthetic materials and evaluate their mechanical properties; to introduce extremely low profile miniature zirconia brackets and evaluate their torsional fracture strength; also, to fabricate brackets in shades comparable to natural tooth shades, and compare them to commercial ceramic <b>brackets</b> under different <b>lights.</b> Materials and Methods: CAD/CAM technology was used to mill brackets from: ParadigmTM MZ 100 and LavaTM Ultimate resin composite; Mark II feldspathic porcelain; and In-Ceram® YZ zirconia. The brackets were subjected to two separate tests (torque and tipping). The average moments necessary to fracture the brackets were determined and compared to those of commercial alumina brackets, Mystique® MB and Resolve®. Also, miniature zirconia brackets were fabricated and subjected to torsion till failure. Static fatigue test was performed on standard YZ, MZ 100, and Mystique brackets. Brackets were fabricated using CAD/CAM in shade A 3 materials: MZ 100; Lava Ultimate; and Mark II. Zirconia and alumina brackets were also fabricated and colored. Adobe Photoshop software {{was used to determine}} ΔE values between the brackets and A 3 acrylic teeth from digital images taken under three different lights (daylight, fluorescent, and incandescent). The shaded brackets were compared to commercial alumina brackets: Inspire ICETM; Radiance PlusTM; Avex® CX; and Mystique® MB. Results: Standard zirconia brackets had the highest torsional and tipping strength among the tested esthetic brackets. Miniature zirconia brackets showed comparable or even statistically significantly higher resistance to archwire torsion than commercial alumina brackets. Standard zirconia brackets showed the highest survival rate of 83 %. Under daylight, Radiance Plus and Lava Ultimate brackets had the smallest mean ΔE values. Lava Ultimate brackets had the smallest mean ΔE under fluorescent and incandescent <b>light.</b> Conclusions: Esthetic <b>brackets</b> can be fabricated in extremely low profile and smaller dimensions from zirconia with fracture strength comparable to the bulkier commercial alumina brackets. Also, brackets can be produced in natural tooth shades enhancing their esthetic appearance. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
