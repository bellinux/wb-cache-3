5|$|Though Rowan Atkinson is not typecast to {{characters}} <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bean, he {{has played}} similar characters in other works, such as Enrico in the 2001 film Rat Race.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs, Pearl {{has also}} been {{considered}} a stereotyped character; Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown wrote in their 2007 book Packaging Girlhood that Pearl exhibits the traits of an archetypal girly girl. A study by the federal office of gender equality in Mexico, , found that Pearl's roles sometimes rely on characteristics associated with stereotypes of women, such as vanity and materialism.|$|E
5|$|When {{the science}} {{projects}} are due, Terrance presents a monkey with five pairs of buttocks, but Kyle has nothing until the pig {{gives birth to}} a pot-bellied pig that looks <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Garrison, implying the pig was impregnated by Mr. Garrison before the elephant. Garrison quickly awards it first prize over Terrance's monkey.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Mallards molt, {{and would}} not be able to fly until their new wings grew again, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what the rest of it is <b>like.</b> <b>Mr.</b> and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as {{bicycles}} and other wheeled objects.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{compared}} Philosopher's Stone to {{the stories}} of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Dahl's stories; for example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost his parents and {{had to live with}} a pair of unpleasant auntsone fat and one thin rather <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} '80s, when Marcos eased {{restrictions}} on publications, Belmonte started a small monthly magazine called The Star, a predecessor of The Philippine STAR. It {{was one of}} several opposition magazines and tabloids, <b>like</b> <b>Mr</b> & Ms Special Edition, Panorama, We Forum, and Tempo, that were critical of the Marcos administration, dubbed the mosquito press.|$|E
25|$|Broadway {{once had}} many {{homegrown}} stars who committed to {{working on a}} show for a year, as Nathan Lane has for The Addams Family. In 2010, some theater heavyweights <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lane were not even nominated; instead, several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short-timers on Broadway, given that many of their film-star performers had {{to move on to}} other commitments.|$|E

25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out <b>like</b> <b>Mr</b> Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Altering the murderer's motives. In the novel, Lady Westholme murdered Mrs Boynton to {{keep her}} past secret. Before {{climbing}} the social ladder, she was incarcerated in the same prison where Mrs Boynton had been a warden. Knowing Mrs Boynton's sadistic personality, she silenced her {{to keep her}} reputation and her social status. In the adaptation, Dame Celia Westholme served as a maid {{in the home of}} Lady Boynton (who was then Mrs Pierce) before becoming a writer. She had an affair with Dr Gerard, delivered a child, and was sent away to a nunnery in Ireland while Lady Boynton kept the baby. That child turned out to be Jinny. When Dame Celia and Dr Gerard found out that Lady Boynton had abused all of the children that were in her care (including Jinny) even for a short while (<b>like</b> <b>Mr</b> Cope), they decided to kill her for revenge.|$|E
25|$|The {{setting for}} popular novel and play Goodbye, Mr. Chips is {{believed}} to have been based on The Leys where author James Hilton was a pupil (1915–1918). Hilton is reported to have said that the inspiration for the protagonist, Chips, came chiefly from W.H. Balgarnie, one of the masters at The Leys (1900–30) who was in charge of the Leys Fortnightly (where Hilton's first short stories and essays were published). Over the years old boys have written to Geoffery Houghton, a master of The Leys for a number of years and a historian of the school, confirming the links between Chips and Balgarnie. As with Mr. Chips, Balgarnie died at the school, at the age of 82, having been linked with the school for 51 years and living his last years in modest lodgings opposite the school. Again, <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Chips, Balgarnie was a strict disciplinarian, but would also invite boys to visit him for tea and biscuits.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Bachchan {{starred in}} Suhaag {{which was the}} highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed {{critical}} acclaim and commercial success with films <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Natwarlal, Kaala Patthar, The Great Gambler and Manzil. Amitabh was required to use his singing voice {{for the first time}} in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in which he starred with Rekha. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. He also received Best Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film Dostana, in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman. Dostana proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980. In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film Silsila, where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and also Rekha. Other films of this period like Shaan (1980) and Shakti (1982) which pitted him against the veteran actor Dilip Kumar were not successful at the box office but Ram Balram (1980), Naseeb (1981) and Lawaaris (1981) were successful.|$|E

500|$|The Red Dwarf Magazine – the {{magazine}} {{part of the}} title changed to [...] "Smegazine" [...] from issue 3 – was launched in 1992 by Fleetway Editions. It comprised a mix of news, reviews, interviews, comic strips, and competitions. The comic strips featured episode adaptations and original material, including further stories of popular characters <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Flibble, the Polymorph, and Ace Rimmer.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} Steve Jackson Games editions of Ogre (after the {{designer}} had {{moved away from}} Metagaming), Tony Watson called Ogre [...] "a legend {{in the ranks of}} SF gamedom, and deservedly so... as well as being {{a lot of fun to}} play, it's an interesting extrapolation on high-tech armoured warfare". It was noted that the rules had remained essentially the same in the new edition, and the most significant changes being to the physical design—with larger (still black and white) counters, and full colour maps by Denis Loubet. [...] Watson also welcomed the retention of the original artwork alongside new pieces—"no one draws a GEV or Ogre <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Chung".|$|E
500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack to think he is a marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints to make him look <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E
500|$|For the game's writing, Fox {{was partly}} {{influenced}} by the silliness of internet culture, as well as comedy shows <b>like</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bean (1990–1995). He was also inspired by the unsettling atmosphere of EarthBound (1994). Fox's desire to [...] "subvert concepts that go unquestioned in many games" [...] further influenced Undertale development. Fox found that the writing became easier after establishing a character's voice and mood. He also felt that creating {{the world was a}} natural process, as it expressed the stories of those within it. Fox felt the importance to make the game's monsters [...] "feel like an individual". He cited the Final Fantasy series (1987–present) as the opposite; [...] "all monsters in RPGs like Final Fantasy are the same ... there's no meaning to that".|$|E
