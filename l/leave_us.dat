A closer approximation to the Book of Mormon picture of Nephite culture is seen in the earth and palisade structures of the Hopewell and Adena culture areas than in the later stately piles of stone in Mesoamerica.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of the post-World War II downsizing of the U.S. Navy {{and the decline of}} the seaplane and motor torpedo boat in U.S. naval operations meant that all but the newest ships decommissioned in 1946 and 1947. Those that did stay on in service as seaplane tenders decommissioned between the mid-1950s and 1960s, some seeing service in the Korean War (19501953). The last unit did not <b>leave</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy service until 1973.|$|E

25|$|The Naga Memorandum {{submitted}} by the Naga Club (which later became the Naga National Council) to the Simon Commission explicitly stated, 'to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> alone to determine ourselves as in ancient times.' In February 1946, the Naga Club officially took shape into a unified Naga National Council in Wokha. In June 1946, the Naga National Council submitted a four-point memorandum to officials discussing the independence of India from British colonial rule. The memorandum strongly protested against the grouping of Assam with Bengal and asserted that Naga Hills should be constitutionally included in an autonomous Assam, in a free India, with local autonomy, due safeguards and separate electorate for the Naga tribes.|$|E

Pharrell remarked upon the organic sound of the album, surmising that it [...] "feels like the only click track they had was [...] the human heartbeat". He felt that the record can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the accessible nature of music, and concluded that Daft Punk [...] "could just get back on the spaceship that brought them here and go, and <b>leave</b> <b>us.</b> But they're gracious, they're nice robots.

500|$|He {{went on to}} laud the {{interaction}} between Veronica and Keith and the latter's eventual sacrifice for his daughter. In addition, {{he felt that the}} supporting characters, including Wallace, Parker, and Piz, also received appropriate sendoffs. He later ranked the episode as his fifth-favorite of the series. Kelly West of Cinema Blend gave a mixed review. She enjoyed the elements that resembled the first season, such as the return of Jake Kane and the portrait of Lilly. She thought that [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] was satisfying {{within the context of the}} season, but that it was too ambiguous for a series finale: [...] "How can the show not come back?

[...] When reviewing the final scene, Marsi commended the appearance of the positive pregnancy test to the audience, calling the it [...] "Quite the cliffhanger to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining. The show went out on a high note and next season could be even better."

500|$|On 10 October, Frederick {{marched on}} Hochkirch and {{established}} his own camp, {{extending from the}} town north, [...] {{to the edge of}} the forest at the base of the Kuppritzerberg. Frederick did not plan to stay in the small village for an extended period, only until provisions—mostly bread—arrived from Bautzen, and then they would move eastward. To the east of the village, less than [...] distant, the Austrians' presence on the hilltop increasingly made the Prussians—except Frederick—anxious about an attack. Frederick ignored the warnings of his officers, especially his trusted Field Marshal James Keith, who thought staying in the village was suicide. [...] "If the Austrians <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> unmolested in this camp," [...] Keith told the king, [...] "they deserve to be hanged." [...] Frederick reportedly replied, [...] "it is to be hoped they are more afraid of us than of the gallows." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Adams of IGN {{rated the}} game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its {{improved}} visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: [...] "Any {{way you look}} at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special ... a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> wanting more." [...] Bit-tech.net awarded the game a 10 out of 10 score, citing approval of how the story turns and the introduction of side stories and new characters. 1UP.com praised the game, noting that the game's [...] "entire five-hour experience" [...] was [...] "vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed." [...] PC Gamer UK also applauded Episode Two, noting it [...] "is the most sumptuous chapter of the Half-Life saga, and by a country mile." [...] The New York Times enjoyed the gameplay, saying, [...] "The battles in Episode 2 of Half-Life 2 often require as much ingenuity as they do fast reflexes." ...|$|E
500|$|Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} film four stars out of five, saying [...] "Perhaps the biggest {{compliment}} you could pay the film, {{apart from that}} it’s by and large hysterically funny, {{is that it is}} unmistakably film-like, with a smoothly arcing plot and gross-out moments staged with the verve and ceremony of an action-movie set-piece." [...] In The Guardian, Mike McCahill gave the film three stars. He found fault in its treatment of female characters, saying [...] "Some of the abundant thought channelled into knob gags could have been diverted towards developing the boys' female counterparts beyond harpies and lust objects". Unlike Collin, he found The Inbetweeners 2 to resemble a television show more than a film: [...] "as with the first film, number 2 never quite shakes its resemblance to primetime E4, complete with ad-ready fadeouts and Walkabout interiors...couldn't the vehicles transporting them to the wider world display slightly more ambition?". Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, summing it up as [...] "The Fannytastic Four <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> on a poo-flecked, piss-soaked, sun-burned high that more than overcomes its familiar flaws to become a real contender for the year’s funniest film. Four star wankers".|$|E

500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should <b>leave</b> <b>us.</b> I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} {{failure of}} Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, {{which made the}} studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giants production considerably. [...] "Three-quarters" [...] of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff {{that there would be}} a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented [...] "They did <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good." [...] Bird regarded the trade-off as having [...] "one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule," [...] but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as [...] "fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can." [...] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; [...] "we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees," [...] said production designer Mark Whiting.|$|E
500|$|Limbo {{initial release}} on the Xbox 360 has {{received}} acclaim from video game critics and journalists; the subsequent {{release of the}} game for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows platforms received similar praise, holding Metacritic aggregate scores of 90/100 and 88/100, respectively, compared to the 90/100 earned by the Xbox 360 version. Some journalists compared Limbo to previous minimalist platform games such as Another World, Flashback, Heart of Darkness, , Ico, Portal and Braid. Reviews consistently noted Limbo short length for its higher selling price: two to five hours of gameplay for 15 euros or 15 U.S. dollars. Reviewers asserted this length-to-price ratio was the largest drawback for the game, and would be a deterrent for potential buyers. Some journalists contended that {{the length of the}} game was ideal; The Daily Telegraph Tom Hoggins considered the short game to have a [...] "perfectly formed running time", while Daemon Hatfield of IGN commented that [...] "it's better for a game to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> wanting more than to overstay its welcome". Numerous independent game developers, in an organised [...] "Size Doesn't Matter" [...] effort, commented on the critical response to Limbo length-to-price ratio. The independent developers questioned the need to quantify that ratio, and noted that it only seems {{to be used as a}} factor in judging video games and not other forms of entertainment such as films.|$|E
