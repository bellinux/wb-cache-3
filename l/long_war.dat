5|$|By January 2017, <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> Studios {{announced}} they {{have changed their}} name to Pavonis Interactive, and among other projects, are working with Firaxis to bring a new mod, <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> 2, {{in the same vein}} as the original <b>Long</b> <b>War,</b> to XCOM 2. The <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> 2 mod was released on January 19, 2017.|$|E
5|$|<b>Long</b> <b>War</b> has {{received}} praise from both video game journalists {{and from the}} developers at Firaxis. It has been downloaded over 840,000 times, by over 500,000 different users. Firaxis took the popularity of <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> to add built-in support for modding into the sequel XCOM 2, and used <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> Studios to provide initial add-ons for the game at release. On 19 January 2017, <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> Studios, now known as Pavonis Interactive, released <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> 2 for XCOM 2.|$|E

5|$|According to Amineri, {{one of the}} mod's core developers, initial {{versions}} of <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> used changes to the game's configuration file to change content in the game. After other mod makers that {{were not part of}} the <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> project discovered how to make changes to the game by directly working with its Unreal Engine, more significant game alterations became possible, and the forums of NexusMods became a hub where such changes were exchanged. Many of the mod's key features, including the increased number of soldiers and the lengthened campaign, first appeared in version beta 1.9, which was released in mid 2013. Shortly after Enemy Within released, Amineri and XMarksTheSpot completed development of a Java-based tool called upkmodder that allowed the team to more effectively manage and implement the changes made by the mod. In the late stages of the mod's development, the team worked directly with the Unreal Development Kit.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a <b>long</b> <b>war</b> with Britain and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E
5|$|<b>Long</b> <b>War</b> is {{a partial}} {{conversion}} mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It was first uploaded to NexusMods on 4 January 2013, and exited beta {{with the release}} of version 1.0 on 28 December 2015. The developers announced in July 2015 with beta 15f2 that they had finished adding new features, and that any future releases would only correct bugs or balance issues. At the time that it exited beta, the mod's development was led by four core members, JohnnyLump (John J. Lumpkin), Amineri (Rachel Norman), XMarksTheSpot, and Ellatan (Alex Rozenfeld). They were joined by four senior contributors, 20 voice actors, and 29 contributors assisting with programming, art, sound engineering, translations, research, and porting the mod to Mac and Linux. Three members of Firaxis Games also provided assistance. The team released separate versions for Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within until the end of 2013, and thereafter only released versions for Enemy Within. <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> has been downloaded from NexusMods over 900,000 times by over 333,000 separate users.|$|E

5|$|About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in Numantia, {{which is}} known as the First Numantine War, and a <b>long</b> <b>war</b> of {{resistance}} was fought between the advancing forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrived in 151 BC and began the process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the <b>Long</b> <b>War.</b> Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the <b>Long</b> <b>War,</b> which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E
5|$|Ernst's rule, {{and that}} of his four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} the position of his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would be brought to the Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already <b>long</b> <b>war</b> of secession well into the next century.|$|E
5|$|Set in 2525, {{twenty-seven years}} before the events of , the novel {{tells the story of}} the United Nations Space Command's first {{encounter}} with the alien collective known as the Covenant on the colony world of Harvest, and the beginning of the <b>long</b> <b>war</b> that follows. The novel is an ensemble piece, with the action being narrated from both human and Covenant viewpoints. The protagonist is a young Marine, Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson, who also appears in the Halo video games. Upon release, the book was generally well received and became The New York Times bestseller in its first week. Critics pointed to the novel's success as a sign of the increasing importance of story in video games.|$|E

5|$|The United Kingdom and France {{declared}} war on Germany in 1939, following the German invasion of Poland, but no major land operations occurred in Western Europe during the period known as the Phoney War {{in the winter of}} 1939–1940. During this time, the British and French built up their forces in expectation of a <b>long</b> <b>war,</b> and the Germans completed their conquest of Poland. On 9 October, Adolf Hitler ordered plans to be made for an invasion of the Low Countries, to use them as a base against Great Britain and to pre-empt a similar attack by the Allied forces, which could threaten the vital Ruhr Area.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} attested king in {{the letter}} of Enna-Dagan is Ansud, who is mentioned as attacking Ebla, the traditional rival of Mari with whom it had a <b>long</b> <b>war,</b> and conquering many of Ebla's cities, including the land of Belan. The next king mentioned {{in the letter}} is Saʿumu, who conquered the lands of Ra'ak and Nirum, but king Kun-Damu of Ebla defeated Mari {{in the middle of}} the 25th century BC. The war continued with Išhtup-Išar of Mari conquest of Emar, at a time of Eblaite weakness in the mid-24th century BC. King Igrish-Halam of Ebla had to pay tribute to Iblul-Il of Mari, who is mentioned in the letter conquering many of Ebla's cities and campaigning in the Burman region.|$|E
5|$|The mod was {{developed}} by <b>Long</b> <b>War</b> Studios, a team that came to include four core members, with assistance from 29 contributors, 20 voice actors, and three members of Firaxis Games, the developer of Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. According {{to one of the}} mod's core developers, Amineri, the mod started as a series of changes to the base game's configuration file, and grew more expansive as the team's capabilities grew. By the end of the mod's development, the team was working directly with the Unreal Development Kit, and had created a Java-based tool to help manage the changes that the mod was making.|$|E

50|$|Vietnam was the <b>longest</b> <b>war</b> for Marines; by its end, 13,091 {{had been}} killed in action, 51,392 had been wounded, and 57 Medals of Honor had been awarded. Due to {{policies}} concerning rotation, more Marines were deployed for service during Vietnam than World War II.|$|R
5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} {{the morale of}} the Albanians. There were few, if not any, officers and soldiers who deserted afterwards. The battle of Albulena has been seen as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory over the Ottomans. However, it also marked the high point of the Albanian resistance, beginning a new phase in Skanderbeg's quarter-century <b>long</b> <b>war</b> which would include its fiercest Ottoman invasions. Even though Skanderbeg himself had died in January 1468, the war would drag on until 1478 and later in the same year the main Albanian fortress at Krujë fell, finally effecting the annexation of Skanderbeg's Albania by the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Two ambassadors {{were sent}} by Emperor Maximilian: Croatian Antun Vrančić and Styrian Christoph Teuffenbach. They arrived in Istanbul on 26 August 1567 and were well {{received}} by Sultan Selim II. An agreement {{ending the war}} between the Austrian and Ottoman empires was reached on 17 February 1568, after five months of negotiations with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (also known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović, being originally from Bosnia). The Treaty of Adrianople was signed on 21 February 1568. Sultan Selim II agreed to an eight-year truce, although the agreement brought 25 years of (relative) peace between the Empires until the <b>Long</b> <b>War.</b> The truce was conditional and Maximilian agreed to pay an annual tribute of 30,000 ducats.|$|E
5|$|Mari {{was first}} {{abandoned}} {{in the middle of}} the 26th century BC but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East-Semitic state before 2500 BC. This second Mari engaged in a <b>long</b> <b>war</b> with its rival Ebla, and is known for its strong affinity with the Sumerian culture. It was destroyed in the 23rd century BC by the Akkadians who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing the title of Shakkanakku ("military governor"). The governors later became independent with the rapid disintegration of the Akkadian empire and rebuilt the city as a regional center in the middle Euphrates valley. The Shakkanakkus ruled Mari until the second half of the 19th century BC when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons. A short time after the Shakkanakku collapse, Mari became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty. The Amorite Mari was short lived as it was annexed by Babylonia in c. 1761 BC, but the city survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period.|$|E
