40|$|Background/Aims: Drinking water {{chlorination}} treatments produce different Disinfection By Products (DBPs) {{as a consequence}} of the reaction between chlorine in water and natural organic matter. This study is part of the international project HiWATE (Health Impacts of Long-Term Exposure to Disinfection By-Products in Drinking Water) funded by the EU Sixth Framework Programme (FP 6). The aim was to investigate the presence of DBPs in drinking water in different northern regions in Italy, where groundwater with low organic matter is generally supplied and where the use of chlorine dioxide as chlorination treatment is widespread. Methods: Bromate, chlorite, chlorate, haloacetic acids (HAAs) and 3 -chloro- 4 -(dichloromethyl) - 5 -hydroxy- 2 (5 H) -furanone (MX) and trihalomethanes (THMs) levels were investigated in drinking water samples collected form 12 waterworks located in Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia and <b>Lombardia</b> <b>Regions.</b> To investigate seasonal variability, water samples were collected over four seasons from 2007 to 2008. Results: MX and HAAs were never detected (detection limit: 0. 5 ng/l and 1 μg/l, respectively). THMs were always found at very low concentrations regardless of the disinfection treatment (mean: 2. 04 μg/l, maximum value: 26. 9 μg/l). Bromate was detected only in 1 waterworks in which disinfection was performed by ozone and chloride dioxide (range 2 - 14 μg/l). Chlorite was found only in chlorine dioxide disinfected drinking water (4 waterworks; mean value: 136 μg/l; range: 28 - 523 μg/l), while chlorate resulted the most widespread DBP (> 85 % of the samples), with concentrations ranging from 1 μg/l to 399 μg/l. No consistent general trends were observed, in terms of DBPs seasonal variations, in the investigated Italian drinking waters. Conclusion: DBPs levels in Italian drinking water appear generally low, however individual DBPs and levels vary according to the different disinfection treatments: when chlorine dioxide is applied as disinfection method high values of chlorite and chlorate could have been detected. Due to their potential health effects, the presence of chlorite and chlorate in drinking water deserve further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Chlorate is a {{disinfection}} by-product (DBP) {{originating from}} chlorine dioxide water disinfection, {{which can be}} a contaminant of sodium hypochlorite solutions as well. Due to its not yet well investigated genotoxic and carcinogenic potential effects, it is considered, together with other DBPs, an emerging DBP for which further research on occurrence levels and toxicological properties is a prior need. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate in some Italian regions the potential exposure to chlorate via drinking water of the general population and of a specific population (swimmers). Methods: Chlorate levels were investigated in drinking water samples collected form 12 waterworks located in Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia and <b>Lombardia</b> <b>Regions.</b> To investigate spatial and seasonal variability, different water samples (n. 194) were collected at different points along the distribution system and over four seasons. In the same period 20 swimming pools in the Emilia-Romagna Region were investigated for the occurrence of chlorate in water pools. Chlorate analysis was performed by ion chromatography (detection limit: 1 μg/l). Results: Chlorate occurred in 97 % of the drinking water samples, (median: 18, range: 2 - 399 μg/l) and resulted always below theprovisional WHO guidelines (700 μg/l). Nevertheless, significant differences in levels were observed according to disinfectionmethods, and the highest levels occurred in water disinfected both with chlorine dioxide and ozone (median: 163, range: 83 - 399 μg/l). No clear spatial or seasonal trends were observed. Swimming pool waters showed much more higher chlorate levels (median: 4347, range: 5 - 19537 μg/l) and significant differences according to disinfectant applied were also observed. Conclusions: In the Italian investigated regions, chlorate appears to be widespread both in drinking and swimming pool waters; in the latter particularly high levels were observed in different settings. Swimmers are therefore a potentially highly exposed population subgroup: to evaluate health implications of this specific exposure pathway, however, further investigation is needed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Air {{pollution}} {{started to}} become a problem for human beings with the industrial revolution, but nowadays, {{with the introduction of}} laws against emissions (e. g., the EuroX normative), the situa- tion is getting better. Moreover, governments must constantly monitor pollution levels to check policies effects. This article describes a method to verify traffic ban effect claims on air pollution using monitored data. In <b>Lombardia</b> (our <b>region),</b> ARPA (the local EPA) maintains pollution monitoring stations from down- town Milano to remote places near the mountains since 1999. Measured data are “somewhat ” available through ARPA’s website. “Somewhat” because a CAPTCHA protected download request form must be filled up for every combination of (station, pollutant, time-frame < 1 yr). In 2003 the Lombardia government introduced a vehicle ban to reduce air pollution. Then, more recently (in 2008 and 2012) the Milano City Council introduced a stricter ban. The author implemented an automated (in place since 2004) data collecting “web gatherer ” to overcome ARPA’s overcomplicated download procedure and, above all, to verify air pollution reduction claims.

40|$|Connected {{government}} {{implies that}} citizens and enterprises can interact with government {{as with a}} single entity rather than {{with a number of}} different public authorities. In countries characterized by a highly fragmented system of Local Government, connected government at the local level can be achieved only through a process of progressive integration on a wider area of systems of local government already integrated at the local level. In the chapter, the author argues that this process should be based on a maturity model and a reference model that define the technological and organizational conditions that allow the establishment of more and more integrated aggregations of municipalities. With reference to a study funded by the <b>Region</b> <b>Lombardia</b> (Italy), the chapter introduces the concept of Integrated System of Local Government (ISLG) and describes the process that leads to the establishment of ISLGs as an intermediate step toward connected government at the local level. Moreover, the chapter discusses the conditions that can induce different aggregations of municipalities to comply with a set of standard requirements in the implementation of their integration processes...|$|R
40|$|The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Halyomorpha halys (Heteroptera, Pentatomidae) was {{detected}} {{for the first}} time in Italy in September 2012 in the province of Modena (Northern Italy) during an insect collection for educational purposes.

40|$|Local GNSS {{permanent}} networks materialize {{the global}} reference frame through their estimation {{and distribution of}} coordinates and velocities. These estimates are provided by the classical network adjustment process, including several nearby reference IGS/EPN permanent stations as fiducial constraints. GNSS data modelling is still a topic of research and the final results can be very sensitive to the processing choices: during the last years, IERS conventions as well as IGS and EPN guidelines have been periodically updated in order to reflect {{the state of the}} art. This work aims at evaluating the sensitivity of the adjustment results with respect to the processing choices. To perform the tests, two local permanent networks, characterized by different geometries and geographic locations are used; the first network is in <b>Lombardia,</b> a <b>region</b> in the northern, pre-alpine Italy; the second is in Puglia, in the southern, Mediterranean, Italy: respectively, 12 and 6 months of data are analysed. Different processing choices are applied and the relevant results are compared: firstly, different constraining weights for the fiducial stations are tested, secondly, the estimation of ZTD’s alone is compared with the estimation including horizontal gradients, and finally the ocean loading effects are analyzed. In the adjustment of a local network, the normal practice is the inclusion and constraining of some IGS stations; we have studied the adoption of a national zero order network as a link between the global and the local networks: the new zero order network of Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM, the Italian Cartographic Institute) is used for an experimental test: in this case, only one month of data is available and is analysed.
