5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a <b>lignotuber</b> or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a <b>lignotuber,</b> B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the <b>lignotuber</b> of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a <b>lignotuber</b> is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a <b>lignotuber</b> makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a <b>lignotuber.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plants {{possessing}} <b>lignotubers</b> include Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah), Eucalyptus brevifolia (Snappy Gum) and Eucalyptus ficifolia (Scarlet Gum) all {{of which}} can have <b>lignotubers</b> ten feet (3 meters) wide and three feet (one meter) deep as well as most mallees, and many Banksia species. <b>Lignotubers</b> develop from the cotyledonary bud in seedlings of several oak species including cork oak Quercus suber, but do not develop in several other oak species, and are not apparent in mature cork oak trees.|$|R
50|$|Greenleaf manzanitas in some areas, but not all, produce <b>lignotubers,</b> {{from which}} they can {{reproduce}} vegetatively.|$|R

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a <b>lignotuber</b> or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a <b>lignotuber,</b> so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} <b>lignotuber,</b> which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the <b>lignotuber,</b> which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa is {{cultivated}} for its attractive needle-like {{leaves and}} rusty-brown flower spikes, {{both of which}} can be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or loamy acidic soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its <b>lignotuber.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Small woody corm-like {{structures}} {{have also}} been found. Initially identified as [...] "seedlings", are now known to be <b>lignotubers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a <b>lignotuber</b> or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a <b>lignotuber</b> to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a <b>lignotuber,</b> and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a <b>lignotuber,</b> after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E
50|$|Shrubland species {{generally}} show a {{wide range}} of adaptations to fire, such as heavy seed production, <b>lignotubers,</b> and fire-induced germination.|$|R
50|$|Growth {{rates of}} all plants in dry sclerophyll forests are slow and as {{water is the}} {{limiting}} factor in these environments, energy for growth is often directed to the roots and <b>lignotubers.</b>|$|R
50|$|As well as seed regeneration, eucalypts utilise {{vegetative}} regeneration {{to recover}} from fire depending on its intensity. Eucalypts can do this by basal sprouting from <b>lignotubers</b> or from the stem, sprouting from epicormic buds.|$|R
5|$|Banksia canei lacks a <b>lignotuber</b> {{and appears}} to {{regenerate}} from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about five years is often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Banksia dentata {{is one of}} four Banksia species {{collected}} by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. Genetic studies show it is a basal member (early offshoot) within the group. Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a <b>lignotuber.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody <b>lignotuber,</b> or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
50|$|E. pauciflora regenerates from seed, by epicormic shoots {{below the}} bark, and from <b>lignotubers.</b> It {{is the most}} cold-tolerant species of eucalyptus, with E. pauciflora subsp. niphophila {{surviving}} temperatures down to -23 C and year-round frosts. It has been introduced to Norway.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change will}} {{increase}} the frequency {{and the intensity of}} droughts in the Mediterranean region, likely reducing growth and increasing mortality of holm oaks (Quercus ilex), one of the most abundant species of Mediterranean forests. In water-limited systems such as those of the Mediterranean, carbon allocation patterns strongly favour belowground accumulation, especially in large subterranean structures called <b>lignotubers.</b> The resilience of these forests depends largely on the replenishment rate of these carbon reserves after disturbances. An experimental thinning, with two intensities (removal of 40 % and 80 % of basal area), was performed in 1992 in a holm oak forest at the Prades Experimental Complex of Catchments (NE Spain). In 2002, a second thinning was carried out in subplots within the former experimental 0. 5 ha plots. Samples from the <b>lignotubers</b> of holm oak trees were analyzed for starch, and both mobile and immobile chemical components, in order to assess the resilience of holm oaks to repeated disturbances. Our results show that after 10 years, starch stocks in the <b>lignotubers</b> have only recovered to half their former values. Removing 40 % of the basal area instead of 80 % is suggested to be the better managing option for this kind of forests. 6 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|These plants take various forms, from dwarf shrubs barely 10 {{centimetres}} tall {{to small}} trees exceeding 5 metres in height. Some have <b>lignotubers</b> and some produce basal shoots. They are hairless and often glandular, sometimes with protruding oil glands on various parts. New stems are four-angled and sometimes winged.|$|R
5|$|Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} paludosa is a slow-growing shrub which regenerates from bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} <b>lignotuber.</b> After fire, plants take around {{three years to}} flower significantly, but are flowering well by five years afterwards. Flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire. Plants are estimated to live to around 60 years of age. Seedlings also appear from seed dispersed after bushfire. All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to the}} nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus).|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a <b>lignotuber</b> or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a <b>lignotuber</b> or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, and because it is only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.epica has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a <b>lignotuber,</b> so {{is thought to be}} killed by fire. Like most Banksia species, however, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{a variety of}} {{strategies}} to survive (or even require) bushfires, (possessing epicormic shoots or <b>lignotubers</b> that sprout after a fire, or developing fire-resistant or fire-triggered seeds) or even encourage fire (eucalypts contain flammable oils in the leaves) {{as a way to}} eliminate competition from less fire-tolerant species.|$|R
500|$|This clade {{became the}} basis for the new {{subseries}} Sphaerocarpae, which Thiele defined as containing those species with <b>lignotubers,</b> styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in B.micrantha), and [...] "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". The species other than B.grossa also have shouldered follicles.|$|R
2500|$|Eucalyptus oil {{is highly}} {{flammable}} (ignited trees {{have been known}} to explode); bushfires can travel easily through the oil-rich air of the tree crowns. [...] Eucalypts obtain long-term fire survivability from their ability to regenerate from epicormic buds [...] situated deep within their thick bark, or from <b>lignotubers,</b> or by producing serotinous fruits.|$|R
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a <b>lignotuber,</b> {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds {{around the base of}} the <b>lignotuber.</b> Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} {{position and}} striking colour {{of the flowers}} of T.truncata {{and many of its}} relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae in both Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. The flower heads produce abundant nectar, which is fed upon by many bird species. The Tasmanian waratah has a swollen woody base largely under the soil known as a <b>lignotuber,</b> which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a bushfire.|$|E
25|$|The term marlock {{has been}} {{variously}} used; in Forest Trees of Australia, it {{is defined as}} a small tree without <b>lignotubers,</b> but with a shorter, lower-branching trunk than a mallet. They usually grow in more or less pure stands. Clearly recognisable examples are stands of E. platypus, E. vesiculosa, and the unrelated E. stoatei.|$|R
5000|$|This clade {{became the}} basis for the new {{subseries}} Sphaerocarpae, which Thiele defined as containing those species with <b>lignotubers,</b> styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in B. micrantha), and [...] "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". The species other than B. grossa also have shouldered follicles.|$|R
50|$|The flower buds {{arise from}} the leaf axils in groups of three and are glacous with a pointed operculum. The woody {{capsules}} have sunken valves and are approximately 10 mm long. Eucalyptus morrisbyi flowers between February and May and its medium of pollination are birds and insects. Recruitment occurs through canopy stored seed or vegetative reproduction from <b>lignotubers.</b>|$|R
