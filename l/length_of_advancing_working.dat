30|$|The {{survey was}} {{designed}} to follow the ageing German baby boom generation and monitor their working conditions, attitudes towards work and individual health trajectories {{from the time they}} reach <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age until retirement. Compared with older cohorts, the baby boom cohorts not only are the most numerous but also have higher levels of education. However, their employment trajectories started later in their life span and are more heterogeneous, and the baby boomers experience more employment interruptions than the preceding cohorts (Tisch and Tophoven 2012). At the first interview, the respondents were at the threshold <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age (i.e., 52 and 46 years old, respectively). Recent studies indicate that in Germany, deterioration of health, particularly due to chronic diseases and musculoskeletal limitations, begins after age 45 (Robert Koch-Institut 2012) and that both job changes and the ability to find employment decrease after age 50 (Dietz and Walwei 2011). Moreover, the likelihood of disability retirement increases rapidly after age 50 for men and age 46 for women (Hagen et al. 2010). At the same time, it can be assumed that the lidA birth cohorts were unable to make sufficient provisions for their retirement {{by the time of the}} interview. Hence, employment withdrawal is not likely driven by pull-factors of early retirement.|$|R

Healthy adult (two-to-four-year-old) mongrels, comprising six dogs and two bitches, were divided into four equal groups in order to obtain multi-aged wounds {{at the end of the}} study. Four 2 cm × 2 cm full-thickness skin wounds were created on both sides of the back area of each dog under general anaesthesia adhering to aseptic technique. Contaminated wounds were then divided into two treatment groups: Group 1, Sidr honey treated (right side wounds) and group 2, povidone-iodine treated (left side wounds). All wounds were evaluated grossly daily at the time of treatment application and digitally photographed once every week. Images were analysed using ImageJ software.

The analysis results indicates that ground pressure at material roadway increased sharply when the <b>working</b> face <b>advanced</b> to place 40 ∼ 50 m away from it, and as the <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> face, the deformation of the two-sides is clearly bigger than that at the roof and floor in material roadway; Therefore, support in material roadway should be strengthened to ensure the safe mining of working face. We use the ZDYJ-IIA type computer-round figure apparatus to observe the ground pressure of the fully-mechanized face, which can help us analyze {{the relation of the}} fully-mechanized mining technique with ground pressure as the <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> face, as well as obtain the ground pressure behavior law of fully-mechanized face and calculate pace <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the periodical roof pressure.

40|$|Sensing and {{manipulating}} targets {{hidden under}} scattering media are universal problems {{that take place}} in applications ranging from deep-tissue optical imaging to laser surgery. A major issue in these applications is the shallow light penetration caused by multiple scattering that reflects most of incident light. Although advances have been made to eliminate image distortion by a scattering medium, dealing with the light reflection has remained unchallenged. Here we present a method to minimize reflected intensity by finding and coupling light into the anti-reflection modes of a scattering medium. In doing so, we achieved more than a factor of 3 increase in light penetration. Our method of controlling reflected waves makes it readily applicable to in vivo applications in which detector sensors can only be positioned at the same side of illumination and will therefore lay the foundation <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> the <b>working</b> depth <b>of</b> many existing optical imaging and treatment technologies...|$|R

Transgenic mice expressing an activated form of stromelysin- 1 {{under the control of}} the MMTV promoter/enhancer exhibited inappropriate alveolar development in virgin females. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that the basement membrane underlying epithelial and myoepithelial cells was amorphous and discontinuous compared with the highly ordered basal lamina in control mammary glands. Transgenic mammary glands had at least a twofold increase in the number of cells/unit area and a 1. 4 -fold increase in the percent of cycling cells by 13 wk of age compared with nontransgenic littermates. In addition, transgenic glands expressed beta-casein mRNA, but not protein, and resembled the proliferative and differentiated state of an animal between 8 and 10 days pregnant. An analysis of metalloproteinase expression in the glands of normal pregnant females demonstrated that the same matrix metalloproteinase family members, including stromelysin- 1, were expressed in connective tissue cells surrounding epithelial clusters during the time of lobuloalveolar development. These results suggest that metalloproteinases may assist in remodeling ECM during normal ductal and alveolar branching morphogenesis, and that disruption of the basement membrane by an activated metalloproteinase can affect basic cellular processes of proliferation and differentiation...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{level of}} the UV-B irradiation due to depleting {{of the ozone layer}} is considered {{to be one of the}} causes of global amphibian declines. The UV-B radiation causes damage to the DNA in the nuclei of the skin cells and their eventual death. In many amphibian species there was found a negative influence of the UV-B radiation on the hatching success of tadpoles and their subsequent viability. It has been assumed that tadpoles are able to actively avoid places with the higher exposure of the UV-B radiation thanks to their locomotion. In this experiment tadpoles could have chosen between a zone with the UV radiation (UV-B and UV-A) and without the UV radiation. The tadpoles have not been exposed to the UV radiation before the measurement started. The location of the tadpoles during the measurement was recorded by CCD camera. A computer program EthoVision then evaluated the time that these tadpoles spent in each of the zones and the total path length these tadpoles has swum in the zones. The measurements were performed for two groups of tadpoles differing in age to determine whether the level of development may affect the tadpoles' preference to the UV radiation. The tadpoles in both groups spent more time in the zone without the UV radiation. The tadpoles in the more advanced development phase have spent 7 times more time in average in the zone without the UV radiation than in the zone with it. The tadpoles from the second group have spent in average 2. 5 times more time in the zone without the UV radiation than in the zone with the UV radiation. The total swimming path <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> tadpoles was almost 2. 5 times longer in the zone without the UV radiation than in the zone with the UV radiation. Conversely, the total path <b>length</b> <b>of</b> younger tadpoles did not significantly differ between the zones.

40|$|The {{construction}} of the shallow tunnel at Brezno started using the Pre-Vault Method. The tunnel excavation, in complicated geological conditions, led to many difficulties which finally resulted in a collapse, when {{a significant part of}} the temporary tunnel lining collapsed. Various options for re-excavating the tunnel were evaluated prior to further construction. Finally a decision was made to separate the collapsed area into sections 9 m in length using 16 m-wide, transversally oriented pile walls, to improve the stability of the collapsed ground. The walls were constructed from the surface prior to excavation. It was also decided to re-excavate a collapsed area using the Sprayed Concrete Lining (SCL) method. Due to problematic soft ground conditions, which had been made even worse by the collapse, some additional support measures had to be considered prior to re-excavation (ground improvement, micropile umbrellas embedded into the pile walls, etc.) This paper describes numerical modelling of the tunnel re-excavation through the collapsed area. Initial calculations of the tunnel re-excavation were made using a 2 D finite element method. Subsequently, further calculations to evaluate the rock mass behaviour in the collapsed area were provided in 3 D. The 2 D calculations were used to provide sensitivity studies, while 3 D modelling was mainly used for evaluating the tunnel face stability (impact of the pile walls, impact of ground improvement) together with other factors (<b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>advances,</b> moment <b>of</b> the temporary invert closure, etc.) The results of the modelling were compared with the monitoring results.

We present a rigorous method to obtain the inverse Compton cross section in the general case of not null initial momentum of the electrons from a pure QED calculation, avoiding the usual approaches based on the derivation of this cross section either from the Klein and Nishina formula and the Lorentz transformations or throught Feynman diagrams and Mandelstam invariants.

40|$|Background: Vγ 9 /Vδ 2 T {{cells are}} a minor subset of T cells in human blood and differ from other T cells by their {{immediate}} responsiveness to microbes. Vγ 9 /Vδ 2 T cells interact with monocytes and become activated by microbial-derived HMB-PP, an essential metabolite {{produced by a}} large range of pathogens, which in turn leads to substantial cytokine secretion and the generation of inflammatory response 1. Objective: To investigate if infections caused by HMBPP+ve organisms carry higher risk of death in ICU patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected in the clinical information system of a university and a non-university hospital between 2009 - 10. Microbiology data was retrieved from the respective databases and paired with patient level data. Microbiologically significant infection was defined as either bacteremia or respiratory secretion cultures with organism concentration > 105 CFU with appropriate clinical manifestations. For statistical analysis Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test was used. Results: We identified 3186 patients with 409 clinically significant microbiology cultures. HMBPP+ve pathogens were identified in 227, HMBPP-ve in 182 occasions. Significantly higher ICU mortality was observed with HMBPP+ve infections 60 / 227 HMBPP+ve vs 33 / 182 HMBPP –ve, respectively p= 0. 047 APACHE II	LOS	Ventilator days	Inotropic support (days) HMBPP+ve	 18 (9) 	 7. 9 (14) 	 3 (6) 	 1 (3) HMBPP-ve	 16. 5 (8) 	 6. 9 (11) 	 3 (6) 	 0. 5 (3) Data presented as median and (interquartile range) No significant differences in APACHE II, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> respiratory and cardiovascular support was observed. Conclusion: This report {{is the first to}} confirm that infection caused by HMBPP+ pathogens carries higher risk of death in ICU patients. This was not attribute to baseline differences as demonstrated by similar APACHE II scores in the HMBPP+ve and –ve group. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear, but it has been postulated that a rapid and HMB-PP-dependent crosstalk between the patients Vγ 9 /Vδ 2 T cells and autologous monocytes results in the immediate production of inflammatory mediators. Disproportionate monocyte-γδ T cell crosstalk may result in excessive production of inflammatory mediators, possibly explaining why episodes of HMB-PP+ve sepsis are associated with increased risk of death. Further studies are warranted to investigate this pathway...|$|R
