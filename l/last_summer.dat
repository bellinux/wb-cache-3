5|$|On 4 January 2016, Barcelona's {{transfer}} ban ended. The same day, they registered 77 players {{across all}} categories and ages, and both <b>last</b> <b>summer</b> signings Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal became eligible {{to play with}} the first team. On 10 February, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey. With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season. After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, the run has ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou. On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons with a 3–0 win in {{the final day of the}} season at Granada. On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League in 2nd Leg, beating Paris Saint-Germain by a score of 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0. On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor signing a two-year contract with an option for a further year.|$|E
5|$|Rovers' {{losing streak}} resumed in October {{with a loss}} at league leaders Bury. Tranmere finally scored a goal, which was only their second in seven games, in the League Trophy Second Round clash against Carlisle United. The game went to a shoot-out, won by Rovers 5–4 after Patrick Brough missed the sixth shot for the guests. On 11 October, after fourth {{consecutive}} league defeat at Plymouth Argyle, Tranmere Rovers reached {{the bottom of the}} League Two table with only nine points in 12 games. Two days later manager Rob Edwards had been sacked. On 16 November, ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams was announced as his replacement, though the team was to be prepared for the next game by the assistant managers. Adams took charge after a fifth straight league defeat and announced the return to the club of Chris Shuker as assistant manager while Alex Russell left the club. Also, a double loan signing was made in order to strengthen the attack line: Armand Gnanduillet joined from Chesterfield and Danny Johnson signed from Cardiff City, while midfielder Steve Jennings, who was signed by Adams for Port Vale <b>last</b> <b>summer,</b> rejoined him at Tranmere on loan until January.|$|E
5|$|His seat on MGM's {{board would}} last {{less than a}} year. After the {{unexpected}} death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958, Columbia's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement. In early April {{it was confirmed that}} Briskin {{was one of those who}} they were considering. In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM, in order to return to Columbia, this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities. In addition to his executive production roles, Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico's board of directors. Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock on the open market as a way to display confidence in the company. By the end of 1958, Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio. In April 1959, Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia, wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18-month span, and studio head Abe Schneider (also Briskin's brother-in-law) tagged Briskin to head the program. Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder, A Raisin in the Sun, and Suddenly, <b>Last</b> <b>Summer.</b> Also in 1959, Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate, the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes. Something Briskin had experience in during World War II. In July, Briskin's brother, Irving, sold his independent television production company to Screen Gems, Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary. After the sale, he went back to work at Columbia, where he had been prior to forming his own company. Shortly after, Briskin, reunited with his brother, announced that he was re-integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia, and it would no longer operate as a separate entity. Under Briskin, in July 1959 production hit an all-time high at Columbia, with over $11.5 million in production at one time. In August, despite rising production costs, Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio. In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia's board of directors, a position he held until his death. At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia's board, it was announced that his son, Jerry, would be joining him at Columbia, working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series, Manhunt. In December, Briskin's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders.|$|E
