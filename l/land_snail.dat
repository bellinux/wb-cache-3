5|$|Circulatory system: The osmotic {{pressure}} of the hemolymph of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95mOsm. That is much lower value than in marine snails in the subfamily Neritinae. The {{osmotic pressure}} and the composiotion of ionts of the hemolymph of the subfamily Neritininae (where does the Theodoxus belong to) {{is similar to the}} hemolymph of the <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> family Helicinidae.|$|E

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>snails</b> form an {{important}} component in the forest ecosystem. In terms of number of species, the phylum Mollusca, to which <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> belong, is the largest phylum after Arthropoda. Mollusca provide unique ecosystem services including recycling of nutrients and they provide a prey base for small mammals, birds, snakes and other reptiles. However, <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> have {{the largest number of}} documented extinctions, compared to any other taxa. Till date 1, 129 species of <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> are recorded from Indian territory. But only basic information is known about their taxonomy and little is known of their population biology, ecology and their conservation status. In this paper, we briefly review status, threats and conservation strategies of <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> of India...|$|R
50|$|Endodonta is a genus {{of small}} {{air-breathing}} <b>land</b> <b>snails,</b> terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks {{in the family}} Endodontidae, an endemic family of <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> from the Hawaiian islands.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, {{while on}} a fishing trip {{on the coast of}} Queensland with his father, Irwin {{discovered}} a new species of turtle. Later given the honour of naming the newly discovered species, he named it Irwin's turtle (Elseya irwini) after his family. Another newly discovered Australian animal – a species of air-breathing <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> Crikey steveirwini, was named after Irwin in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets. The largest amount of time is spent eating phloem sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing plant parts (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees. They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail, {{scientific}} name Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, is {{a species of}} small air-breathing <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> in the family Succineidae, the amber snails. This species was discovered in 1905, and was reported three years later as a subspecies of the oval ambersnail, Succinea ovalis. Several taxonomic reviews {{took place in the}} subsequent decades {{until the end of the}} 1980s, when the Chittenango ovate amber snail was finally judged to be a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, based on chemical and morphological data.|$|E
50|$|Sigmurethra is a taxonomic {{category}} of air-breathing <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> and slugs, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. This is an informal group {{which includes the}} majority of <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> and slugs.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as being}} relished as gourmet food, several species of <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> provide an easily {{harvested}} source of protein to many people in poor communities around the world. Many <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> are valuable because they can feed {{on a wide range}} of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in banana plantations. In some countries, giant African <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> are produced commercially for food.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> bear one or {{two pairs}} of tentacles on their heads. In most <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> the eyes are carried on the first (upper) set of tentacles (called ommatophores or more informally 'eye stalks') which are usually roughly 75% of {{the width of the}} eyes. The second (lower) set of tentacles act as {{olfactory}} organs. Both sets of tentacles are retractable in <b>land</b> <b>snails.</b>|$|R

25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri {{is a small}} <b>land</b> <b>snail.</b> The {{height of}} the shell is 3.4-6.0mm, usually 3.5–5mm. The width of the shell is 5.1(5.0)-8.0mm.|$|E
25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri is {{a species}} of {{air-breathing}} <b>land</b> <b>snail,</b> a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Hygromiidae. It is also often known as Trochoidea geyeri.|$|E
25|$|This <b>land</b> <b>snail</b> {{lives in}} {{limestone}} areas in Vietnam. The original description {{was published in}} 2007, and included details of the reproductive system and the radula. The shell is sinistral in coiling and has 8 or 9 whorls.|$|E
5|$|All pulmonate <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> are hermaphrodites, {{and have}} a {{complete}} and rather elaborate set of {{both male and female}} reproductive organs (see the simplified anatomical diagram above), but the majority of pulmonate <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> have no love darts and no dart sac.|$|R
50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>snails</b> have {{a strong}} muscular foot; they use mucus {{to enable them to}} crawl over rough surfaces, and in order to keep their soft bodies from drying out. Like other mollusks, <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> have a mantle, and they have one or two pairs of tentacles on their head. Their {{internal}} anatomy includes a radula and a primitive brain.In terms of reproduction, the majority of <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> are hermaphrodite (have a full set of organs of both sexes) and most lay clutches of eggs in the soil. Tiny snails hatch out of the egg with a small shell in place, and the shell grows spirally as the soft parts gradually increase in size. Most <b>land</b> <b>snails</b> have shells that are right-handed in their coiling.|$|R
