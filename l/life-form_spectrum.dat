40|$|A phytosociological {{study was}} {{conducted}} on evergreen broad-leaved forests in the Chichibu district of central Honshu. Four associations and one community were determined: a Polysticho-Perseetum thunbergii, an Ardisio-Castanopsietum sieboldii, a Quercetum myrsinaefoliae, a Sakakio-Cyclobalanopsietum and a Quercus glauca community. These vegetation units occur in different horizontal habitats and precipitation areas. Evergreen broad-leaved forests in this district, except the Ardisio-Castanopsietum sieboldii, contain summergreen species, about 70 % as many {{as the number of}} evergreen species growing there. In the Ardisio -Castanopsietum sieboldii, however, the number of summergreen plants is smaller, cpmprising less than 40 % of the number of evergreen species.

One hundred and eighty-four taxa are reported {{here for the first}} time. The local distribution of plants in the interior castle area, on walls and in the surrounding area is discussed. The wall flora is presented and compared with other Mediterranean wall floras. In the <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum,</b> therophytes are overrepresented (56. 4 %). Nine chorological groups are distinguished, with the Mediterranean elements (63. 4 %) as dominant. The endemic element is relatively rich, including 24 taxa with a restricted distribution range confined to Greece or an even smaller area. The adventive flora is remarkably poor and it consists of only seven taxa. Key words: castle flora, chorology, endemics, life forms, wall flor...|$|E

40|$|The cerrado, {{the second}} largest {{vegetation}} type in Brazil, presents a wide physiognomic range, from grasslands to tall wood-lands, but with most of its physiognomies fitting the definition of tropical savanna. We compiled Raunkiaer’s <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> from cerrado sites and from other vegetation types, comparing them among themselves with ordination analyses. In all cerrado <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra,</b> the main <b>life-form</b> classes were the hemicryptophytes and the phanerophytes, the former prevailing in sites with open physiognomies and the latter prevailing in sites with closed physiognomies. When compared with <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> from other vegetation types, the cerrado sites formed a distinct group, with scores closer {{to those of the}} hemicryptophytes and phanerophytes. The cerrado sites distinguished themselves from the savanna sites by their under-representation of therophytes. The ordination plot indicated the likeliness of two gradients in the determination of biological spectra in the world, one from wet to dry, the other from hot to cold, thus stressing the role of precipitation and temperature on plant forms. Even if sometimes criticized in its application on tropical communities, Raunkiaer’s system was useful to characterize the cerrado floras and to separate them from other vegetation types...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a floristic investigation {{undertaken in the}} urban “Grand Park of Tirana” in three years’ period (2012 – 2015). The {{purpose of this study}} is to give floristic data and distribution of spontaneous plant species which occur in “Grand Park of Tirana” and determine and analyze their urban indicators. Spontaneous flora of the park contains 240 species of vascular plants from 179 genera and 54 families. Among the families the most dominants in species are the Poaceae (30 species), Fabaceae (24) and Asteraceae (21). The analysis of <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> shows that the dominant life form is the hemicryptophyte.

40|$|The study’s aim is the {{comparative}} chorologic and ecological {{analysis of the}} vascular flora of the two gorges of the Pčinja River in Serbia and Macedonia which are 27 km apart. In the two gorges 1564 taxa have been recorded, 1057 being in the upper gorge in Serbia and 1174 in the lower gorge in Macedonia. Common to both gorges are 666 taxa. Chorological spectra show that in both gorges the most abundant are Mediterranean-submediterranean plants, 32. 85 % being in the upper and 43. 97 % in the lower gorge. Differences in the studied vegetation result from a diverse participation of other floristic elements such as Central European ones that are more abundant in the upper gorge (17. 05 %) than in the lower gorge (10. 86 %). The <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum</b> reveals that the flora in both gorges is hemicryptophyte-therophyte in character.

40|$|Aims To {{identify}} the relative contributions of environmental determinism, dispersal limitation and historical {{factors in the}} spatial structure of the floristic data of inselbergs at the local and regional scales, and to test if the extent of species spatial aggregation is related to dispersal abilities. Location Rain forest inselbergs of Equatorial Guinea, northern Gabon and southern Cameroon (western central Africa). Methods We use phytosociological releves and herbarium collections obtained from 27 inselbergs using a stratified sampling scheme considering six plant formations. Data analysis focused on Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, Melastomataceae, Poaceae, Commelinaceae, Acanthaceae, Begoniaceae and Pteridophytes. Data were investigated using ordination methods (detrended correspondence analysis, DCA; canonical correspondence analysis, CCA), Sorensen's coefficient of similarity and spatial autocorrelation statistics. Comparisons were made at the local and regional scales using ordinations of <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> and ordinations of species data. Results At the local scale, the forest-inselberg ecotone is the main gradient structuring the floristic data. At the regional scale, this is still the main gradient in the ordination of <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra,</b> but other factors become predominant in analyses of species assemblages. CCA identified three environmental variables explaining {{a significant part of}} the variation in floristic data. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that both the flora and the environmental factors are spatially autocorrelated: the similarity of species compositions within plant formations decreasing approximately linearly with the logarithm of the spatial distance. The extent of species distribution was correlated with their a priori dispersal abilities as assessed by their diaspore types. Main conclusions At a local scale, species composition is best explained by a continuous cline of edaphic conditions along the forest-inselberg ecotone, generating a wide array of ecological niches. At a regional scale, these ecological niches are occupied by different species depending on the available local species pool. These subregional species pools probably result from varying environmental conditions, dispersal limitation and the history of past vegetation changes due to climatic fluctuations.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the ecology of vegetation and {{to see if the}} heterogeneity of soil is the main determining factor for the diversity of natural vegetation. Therophytes were the most prominent proportion of <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum.</b> On the basis of highest IVI three plant communities, Ochthochloa - Cymbopogon - Community, Launaea - Aerva - Community and Lasiurus scindicus -Community were recognized at the three selected habitats. Measurements for ecological indices showed that Launaea - Aerva - Community was more diverse with regard to species number, richness and evenness as compared to the other two plant communities studied. Present results for the pearson moment correlation showed that soil chemical composition may be the main factor not only for array of vegetation but also determines that what type of plant species can grow there. Soil variables were found highly different at all the study sites. We concluded that soil heterogeneity is the major determinant for development of plant communities while climate do not differ much in the area...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} use of {{non-parametric}} estimators of species richness to evaluate the flora of a relatively large (431 ha) nature reserve, using a sampling area much lower than that used in previous studies. Different estimation methods were applied to floristic data obtained from 50 random plots: the number of observed species, the extrapolated accumulation curves based on the Michaelis–Menten model and the non-parametric estimators based on incidence data (Chao 2, first-order Jackknife, second-order Jackknife and bootstrap). To test {{the performance of the}} estimators, five data sets were created on the basis of life-forms. The estimates were compared with reference values obtained by traditional floristic and vegetation sampling. The power of the different estimation methods could not definitively be determined, but the first- and second-order Jackknives seem to be the most precise. Although total species richness was underestimated, the sample-based approach provided accurate information for quantitative comparison of time series of data related to ecological changes, vegetation dynamics and environmental changes. This sample-based data included basic statistics on species richness and species frequency distributions as well as the <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum,</b> at the plot and the whole site scales...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a floristic survey in six forests owned and managed by the {{regional}} administration of Tuscany are reported in this paper. These forests are undergoing a monitoring program, which includes biodiversity {{as one of the}} status indicators. Vascular plants are used as indicator species group to quantify biodiversity and they are assessed by means of quantitative floristics. This approach involves the collection of floristic information {{on the basis of a}} sampling design. Floristic and structural data were collected in 109 plots, each 400 m 2 large, and analysed at both the plot and forest scales. At the plot scale, species richness was found to be unimodally related to elevation and negatively related to tree stem density and total basal area. At the forest scale, the six forests differed in their patterns of species accumulation, with the highest number of species for a given number of sites sampled observed in the intermediate elevation forests. The analysis of the <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum</b> showed, for both the plot and forest scales, a decreasing importance of the relative abundance of phanerophytes and an increasing importance of the relative abundance of hemicriptophytes in relation to elevation.

40|$|The plant {{communities}} of the badlands of a pre-Pyrenean area were studied {{by means of a}} geomorphological selection of the eroded areas and 71 phytocoenological relevés with topographic data. The relevés were subdivided into two groups, according to the two kinds of substratum (Eocene marls and Upper Cretaceous clays), and then submitted to Correspondence Analysis. According to these analyses and to abiotic parameters, nine vegetation types can be distinguished. Each community is characterized by ecological groups of species and by different <b>life-forms</b> <b>spectra.</b> The comparison among such communities, as well as with those of the non-eroded areas, allows to discuss their dynamic relationships in relation with erosion processes. As a generai rule, erosive dynamics involves a regressive succesion from the previous community (normally a mesoxerophilous pasture) through the opening of gaps and the loss of mainly mesophilous species. Thus, the badland communities on each substratum are dynamically connected, most stands having medium- to very low coverages and diversity, the topographic position and the related erosive processes being the most influential factors on their distribution...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the plant communities characteristic of the Mediterranean type climatic regions of France, California, and southern Australia. Infertile and relatively fertile soils support two distinctive groups of plant communities. In their natural state, the climax vegetations on both soils are dominated by evergreen, sclerophyllous trees in a woodland formation. Grass and herbs form a characteristic understorey on the more fertile soils; evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs are common in the understorey on infertile soils. In drier habitats, the climax woodlands may be replaced by shrub communities such as the garrigue-maquis in France, the chaparral in California, and the heath and mallee-broombush (open scrub) vegetations in southern Australia. In a preliminary study, the characters which Schimper and others had expounded were used to compare the communities of drier habitats. Characteristics such as the presence of evergreen sclerophyllous leaves, lignotubers, and similar <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> pointed to comparable vegetation. In further support of this conclusion, phenological data showed that spring was the season of maximum flowering and shoot growth of the various plant communities; the dry summer conditions reduced growth to zero except in southern Australia where growth extends through much of summer...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © by Gustav Fischer Verlag. Twenty sites, {{representing}} different pasture {{types in}} NW Spain, were sampled {{with respect to}} their floristic composition and structural characteristics for two years of contrasting precipitation. The first year was characterised by a severe regional drought and the second year had normal precipitation. Four plant community types were identified by consensus classification techniques of plant species composition. These community types were associated with grazing regime, percentage cover at herbaceous vegetation, rocks and bare ground, and sail characteristics. One community type included mesic sites on acidic parent materials with low grazing, where as the other three were all intensely grazed, and included either xeric or mesic sites on calcareous parent materials or mesic sites an acidic parent materials. Species composition varied between years according lo well defined directional trends within the intensely grazed communities. Compositional differences between calcareous and acidic pastures increased in the normal year. On average 49 to 73 % of the species appeared only in one year. This high species turnover was also high when analysed separately for different life-form s, namely annuals perennial grasses, perennial forbs and under shrubs. In spite of this, both the <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and the relative abundance of each life-form remained unaltered for each community type in both years. This suggests that such characteristics of the communities' structure are in equilibrium with habitat characteristics, as well as the existence of a deterministic structure in the grasslands studied...|$|E
40|$|Whether the {{functional}} structure of ecological communities is deterministic or historically contingent is still quite con-troversial. However, recent experimental tests {{did not find}} effects of species composition variation on trait convergence and therefore the environmental constraints should play the major role on community convergence into functional groups. Seasonal cerrados are characterized by a sharp seasonality, in which the water shortage defines the community functioning. Hyperseasonal cerrados experience additionally waterlogging in the rainy season. Here, we asked whether waterlogging modifies species convergences into life-forms in a hyperseasonal cerrado. We studied a hyperseasonal cerrado, comparing it with a nearby seasonal cerrado, never waterlogged, in Emas National Park, central Brazil. In each area, we sampled all vascular plants by placing 40 plots of 1 m 2 plots in four surveys. We analyzed the species convergences into life-forms in both cerrados using the Raunkiaer’s <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum</b> and the index of divergence from species to life-form diversity (IDD). The overall life-form spectra and IDDs were not different, indicating that waterlogging {{did not affect the}} composition of functional groups in the hyperseasonal cerrado. However, there was a seasonal variation in IDD values only in the hyperseasonal cerrado. As long as we did not find a seasonal variation in life-form diversity, the seasonal variation of convergence into life-forms in the hyperseasonal cerrado was a conse-quence of the seasonal variation of species diversity. Because of high functional redundancy of cerrado plants, water-logging promoted a floristic replacement without major changes in functional groups. Thus, waterlogging in the hyper-seasonal cerrado promoted seasonal changes in species convergence into life-forms by reducing species diversity...|$|E

These orchards were cultivated with: Citrus spp., Phoenix dactylifera, Musa sapientum, Prunus persica, Mangifera indica, Vitis vinifera, Psidium guajava and Pyrus malus. The total number of weed species recorded in these orchards was 169 related to 126 genera and grouped under 35 families. Out of these weeds, 47 species were monocotyledoneae (27. 81 %) and 122 species were dicotyledoneae (72. 19 %). Gramineae and Compositae were the main families representing collectively about 36. 06 % of the total recorded species. According to the life span, the recorded species were classified into three groups: 1) 50 perennial weed species (29. 58 %), 2) 4 biennial weed species (2. 37 %) and 3) 115 annual weed species (68. 05 %). Furthermore, the annual weeds can be subdivided into three categories as follows: a) all year active annuals (31 species), b) winter-spring annuals (57 species) and c) summer-autumn annuals (27 species). According to the <b>life-form</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the weed flora of the study orchards may be grouped under six groups; these were: therophytes (119 species), cryptophytes (27 species), hemicryptophytes (12 species), chamaephytes (7 species), nanophanerophytes (3 species) and parasites (one species). Phytogeographically, 84 species (49. 7 %) were Mediterranean taxa. These were either pluriregional (23. 07 %), biregional (20. 11 %) or monoregional (6. 52 %).

40|$|Intuitively, {{biological}} diversity would apparently seem the most unambiguous and easily studied of ecological concepts. However, {{when we look}} for a suitable numerical definition, we find that no single diversity index adequately summarizes community structure. One reason for this drawback is that different diversity indices confound the qualities of species richness and dominance concentration in a single number. Consequently, the characterization of community diversity can be substantially improved by substituting a parametric index family for traditional diversity indices, While traditional diversity indices supply point descriptions of community structure, according to parametric diversity indices, there is a continuum of possible diversity measures, which differ only in their sensitivity {{to the presence of}} rare species in the formulation of the indices. In this paper we first summarize the role of Renyi's generalized information for parametric biodiversity characterization. Then, we show that Renyi's generalized information can be expressed as a simple linear combination of the information associated to species richness and dominance concentration.

A total number of 285 plant species have been gathered belonging to 77 families, of which Poaceae (34 species) and Fabaceae (32 species) are the most representative. The 285 plant species identified have been classified in seven groups according to the vegetation types. The analysis of <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> has revealed the abundance of therophytes (38. 2 % and 36. 5 %) and phanerophytes (39. 7 % and 37. 2 %). The grasslands are dominated by annual species. The number of therophytes increases from south to north; this could be due to decrease of average annual precipitation. The phytogeographical spectrum of species have revealed the abundance of sudano-zambezian elements (21. 4 % and 23. 9 %) and African pluriregional elements (21. 4 % and 21. 6 %). No endemic species have been noted among the 285 species. The two phanerophytes most frequently encountered and restricted to the inselbergs are Hymenodictyon floribundum and Ficus abutilifolia.

40|$|Biodiversity {{pattern and}} <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> were studied along a 3, 000 m altitudinal {{gradient}} from a semi-desert {{area to the}} alpine peak of Tochal Mountain. The gradient {{is located on the}} southern slopes of Central Alborz with a Mediterranean continental climate. DCA ordination was applied to 1, 069 relev,s and 7 quantitative variables to discover the relation of diversity and altitude. A biodiversity pattern was obtained by relating values for species richness and Shannon-Wiener's index to 100 -m altitudinal sections. Altitude was determined as the major ecological gradient. Both diversity indices are negatively correlated with altitude and show a decreasing trend beyond a peak in species richness at 1, 800 - 1, 900 m a. s. l. towards a very low diversity in the high alpine zone. The biodiversity peak does not match with the potential tree line in the area (2, 500 - 3, 000 m a. s. l.). The high diversity in foothills can be related to habitat heterogeneity, longer suitable climatic conditions, and diverse disturbance factors, while unfavorable conditions at high-altitude alpine and low-altitude desert areas reduce the number of species at both extremes. Life-form patterns clearly change along altitudinal gradient. Annuals with decreasing trend, and hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes with increasing trend along the altitudinal gradient are notable patterns of life form in the area. Temperature, soil moisture and nutrients are the main factors that explain the ecological influence of altitude on species diversity and life-form patterns in the semi-arid steppe vegetation of the area. ...|$|R
40|$|Vascular {{species and}} their {{respective}} life-forms and coverage were recorded in a Brazilian quartzite and itabirite rocky outcrop site at Serra de Ouro Preto, producing the floristic, frequency and vegetational spectra. Three habitats in both lithologies were defined by geomorphology as: 1) Sloped areas near the mountain summit, with grasslands; 2) Plateaus {{in the middle of}} the slope, with grasslands; and 3) Lower and/or concave parts of the slopes, with woody savannas. The life-forms followed Raunkiaer's System. We aimed to answer the following questions: Do quartzite and itabirite rocky outcrops have different biological spectra? Are the biological spectra different in the geomorphologic habitats? Do the floristic, vegetational and frequency spectra differ from one another? What spectrum stacks up to a rocky outcrop physiognomy description? The results portrayed that: a) the most represented life-forms were the phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes; b) the floristic and frequency spectra did not differ from each other, but both differed from the vegetational one; c) all the floristic spectra were similar, but there were significant differences in the frequency and vegetational spectra among the lithology and geomorphology habitats; d) higher phanerophyte and lesser hemicryptophyte coverages were found in the itabirite areas and also in the lower or concave parts of the slopes of both lithologies; and e) the vegetational spectrum was more efficient for the studied rocky outcrop comparison. Relationships between the environmental aspects and <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> are discussed. This study will help advance the development of restoration projects for these areas by adding knowledge of their flora composition, structure and function...|$|R
40|$|It {{has already}} been {{extensively}} documented that major floristic differences between ancient and recent temperate broad-leaved forests exist. Hence, the question raises whether the herb layer community structure and organization of ancient and recent forests also differs and whether these differences are the same in productive vs. unproductive forest types? Therefore, we selected 127 releves situated in productive Alno-Padion forests and 69 releves situated in less productive Quercion forests out of a larger data-set containing 640 releves from northern Belgium. The plots differed with respect to land use history but it was assured that no covariation between land use history on the one hand, and soil texture, soil drainage and canopy composition on the other occurred. In both forest types, about 30 % of the studied species exhibited an association with either ancient or recent forests. Persistent differences between ancient and recent forests in <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> in general and in the number and abundance of geophytes in particular were found as well. Few changes in the community structure of productive Alno-Padion forests were observed after 70 years of recovery. Only in the youngest Alno-Padion forests (i. e. < 70 years) species numbers and total cover of the herb layer were lower and co-occurrence patterns {{did not differ from}} random. In general, community recovery appeared to be slower in unproductive Quercion forests. Species numbers, species abundance distributions, species co-occurrence patterns and plot dissimilarity still changed after 120 years. The persistent differences in both communities {{can be explained by the}} strong dispersal limitation of many of the involved species, but in the Quercion forests recovery is probably also severely hampered by establishment limitation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Die Arbeit vergleicht die Flora von 19 Dörfern Westböhmens mit derjenigen der Stadt Plzen. Zugrunde liegen {{qualitative}} und quantitative floristische Angaben zur Artenzusammensetzung insgesamt und teilweise auch im Vergleich einzelner Standorte. Ausgewertet werden weiter Lebensformenspektren, der Anteil der Anthropophyten und mittlere Zeigerwerte nach ELLENBERG. Insgesamt ergeben sich deutliche Unterschiede, teilweise in Übereinstimmung mit Untersuchungen aus anderen Gebieten. A comparison {{in western}} Bohemia of village ruderal flora {{with that of}} an industrial town is presented. The floristic differences between the town of Plzen and 19 village settlements {{make it possible to}} specify many species which typically occur on one or another habitat type. Species obviously concentrated either in villages or in the town can be found even among the common ones. Enrichment of village ruderal flora is mostly due to the occurence of species growing in moist, steppe and forest sites. On the other side, better possibilities of immigration in towns results in increased numbers of anthropophytes. Regarding the percentage share of families in the composition of the flora, considerable differences were found between villages and the town (see table 3). Analysis of similarity indices showed that differences among floras of strongly human-influenced areas are most of all due to differences among the most dynamic groups of plants (neophytes, ergasiophygophytes). The percentage of therophytes was higher in Plzen, whereas an increase in geophytes and phanerophytes was recorded in rural habitats (Table 5). In the town of Plzen, the spectrum of life forms remains relatively stable regardless of the habitat type, with the percentage of therophytes slightly increasing from the periphery towards the center of the town. On the contrary, major differences in the composition of <b>life-form</b> <b>spectra</b> {{can be seen in the}} village flora according to the habitat type. The considerably higher proportion of anthropophytes recorded in the flora of Plzen (see Table 6) is due to greater environmental pressure by humans and more suitable temperature conditions. An increase in the percentage of anthropophytes was observed along the gradient from rural to urban localities. Among anthropophytes, archaeophytes occur more frequently than neophytes. This trend can be better discovered when quantitative data on species occurence are taken into account. In general, archaeophytes are the group better established in local floras, often being important components of prevailing ruderal communities. Application of ELLENBERG's indicator values showed a higher concentration of nitrophilous and thermophilous species in the flora of Plzen, whereas the hygrophilous and heliophilous species are more typical of village sites...|$|R
40|$|Plant species {{composition}} and vegetation coverage are critical indicators in vegetation disturbance and restoration, but their correlations are dynamic and complex under human disturbance. Inadequate {{attention has been}} paid to the correlations between {{species composition}} and vegetation coverage associated with vegetation disturbance on plateaus. We analyze the origin of species, chorological <b>spectra,</b> <b>life-forms</b> and dominant species in the Napahai wetland of Yunnan Province, China. The correlations between species composition and vegetation coverage associated with human disturbance were then investigated by hierarchical partitioning and regression analysis. A total of 71 plant species belonging to 47 genera and 24 families were identified. Our results revealed that the plant composition of the Napahai Plateau vegetation was relatively monotonous, with the three dominant chorological types consisting of 68. 4 - 100. 0 % of all genera. The wetlands studied have suffered from significant changes in species composition caused by human disturbance, and several plant species might have disappeared following such disturbance. Species richness, the most significant explanatory variable, independently contributed to 25. 9 % of the variance in vegetation coverage. A model constructed using the three dominant factors explained 68 % of the variance in vegetation coverage. Our results highlight the dramatic changes in characteristics of plant species composition after human disturbance, and the effects of human disturbance on vegetation coverage. Several suggestions were also proposed to increase vegetation coverage in degraded wetland plateau areas of Napahai...|$|R
