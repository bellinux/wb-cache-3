2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of postage stamps, mail in the UK was {{paid for by the}} recipient, a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem: the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by [...] the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items, and senders had no incentive to restrict the number, size, or weight of items sent, whether or not they would ultimately be paid for. The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner, with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced. Concurrently with the first stamps, the UK offered wrappers for mail. [...] Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes, post cards, <b>lettercards,</b> aerogrammes, postage meters, and, more recently, specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the U.S. postal service for priority or express mailing.|$|R
