5|$|Prisoners in the Agra jail {{were trained}} and kept {{employed}} as carpet weavers {{as part of}} their rehabilitation. In 1886, 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate carpet weaving at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in South Kensington. Karim did not accompany the prisoners, but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip, and helped to select the carpets and weavers. When Queen Victoria visited the exhibition, Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets, again chosen with the assistance of Karim. The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her Golden Jubilee. She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year. Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England, along with Mohammed Buksh. Major-General Thomas Dennehy, who was about to be appointed to the Royal Household, had previously employed Buksh as a servant. It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait at table, and <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> other tasks.|$|E

25|$|He {{states that}} he is fully {{convinced}} that the greatest challenge is not technology in itself, is not security and integrity of data, is not the decluttering of information, but the quantum leap in culture required at all echelons. Generals must <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and stick to their job of strategists and planners, leaving tactics where they belong; platoon commanders must learn to take their own growing share of responsibility to conduct actions that concur with the intent indicated by generals, without minute by minute directions.|$|E
500|$|Boyce {{felt that}} Scouting's {{emphasis}} on outdoor activity was crucial in producing {{the type of}} leaders that America needed because youth reared in cities had too much done for them, whereas those from the country had to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things for themselves. Scouting was focused on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order [...] "to make men".|$|E
500|$|Although {{only two}} {{characters}} start {{the game with}} the ability to use magic, almost every character can <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Characters may equip magicite, which enables the summoning of espers, this game's incarnation of summoned monsters (including several recurring summons such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin, along with many new summons exclusive to Final Fantasy VI), {{as well as that of}} specific magic spells. If a character has a piece of magicite equipped, he or she will gain [...] "Magic Acquisition Points" [...] after most battles. As a character gains magic AP, he or she gradually learns spells from the magicite equipped and will gain additional statistic bonuses when leveling up, depending on the magicite.|$|E

2500|$|Another topic he {{discussed}} during this interview was education. He expressed {{his belief that}} education is important and should be free for everyone. He mentioned that Cuba is able to provide free education for all those living in Cuba despite being a small country and that he doesn't understand how the United States being such a powerful nation {{was not able to}} do the same. He then expressed frustration at the fact that one can enroll in the armed forces in the United States and [...] "learn to kill" [...] for free, but had to pay to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything else.

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a [...] out of 4-star rating.

However, he praised Culkin's performance. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the film a [...] "D" [...] grade, criticizing the film for its [...] "sadistic festival of adult-bashing".

2500|$|Chimpanzees {{exhibit a}} variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for {{termites}} using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites. [...] Some of this variation {{may be the result}} of [...] "environmental shaping" [...] (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects. [...] When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.|$|E
2500|$|One {{night on}} tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked [...] "if only you would <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> battement tendu {{properly}} you wouldn't {{have to learn}} anything else." [...] It {{was his way of}} saying she needed to start all over– battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. [...] "I wanted to die", she recalled. [...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My body seemed to be going through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E
