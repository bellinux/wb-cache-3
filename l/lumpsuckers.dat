5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, <b>lumpsuckers,</b> and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lumpsuckers</b> {{are found}} in {{temperate}} northern waters. They live on the seafloor, and are temporary residents of rocky pools in late winter and early spring when they spawn. The body of the lumpsucker is scaleless and covered with small lumps. They have a large sucking disc on their underside which they use to cling to surfaces. They are normally a blue to slate-grey colour, and are effectively camouflaged to look like stones. They are portly, nearly spherical, poor swimmers, reaching lengths up to 50cm. After the female lumpsucker lays eggs, the male takes over, clamping itself to a rock where it guards the eggs. When they hatch, <b>lumpsuckers</b> look like tiny tadpoles. They remain in shallow water and rock pools, hiding amongst seaweed and rocks, until they grow up.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} aspects of goby morphology are the fused pelvic fins that form a disc-shaped sucker. This sucker is functionally {{analogous to the}} dorsal fin sucker possessed by the remoras or the pelvic fin sucker of the <b>lumpsuckers,</b> but is anatomically distinct; these similarities {{are the product of}} convergent evolution. Gobies can often be seen using the sucker to adhere to rocks and corals, and in aquariums they will stick to glass walls of the tank, as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} red {{king crab}} Paralithodes camtschaticus preys on <b>lumpsucker</b> Cyclopterus lumpus eggs. We tested the hypothesis this egg consumption may hamper {{the recruitment of}} <b>lumpsucker.</b> Methods applied included field work, laboratory experiments and modelling of egg consumption. Crabs were sampled and feeding behaviour was studied {{by means of a}} remotely operated vehicle and SCUBA divers in a field survey carried out in Varanger Fjord, Norway, in 2003. Laboratory experiments were carried out in 2006 to study the digestion of <b>lumpsucker</b> eggs by red king crabs, and a stomach evacuation model was fitted to the experimental data. Using data from the field and laboratory studies, an egg consumption model was used to quantify the amount of <b>lumpsucker</b> eggs consumed by king crabs in Varanger Fjord. The uncertainty in model input data was assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation. Sex or sampling area did not significantly affect egg predation. A total of 7. 9 % of all crab stomachs contained an average of 20 <b>lumpsucker</b> eggs, but the number of eggs per stomach varied widely. The average time required to evacuate <b>lumpsucker</b> eggs at 6 °C in the laboratory experiment was ~ 10 h. In 2003, king crabs in Varanger Fjord consumed <b>lumpsucker</b> roe equivalent to approximately one-third of commercial catches during the same period. Red king crab predation on <b>lumpsucker</b> eggs may hamper <b>lumpsucker</b> recruitment in northern Norwegian waters...|$|R
50|$|Cod {{and related}} species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, Lernaeocera branchialis, starts {{life as a}} copepod, a small, free-swimming {{crustacean}} larva. The first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or <b>lumpsucker,</b> which they capture with grasping hooks {{at the front of}} their bodies. They penetrate the <b>lumpsucker</b> with a thin filament which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then mate on the <b>lumpsucker.</b>|$|R

500|$|This alcid {{typically}} fed in shoaling {{waters that}} were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, {{they had been}} sighted as far as [...] from land.

Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include <b>lumpsuckers,</b> shorthorn sculpins, cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans. The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.|$|E

40|$|Mortality of {{demersal}} fish eggs caused by predation {{was investigated in}} this research project. The selected prey species were the Barents Sea capelin Mallotus villosus and <b>lumpsucker</b> Cyclopterus lumpus L, while the selected predators were capelin itself by cannibalistic behaviour and the invasive red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus. Both capelin and <b>lumpsucker</b> are commercially important species in the Norwegian fisheries, but capelin {{is also a very}} important forage fish for other species. The egg guarding <b>lumpsucker</b> male was not able to protect his eggs from the egg feeding red king crab. Approximately 8 % of the analysed red king crab stomachs contained <b>lumpsucker</b> eggs in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, capelin eggs occurred in 10 % and 23 % of the analysed red king crab stomachs and capelin in 82 % and 22 % respectively. As post-spawn capelin occurred more frequently in crab stomachs than capelin eggs, they might have served as alternative prey to capelin eggs. Average stomach evacuation time for <b>lumpsucker</b> in red king crabs was higher than for capelin eggs. Consumption estimates of capelin eggs in red king crab accounted for 0. 04 % and 2. 23 % of the eggs available in the years of study, while the minimum estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism in capelin accounted for 1 - 2 % of the total egg production in 2003. The uncertainty in stomach data generated most of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo estimated consumption of fish eggs by the red king crab. This study has established new knowledge about fish egg predation by the invasive red king and egg cannibalism in capelin. Mortality in capelin eggs caused by cannibalism and egg consumption by the red king crab may influence mortality of eggs, but is not considered to hamper capelin recruitment. Recruitment of <b>lumpsucker</b> on the other hand, may be hampered by the red king crab that chase away the egg guarding male, damage and feed on his eggs...|$|R

Movements {{of female}} <b>lumpsucker</b> Cyclopterus lumpus in a Norwegian fjord during the {{spawning}} period. - NINA Report 288. 20 pp. <b>Lumpsucker</b> are {{distributed throughout the}} North Atlantic Ocean, and migrate considerable distances between offshore feeding areas and shallow inshore spawning areas. In July 2006, {{a study on the}} movements of female <b>lumpsucker</b> during the spawning period was carried out in Øksfjord, Northern Norway. Twenty fish (mean body mass 3. 2 kg, range 1. 5 - 4. 8 kg) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and released in the inner part of the fjord. Their distribution was subsequently recorded by 22 automatic acoustic receivers distributed throughout the study area. All the fish migrated rapidly out of the fjord. The average time of leaving the fjord (17 km from the release site) was three days, and within one week after release all the fish had left the fjord. The fish did not return to Øksfjord within the nearly three-month study period. These results indicate that female <b>lumpsucker</b> stay in the fjord only for a short time during the spawning season, and that they depart the spawning ground immediately or a few days after spawning. The tagged females were likely {{in the beginning of the}} spawning period when they were tagged, based on 1) the mass/length relationship of the tagged females, 2) the fact that eggs could be seen when implanting the transmitters, and 3) because 18 out of 19 females (95 %) caught at the same time and sites as the tagged fish had large egg masses. We suggest that the tagged females, when they left the study area in Øksfjord, either left inshore areas migrating back to the ocean because they had finished spawning, or that they continued the spawning, but moved to new fjord systems in search for new males. Whether individual females visit several fjords during the spawning period and search for males over a relatively large area should be addressed in future studies of this species. The female <b>lumpsucker</b> in this study were actively swimming, and often did so against the tidal current. There were no indications that female <b>lumpsucker</b> were passively drifting with the currents, or that they used the tidal current actively to move out of the fjord. The fish were, on average, moving a minimum of 0. 72 km per hour relative to the ground during the study. Such extensive movements might make these females highly vulnerable to exploitation by passive gears used in the commercial fishery. During the outward migration, 75 % of the fish were recorded close to salmon farms. However, the tagged fish left the fjord without staying for extended periods around the fish farms (the longest stay being 5. 8 hours), and therefore did not seem to be specifically attracted by the fish farms. Based on these results, female <b>lumpsucker</b> seemed to have limited potential to act as vectors for transmission of parasites and diseases between aquaculture farms and wild fish. Previous studies have shown that <b>lumpsucker</b> is among one of the most preferred hosts of the sea louse Caligus elongatus.
