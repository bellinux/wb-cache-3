The book details the period in Nicholas and Jane’s life when they take over a new parish in an (anonymous) English village and encounter the widower Fabian Driver, who Jane decides will make an excellent husband for Prudence. Prudence has an imponderable attraction to her older and completely impervious employer, the head of an unspecified academic foundation.

50|$|Two common {{situations}} {{which can}} lead to underemployment are immigrants and new graduates. When highly trained immigrants arrive in a country, their foreign credentials may not be recognized or accepted in their new country, or they may have to do a lengthy or costly re-credentialing process. As a result, when doctors or engineers from other countries immigrate, they may be unable to work in their profession, and they may have to seek menial work. New graduates may also face underemployment, because even though they have completed the technical training for a given field for which there is a good job market, they lack experience. So a recent graduate with a master's degree in accounting or business administration may have to work in a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job</b> as a barista or store clerk-jobs which do not require a university degree-until they are able to find work in their professional field.|$|E
30|$|Wage {{subsidies}} aim at complementing low incomes with an income-contingent {{wage subsidy}} {{to improve the}} financial incentives to accept a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job.</b> There are currently several forms of wage subsidies in Germany, e.g. top-up payments for recipients of unemployment compensation or the partial or full exemption of social contributions {{up to a certain}} threshold. We analyze a specific wage subsidy, the so-called ‘employment bonus’, which does not subsidize low wage incomes but low hourly wages and is related to individual but not household income. This avoids negative labor supply incentives for secondary earners.|$|E

40|$|We model {{transitions}} between unemployment, low-paid and high-paid {{employment by}} British men using a first order Markov model with endogenous switching that also {{takes into account}} the endogeneity of initial conditions, selection into employment, and sample attrition. Our estimates indicate that all three selectivity issues are non-ignorable. We demonstrate several interrelationships between the dynamics of (un) employment and low-paid work between one year and the next, represented by forms of (cross-) state dependence. Controlling for heterogeneity, the probability of a man having a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job</b> in one year depends not only whether he had a job a year before but also whether that job was low paid. The probability of his being employed at all depends on whether he had a job the previous year...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how {{the effects}} of low-wage {{employment}} and non-employment on wage prospects vary depending on qualification. We apply dynamic multinomial logit models with random effects and include interactions of the lagged labor market state with qualification to estimate heterogeneity in state dependence. We find that low-wage jobs are stepping stones to high-paid jobs for low qualified workers. In contrast, the chances of workers with a university degree to obtain a high-paid job are the same when being low-paid or non-employed (whereas their risk of non-employment is lower when having a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job).</b> Furthermore, our results suggest that for workers with university degree low-wage jobs are associated with negative signals.

30|$|Using German SOEP data, 1999 – 2009, {{this study}} {{analyzes}} state dependence in low-wage employment of western German women, where we distinguish between full-time and part-time working. We estimate a dynamic multinomial logit model with random effects {{and find that}} having a low-wage job – compared to having a high-wage job – ceteris paribus decreases the probability of being high-paid in the future. This negative effect is significantly larger for part-time jobs than for full-time jobs. We find mixed evidence for a low-pay-no-pay cycle: compared to being high-paid, having a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job</b> {{increases the risk of}} being unemployed in the next period only for part-time workers. However, concerning future wage prospects low-paid women are clearly better off than unemployed or inactive women.

30|$|For {{various reasons}} we {{restrict}} our analysis to full-time employees.

Moreover, precise working hours of part-time workers are not available in our data set (there are just two crude categories: part-time work in general and part-time work with less than   18 working hours), {{which would make it}} extremely difficult to classify them as low-paid or high-paid. To focus on the core group of the labour market and to minimize transitions into retirement, we exclude trainees, interns, working students, retired persons and persons younger than   15 or older than   57 years in 1998. Furthermore, we do not consider observations with implausible information on wages. 5 Since our administrative dataset is highly reliable, this problem affects only about   4 % of full-time employees.|$|E

30|$|While the {{existence}} of state dependence has been found before (see e.g. Uhlendorff (2006) for men or Knabe and Plum (2013) {{for men and women}} for Germany), we are the first to distinguish further between full-time and part-time employment by allowing that unobserved characteristics have different effects on the probabilities of working full-time and part-time. We find that the effects differ between the two working-time categories. This suggests that it may be worthwhile to investigate this heterogeneity more deeply. It might also be interesting to see whether taking up a low-wage job is more appropriate for long-term than for short-term unemployed individuals. In addition, the effect of a low-wage job might also depend on its duration. Knabe and Plum (2013) use dynamic panel data models and show that taking up a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job</b> is most appropiate for long-term unemployed individuals. A further step to take the duration of (un-)employment episodes into account will be to use administrative data with daily information and to apply multivariate duration models.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, state {{dependence}} regarding {{labor market}} transitions between low-wage employment, high-wage employment and unemployment has been analyzed by Stewart (2007) for the UK and by Buddelmeyer et al. (2010) for Australia, using panel data models with lagged dependent variables. While Stewart (2007) finds that low-wage earners incur the same unemployment risk as unemployed persons, Buddelmeyer et al. (2010) show that low-wage employment is associated for men with weak, but {{for women with}} considerable scarring effects. Clark and Kanellopoulos (2013) find positive, statistically significant state dependence in low pay for male workers {{in each of the}} twelve European countries under inverstigation. Uhlendorff (2006) analyzes German SOEP-data and shows that for men low-wage jobs are stepping stones to high-paid jobs. Also using SOEP-data, Knabe and Plum (2013) analyze labor market transitions of women and men and find that taking up a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job</b> is especially appropriate for less-skilled persons and those with longer unemployment durations. The former result has also been found by Mosthaf (2014) with German administrative data for men working full-time.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, we do {{find some}} {{evidence}} for a low-pay-no-pay cycle: compared to being high-paid and working part-time, having a low-paid part-time job does ceteris paribus {{increase the risk of}} being unemployed in the next period, while the effect is insignificant for full-time workers. However, concerning future wage and employment prospects, low-paid women are clearly better off than unemployed or inactive women. Compared to being low-paid, being unemployed or inactive leads to a higher probability of becoming unemployed or inactive again and – compared in particular to full-time low-wage earners – to a stronger decline in the probability of getting a high-paid job. In consideration of this evidence, we argue that for women low-wage jobs can serve as stepping stones out of unemployment and are to be preferred to staying unemployed and waiting for a better job. To paraphrase Layard et al. (1991, p. 249) and to contradict them: While having a <b>low-paid</b> <b>job</b> may be a bad signal, being unemployed seems to be a worse one. This may justify policies which induce women to accept low-wage jobs.|$|E
