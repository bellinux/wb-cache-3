5000|$|The musical {{scores to}} several operas by the French {{composer}} Jean-Philippe Rameau have been lost. They include two major tragédies en musique, Samson and Linus, and a one-act pastoral opera Lisis et Délie. The music to these pieces was substantially complete and {{was performed in}} rehearsal but for various reasons - including censorship {{in the case of}} Samson - they were never publicly staged. Rameau also wrote a divertissement for Alexis Piron's play <b>Les</b> <b>courses</b> de Tempé, which did appear at the theatre in 1734. The music to all these works has been almost completely lost, although there is evidence Rameau reused some of it in his later operas. Rameau also began other operatic projects, which were either abandoned at an early stage (Pandore) or broken up to form shorter works (Les beaux jours de l'Amour).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe blind {{beating the}} pig. Rite, {{disability}} and urban {{society in the}} late Middle AgesIn Lübeck, Stralsund, Paris, Bruges, Arnhem, Ypres, Dordrecht, Speyer, Zwickau, Heidelberg, Cologne and most certainly many more cities, a rather strange game {{took place in the}} late Middle Ages. A few blind men were placed in an enclosure with a pig. Each of them had a stick, with which they had to beat the animal to death; the winner took the carcass. Yet in the hustle they would hit each other more than the pig, much to the delight of the crowd. This cruel custom is not unknown. Since the Renaissance, it has been the topic of several literary texts and works of graphic arts. Some euphemized forms of the game (no killing, non-impaired participants with a blindfold) exist to this day. Moreover, several historical studies have addressed it in the past several years; most of them insist upon the cruelty of laughs, mocking and stigmati­zing visually impaired persons in the late Middle Ages. Yet the disability studies teach us that disability is a social and cultural construction, so that one should not interpret this “game” outside of the context that produced it. There are several possible ways of understanding it. On the one hand, this game {{can be seen as a}} catharsis in which the blind are to be seen above all as beggars: the poor, particularly beggars, were subjected to a strong social control in late medieval towns. By mocking the blind and inflicting violence upon them, the townfolks disciplined them. At the same time, it functioned as a means of exorcising the fear that was caused by their disability. On the other hand, the choice of a pig as the blind men’s adversary, which has been largely neglected by the scholars so far, is not indifferent, for this animal functions as a perfect double of the blind, both in theology and in the medieval ima­ginaire. Pigs were often associated with the devil or the sins. Thus one can understand why several exempla, for instance by Jacques de Vitry, use the game as a metaphor for mankind’s struggle with sin, while others compare the pig in the game with a bad preacher misleading the faithful. Finally, the game has to be interpreted in the context of urban political communication, as it was always organized by the city authorities. Several features of the show are similar to those of other urban games from the same era, in particular the ones taking place during Carnival: the inversion – here the weak imitating the strong – or the parody (cf. the numerous parodies of tournaments). It can then be compared to other shows like the prostitutes’ races that both humiliated their participants and gave them a function – that of mocking the enemy or, in other cases, the authorities. In the end, the polysemy of this game, which is typical for medieval rites, reflects the ambivalent position of (visually) impaired people in medieval so­ciety: their liminality. Dans certaines villes, en particulier en Flandre ou aux alentours, se tint à la fin du Moyen Âge un jeu bien particulier, où quelques aveugles étaient placés dans un enclos avec un cochon. Armés de bâtons, ils devaient frapper à mort la bête, dont la dépouille revenait en prix à celui qui l’aurait tuée. Dans l’agitation du combat, les pauvres hommes se frappaient autant les uns les autres qu’ils n’atteignaient l’animal, au grand plaisir du public nombreux. Ce divertissement est cruel et horrible. Mais les travaux des disability studies apprennent à concevoir le handicap comme une construction socio-culturelle. Il importe donc de ne pas interpréter ce jeu hors du contexte dont il était issu, et plusieurs lectures en sont alors possibles. La première est de le comprendre comme un rite cathartique où les aveugles sont d’abord des mendiants, qui faisaient l’objet d’un fort contrôle social. En se moquant d’eux et en leur infligeant une telle violence, la société urbaine les disciplinait tout en exorcisant la peur que lui inspirait leur handicap. D’autre part, le choix du cochon, animal souvent associé au mal ou au péché, comme adversaire des aveugles est tout sauf anodin, le porc faisant fonction de double de l’aveugle. Dans plusieurs exempla, le jeu est évoqué comme métaphore du combat entre les hommes et le péché; les aveugles sont également parfois assimilés aux mauvais prédicateurs. Enfin, ce spectacle s’insère dans la communication politique des autorités urbaines; on peut le voir comme une parodie de tournoi, avec une inversion (les faibles jouant les forts) typique du carnaval. Il peut alors être comparé à d’autres jeux comme <b>les</b> <b>courses</b> de prostituées, qui servaient à ridiculiser les ennemis. Finalement, la polysémie du jeu, caractéristique des rites médiévaux, reflète la position liminale des aveugles dans la société urbaine de la fin du Moyen Âge...|$|E

Nearly three years of continuous measurements of meteorological factors, surface water and energy fluxes, soil water content, and groundwater table were carried out over a riparian Tamarix spp. stand in the lower Tarim River basin. Because of scarce precipitation and low air humidity, the diurnal and seasonal variations of most meteorological factors exhibited simple unimodal dynamics. However, the seasonal variation of latent heat exchange (LE) was distinctly related to plant phenology. The sensible heat exchange (H) exhibited reverse <b>course</b> with the <b>LE</b> seasonal <b>course,</b> which suggested seasonal variation of the H was controlled by the <b>LE</b> <b>course.</b> In the daytime, a good linear relationship existed between evapotranspiration (ET) and reference evapotranspiration. The yearly ET over the tamarisk stand was approximately 500 mmyear− 1, and the mean daily ET is about 3. 85 mmd− 1 in a vibrant growing season. The groundwater table and the soil water content (SWC) near the groundwater table exhibited obvious seasonal and diurnal variations in the growing seasons but SWC in the shallow soil layer did not, suggesting the groundwater was the water source of the tamarisk. Our analysis indicated that under a hyper-arid climate, the energy and water exchanges over riparian tamarisk stands in the lower Tarim River basin showed certain features: (1) plant transpiration accounted {{for most of the}} surface ET, with soil evaporation weak and negligible; (2) the seasonal processes of surface energy and water exchanges were highly related with plant phenology; (3) the diurnal processes of ET resulted from the comprehensive effects of all atmospheric factors; and (4) ET depends on groundwater, rather than precipitation...|$|R
