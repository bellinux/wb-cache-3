40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{describes}} macroscopic {{fatigue damage}} in carbon black-filled natural rubber (CB-NR) under uniaxial <b>loading</b> <b>conditions.</b> Uniaxial tension-compression, fully relaxing uniaxial tension and non-relaxing uniaxial tension <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> were applied until sample failure. Results, summarized in a Haigh-like diagram, show {{that only one}} type of fatigue damage is observed for uniaxial tension-compression and fully relaxing uniaxial tension <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> and that several different types of fatigue damage take place in non-relaxing uniaxial tension <b>loading</b> <b>conditions.</b> The different damage types observed under non-relaxing uniaxial tension, <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> {{are closely related to}} the improvement of rubber fatigue life.

Multiaxial low-cycle fatigue strength under 90 ° out-of-phase <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> is significantly reduced for both base-metal and welded-metal specimens. The weldment has lower fatigue life than the base metal under the given <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the fatigue life reduction of weldment increases with the increasing strain amplitude.

40|$|Technical {{components}} {{are subjected to}} cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> that can be arbitrarily complex in the most general case. For analytical fatigue strength verifications in the finite life regime both the uniaxial material characteristics by means of Wöhler curves {{as well as a}} representative equivalent fatigue damage parameter (FDP) for multiaxial cyclic loadings have to be determined. For simple <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> the fatigue assessment can be performed using well-known and verified strength hypotheses for quasi-static <b>loading</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, for complex non-proportional cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> with rotating principle stress directions the application of these hypotheses is not sufficiently verified. Hence, advanced stress, strain or energy based strength hypotheses in critical plane formulation are used. These hypotheses require considerable numerical efforts. The fatigue concept (MPA AIM-Life) enables an assessment of complex fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> with different advanced strength hypotheses. An interface to the finite element code ABAQUS allows the fatigue assessment of complex component geometries. Based on fatigue tests of specimens made from ferritic and austenitic materials under uniaxial and multiaxial <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> (tension/torsion) the accuracy of different strength hypotheses is demonstrated. Therefore the fatigue analysis assessment included in codes and standards is compared to different advanced fatigue damage parameters.

In the concentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition</b> A 2 and A 4 ruptures as well as alternative events such as fracture of a phalanx or avulsion of the flexor tendons were almost equally distributed, whereas the A 2 pulley rupture was the most common event (59 %) in the eccentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition</b> and alternative events were rare (23. 5 %). The forces in the deep flexor tendon, the fingertip and in the pulleys were significantly lower in the eccentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition.</b> As the ruptures occurred at lower loads in the eccentric than in the concentric <b>loading</b> <b>condition</b> it can be concluded that friction may be an advantage for climbers, supporting the holding force of their flexor muscles but may also increase the susceptibility to injury...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study on the {{uncertainties}} in assessing <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> of handy size bulk carriers. <b>Loading</b> <b>conditions</b> and the corresponding hull girder still-water loads are important for the safety of bulk carriers. Unfortunately, statistical studies on this topic remain very few, partly because of the difficulty in fully understanding the impact of loading/unloading operation process and partly because of intrinsic uncertainties in measuring cargo <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> data. Three handy-size bulk carriers were investigated and their actual <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> spanning several voyages in 22 months, were collected. Statistical analyses of the collected data resulted in an estimate of the uncertainties in the loading/unloading process. Based on these analyses, probability distribution models for weights in cargo holds, water ballast tanks, fuel tanks as well as consumable tanks are proposed best fitting the collected data; hull girder still water loads statistical distributions are also obtained. It is expected that these analytical models can be used in structural reliability analyses that require the definition of uncertainties of <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> and of resulting still water loads...|$|R

5000|$|From the {{perspective}} of perceptual load theory stimulus variation means whether the stimulus has high or low perceptual load. Perceptual load refers {{to the complexity of}} the physical stimuli, particularly the distractor stimuli e.g. a square surrounded by circles is a scene with low perceptual load whereas a square surrounded by lots of different shapes has high perceptual load. Due to the assumed limited capacity of attentional resources and that distractors have to be processed before the target it is suggested that, in high load tasks the targets attentional resources are depleted faster therefore being able to attend to the target sooner compared to a low load task. This is because the low load task needs to process more of the distractors to exhaust mental resources, therefore the distractors cause a greater inference in finding the target. This demonstrates that selection occurs both {{in the early stages of}} processing (high <b>load</b> <b>condition)</b> when the degree of inference is low as the majority of the resources process the target and enables the individual to ignore distractors. As well as the late stages (low <b>load</b> <b>condition)</b> when the distractors are perceived because they take up fewer attentional resources and as such spill over to the distractors which results in them being perceived, causing an interference.|$|E

Also, an FPP is typically {{more efficient than}} a VPP for a single specific rotational speed and <b>load</b> <b>condition.</b> Accordingly, vessels that normally operate at a standard speed (such as large bulk carriers, tankers and container ships) will have an FPP optimized for that speed. At the other extreme, a canal narrowboat will have a FPP for two reasons: speed is limited to 4 mph (to protect the canal bank), and the propeller needs to be robust (when encountering underwater obstacles).|$|E
