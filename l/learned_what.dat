5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt {{that he did not}} have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> had happened to the first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E

25|$|It was Pearse who, {{on behalf}} of the IRB shortly before Easter in 1916, issued the orders to all Volunteer units {{throughout}} the country for three days of manoeuvres beginning Easter Sunday, which was the signal for a general uprising. When Eoin MacNeill, the Chief of Staff of the Volunteers, <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> was being planned without the promised arms from Germany, he countermanded the orders via newspaper, causing the IRB to issue a last-minute order to go through with the plan the following day, greatly limiting the numbers who turned out for the rising.|$|E
25|$|Lepuropetalon was {{mentioned}} {{in several other}} publications in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but it remained little known and it was seldom collected for herbaria. There are about 90 known collections of it before 1970. In the 1970s, interest in Lepuropetalon increased and by 1987, when Ward and Gholson wrote of it, there had been 263 collections. Collectors at that time observed that once one <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> sort of areas to look in, Lepuropetalon was easily found. Ward and Gholson provide a detailed map of its distribution in the United States.|$|E

The plan was to secure the barracks and gain possession of the weapons stored within, {{and to use the}} building's army communications equipment to spread false messages for several hours to confuse the military. In the meantime, the weapons would be removed and hidden throughout the city to use in the continuing struggle, and Santiago's radio station would be taken to broadcast the speeches of Eduardo Chibás, in order to mobilize the public with the ultimate aim of bringing down the Batista government.|$|E
25|$|Nations do not {{necessarily}} need wealth to gain health. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. It reduced it to 0.5–0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.6% today while spending less each year on maternal health because it <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> worked and what did not.

25|$|However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet {{ratified}} the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It was now {{apparent that the}} momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped. Shortly after the RSFSR {{ratified the}} Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside. On 17 December, he accepted the fait accompli and reluctantly agreed with Yeltsin to dissolve the Soviet Union. Four days later, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics—all except Georgia (the Baltic states had already seceded in August)—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which formally established the CIS. They also preemptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. When Gorbachev <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> had transpired, he told CBS that he would resign {{as soon as he}} saw that the CIS was indeed a reality.|$|E

After placing first, he lied about his marriage and became the emperor’s new brother-in-law. Years later, a famine forced Qin and her children {{to move to the}} capital, where they <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> happened to Chen. Qin finally found a way to meet Chen and begged him to help at least his own children. Not only did Chen refuse, he sent his servant Han Qi to kill them to hide his secret, but Han helped the family escape and killed himself. Desperate, Qin brought her case to Bao Zheng, who tricked Chen to the court to have him arrested. The imperial family intervened with threats, but Bao executed him nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|Around 1981 his {{scheme was}} {{discovered}} when suspicious regulators {{wrote to the}} vehicles' previous owners, whose addresses were on the dealer's applications, and <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> the odometers had {{said at the time}} of sale. He was arrested by federal authorities and indicted on 12 counts of mail fraud, a felony, for cars he had sold to five different dealers, some as many as five times over a two-year period. At his trial, presided over by district judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, he admitted that he had rolled back the odometers, but denied that he had committed mail fraud since the dealers had sent the applications after they had bought the cars from him, therefore it wasn't necessary that they do so for him to have realized the proceeds of the odometer tampering. Before his trial in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, his attorney, Peter Lewis Steinberg, moved that the jury be instructed that they could convict Schmuck on the lesser included charge of odometer tampering, at the time a misdemeanor, if they did not feel his actions constituted mail fraud.|$|E
25|$|With {{the painter}} Ary Scheffer, {{a friend of}} Louis-Philippe, he rode on horseback {{immediately}} to the Duke's residence in Neuilly, but found that the Duke had left and was in hiding at another chateau in Raincy. Thiers talked instead to the Duke's wife, Marie-Amélie, and sister-in-law, Madame Adelaide. Thiers explained that they wanted a representative monarchy and a new dynasty, and that everyone knew that Louis-Philippe was not ambitious and had not sought the crown for himself. Madame Adelaide agreed to take the proposition to the Duke. The Duke returned to Neuilly at ten {{in the evening and}} <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> had happened from his wife. He put on a tricolor ribbon, the symbol of the opposition, and rode to the Palais-Royal, where Thiers, the Marquis de Lafayette and Jacques Laffitte were waiting. Together, they persuaded him to take the throne and discussed how it would be done. That afternoon, they rode to the Hotel de Ville. Louis-Phiiippe, wrapped in a tricolor flag, was presented to the huge and cheering crowd in front of the Hotel de VIlle by LaFayette. King Charles X withdrew his proposed new government and offered to negotiate, but it was too late. He and his son departed the Chateau of Saint-Cloud and left France for exile in England.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} past, {{there was a}} hero named Hou Yi who was {{excellent}} at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi {{did not want to}} leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and <b>learned</b> <b>what</b> had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.|$|E
