5|$|Early in September 1990, Vietnamese Prime Minister Đỗ Mười, General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh {{and former}} Prime Minister Pham Van Dong {{travelled}} to Chengdu, China, where {{they held a}} secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin. On 17 September 1990, General Võ Nguyên Giáp also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance. Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt travelled to Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart, <b>Li</b> <b>Peng,</b> and they issued an 11-point communiqué re-establishing diplomatic ties {{between the two countries}} after 10 years without formal relations.|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI. Although the main petition office is the Complaints Office, petitions are usually sent to other offices and institutions (such as the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, the National People's Congress and party leadership {{as high as the}} PSC) as well. Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout the country). In a case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin, <b>Li</b> <b>Peng,</b> Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E
25|$|Zhao's {{departure}} to North Korea left <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> as {{the acting}} executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing and mayor Chen Xitong {{to gauge the}} situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis, and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken. On the morning of April 25, President Yang Shangkun and Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations. The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials {{in an effort to}} mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.|$|E
5000|$|On June 3, 1989 an [...] "Emergency Mobilization Order" [...] {{was issued}} {{in the name}} of the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters. The [...] "Emergency Mobilization Order" [...] reaffirmed the idea of [...] "Overthrowing the <b>Li</b> <b>Peng's</b> Government" [...] and they wanted Chinese people to always {{remember}} the behavior of <b>Li</b> <b>Peng's</b> government. And they were hoping the army would choose the student side rather than the [...] "Fake Government's" [...] side.|$|R

25|$|Security {{cordoned off}} the east {{entrance}} to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students knelt {{on the steps of}} the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng.</b> However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.|$|E
50|$|In December 1998, {{at the end}} of Prime Minister <b>Li</b> <b>Peng’s</b> {{visit to}} Moscow, Russia and China issued a joint communique {{pledging}} to build an ‘equal and reliable partnership’. This reinforced the Sino-Russian views that the United States was their main competitor in the global political scene.|$|R
30|$|By {{the idea}} of Shen [1], Guo, <b>Li,</b> and <b>Peng</b> [9] {{obtained}} a regularity estimate of the kernel R_L and proved the commutators [b, R_L] are bounded on some Lebesgue spaces L^p with b∈BMO(R^n). For b∈BMO_∞(ρ), Bongioanni, Harboure, and Salinas [14] proved the L^p-boundedness of [b, R_L]. Recall that BMO(R^n)⊂BMO_σ(ρ). Hence the result of Bongioanni, Harboure, and Salinas [14] generalizes that of Guo, <b>Li,</b> and <b>Peng</b> [9].|$|R
30|$|Mean-field BSDEs are deduced by Buckdahn, Djehiche, <b>Li</b> and <b>Peng</b> [14] {{when they}} studied a special mean-field {{problem with a}} purely {{stochastic}} method. Later, Buckdahn, <b>Li</b> and <b>Peng</b> [15] investigated the properties of these equations in a Markovian framework, obtained {{the uniqueness of the}} solutions of mean-field BSDEs as well as the comparison theorem and also gave the viscosity solutions of a class of McKean-Vlasov PDEs in terms of mean-field BSDEs.|$|R
25|$|What {{motivated}} Zhao remains, even today, a {{topic of}} debate by many. Some say {{he went into the}} square hoping a conciliatory gesture would gain him leverage against hard-liners like Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng.</b> Others believe he supported the protesters {{and did not want to}} see them hurt when the military was called in. After the incident, Zhao was placed under indefinite house arrest.|$|E
25|$|Though {{martial law}} was {{scheduled}} for May 21, news of the impending order was leaked to the public, so the timetable was moved up. Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> hastily announced martial law {{in the early morning}} hours of May 20. The order, declared pursuant to Article 89, Section 16 of the PRC Constitution, was to come into effect at 10:00 am in eight urban districts of Beijing.|$|E
25|$|His {{economic}} reform policies and sympathies with student demonstrators during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 placed him {{at odds with}} {{some members of the}} party leadership, including Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng,</b> former President Li Xiannian and Party elder Chen Yun. Zhao also began to lose favour with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In the aftermath of the events, Zhao was purged politically and effectively placed under house arrest for the next 15 years.|$|E
40|$|Improvement and {{straightening}} out" and deepening {{the reform}} {{is the correct}} economic policy formulated by the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee last year {{in view of the}} prevailing political and economic situation. The policy has been approved by the National People's Congress (NPC). At the NPC session discussing Comrade <b>Li</b> <b>Peng's</b> report on the work of the government, there were only two dissenting votes and four abstentions, showing {{that the majority of the}} congress deputies supported this central policy. ...|$|R

For b∈BMO(R^n), the L^p-boundedness of [b, T_i], i= 1, 2 {{have been}} {{obtained}} by Guo, <b>Li,</b> and <b>Peng</b> [9], respectively. See Theorem  1 in [9]. In this paper, we assume that b∈BMO_σ(ρ), which is larger than BMO(R^n). Hence our results cover those of Guo, <b>Li,</b> and <b>Peng</b> [9]. On the other hand, the boundedness of [b, T_β] on Herz spaces are new even for the case b∈BMO(R^n).|$|R
25|$|In 2010, Li's autobiographical work, The Critical Moment – <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> Diaries, was {{published}} by New Century Press. The Critical Moment covered Li's activities {{during the period of}} the Tiananmen Square protests, and {{was published}} on the protests' twenty-first anniversary. The Critical Moment was characterized by reviewers as largely an attempt to minimize Li's culpability during the most egregious stages of the crackdown; some also say he attempted to shift blame to Deng. He reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on October 18, 2017.|$|E
25|$|After Zhao became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, his {{proposals}} in May 1988 to expand free enterprise led to popular complaints (which some suggest were politically inspired) about inflation fears. Public {{fears about the}} negative effects of market reforms gave conservatives (including <b>Li</b> <b>Peng)</b> the opening to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influences, especially opposing further expansion of Zhao's more free enterprise-oriented approach. This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988–1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, the divisions intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng.</b> Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.|$|E
50|$|After his retirement, Ford lectured {{in support}} of the Tibetan Government in Exile in various {{countries}} (the UK, other European countries, Australia and the United States). In 1992, he undertook a countrywide lecture tour in India, {{at the request of the}} Dalai Lama. However, the tour was brought to an abrupt end when Ford was put under house arrest in Dharamsala by the Indian authorities as the lectures coincided with Chinese Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng's</b> official visit to India. Ford had to return to Britain earlier than expected.|$|R
50|$|Student representatives {{expected}} {{to hold a}} substantive dialogue where the government and students were considered equals. They wanted to have an open discussion of issues {{with the government and}} come up with resolutions. The course of the dialogue made it clear, however, that <b>Li</b> <b>Peng’s</b> main objective was convincing the students to end the hunger strike. The meeting ended as students saw that they held a subordinate position. It was evident to them that the government would not compromise or meet any of their demands.|$|R

25|$|There was a {{significant}} impact on the Chinese economy after the incident. Foreign loans to China were suspended by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and foreign governments; tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2billion to US$1.8billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled and there was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10 year decline. Chinese Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> visited the United Nations Security Council on January 31, 1992, and argued that the economic and arms embargoes on China were a violation of national sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Policy {{planners}} {{debated the}} necessity and economic viability of high-speed rail service. Supporters argued that high-speed rail would boost future economic growth. Opponents noted that high-speed rail {{in other countries}} were expensive and mostly unprofitable. Overcrowding on existing rail lines, they said, could be solved by expanding capacity through higher speed and frequency of service. In 1995, Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> announced that preparatory work on the Beijing Shanghai HSR would begin in the 9th Five Year Plan (1996–2000), but construction was not scheduled until {{the first decade of}} the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|During {{his term}} as a minister, Luo had {{developed}} {{a close relationship with}} <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> came to be considered one of Li's protégés. Luo was appointed a State Councilor, a position with equivalent rank but slightly lesser responsibility compared as a Vice-Premier, in 1993. He served in the position until 2003. In September 1997 at the 15th Party Congress, Luo advanced further, being named a Secretary of the Central Secretariat, the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei), {{and a member of the}} 15th Politburo of the Communist Party of China, joining the inner sanctum of party leaders.|$|E
50|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Deng Xiaoping, always an {{opponent}} of lifetime tenure in office, gradually convinced most of the party elders to retire. Li stepped down as President in 1988 and was succeeded by Yang Shangkun. Li was then named Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He was {{a strong supporter of}} Jiang Zemin's rise to power, and during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Li was one of the hardline Party elders who pushed for a strong response to the demonstrations and supported Premier <b>Li</b> <b>Peng's</b> desire to use military force to suppress the protests. Li continued to serve in government until his death in 1992.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his {{political}} swan song. He was accompanied by Wen Jiabao. <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike. He told the students {{that they were still}} young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.|$|E
25|$|During {{the speech}} former General {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin seemed very tired, was constantly yawning, {{and was not}} paying much attention. Jiang seldom talked to Wen Jiabao, who was sitting to his left. Wen was paying full attention to Hu's speech for its entire length. Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, {{and that no one}} came up to shake his. Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate. All the surviving members of the 14th and 15th PSC's were present, including former Premiers <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> and Zhu Rongji, but with the exception of Jiang rival Qiao Shi.|$|E
25|$|The {{hunger strike}} {{galvanized}} {{support for the}} students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents {{from all walks of}} life demonstrated in solidarity on 17–18 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials. Many grassroots Party and Youth League organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate. In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to <b>Li</b> <b>Peng</b> in support of students. The Chinese Red Cross issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of Mikhail Gorbachev, many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.|$|E
