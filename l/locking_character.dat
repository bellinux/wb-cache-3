50|$|Another {{big change}} hit {{the game in}} version 0.4 with the {{addition}} of a level system, <b>locked</b> <b>characters</b> and ingame accounts to record players unlocked characters and levels.Levels were first capped at 10, but with every new stage, the cap is increased by 2. <b>Locked</b> <b>characters</b> are unlocked by completing stages.|$|R
5000|$|... 15 Storeys High would {{transfer}} to television after two radio series, with <b>Lock's</b> <b>character</b> renamed 'Vince', {{for a further}} two series in 2002 and 2004.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A running gag in {{the episode}} shows {{different}} <b>characters</b> <b>locking</b> other <b>characters</b> in a men's room to bully them, including ultimately, Jesus.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, 15 Storeys High {{was made}} into a {{television}} show which ran for two series, each series consisting of six half-hour episodes. In the television series, <b>Lock's</b> <b>character</b> was named Vince (he was simply Sean Lock in the radio series). Vince's flatmate Errol Spears was played by Benedict Wong. The TV shows were not recorded with a live audience.|$|R
5000|$|... 15 Minutes of Misery {{lasted for}} one series of six {{programmes}} in late 1998 and early 1999, and {{would later be}} expanded into the half-hour series 15 Storeys High. From ostensibly the same tower block, <b>Lock's</b> <b>character</b> was now given a flatmate (the hapless Errol) and {{a job at the}} local swimming baths, as well as a somewhat dour and intolerant demeanour.|$|R
50|$|There's no {{specific}} <b>Locking</b> Shift <b>Character</b> Set for the Spanish language. Uses the default Basic Character Set.|$|R
50|$|Another {{addition}} is {{the lock}} on mechanic, which keeps the <b>locked</b> on <b>character</b> {{in front of the}} player. While it doesn't center the enemy in front of weapon firing reticules, it does keep the character on the screen until either the player unlocks them, kills or is killed by them, or the <b>locked</b> on <b>character</b> is out of line of sight. This mechanic helps alleviate the imprecision of analog sticks on the console, as opposed to using a mouse and keyboard on the PC platform, especially when circle strafing; and to make melee attacks easier to control.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the player}} disposes of six fictional racers {{displayed}} {{at the top of}} a mountain once single player mode is selected from the main menu of the game, by pressing the select button over a unlocked racer additional info of the racer will be displayed and by pressing the select button over a <b>locked</b> <b>character</b> which is represented by a statue, valuable info on how to unlock the same will be displayed such as a specific career to finish. In addition to two other fictional racers, players can also unlock professional biking racers like Eric Carter and Tara Llanes when specific tournaments are finished during gameplay.|$|R

50|$|Lecavalier became <b>Lock's</b> main <b>character</b> and {{inspiration}} {{in his company}} La La La Human Steps. With her mane of platinum dreadlocks, her physical power and her mastery of the full-body barrel jump, {{which looks like a}} horizontal pirouette, her image was a signature for the company. She was the embodiment of Lock's frenetic and technically challenging androgynous aesthetic in works such as Human Sex (1985) and Infante, c'est destroy (1991).|$|R
50|$|Her second film {{role was}} in 1952's Jumping Jacks, which also starred Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. She next portrayed an agoraphobic <b>character</b> <b>locked</b> up in a reform school for rich-girl delinquents in the 1953 film, Problem Girls, {{starring}} Susan Morrow.|$|R
50|$|In August 2016, Bishop {{starred in}} the revival of classic 1970s BBC sitcom Porridge. He {{played the role of}} Fletch, {{grandson}} of Ronnie Barker's original main <b>character,</b> <b>locked</b> up for cyber-crime. Originally a one-off, the show was commissioned to full series in October.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Locks</b> {{describes}} the <b>character</b> of Uncle Alexander as an [...] "atavistic amalgamation of various icons of British gentlemen" [...] - {{among them the}} [...] "chivalrous knight", whose moral code he inverts through the planned sacrifice of his niece and the actual sacrifice of his wife.|$|R
50|$|The MMC2 is {{only used}} in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! and the later rerelease which {{replaced}} Mike Tyson. A single 8KB bank of program ROM can be selected (with the remaining 24KB <b>locked)</b> and <b>character</b> ROM can be selected in {{two pairs of}} 4KB banks, which would be automatically switched when the video hardware attempts to load particular graphic tiles from memory, thus allowing a larger amount of graphics to be used on the screen {{without the need for}} the game itself to manually switch them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} warmly {{received}} by The New Yorker; [...] "with calm and nuanced images, Sy captures emotionally unguarded <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> in {{the gaze of}} prying eyes; with brusque, quiet action and incisive, tight-lipped dialogue, she sets a gripping plot in motion while keeping it close to the heart." ...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{it may be}} {{used for}} Arabic {{language}} as well, but the Eastern digits (encoded here in their Persian-Hindu variant) won't be used in that case because standard Arabic prefer its traditional Eastern Arabic digits, and will frequently be replaced by Western Arabic digits (encoded in the <b>locking</b> shift <b>character</b> set in column 0x30) which are also used now frequently in Urdu as well. However, in India, phones recognizing the Arabic language indication may substitute the Persian-Hindu variants of the Eastern Arabic digits by the traditional Eastern Arabic digits.|$|R
50|$|The film {{depicts the}} {{political}} continuity between wartime Nazism and post-war Europe and the psychological continuity of <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> into compulsive {{repetition of the}} past. On another level it deals with the psychological condition known as Stockholm syndrome. The movie also raises the issue of sleeper Nazi cells and their control.|$|R
5000|$|His line {{drawings}} enhance {{the mood of}} each scene, lightening it, sending up <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> in earnest or self-serving conversation, or hopelessly in love; at other times giving a darker, sinister flavour to events ... revellers disguised as politicians, celebrities and cartoon animals tumble over one another {{right out of the}} frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{player is}} on a {{treasure}} hunt, and visits five worlds to collect treasures without getting crushed by giant rocks. The <b>character</b> <b>locks</b> himself in, getting caught by enemies or {{running out of}} time. Once the required amount of treasure is collected, the player must locate and use the exit door to finish the level.|$|R
50|$|New {{styles of}} levels in The Alien Wars involve {{motorcycle}} chases, riding on missiles, and two Mode 7 enabled top-view levels. Players can carry and switch between two weapons at any time, only losing {{the one they}} are currently using if they die. They can also fire these two weapons simultaneously in a spin-jump circular fire pattern that hit enemies on all sides: however, being hit while doing so results in the player losing both of their weapons. The player can also <b>lock</b> their <b>character's</b> mobility, allowing the player to shoot at all eight possible directions (including downwards and at angles) without moving or jumping.|$|R
50|$|People in Cages {{was first}} {{published}} in Great Britain in 2002 by Hope Corner. The published play includes two other short plays by Wilson, Reflections and The Biscuit. Reflections is a collection of short monologues while The Biscuit, in common with People in Cages, features a <b>character</b> <b>locked</b> in a cage where he is tormented and finally killed by his captors.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{an original}} {{analysis of the}} incidence and influence of memory in Shakespeare's second tetralogy. It is the first full-length study of memory in Shakespeare to show not only how memories can <b>lock</b> <b>characters</b> into history but also how memories can be released from history in order to engender radically different futures. This thesis offers detailed close readings of key scenes in the second tetralogy to substantiate this argument and to illuminate afresh issues {{at the heart of}} the plays, such as identity, time and death. It builds on previous and current research on memory in Shakespeare, as well as considering how he may have engaged with original archival sources such as Petrus's 'Art of Memory' and Gratarolo's 'Castle of Memory'. The first chapter of this thesis provides an overview of Shakespeare's use of and reliance on memory in the canon, supplies a review of previous works on memory, and explains the scope and structure of the thesis. The second chapter defines terms and clarifies the method of the thesis, considers the phenomenology of memory, and elucidates the crucial concept of forward recollection. The third chapter explores how and why Shakespeare's drama is an especially apt vehicle for memory. These three chapters prepare the ground for the subsequent four chapters, which examine each of the plays in the second tetralogy in turn. The chapters on the plays focus on key aspects of memory that exemplify the wider argument of the thesis: memory and identity in Richard 11; memory and time in 1 Henry IV; memory and death in 2 Henry IV; and memory and forward recollection in Henry V. 3 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Keaton's <b>character</b> <b>locks</b> up {{the cops}} in the police station. However, the girl he is trying to woo disapproves of his {{behavior}} and gives him the cold shoulder. Therefore, he unlocks the police station and is immediately pulled in by the cops. The film ends with the title [...] "The End" [...] written on a tombstone with Keaton's pork pie hat propped on it.|$|R
50|$|Once {{there was}} a writer named Drosselmeyer, who {{had the power to}} make his stories come to life. But he died before he could finish his final tale, The Prince and The Raven, leaving the two title <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> in an eternal battle. After many years, the Raven managed to break free into the real world, and the Prince pursued him. To seal away the Raven's evil, Prince Mytho {{shattered}} his own heart with his sword, causing him to lose all his memories and emotions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inclusion}} of characters on the disc {{that can only}} be used by paying more resulted in criticism by fans and publishers as gamers would pay an additional amount of money for something that was completed before release and on disc. Capcom responded stating they intended to add the <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> in the retail versions to save hard drive space. Play UK criticized the response saying [...] "But this is absolute bollocks. Absolute shit." [...] ScrewAttack included this on their 2012 list of top ten Capcom mistakes.|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1949 a field party of the Geological Survey of Canada made a {{reconnaissance}} survey of the Labrador coastal region. In {{the course of the}} summer a section of the coast and the coastal islands between Domino Run and Hamilton Inlet were studied. Here the Labrador coast, which is relatively unexplored, was found to consist mainly of a grey granite gneiss which had been intruded by basic rocks of at least two ages. The older of the intrusive rocks are garnet-bearing and have since been found to contain well-developed reaction rims. Parts of the garnetiferous gabbro-diabase, which is the older intrusive occur as inclusions in the gneiss and the inclusions have been metamorphosed. The younger intrusives have not been altered like the older <b>locks.</b> The <b>character</b> and the origin of the garnet in the gabbro-diabase as well as {{a detailed description of the}} main rock types is proposed.

50|$|Wastelands game {{mechanics}} {{are based}} on those used in the tabletop role-playing games, such as Tunnels and Trolls and Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes created by Wasteland designers Ken St. Andre and Michael Stackpole. Characters in Wasteland have various statistics (strength, intelligence, luck, speed, agility, dexterity and charisma) that allow the characters to use different skills and weapons. Experience is gained through battle and skill usage. The game generally lets players advance {{using a variety of}} tactics: to get through a <b>locked</b> gate, the <b>characters</b> could use their picklock skill, their climb skill, or their strength attribute; or they could force the gate with a crowbar or a LAW rocket.|$|R
5000|$|When it {{was first}} released, FusionFall {{required}} a paid subscription for the full game, with a limited portion of the content available to free accounts. Free accounts could only play in the [...] "future" [...] portion of the game, which only allows players to collect four nanos and create two characters. The full game had a total of 40 nanos, 36 before the new extensions. To create up to four characters, players had to earn all 36 nanos during the beta testing. Players with characters that progressed into the past during the sneak peek or during a previous subscription had their <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> until a current subscription was purchased.|$|R
500|$|The {{player can}} play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and each {{character}} has advantages and disadvantages. For example, Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a <b>lock</b> pick. Both <b>characters</b> can equip defensive weapons {{that can save}} them from taking damage when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger and a special weapon that is exclusive to each of them: Jill can use a taser, while Chris is able to shove stun grenades into the zombies' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot. Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster.|$|R
50|$|Konami {{released}} a second portable version of Contra III in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance titled Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX, which {{was released in}} Japan as Contra: Hard Spirits (魂斗羅 ハードスピリッツ). Unlike the original Super NES game and the previous Game Boy adaptation, Contra Advance was released in Europe and Australia under the Contra name without the Probotector title and robotic characters. The designers made changes {{to many of the}} features of the original game due to the Game Boy Advance's lack of XY buttons. The mega bombs and the ability to wield two weapons were removed, but the player can now <b>lock</b> their <b>character's</b> aim like in Contra: Shattered Soldier (allowing the player to move anywhere while shooting at one direction) and is given a choice to revert to their previously held weapon when picking a new one. The top-view stages (Stage 2 and 5) from the original Super NES game were replaced with two stages from Contra: Hard Corps (the Military Train and Big Battle stages). This version only has two difficulty levels, Easy and Normal, with Easy mode cutting the game's length {{at the end of the}} fourth stage.|$|R

5000|$|Zac {{has been}} immortalized, being listed {{as one of}} the {{numerous}} men the iconic Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) romanced and is generally well regarded as a [...] "hunk" [...] and a [...] "hottie". Edward expressed his hope that the character would become one of the soap's best ever villains. Amy Usherwood (Emma Franklin) named Zac as the character besides her own whom she would enjoy playing, due to the fact: [...] "he gets to be naughty". Reviewer Dionne Christian labelled Zac: [...] "Shortland Street's resident love rat". Blogger Bridget Jones hoped {{that the end of the}} 2012 season of Shortland Street would see the end of Zac's manipulative behaviour. Zac was described by one reviewer as, [...] "one of the most manipulative creeps and terrifyingly clever assailants that Shortland Street has ever seen". The development of the character of Zac following his attack on Roimata, was named by Rebecca Barry Hill of The New Zealand Herald as a satisfying continuation of the drama brought on by the shows 20th anniversary in May. Zac's return to the soap, his love triangle between Sarah (Amanda Billing) and Vasa (Teuila Blakely), alongside his shirtless confrontation with TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) and later sexual assault of Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakere), were all named as part of the top moments of the 2012 Shortland Street season. In 2013, Zac's return was listed as the 8th best ever character return on the soap by the Shortland Street website. A reviewer from The Otago Daily Times highlighted how successful the character of Zac was and noted a surprise in the character not being like [...] "99%" [...] of the characters, in that he wasn't a doctor. He commented that the character obviously spent too much time at the gym and mentioned the increasing amount of soap opera storyline climaxes involving <b>locking</b> <b>characters</b> in cellars. However he also noted that the character of Zac was sure to be written off due to the content of his story lines. Although Edward received a fair amount of verbal abuse on the streets, he expected a more physical tone due to past experiences with Johnny Barker (Joey Henderson), whose character murdered 5 woman. Upon ending his stint, Edward acknowledged that Zac was liked by fans when he first arrived in 2012 but by the end, had become a character fans, [...] "loved to hate". In the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 awards, Zac's conclusion was voted the fans second favourite storyline and 3rd most shocking plot twist. Television New Zealand named the kidnap storyline as the second best moment of the 2013 season. In 2015 a New Zealand Herald author described Zac {{as one of the}} [...] "most evil" [...] characters in the soap's history.|$|R
25|$|Karnad {{found a new}} {{approach}} of drawing historical and mythological sources to tackle contemporary themes and existentialist crisis of modern man through <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> in psychological and philosophical conflicts. His next was Tughlaq (1964), about a rashly idealist 14th-century Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq, and allegory on the Nehruvian era which started with ambitious idealism {{and ended up in}} disillusionment. This established Karnad, now 26 years old, as a promising playwright in the country. It was staged by the National School of Drama Repertory under the direction of Ebrahim Alkazi, with the actor Manohar Singh, playing the visionary king who later becomes disillusioned and turns bitter, amidst the historic Purana Qila in Delhi. It was staged in London by the National School of Drama for the Festival of India in 1982.|$|R
5000|$|The {{episode was}} first teased by Drew Carey on July 25, 2001, during an {{interview}} with the Akron Beacon Journal's R.D. Heldenfels. Carey admitted that he was disappointed in the sixth season of The Drew Carey Show, which ended with Carey's <b>character</b> <b>locked</b> up in an asylum. Several changes and new ideas were implemented in a bid to improve the show and falling ratings ahead of the seventh season premiere in September 2001. Carey announced that the new season would open with an hour-long back-to-school episode, featuring music performances. Carey said, [...] "It's {{not going to be a}} regular show. It's going to be sketches about going back to school where we're going to play different people." [...] In the same month, Atlantic Records announced that Uncle Kracker would be appearing in the episode.|$|R
60|$|THERE is {{something}} in the character and habits of the North American savage, taken {{in connection with the}} scenery over which he is accustomed to range, its vast lakes, boundless forests, majestic rivers, and trackless plains, that is, to my mind, wonderfully striking and sublime. He is formed for the wilderness, as the Arab is for the desert. His nature is stern, simple, and enduring, fitted to grapple with difficulties and to support privations. There seems but little soil in his heart for the support of the kindly virtues; and yet, if we would but take the trouble to penetrate through that proud stoicism and habitual taciturnity which <b>lock</b> up his <b>character</b> from casual observation, we should find him linked to his fellow-man of civilized life by more of those sympathies and affections than are usually ascribed to him.|$|R
40|$|A Professional Doctorate in Fine Art Report on the {{theoretical}} creative practice, professional practice and artwork of the Author, Hedley Roberts between 2006 and 2012. My work uses paint and digital media to interrogate {{the complexity of}} romantic love and the emotional ‘between-ness’ of relationships. Paint is handled as an expressive, performative medium that aims to capture moments of the artist’s inner dialogue and emotional state. Digital media is used to create moving paintings that meld and conjoin figures to produce troubled, interrupted forms. Oversized watercolour portraits of flirtatious, angry, sad, confused, and unspecified individuals confront us as audience. Images of passionate kisses form psychodramatic landscapes of <b>characters</b> <b>locked</b> in moments of unbridled lust, caring embrace, or dramatic end. Each image is a moment that presages the possibility of tragedy {{and the loss of}} the endless embrace...|$|R
