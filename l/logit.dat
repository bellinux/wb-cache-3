40|$|Purpose. To {{validate}} visual disability questionnaire (VDQ) {{in patients}} with low vision in India, and explore whether the two latent traits “importance ” and “difficulty ” associated with performance of daily activities are valid and independent constructs. Methods. The VDQ consisting of 25 items was administered verbally to 137 subjects with low vision aged 16 to 89 years. Responses for each item were rated for importance and difficulty using a 5 -category Likert scale. Rasch {{analysis was used to}} estimate interval measures of response ratings. Results. Subjects could discriminate only three response categories for importance and difficulty. Content validity was demonstrated by good separation indices for importance (4. 24 and 2. 59 for the item and person parameters, respectively) and difficulty ratings (7. 64 and 3. 33, respectively). High reliability scores were recorded for importance (0. 95 and 0. 87) and difficulty ratings (0. 98 and 0. 92). The most important items were “grooming ” (1. 15 <b>logits)</b> and “reading newspaper” (0. 97 <b>logits).</b> Although “threading a needle ” was the least important item (2. 79 <b>logits),</b> it was the most difficult task (3. 13 <b>logits).</b> The least difficult item was moving around in familiar places (2. 51 <b>logits).</b> A poor correlation was observed between the item measures (r 0. 19, p 0. 34) and also between person measures (r 0. 18, p 0. 03) of importance and difficulty...|$|R

As shown in Table  1, the participant separation ratio at 5.93 suggests that the participants could be separated into roughly six distinct levels of performance and the separation reliability at [...]. 97 was high, suggesting reproducibility of the measures from this sample of participants (Linacre 2017 a). An inspection of the participant’s infit and outfit mean squares found that 10 (7.8 %) of the 128 coded participants were identified as misfitting with infit mean squares above 2.0. However, as noted by Bonk and Ockey (2003), participant misfit on a performance test such as this may be unavoidable when participants with uneven L 2 profiles rightly receive scores that deviate from the degree of relative difficulty across the rating scales modeled together. For {{the purposes of this study}} and its explicit focus on the rating scales rather than the learners, the 10 misfitting participants were retained in all analyses.|$|R

Methods. : Sixteen existing patient-reported outcome instruments (PROs) suitable for cataract assessment, with different rating scales, were self-administered by patients on a cataract surgery waiting list. A total of 226 VRAL items from these PROs in their native rating scales were included in an item bank and calibrated using Rasch analysis. Fifteen item/content areas (e. g., reading newspapers) appearing in at least three different PROs were identified. Within each content area, item calibrations were compared and their range calculated. Similarly, five PROs having at least three items in common with the Visual Function (VF- 14) were compared in terms of average item measures. Results. : A total of 614 patients (mean age ± SD, 74. 1 ± 9. 4 years) participated. Items with the same content varied in their calibration by as much as two logits; “reading the small print” had the largest range (1. 99 <b>logits)</b> followed by “watching TV” (1. 60).

40|$|Major {{sources of}} {{information}} for the estimation {{of the size of}} the fish stocks and the rate of their exploitation are samples from which the age composition of catches may be determined. However, the age composition in the catches often varies as a result of several factors. Stratification of the sampling is desirable, because it leads to better estimates of the age composition, and the corresponding variances and covariances. The analysis is impeded by the fact that the response is ordered categorical. This paper introduces an easily applicable method to analyze such data. The method combines continuation-ratio <b>logits</b> and the theory for generalized linear mixed models. Continuation-ratio <b>logits</b> are designed for ordered multinomial response and have the feature that the associated log-likelihood splits into separate terms for each category levels. Thus, generalized linear mixed models can be applied separately to each level of the <b>logits.</b> The method is illustrated by the analysis of age-composition data collected from the Danish sandeel fishery in the North Sea in 1993.
