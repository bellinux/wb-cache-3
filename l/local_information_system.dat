They overlap with some capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS), although their primary function is the reporting of statistical data rather than the analysis of geospatial data. LIS also tend to offer some common knowledge management functionality for storage and retrieval of unstructured data such as documents. They deliver functionality to load, store, analyse and present statistical data that has a strong geographic reference. In most cases the data is structured as indicators and is linked to discrete geographic areas, for example population figures for US counties or numbers claiming unemployment benefit across wards in England. The ability to present this data using data visualization tools like charts and maps is also a core feature of these systems.|$|E

The system frames position estimation as a geometric problem solvable through common nonlinear regression techniques and develops methods for gauging the reliability of position estimates. This provides a flexible framework that can use and enhance a variety of technologies and protocols to produce finegrained position estimates. A specific model provides a simulation environment showing that over 90 % of position estimates are correct to within 3 % of the ranging distance with only 5 % of the system in the initial reference set...|$|E

We conducted a study which required 3 academic hospitals (in 2 separate medical centers) to extract raw laboratory data from their <b>local</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> for a defined patient population, translate tests into LOINC, and provide aggregate data which could then be used to compare laboratory utilization. We found that the coding of local tests into LOINC can often be complex, especially the "Kind of Property" field, and apparently trivial differences in choices made by individual institutions can result in nonmatches in electronically pooled data. In our study, 72 - 86 % of the failures of LOINC to match the same tests between different institutions were due to differences in local coding choices. LOINC has tremendous potential to eliminate the needing for detailed human inspection during the pooling of laboratory data from diverse sites, and perhaps even a built-in capability to adjust matching stringency by selecting subsets of LOINC fields required to match. However, a quality, standard coding procedure at all sites is critical...|$|E

This will enable local government to plan on a sound basis in order to meet its desired objectives.

DESIGN [...] At district or even at neighbourhood level, data are collected on health status and factors related to health, including lifestyle, social and physical and environment, and the health care system. Data are collected from central and municipal Bureaus of Statistics, health care services, regional and municipal institutions, and by means of regularly performed local health surveys.
