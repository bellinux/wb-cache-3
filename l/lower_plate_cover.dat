The stay <b>plate</b> along with <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> will be seeing thermal transients during reactor scrams. The thermal transient will cause the membrane stress due to global temperature increase in <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> and bending stress due to temperature gradient across the thickness. This paper aims the creep and fatigue damages estimation of the stay <b>plate</b> and <b>covers</b> <b>plate.</b> The material of stay <b>plate</b> and <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is SS 316 LN.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} study of laminar, mixed convection flow associated with mass transfer and phase change in a parallel plate channel. The plates are maintained at a constant uniform temperature and the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> is <b>covered</b> by thin liquid water film. The liquid film {{is assumed to be}} extremely thin and its temperature is equal to the wall temperature. A 2 D fully elliptical model, associated with the Boussinesq assumption, is used to take into account axial diffusion. The solution of this mathematical model is based on the finite volume method and the velocity-pressure coupling is handled by the SIMPLER algorithm. Combined buoyancy forces effects on laminar mixed in symmetrical isothermal channel were investigated. Results show that buoyancy forces have an important effect on the hydrodynamic field {{as well as on the}} heat and mass transfer characteristics. Thus, for cold plates and an upward hot air flow, these forces induce a flow reversal near the plates for high air temperatures and mass fractions. Additionally, heat transfer associated with phase change (i. e. latent heat transfer) is more important compared with sensible heat transfer. Flow reversal was investigated in symmetrical isothermal vertical channel and asymmetrical isothermal inclined channel. For the inclined channel, only the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> is wetted by a thin liquid water film while the other one is impermeable. We discuss the effect of the buoyancy forces on the hydrodynamic, heat and mass fields. Thus, these forces induce a flow reversal when there intensities are important. It is established that heat transfer associated with phase change is, sometimes, more significant than sensible heat transfer. Furthermore, this importance depends on the mass fraction gradient. The conditions for the existence of flow reversal are presented in charts and analytical expressions. These charts specify the critical thermal Grashof number as a function of the Reynolds number for different values of the solutal Grashof number and different channel inclinations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study investigates {{initiation}} and {{propagation of}} damage zones in the composite plates of an adhesively bonded single-lap joint in tension at the mesoscale level. A set of material degradation rules {{is applied to}} the mechanical properties of each failed ply of the plates based on the Hashin failure criterion. The von Mises stress concentrates along the free edges of the adhesive layer and the corresponding <b>lower</b> and upper <b>plate</b> regions and peaks along the free edges of the adhesive–plate interfaces. Consequently, the damage initiates at the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> interface to the adhesive layer and propagates in the first ply along this adhesive free edge, and then spreads through the neighboring plies of the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in a similar failure mechanism. The damage in the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> occurs in the matrix, delamination, and fiber–matrix failure modes, and the first ply-failure loads decrease significantly with increasing ply fiber angle. Tension tests showed that the adhesive joints with ply lay-ups between [0] 10 and [15] 10 fails through the adhesive layer, and the <b>lower</b> <b>plates</b> with larger fiber angles break along the free edge of the lower plate– adhesive interface whereas the adhesive layer is still intact. The adhesive failure is interfacial around the adhesive free edges and is through the adhesive {{in the middle of the}} overlap region in the joints with the ply lay-ups [0] 10. Although a similar failure mechanism is observed in the ply lay-up [15] 10, the damage zones in the first ply of the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in which the matrix and fibers are damaged, are distributed in the overlap region.

30|$|In {{creating}} the wiping device, {{there are several}} factors to consider. The frictional force expressing the slipperiness varies depending on {{the magnitude of the}} load on the floor surface. This load varies depending on the attachment position of the sensor and the weight of the device. Also, the contact plate is better to have a smooth and hard surface. If the surface of contact plate is rough, the contact area between the target surface and the device will decrease. And, if the hardness of the contact <b>plate</b> <b>cover</b> is too soft, it will be assumed that wear is caused by the wiping motion, and repeat measurement becomes difficult. Besides wear, self-excited vibration tends to occur because the system becomes unstable if the <b>plate</b> <b>cover</b> is soft. If we want {{to pay attention to the}} resistance force, this vibration is undesirable as it can hinder stable contact with the ground. For these reasons, it is desired that the <b>plate</b> <b>cover</b> is hard and smooth.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccommodation of collisional {{shortening}} in the Central Alps varies dramatically along strike, {{and this}} change is inferred to result from along-strike changes of rheology. In the western Central Alps, 90 % of shortening is accommodated in the thickened <b>lower</b> <b>plate.</b> In the eastern Central Alps, 90 % of shortening is accommodated in the upper plate. In the central Central Alps, shortening is almost equally partitioned between the two <b>plates.</b> The <b>lower</b> crust of the Adriatic plate forms a wedge that reaches a maximum north-south extension of almost 70 km in the Engadine section, progressively decreasing westward and disappearing along the Simplon section. This difference indicates an along-strike increase of intra-plate decoupling, limiting shortening of the Adriatic plate to {{the middle and upper}} parts of the crust. Whereas the upper plate indents into the thickened accreted <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in the Simplon section, it is the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> that indents an intensely deforming upper plate in the Engadine section. In the west, the Ivrea mantle body increases the strength of the Adriatic upper plate, and Barrovian metamorphism weakens the <b>lower</b> <b>plate.</b> Therefore, along-strike transfer of shortening from one plate to the other appears to be a manifestation of along-strike changes in rheology deep in the crust...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{histories}} of mylonitic rocks from the footwall {{of the northern}} Snake Range decollement (NSRD), Nevada, were calculated using multiple diffusion domain analyses of potassium feldspar Arrhenius data and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age spectra in order to characterize the cooling (exhumation) history of these mylonitic rocks and thereby constrain the origin and movement history of the NSRD. The calculated thermal histories, along with reported apatite fission track ages, indicate the three following episodes of rapid cooling (10 – 55 °C/m. y.) related to extensional denudation: (1) middle Eocene (48 – 41 Ma), (2) late Oligocene (30 – 26 Ma), and (3) early Miocene (20 – 16 Ma). The first episode of rapid cooling {{may be related to}} the earliest period of normal faulting in east central Nevada and initiation of slip along the NSRD. The second episode signals a pulse of slip along the NSRD, and the third episode marks the cessation of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> mylonitic deformation and the onset of the major pulse of uplift and rotation of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks from beneath the NSRD and/or younger east dipping normal faults. The thermal history data provide evidence for a temperature difference across the range within the same structural horizon; the northwestern flank of the range dropped below 300 °C by 46 Ma and reached 115 °C by 20 Ma, whereas <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks in the eastern parts of the range were at temperatures above 300 °C until 19 Ma. If isotherms were subhorizontal, these relations suggest that either <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> units had an eastward dip prior to the onset of Tertiary mylonitic deformation or that layering dipped eastward as a result of top-to-the-east shear within an east dipping shear zone. Either case results in differential cooling (uplift) of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> rocks from beneath the NSRD. A temperature-distance-age graph, constructed based upon the calculated thermal histories, shows differential uplift and rotation of moderately to steeply east dipping <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> units from beneath the NSRD. Furthermore, this reconstruction shows that the dip of <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> units increases and then decreases in time and space. This reconstruction implies that the NSRD initiated at moderate to steep angles that shallowed at depth, listric style, into a shallow dipping shear zone. These reconstructions provide a spectacular example of the rolling hinge/isostatic rebound model...|$|R
