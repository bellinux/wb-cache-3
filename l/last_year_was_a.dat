5000|$|Forshaw {{was rewarded}} with a new three-year {{contract}} on 27 June 2013, despite having a year of his existing contract left to run. Forshaw scored his first goal of the 2013/14 season in a 3-1 victory over Sheffield United on 10 August. With the absence of regular penalty taker Kevin O'Connor through injury, Forshaw assumed the role and scored his third penalty of the season (his fifth goal overall) in a 3-0 away league victory over Preston North End on 21 December. Forshaw's run of 24 consecutive league starts ended when he was {{left out of the}} squad for a 2-0 win over Port Vale at Griffin Park on 11 January 2014 and his absence drew speculation about his future. Manager Mark Warburton later stated that Forshaw was suffering with a calf problem and Forshaw himself said [...] "my aim is to get promoted with Brentford. I’m really enjoying it here. I feel I’m gaining a lot of experience playing regularly. <b>Last</b> <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> massive learning curve for me". On 12 March, it was revealed that Forshaw had made it onto the three-man shortlist for the 2014 League One Player of the Year award. He won the award on 16 March, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers' Kevin McDonald and Swindon Town's Alex Pritchard. Forshaw was sent off for the second time of his career in a 1-0 defeat to Swindon Town on 12 April. Owing to being suspended, Forshaw was absent for Brentford's automatic promotion-clinching 1-0 victory over Preston North End on 18 April and his final appearance of the season came in a 2-2 draw with Milton Keynes Dons on 21 April. The following day, Forshaw underwent surgery to correct a long-standing ankle problem. Looking back on Brentford's promotion, Forshaw said he was [...] "over the moon, we were so close last year and to do it this year in style was a real credit. It was nice to not take it to the wire. To get it done was special". He made 40 appearances during the 2013/14 season and scored eight goals. Forshaw was named in the 2013/14 League One Team of the Year and won Shoot magazine's League One Player of the Year award.|$|E
50|$|The Sox {{kicked off}} July {{by winning the}} series at home against the Orioles which began on July 2, {{including}} a walk-off win on Fourth of July by a home run by Adam Dunn, his ninth career. Ironically, the Sox had a walk-off win on Fourth of July in three straight years, <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> single by Kevin Youkilis against the Rangers and the year before was a balk with Dunn at the plate against the Royals. After that series win, they headed to St. Pete where they get swept by Rays scoring only 4 runs during the three game sweep. The Sox then played the makeup game with the Cubs that got rained out on May 28. The Sox lost the game 8-2 to complete the Cubs 4-game sweep of the Sox. The Sox were outscored 32-8 during the Cubs Crosstown Classic sweep. In {{the first game of}} a three games series in Detroit, the Sox scored a season high eleven runs during an 11-4 victory over the Tigers. The Sox also had a season high 23 hits and Alex Ríos went 6 for 6 with a triple and five singles during the game. The six hits by Rios tied a franchise and American League record for most hits during a 9-inning game. The last White Sox player to have six hits in a 9-inning game was Lance Johnson on September 23, 1995, against the Twins. The Sox lost game two of the series vs. the Tigers but won the overall series due to a grand slam by rookie catcher Josh Phegley in the third and final game of the series. Phegley became the first Sox player with three home runs in his first five games since Magglio Ordóñez in 1997. The Sox then opened up a three-game series with the Philadelphia Phillies in Philadelphia. Just before the series began, Matt Thornton and cash was traded to the Boston Red Sox for minor leaguer Brandon Jacobs. After the first games was postponed due the rain the Sox split a doubleheader with the Phillies with both games going into extra innings and each team winning by one run. The Sox lost the final games of the series once again in extra innings and lost by one run. The Sox were off from July 15-18 because of the All-Star break. Chris Sale and Jesse Crain were both All-Stars for the White Sox. Crain did not play in the All-Star game because of an injury and Sale was the winning pitcher in the game pitching two scoreless innings.|$|E
