We have examined associated neuro-patfaology, the validity and die reproducibility of the method, and made comparisons of initial slope estimates of CBF with those obtained by stochastic analysis. Initial slope estimates (CBF = 1. 62 ± 0. 04 ml min 'g X ± SE, N = 38) were linearly related to stochastic measurements (CBF = 1. 42 ± 0. 09 ml min 'g 1, N = 6), and overestimated mean CBF by about 15...|$|E
40|$|Réduit à sa plus simple expression, ce travail de {{recherche}} met face à face deux acteurs s affrontant dans un duel philosophique : le physicalisme et l argument de la connaissance de Franck Jackson. La question clé autour de laquelle s agencera notre discussion ici est (1) Est-il vrai que Tout est physique ? Le coeur de la thèse que nous défendons peut être résumé ainsi : (T) Le clivage post-platonicien (tacite) entre les formes objectivées et les formes subjectivées de la pensée, provoque des fossés explicatifs (explicites), qui sont franchis (très souvent) via des sauts conceptuels (mystérieux), intercalés entre les étapes d une argumentation. Il sera argumenté ici que la distribution actuelle des débats sur <b>l</b> <b>axe</b> états physiques (objectifs) / états qualitatifs (subjectifs) subit une pression souterraine post-platonicienne. Conséquemment, une bonne partie de l énergie des penseurs actuels est dépensée à la recherche du bon saut ou crochet conceptuel permettant d attacher les rives du mental à celui du physique. Nous soutiendrons que le coeur du problème ne consiste pas à résoudre le différend entre les physicalistes et les avocats des qualia, mais plutôt à trouver la réponse à la question : pourquoi en sommes-nous arrivés là, i. e., à ce clivage sur <b>l</b> <b>axe</b> phénoménal/physique ?Everything is physical physicalists claim. Everything except qualia reply {{the defenders}} of the Knowledge Argument. This thesis argues that both parties to this debate are committed to a traditional picture according to which one can tacitly adopt the standpoint of an off-stage narrator, capable of distinguishing ab initio between the different items in this conceptual scenario. The main claim here is that every time we artificially introduce a sharp conceptual distinction separating these two items or levels (mental and physical), we must automatically make a sophisticated conceptual leap in order to link the first-person qualitative perspective with the external physical world. Thus the physicalism/qualia dispute is only a by-product of an extended theoretical conception of the mind/world link which entails two distinct kinds of problems: (i) structural problems (to define and determine conceptually dual items like thought/matter, reason/senses, subject/object, etc.). Such problems require us to question how are these items supposed to work together? and this leads us to the second group of problems: (ii) mediation problems. The first group of problems inevitably leads to explanatory gaps; the second ends up needing to appeal to conceptual leaps {{in order to ensure}} the necessary link between two separate items. This exerts a powerful influence over the cast of our thoughts: seen from this angle, all philosophical enterprise comes down to the question of where to place the three following parameters: {{the world as it is}}, the conceptual picture which aims to represent the world as it is and the theorist-painter gifted with the ability to capture the world picture as it is. We also face the problem of finding the right mediators to assure coherence among the members of this trio, and the problem of setting the valid criteria guaranteeing the theorist-painter that what is captured on his conceptual canvas does indeed correspond to the world as it is, i. e. that he is not laboring under the delusions of an evil genie. In this thesis I argue against this way of putting things. DIJON-BU Doc. électronique (212319901) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the role of acidic ribosomal protein (ARP) phosphorylation in translation. Ribosomes (Rbs) from germinated maize (Zea mays <b>L.)</b> <b>axes</b> had four ARP bands within 4. 2 to 4. 5 isoelectric points when analyzed by isoelectric focusing. Two of these bands disappeared after alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis. During germination a progressive change from nonphosphorylated (0 h) to phosphorylated ARP (24 h) forms was observed in the Rbs; a free cytoplasmic pool of nonphosphorylated ARPs was also identified by immunoblot and isoelectric focusing experiments. De novo ARP synthesis initiated very slowly early in germination, whereas ARP phosphorylation occurred rapidly within this period. ARP-phosphorylated versus ARP-nonphosphorylated Rbs were tested in an in vitro reticulocyte lysate translation system. Greater in vitro mRNA translation rates were demonstrated for the ARP-phosphorylated Rbs than for the non-ARP-phosphorylated ones. Rapamycin application to maize axes strongly inhibited S 6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation, but did not interfere with the ARP phosphorylation reaction. We conclude that ARP phosphorylation does not depend on ARP synthesis or on ARP assembly into Rbs. Rather, this process seems {{to be part of a}} translational regulation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The size sorting {{and shape}} sorting of gravel bedload by running water often is {{investigated}} using identifiable tracer grains {{that represent the}} grains within the riverbed. A new, robust, and reproducible method is described for the objective selection of three-dimensional shapes that {{are representative of the}} variety of shape within any whole sample. Widespread adoption of the method would ensure comparability between the shape-sorting results of different experiments. The approach identifies average and extreme grain shapes from natural gravel samples. Importantly, tracer dimensions are derived that form shapes with equal volume, thus ensuring that the shape of the tracers is the only transport variable. The method is tested on seven gravel samples from a range of fluvial, beach, and scree-slope environments as well as different sieve sizes. Initially, measurements of the short (S), intermediate (I), and long (<b>L)</b> orthogonal <b>axes</b> of clasts are made from selected sieve intervals that represent the spread in the size distribution of the natural gravel.

40|$|The {{potential}} to cryopreserve embryonic axes of desiccation-sensitive (recalcitrant) seeds {{is limited by}} damage during the desiccation necessary for low temperature survival, but {{the basis of this}} injury and how to reduce it is not well understood. The effects of drying rate on the viability, respiratory metabolism and free radical-mediated processes were therefore investigated during dehydration of Quercus robur <b>L.</b> embryonic <b>axes.</b> Viability, assessed by evidence of germination and tetrazolium staining, showed a sharp decline at 0. 27 and 0. 8 g/g during rapid (< 12 h) or slow (3 d) dehydration, respectively. Rapid dehydration therefore lowered the critical water content for survival. At any given water content rapid dehydration was associated with higher activities of the free radical processing enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase and lower levels of hydroperoxide and membrane damage. Rapid dehydration was also associated with lower malate dehydrogenase activity, and a reduced decline in phosphofructokinase activity and in levels of the oxidized form of nicotinamide dinucleotide. Ageing may have contributed to increased damage during slow dehydration, since viability declined even in hydrated storage after 3 d. The results presented are consistent with rapid dehydration reducing the accumulation of damage resulting from desiccation induced aqueous-based deleterious reactions...|$|R

Using poly(dA) /oligo(dT) as template, DNA polymerase 2 has a processivity of 18 ([plus or minus] 5) nucleotides incorporated, a value much lower than that found for wheat [alpha]-type DNA polymerase (P. Laquel, S. Litvak, M. Castroviejo [1993] Plant Physiol 102 : 107 - 114). Conditions that maximally stimulate enzyme activity, such as 100 mM KCl and 12 mM Mg 2 +, are strongly inhibitory of processivity and cause the enzyme to become distributive under these conditions. Optimal concentrations for processivity are 10 mM KCl and 1 to 2 mM Mg 2 +. Both enzyme activity and processivity {{were found to be}} similar at different Mn 2 + concentrations. Both DNA polymerase 2 activity and processivity are greatly reduced by spermine and N-ethylmaleimide. A distinguishing feature of processivity in DNA polymerase 2 was the response to ATP, which not only stimulated processivity by more than 2 -fold, but also produced a distinctive pattern in which the enzyme seemed to pause every 10 nucleotides, reaching a value of 40 to 50 nucleotides incorporated. This pattern was observed in some, but not all, heparin-Sepharose fractions with enzyme activity, suggesting the possibility of different DNA polymerase 2 complexes...|$|R

Specifically due to its importance in wood elastic parameters, this paper deals with the fiber orientation influence in these models through adequate transformation of coordinates. As a final result, some examples of the linear model, which show the variation of elastic moduli, i. e., Young´s modulus and shear modulus, with fiber orientation are presented...|$|R

These analyses show that sucrose and larger oligosaccharides were consistently present during the tolerant stage, and that desiccation tolerance disappeared as the oligosaccharides were lost.

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that a mammalian-like nitric oxide synthase (NOS) exists in plants. Researchers have {{attempted}} to verify its presence using two approaches: (i) determination of NOS functional activity and (ii) probing with mammalian NOS antibodies. However, up to now, neither a NOS-like gene nor a protein {{has been found in}} plants. While there is still some controversy over whether the NOS functional activity seen is due to nitrate reductase, using the mammalian NOS antibodies in western blot analysis, several groups have reported the presence of immunoreactive protein bands in plant homogenates. Based on these results, immunohistochemical studies using these antibodies have also been used to localize NOS in plant tissues. However, plant NOS has never been positively identified or characterized. Thus, we used a proteomic approach to verify the identities of plant proteins that cross-reacted with the mammalian NOS antibodies. Proteins extracted from maize (Zea mays <b>L.)</b> embryonic <b>axes</b> were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subjected to western blot analysis with the mammalian neuronal NOS and inducible NOS antibodies. Twenty immunoreactive protein spots recognized on a corresponding Coomassie blue-stained two-dimensional gel were subjected to tryptic digestion, followed by identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Fifteen proteins were successfully identified and they have described functions that are unrelated to NO metabolism. The remaining five proteins could not be identified. The amino acid sequences of these identified proteins and those used to raise the antibodies were aligned. However, no homologous region could be found. Our results demonstrate that the mammalian NOS antibodies recognize many NOS-unrelated plant proteins. Therefore, it is inappropriate to infer the presence of plant NOS using this immunological technique. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R

In a single trial, the test color was only adjustable along one of 26 directions around the reference. Thus 26 colors with just noticeable difference (JND) were obtained and made up a tube-like or an ellipsoidal shape around each reference. With color-anomalous subjects, the major axes of these shapes should be parallel to color confusion lines that have a common orientation vector corresponding to one of the cone excitation <b>axes</b> <b>L,</b> M, or S.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} pose of a bone during {{activity is}} commonly estimated using {{a cluster of}} at least 3 non-collinear skin markers the position of which in a global frame (G) is reconstructed through stereophotogrammetry. A time-invariant clustermodel, rigidly associated {{with a set of}} local <b>axes</b> (<b>L),</b> is defined and registered with the skin markers in each sampled instant of time. Soft tissue deformation, however, engenders an artefact (STA) that affects the reconstructed position of the markers and causes a shape variation (SV) of the cluster. Because of this, both the determination of the cluster model and the registration call for optimization procedures. To this purpose several algorithms have been proposed [Andriacchi, 1998; Taylor, 2005]. The estimated pose of L embeds not only the motion of the bone relative to G, the goal of the analysis, but also the motion of L relative to the bone (CB), the latter also caused by STAs and representing an error. Thus, STAs manifest themselves at the cluster level through two components (SV and CB).

Corneal curvature was measured using the L 80 instrument by one practitioner and the manual B & L keratometer by a different practitioner. Intratest and intertest repeatability were assessed. Results: Corneal curvature {{was found to be}} statistically different between the two instruments (p < 0. 001), with the L 80 providing a slightly steeper bias of 0. 05 mm and 0. 07 mm for the horizontal and vertical meridians, respectively than the B & L keratometer. 78. 2 % and 86. 2 % of the L 80 results were within ± 0. 1 mm (± 0. 06 D) and 95. 4 % and 97. 7 % within ± 0. 2 mm (± 0. 11 D) of the readings obtained with the B & L keratometer along the horizontal and the vertical meridians, respectively.

Intertest repeatability was better for the L 80 videokeratographer compared to the B & L keratometer and showed {{no significant difference between the}} two sessions. ConclusionThe L 80 videokeratographer is a reliable objective instrument comparable to other autokeratometers which, in addition, combines many other useful clinical features. It provides steeper radii of curvature measurements than the B & L keratometer. An offset incorporated into the instrument could mitigate the difference between the two instruments and make them interchangeable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Germination is {{the first}} step of plant growth in plant life cycle. An {{embryonic}} radicle protruding the seed coat {{is the first}} part of plant which has direct contact with external environment including salt-affected soil. In embryo axes, mitochondria are the main energy producer. To understand better salinity impact on mitochondria functioning, this study was focused on the effect of NaCl stress onto mitochondria proteome. Mitochondria were isolated from yellow lupine (Lupine luteus <b>L.</b> ‘Mister’) embryo <b>axes</b> cultured in vitro for 12 h with 250 and 500 mM NaCl. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of mitochondrial proteins isolated from NaCl-treated axes demonstrated significant changes in proteins abundances as a response to salinity treatment. Twenty-one spots showing significant changes in protein expression profiles both under 250 and 500 mM NaCl treatment were selected for tandem mass spectrometry identification. This approach revealed proteins associated with different metabolic pro-cesses that represent enzymes of tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transport chain, enzymes and proteins involved in mitochondria biogenesis and stresses response. Among proteins involved in mitochondria biogenesis, mitochondrial import inner membrane translo-case, subunit Tim 17 / 22, mitochondrial-processing pepti-dase subunit alpha- 1, mitochondrial elongation factor Tu and chaperonins CPN 60 were revealed. Finally, for-mate dehydrogenase 1 was found to accumulate in lupine embryo axes mitochondria under salinity. The functions of identified proteins are discussed in relation to salinity stress response, including salinity-induced PCD...|$|R

Subjects were seated {{at a distance of}} 130 cm from the wall in front of the chamber. The monitor was placed in a tunnel 57 cm behind the wall, and was viewed through an opening of 10. 6 × 8 deg. Stimuli were displayed on a Sony GDM-F 520 CRT monitor with a spatial resolution of 800 × 600 pixels and refresh rate of 120 Hz, driven by a Cambridge Research VSG graphics card. The C. I. E. 1931 chromaticity of the white point of the monitor was x = 0. 32, y = 0. 34 with a luminance of 29 cd m-. Calibration of the setup is described in detail in Rinner & Gegenfurtner (2002). Stimuli. Seven digitized photographs of fruit and vegetables were selected as stimuli due to their distinct object colour. Each stimulus contained one fruit object on a grey background. As control stimuli we used homogeneously coloured discs and noise discs with an amplitude spectrum resembling the average amplitude spectrum of natural scenes (1 /f, pink noise). The stimuli were defined in the DKL colour space, which is spanned by a luminance axis (L + M) and two chromatic <b>axes</b> (<b>L</b> – M and S – (L + M) ...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{construction}} materials, wood reveals an orthotropic pattern, because of unique characteristics in its internal structure with three axes of wood biological directions (longitudinal, tangential and radial). elastic symmetry: longitudinal, tangential and radial, reveals an orthotropic pattern. The effect of grain angle orientation onin {{the elastic modulus}} constitutes the fundamental cause forof wood anisotropy. It {{is responsible for the}} greatest changes in the values of the constitutive tensor components, and, thus in the elastic constant values of wood. The goal {{of this article is to}} verify the adequacy of the orthotropic model for wood, basically expressed by the modulus of elasticity Ei related to a determined direction. It was considered a cCoordinate transformation between the materials <b>axes</b> (<b>L,</b> R and T) and Euler&# 8242;s angles is considered to use a constitutive equation for orthotropic materials. The main purpose of this analysis is to theoretically explore the coordinate transformation in the three - dimensional point of view and also to statistically compare the results of modulus of elasticity from compression test in a Brazilian wood species, Guapuruvú (Schizolobium parahyba), with values obtained from a theoretical expression. The results from the analysis, in which the coefficient of determination (R-sq) was equal to 0. 965 for a linear least squares analysis, showed that the orthotropic model is adequate to be applie...|$|R

40|$|Body {{composition}} {{analysis was}} performed on 37 Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica baueri) that had been illegally shot during migratory fueling in northern New Zealand in March 1992. Adults (n = 35) were heavy (442 - 721 g), with fat loads of 30 - 45 % of body mass. Two first-year males had only 5. 4 % and 8. 9 % fat, respectively, and had 13 % less lean (fat-free dry) tissue than the average adult male. Males and females scaled along the same size axes, with little overlap between the sexes (females were larger). Larger birds carried more fat, but fat loads did not cliff er systematically with size (and, therefore, sex). Fatter birds (after accounting for body size) had larger flight muscle and lung masses, implying premigratory hypertrophy. Males that were not in body molt were fatter, but less colorful, than molting birds. They were also longer-winged and had larger testes but smaller intestines and salt glands, which suggests that they may belong to a subpopulation with a different fueling and molt strategy. Comparison between L. l. baueri and a smaller subspecies (L. l. taymyrensis) indicated that although the two subspecies scaled along the same lean mass-size <b>axes,</b> <b>L.</b> 1. baueri deposited much more fat for their body size (1. 7 x more than the equivalent-sized L. 1. taymyrensis). On the basis of estimated travel costs for L. 1. taymyrensis, predicted flight ranges for L. 1. baueri ranged from 6, 000 to 8, 600 km, depending on whether wind assistance is assumed. That suggests that direct flights from New Zealand to southeastern or eastern Asia are possible (e. g. Philippines, 7, 200 km; Japan, 8, 700; South Korea, 9, 100 km) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to {{evaluate}} the flying qualities of a half-scale radio controlled airplane based on the Unmanned Airplane for Ecological Conservation via flight simulation. The stability coefficients of the half-scale airplane were obtained by vortex lattice method using the code Tornado. The radio controlled aircraft simulator CRRCSim was used to perform the virtual flights. Aerodynamic, geometry, thrust and mass characteristics of the airplane were introduced to the simulator by a code written in C++. Virtual test flights were carried out and the flying qualities were obtained. It could be concluded that the half-scale airplane has excellent flying qualities, rating the aircraft in level 1. The simulator is recommended as a training tool for test pilots of the real model.
