The second hypothesis, the amounts of sales selected in the sample were proportional to the amounts of sales in the population on a monthly basis...|$|R

The Fagels having fallen on hard times as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, the entire library was to be auctioned by Christie 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>of</b> <b>London</b> in March 1802. Through "Acumen" and "Timely Intervention" Trinity College bought the entire collection before it went to auction. Despite the immense wealth of this resource, it has only ever been examind sporadically and unsystematically. Indeed, large sections of the collection have never even been properly catalogued. The Department of Germanic Studies is preparing applications to Dutch, Belgian and Irish sources for funding for two postgraduate students or post-doctoral fellows to study the Fagel collection. The persons appointed would be expected either to study the collection itself, say, from the point of view of the history of the book or social history, or to carry out research projects based on its holdings, in areas such as literature, history of science, political history, cartography, or history of ideas...|$|R
