Future generations are likely to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, yet they are also the <b>least</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> current decisions on climate action. At the same time, the world population is ageing very quickly.

Formal decision-making structures strive to ensure the participation of those most vulnerable and least represented, recognizing that specialized efforts need to be invested in engaging vulnerable communities.|$|E

Adults and children aged 7 – 10 years showed clear category-specific cortical specialization for tool versus animal pictures during a one-back categorisation task. Thus, sensorimotor representations for these categories were in place at all ages. However, co-activation of these same brain regions by the visual objects’ written names was only present in adults, even though all children could read and comprehend all presented words, showed adult-like task performance, and older children were proficient readers.

40|$|Policies {{designed}} to increase women’s representation in Africa are often motivated by the assumption {{that men and women}} have different policy preferences. We find that gender dif-ferences in policy priorities are actually quite small on average, but vary significantly across policy domains and countries. We leverage this variation to show that economic and social em-powerment of women influences the size of gender gap in the prioritization of two important domains. In particular, women’s participation in the labor force – an indicator of economic empowerment – narrows the gender gap in the prioritization of infrastructure investment and access to clean water, while social vulnerability widens the gap on infrastructure investment. Finally, we show that the places where women and men have the most divergent policy pref-erences – and thus formal representation is most important – are precisely the places where women are the <b>least</b> <b>represented</b> and active <b>in</b> formal politics. 1 In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the rate of participation of women in posi-tions of political power. 1 This change in descriptive representation has been welcomed because o...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{populations of}} the Arabian Peninsula remain the <b>least</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> public genetic databases, {{both in terms of}} single {{nucleotide}} variants and of larger genomic mutations. We present the first high-resolution copy number variation (CNV) map for a Gulf Arab population, using a hybrid approach that integrates array genotyping intensity data and next-generation sequencing reads to call CNVs in the Qatari population. Methods: CNVs were detected in 97 unrelated Qatari individuals by running two calling algorithms on each of two primary datasets: high-resolution genotyping (Illumina Omni 2. 5 M) and high depth whole-genome sequencing (Illumina PE 100 bp). The four call-sets were integrated to identify high confidence CNV regions, which were subsequently annotated for putative functional effect and compared to public databases of CNVs in other populations. The availability of genome sequence was leveraged to identify tagging SNPs in high LD with common deletions in this population, enabling their imputation from genotyping experiments in the future. Results: Genotyping intensities and genome sequencing data from 97 Qataris were analyzed with four different algorithms and integrated to discover 16, 660 high confidence CNV regions (CNVRs) in the total population, affecting ~ 28 Mb in the median Qatari genome. Up to 40 % of all CNVs affected genes, including novel CNVs affecting Mendelian disease genes, segregating at different frequencies in the 3 major Qatari subpopulations...|$|E

The database was analyzed for aerosol optical properties using the SKYRAD radiative inversion algorithm and calibrated using the in situ SKYIL calibration method. Retrievals include aerosol optical depth, Ångström wavelength exponent, aerosol volume distribution, refractive index and single scattering albedo. The {{results show that the}} Plymouth site is characterized by low values of aerosol optical depth with low variability (0. 18 ± 0. 08 at 500 nm) and a mean annual Ångström exponent of 1. 03 ± 0. 21. The annual mean of the single scattering albedo is 0. 97, indicative of non-absorbing aerosols. The aerosol properties were classified in terms of air mass back trajectories: the area is mainly affected by Atlantic air masses and the dominant aerosol type is a mixture of maritime particles, present in low burdens with variable size. The maritime air masses were defined by annual mean values for the AOD (at 500 nm) of 0. 13 – 0. 14 and a wavelength exponent of 0. 96 – 1. 03. Episodic anthropogenic and mineral dust intrusions occasionally occur, but they are sporadic and dilute (AOD at 500 nm about 0. 20).

We asked 20 normal volunteers to provide properties of 64 concrete items, drawn from living and nonliving categories, by completing simple sentence stems (e. g., an owl is __, has __, can__). At a later date, the same participants rated the same concepts for prototypicality and familiarity. The features generated were classified as to type of knowledge (sensory, functional, or encyclopaedic), and also quantified with regard to both dominance (the number of participants specifying that property for that concept) and distinctiveness (the proportion of exemplars within a conceptual category of which that feature was considered characteristic). The results demonstrate that rated prototypicality is related to both the familiarity of the concept and its distance from {{the average of the}} exemplars within the same category (the category centroid). The feature database was also used to replicate, resolve, and extend a variety of previous observations on the structure of semantic representations. Specifically, the results of our analyses (1) resolve two conflicting claims regarding the relative ratio of sensory to other kinds of attributes in living vs. nonliving concepts; (2) offer new information regarding the types of features - across different domains - that distinguish concepts from their category coordinates; and (3) corroborate some previous claims of higher intercorrelations between features of living things than those of artefacts...|$|R
