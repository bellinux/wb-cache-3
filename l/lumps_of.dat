Barrow discovered Honus Wagner throwing <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed him to his first professional contract. Barrow sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for $2,100 the next year ($ in current dollar terms). With poor attendance, Barrow brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired. He also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, to pitch a few innings a game.|$|E
5|$|English cookery has {{developed}} over many centuries {{since at least}} the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E

5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E

The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

50|$|Mereological essentialism is a {{position}} defended {{in the debate}} regarding material constitution. What {{is the relationship between}} a statue and the <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay from which it is made? Several different answers have been proposed. Coincidentialism is the view that the statue and the <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay are two objects located at the same place. The <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay should be distinguished from the statue because they have different persistence conditions. The lump would not survive the loss of a very small part of clay, but the statue would. The statue would not survive being squashed into a ball, but the <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> clay would.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> labor fallacy is {{also known}} as the <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> jobs fallacy, fallacy of labour scarcity, fixed pie fallacy or the zero-sum fallacy - due to its ties to zero-sum games.

5000|$|Examples can {{be found}} in many cultures. The Indian Mahabharata tells how Gandhari, the wife of Dhritarashtra, wished for 100 sons, and after two years of {{pregnancy}} gave birth to a <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> flesh, which were cut into 101 pieces and placed in jars, and developed into 100 sons and a daughter. The Tamil saint Thirumalisai Alvar was born as a limbless <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> flesh after twelve months in the womb, abandoned by his parents, and returned to life by Vishnu.

25|$|Sometimes amber {{retains the}} form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and {{receptacles}} of the injured trees.

25|$|The Lydian coins {{consisted}} of discs or <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> electrum (a natural gold/silver alloy), and were stamped {{on two sides}} with dies.

When Lydia was conquered by Achaemenid Persia, the production of Lydian coins continued {{in the guise of}} silver Siglos and gold Darics. Other parts of Persia only began to mint coins at the time of Alexander the Great's conquest.|$|E
25|$|The three-stage {{breaking}} action: initially, {{the material}} is gripped by the leading faces of opposed rotor teeth. These subject the rock to multiple point loading, inducing stress into the material to exploit any natural weaknesses. At the second stage, material is broken in tension by being subjected to a three-point loading, applied between the front tooth faces on one rotor, and rear tooth faces on the other rotor. Any <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> material that still remain oversize, are broken as the rotors chop through the fixed teeth of the breaker bar, thereby achieving a three dimensional controlled product size.|$|E

Mang-chi-shi – is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. Lang-ch’a is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste.

40|$|This paper critiques {{the last}} decade of {{research}} on the effects of high-skill emigration from developing countries, and proposes six new directions for fruitful research. The study singles out a core assumption underlying much of the recent literature, calling it the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model of human capital and development, and describes five ways that research has come to challenge that assumption. It assesses the usefulness <b>of</b> the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model in the face of accumulating evidence. The axioms <b>of</b> the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model have shaped research priorities in this literature, but many of those axioms do not have a clear empirical basis. Future research proceeding from established facts would set different priorities, and would devote more attention to measuring the effects of migration on skilled-migrant households, rigorously estimating human capital externalities, gathering microdata beyond censuses, and carefully considering optimal policy 9 ̆ 6 among others. The recent literature has pursued a series of extensions to the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model. This study urges discarding the <b>Lump</b> <b>of</b> Learning model, pointing toward a new paradigm for research on skilled migration and development...|$|R

The account is characterized by a great deal of literary license and contains references to hell where “great demons threw down <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire” and “great crystal pillars.” Many now believe these to be references to the volcanic activity around Iceland, and to icebergs.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} stages—egg, larva, and pupa—are largely aquatic. These stages {{typically}} last 5 to 14 days, {{depending on the}} species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions. Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend {{part of the year}} in diapause; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, Wyeomyia larvae typically get frozen into solid <b>lumps</b> <b>of</b> ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of Aedes remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.|$|E
25|$|Manykin et al. have {{suggested}} atmospheric Rydberg matter {{as an explanation}} of ball lightning phenomena. Rydberg matter is a condensed form of highly excited atoms in many aspects similar to electron-hole droplets in semiconductors. However, in contrast to electron-hole droplets, Rydberg matter has an extended life-time—as long as hours. This condensed excited state of matter is supported by experiments, mainly of a group led by Holmlid. It {{is similar to a}} liquid or solid state of matter with extremely low (gas-like) density. <b>Lumps</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric Rydberg matter can result from condensation of highly excited atoms that form by atmospheric electrical phenomena, mainly due to linear lightning. Stimulated decay of Rydberg matter clouds can, however, take the form of an avalanche, and so appear as an explosion.|$|E
