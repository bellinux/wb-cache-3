The following search terms were used: "flap" and "monitoring. " All <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> found between January of 1999 and January of 2009 were evaluated. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> that were described in five or more clinical reports were further investigated. RESULTS: The advantages and disadvantages of conventional <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods,</b> the implantable Doppler system, color duplex sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, microdialysis, and laser Doppler flowmetry are presented. Furthermore, an overview is given of their potential as ideal <b>monitoring</b> <b>method.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The implantable Doppler system, near-infrared spectroscopy, and laser Doppler flowmetry appear to be the best monitoring devices currently available. As most of the publications on monitoring have focused on the reliability of the systems, future research should also address their cost efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) {{is an effective}} feature extraction tool for process monitoring. However, the conventional ICA-based process <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> usually adopt noise-free ICA models and thus may perform unsatisfactorily under the adverse effects of the measurement noise. In this paper, a process <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> using a new noisy independent {{component analysis}}, referred to as NoisyICAn, is proposed. Using the noisy ICA model which considers the measurement noise explicitly, a NoisyICAn algorithm is developed to estimate the mixing matrix by setting {{up a series of}} the fourthorder cumulant matrices of the measured data and performing the joint diagonalization of these matrices. The kurtosis relationships of the independent components and measured variables are subsequently obtained based on the estimated mixing matrix, for recursively estimating the kurtosis of independent components. Two monitoring statistics are then built to detect process faults using the obtained recursive estimate of the independent components' kurtosis. The simulation studies are carried out on a simple three-variable system and a continuous stirred tank reactor system, and the results obtained demonstrate that the proposed NoisyICAn-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> outperforms the conventional noise-free ICA-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> as well as the benchmark <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> based on the existing noisy ICA schemes adopted from blind source separation, in terms of the fault detection time and local fault detection rate...|$|R

40|$|Beneficial use {{of waste}} relies on {{efficient}} systems for collection and separation. In Sweden, a bring system involving recycling centres for collection of bulky, electr(on) ic and hazardous waste has been introduced. A significant share of this waste is incorrectly sorted, causing downstream environmental implications. At present, however, {{there is a lack}} of affordable and accurate <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> for providing the recycling centres with the necessary facts for improving the sorting of waste. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the usability of a simplified and potentially more suitable waste <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> for recycling centres. This method is based on standardised observations where the occurrence of incorrect sorting is monitored by taking digital pictures of the waste which then are analysed according to certain guidelines. The results show that the developed <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> could offer a resource-efficient and useful tool for proactive quality work at recycling centres, involving continuous efforts in developing and evaluating measures for improved sorting of waste. More research is however needed in order to determine to what extent the obtained results from the <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> are reliable.

40|$|Small bowel {{transplantation}} {{is acknowledged}} as auto- and allotransplantation. In both instances, there {{is up to}} a 4 %– 10 % risk of postoperative ischemia, and as the small bowel is extremely susceptible to ischemia, the timely diagnosis of ischemia is important. The location of the transplant, whether it is buried in the abdominal cavity or in the neck region, increases the challenge, as monitoring becomes more difficult {{and the consequences of}} neglect more dangerous. All methods for the early detection of postoperative ischemia in small bowel transplants are described together with the requirements of the ideal <b>monitoring</b> <b>method.</b> A small bowel transplant can be inspected directly or indirectly; the blood flow can be monitored by Doppler or by photoplethysmography, and the consequences of the blood flow can be monitored. The ideal <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> should be reliable, fast, minimally invasive, safe, objective, easy, cheap, and comfortable. No <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> today fulfill the criteria of the ideal <b>monitoring</b> <b>method,</b> and evidence-based guidelines regarding postoperative monitoring cannot be made.

Monitoring {{and control of}} the chip size and shape is very important in deep-hole machining because a visual monitoring is obstructed by hidden chip passages.

In this manufacturing process monitoring system, the three principal components for chip status monitoring have been investigated: the sensing chip concentration, the signal processing, and the classification (decision making).
