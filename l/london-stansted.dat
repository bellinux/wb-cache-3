25|$|After {{having made}} small profits {{ten years in}} a row until 1998, Coast Air had a loss of NOK18.6 million and a revenue of NOK40.5 million in 1999. To {{increase}} liquidity, the company sold two of its four Jetstream 31 aircraft. The establishment in the PSO market was expensive for Coast Air, and the airline lost NOK9.7 million in 2000. To counteract, the company's owners chose to perform a private placement of NOK7.5 million. By April 2001, the liquidity problems in Coast Air were so severe that the employees threatened to file for bankruptcy. Coast Air chose to terminate the Haugesund–Aberdeen route, {{and replace it with a}} service between Bergen and Aberdeen. With the Scandinavian Airlines System take-over of Braathens in May, Coast Air became the largest airline in the country not owned by the SAS Group. In 2003, the company chose to reintroduce the route between Stavanger and Geilo. Following Ryanair's establishment of a route from Haugesunnd to <b>London-Stansted</b> in 2003, Coast Air won the contract for ground services in competition with SAS Ground Services.|$|E

Some of these airports, however, (and most that Ryanair flies to) {{do not have a}} runway long enough or have unsuitable taxiways and gates for long-haul traffic. The only airports from which Ryanair were interested to host long-haul flights that were suitable at the time were Dublin Airport, East Midlands, Frankfurt-Hahn, Glasgow-Prestwick, <b>London-Stansted,</b> Milan-Bergamo, Stockholm-Skavsta and Liverpool Airport. While landings of larger planes such as Boeing 747s are uncommon due to runway length, it's possible to operate long-haul service at those fields.

5000|$|On 8 March 2007 Ryanair {{announced}} that it would commence service between <b>London-Stansted</b> and Maribor in June 2007, three times weekly.

This has remained largely consistent for many years however from Summer 2018, both Glasgow and London-Luton will lose an aircraft (to become one and two based respectively) whilst a new base will open at Aberdeen with a single aircraft and operations are increased at larger bases such as London-Gatwick. Some of these bases may have additional aircraft through {{certain parts of the}} week to service long-haul flights.|$|E
50|$|Norwegian Air Shuttle flew to Stockholm-Arlanda and Flybe Nordic to Tallinn {{during the}} winter season 2011-2012. Ryanair {{operated}} flights to Brussels-Charleroi, <b>London-Stansted,</b> Málaga and Barcelona-Girona only during the summer season 2012. According to Ryanair the period was very successful {{but they could not}} tolerate the raised airport costs of Finavia operated airport and promised to return all routes as soon as price raise would be withdrawn. During the Ryanair's stay there was 27% growth on passenger statistics. Turku Airport was closed partially in July 2014 for the renovations of the runway and taxiways. Terminal 1 and the passenger apron were also renovated. Finavia budgeted 14 million euros for the renovations and improvements. However, Scandinavian Airlines flights to Copenhagen, {{one of the most important}} destinations operated since 2006, were discontinued after the renovations. This had immediate impact in passenger volumes.|$|E
