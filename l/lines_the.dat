5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
