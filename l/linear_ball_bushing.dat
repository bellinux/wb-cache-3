The subject of quality control were bolts and a <b>ball</b> <b>bushing.</b> The Pareto chart and fault mode and effect analysis (FMEA) were used to assess faultiness of the products. The faultiness analysis in case of the bolt enabled us to detect the following defects: failure to keep the dimensional tolerance, dents and imprints, improper roughness, lack of pre-machining, non-compatibility of the electroplating and faults on the surface. Analysis of the <b>ball</b> <b>bushing</b> has also revealed defects such as: failure to keep the dimensional tolerance, dents and imprints, improper surface roughness, lack of surface premachining as well as sharp edges and splitting of the material...|$|R

40|$|Little {{data have}} been {{collected}} that compare the linear velocity of the ball at release versus {{the accuracy of the}} pitch in fast-pitch windmill softball pitching. Previous research suggests that accuracy of a task may decrease as the speed of the task increases. Little research exists that previously compares the speed and accuracy of fastball and change-up pitches in windmill softball pitching. These data may assist the batter in decoding the type of pitch being thrown before the ball is released from the pitcher’s hand. It was hypothesized that the slower change-up pitch might be more accurate and the faster pitch less accurate. Three female subjects (20 ± 1 years old) volunteered to throw ten fastball and ten change-up pitches. Sagittal plane video data were recorded and analyzed with Dartfish Software (v 5. 5). The accuracy of the pitch, <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> velocity, elbow and hip angles of the pitcher at ball release, and mean angular shoulder flexion velocity throughout the pitch were measured. Mean elbow angles at release were significantly different (t = 0. 03), which suggests that the batter might be able to detect the pitch via elbow mechanics. Mean hip angles were similar and showed no significant difference (t= 0. 32), which suggests that the batter could not use hip mechanics to decode the pitch. Spearman Rho correlations (n = 30) between <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> velocity at release and accuracy were not significant (fastball =. 20; change-up = -. 21); however, the change-up pitch best resembled the speed-accuracy relationship...|$|R

In particular, the paper develops relationships connecting the mass, stiffness and damping of a <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> model to the coefficient of restitution and the contact time of the ball with the surface during one bounce. The paper also shows that the ball model parameters are functions of quantities readily determined in an experiment: (i) the height from which the ball is dropped from rest, (ii) the number of bounces, and (iii) the time elapsing between dropping the ball and the ball coming to rest. For a ball with significant bounce, approximate expressions are derived for the model parameters {{as well as for the}} natural frequency and damping ratio.

Based on the equilibrium of the forces and moments acting on the ball, the sliding forces between ball and both carriage and guide are determined without an integrating of the shear stress on contact ellipses. The sliding forces include the rolling forces on the two contacts, the friction moments due to the races curvature, the elastic resistance moments in ball-races contacts, the contact force between the balls and the friction moment between the balls. The program was adapted for the <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> rolling guidance system type KUVE 25 V 1 and the influences of ratio C/P (where C is the basic dynamic load rating and P is equivalent dynamic load) on total friction forces was investigated.

40|$|An optical {{alignment}} mirror mechanism (AMM) {{has been}} developed with angular positioning accuracy of +/- 0. 2 arcsec. This requires the mirror s linear positioning actuators to have positioning resolutions of +/- 112 nm to enable the mirror to meet the angular tip/tilt accuracy requirement. Demonstrated capabilities are 0. 1 arc-sec angular mirror positioning accuracy, which translates into linear positioning resolutions at the actuator of 50 nm. The mechanism consists of a structure with sets of cross-directional flexures that enable the mirror s tip and tilt motion, a mirror with its kinematic mount, and two linear actuators. An actuator comprises a brushless DC motor, a <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> screw, and a piezoelectric brake that holds the mirror s position while the unit is unpowered.

After a 3-yard run by Pierre Thomas, Brees threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. Rather than settle for a six-point lead, and risk a potential Colts game-winning touchdown, the Saints chanced a two-point conversion. Lance Moore received a pass and attempted to stretch the ball out over the goal line as he fell to the ground and rolled over on his head. The ball was kicked away from his hands by defender Jacob Lacey, and the play was ruled an incomplete pass, prompting a coach's challenge from Sean Payton.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze angular velocities of the hip and shoulders in the transverse plane and resultant linear velocity of the ball during a handball power serve. There has been little research of any type in court handball and no known research reports involving the biomechanics of handball. Eighteen trained, competitive handball players, from the professional division to the B class amateur division, served 10 legal serves in a mock court setup. The serve patterns were digitized and angular velocities of hip and shoulder rotation were compared to ball velocities. The primary findings showed that hip rotation preceded shoulder rotation, the shoulders rotated at a higher angular velocity than the hips (429. 796 deg/sec ?? 154. 067, 801. 237 deg/sec ?? 130. 254 respectively), and better players achieved higher maximum and average <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> velocities.

40|$|The {{development}} of novel MRI-guided therapeutic ultrasound methods including potentiated drug delivery and targeted thermal ablation requires extensive testing in small {{animals such as}} rats and mice due to {{the widespread use of}} these species as models of disease. An MRI-compatible, computer-controlled three-axis positioning system was constructed to deliver focused ultrasound exposures precisely to a target anatomy in small animals for high-throughput preclinical drug delivery studies. Each axis was constructed from custom-made nonmagnetic <b>linear</b> <b>ball</b> stages driven by piezoelectric actuators and optical encoders. A range of motion of 5 × 5 × 2. 5 cm 3 was achieved, and initial bench top characterization demonstrated the ability to deliver ultrasound to the brain with a spatial accuracy of 0. 3 mm. Operation of the positioning system within the bore of a clinical 3 T MR imager was feasible, and simultaneous motion and MR imaging did not result in any mutual interference. The system was evaluated in its ability to deliver precise sonications within the mouse brain, linear scanned exposures in a rat brain for blood barrier disruption, and circular scans for controlled heating under MR temperature feedback.
