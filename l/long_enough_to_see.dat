5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E

50|$|Brünnich's {{guillemot}} {{is a rare}} vagrant in European countries {{south of}} the breeding range. In Britain, over 30 individuals have been recorded, but over half of these were tideline corpses. Of those that were seen alive, only three have remained <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> by large numbers of observers. All three were in Shetland - winter individuals in February 1987 and November/December 2005, and a bird in an auk colony in summer 1989. The 1989 and 2005 birds were both found by the same observer, Martin Heubeck.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if he had lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
5|$|Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, {{discovers that}} the {{rumors of a}} curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the mythril smith Takka's adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship, and {{accompany}} her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who has somehow escaped the curse. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They catch up {{to her in the}} Sealed Cave, and with her, battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, however, Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus all disappear before her eyes. As it transpires, the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power. After this, Luneth's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn's curse, but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship. It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid's airship, the player would be able to piece together why: she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys, and therefore has to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley.|$|E

50|$|In 1951 Canine became {{director}} of the Armed Forces Security Agency, which was America's first tentative step toward cryptologic unification. He was there <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> (one year) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the organization lacked. When President Truman created the NSA in 1952, Canine continued as its first director. He died unexpectedly of a pulmonary embolism in March 1969.|$|R
60|$|But {{only for}} a moment did he stand before her; but it was <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her shrink a little, the gladness in her eyes giving way to {{uncertainty}} and a fugitive hope. Suddenly he began to pace the room again, and to talk incoherently. With the flow of words he gradually grew calmer, and, with something of his natural dignity, spoke more rationally.|$|R
25|$|Novalis lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the {{publication}} only of Pollen, Faith and Love or the King and the Queen and Hymns to the Night.

The house was sold for building materials in 1739, and much of its fabric survives, having {{been used in the}} contemporary construction of West Country buildings.|$|E
25|$|Manuel II's reign {{saw another}} {{temporary}} respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, {{he succeeded in}} retaking some territory and held {{it to the end}} of his reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his son undo much of his achievements.|$|E

50|$|Finlay, Dodwell, and Caelli (1984) and Finlay and Dodwell (1987) studied {{perception}} of rotating wheels under stroboscopic illumination when {{the duration of}} each frame was <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for observers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the real rotation. Despite this, the rotation direction was dominated by the wagon-wheel effect.

60|$|Mr. Easterfield did {{not care}} to meet any of his guests, and hoped to find his wife in her room, that he might report, and consult. But, as he {{approached}} the house, he saw at an upper window a female head.

25|$|Although he {{had fallen}} on {{financial}} hard times, Barton S. Tibbits lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his dream survive and prosper. It is only fitting that upon his death, his memorial service would be held on the very stage that he erected at his own sacrifice {{for the benefit of}} Coldwater and the wider community's citizens. His funeral was held August 27, 1889. The opera house also offered memorial services for President McKinley.|$|E
25|$|The FSLN {{originated}} in the milieu of various oppositional organizations, youth and student groups in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The University of Léon, and the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN) in Managua {{were two of the}} principal centers of activity. Inspired by the Revolution and the FLN in Algeria, the FSLN itself was founded in 1961 by Carlos Fonseca, , Tomás Borge and others as The National Liberation Front (FLN).

She remained afloat, and was converted into an accommodation ship and base ship. In this new role, she became a harbour guard ship in 1941, serving at Londonderry (also known as Derry) in Northern Ireland for the remainder of World War II.|$|E

He offers to take over the care of the pregnant female, Coresan, in addition to tending to Kashet. When she lays an egg, he steals it and tends to it in secret. His dragon is a scarlet female he names Avatre. His young dragon goes unnoticed as several other young dragons have been brought to the Jousters' compound as a new training experiment.|$|R
50|$|Brunson met {{his future}} wife, Louise, in 1959 and married her in August 1962. Louise became pregnant, but later that year, a tumor was {{discovered}} in Doyle's neck. When it was operated on, the surgeons found that the cancer had spread.

The bra she invented went {{through a number of}} transformations and become a standard undergarment for women all over the world. Her first two husbands and her son Bill preceded her in death. She was survived by her daughter Polleen Peabody de Mun North Drysdale and two granddaughters. Crosby was buried in the Cimetiere de l'Abbaye de Longchamp, in Boulogne, Departement de la Vendee Pays de la Loire, France.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Life took sides in {{politics}} and international affairs, and published fiery pro-American editorials. Mitchell and Gibson were incensed when Germany attacked Belgium; in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push the United States into the war. Mitchell's seven years studying at Paris art schools made him partial to the French; there was no unbiased coverage of the war. Gibson drew the Kaiser as a bloody madman, insulting Uncle Sam, sneering at crippled soldiers, and shooting Red Cross nurses. Mitchell lived just <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Life crusade result in the U.S. declaration of war in 1917.|$|E
25|$|While defeated, however, {{these states}} were not destroyed; if Hammurabi {{had a plan}} for welding them to Babylon he did not live <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it through. Within {{a few years of}} his death, Elam and Assyria had {{withdrawn}} from Babylon's orbit and revolutions had started in all the conquered territories. The task of dealing with these troubles—and others—fell to Samsu-iluna. Though he campaigned tirelessly and seems to have won frequently, the king proved unable to stop the empire's unwinding. Through it all, however, he did manage to keep the core of his kingdom intact, and this allowed the city of Babylon to cement its position in history.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Schwarz {{directed}} the feature documentary Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon, {{which focused on}} the life and career of porn star Jack Wrangler, who became a superstar in both the gay and straight markets before marrying singer Margaret Whiting and retiring from the business.

25|$|Zevon stated {{previously}} {{that his}} illness {{was expected to}} be terminal within months after diagnosis in the fall of 2002; however, he lived to see the birth of twin grandsons in June 2003 and the release of The Wind on August 26, 2003. Owing in part to the first VH1 broadcasts of Nick Read's documentary Warren Zevon: Keep Me in Your Heart, the album reached number 12 on the U.S. charts, Zevon's highest placement since Excitable Boy.

25|$|Ten years later, she {{undertook}} {{one final}} singing {{tour of the}} United States; however, {{it turned out to}} be a critical, financial and personal failure, owing to the deterioration of her voice through age and wear and tear. From then on she restricted herself to the occasional concert here or there, or to private performances mounted at a little theater she had built in her impressive residence, Craig-y-Nos Castle in Wales. She last sang in public on 24 October 1914, taking part in a Red Cross concert at London's Royal Albert Hall that had been organized to aid victims of World War I.

Constantin Brâncuși entered three plaster busts: Portrait de M. S. Lupesco, L'Enfant and Orgueil (no. 218 - 220). Raymond Duchamp-Villon exhibited Dans le Silence (bronze) and a plaster bust, Œsope (no. 498 and 499). His brother Jacques Villon exhibited six works. Kees van Dongen showed three works, Montmartre (492), Mademoiselle Léda (493) and Parisienne (494).

60|$|We {{were now}} drawing near the hotel, and I felt a certain glow of {{pleasure}} in its gay {{effect on the}} pretty knoll where it stood. In its artless and accidental architecture it was not unlike one of our immense coastwise steamboats. The twilight had thickened to dusk, and the edifice was brilliantly lighted with electrics, story above story, which streamed into the gloom around like the lights of saloon and state-room. The corner of wood making into the meadow hid the station; {{there was no other}} building in sight; the hotel seemed riding at anchor on the swell of a placid sea. I was going to call the Altrurian's attention to this fanciful resemblance when I remembered that he had not been in our country <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> a Fall River boat, and I made toward the house without wasting the comparison upon him. But I treasured it up in my own mind, intending some day to make a literary use of it.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} was settled {{by the appearance}} of the wolf in the second scene, and such a wolf! On few amateur stages do we find so natural an actor for that part, or so good a costume, for Sanch was irresistibly droll in the gray wolf-skin which usually lay beside Miss Celia's bed, now fitted over his back and fastened neatly down underneath, with his own face peeping out at one end, and the handsome tail bobbing gayly at the other. What a comfort that tail was to Sancho, none but a bereaved bow-wow could ever tell. It reconciled him to his distasteful part at once, it made rehearsals a joy, and even before the public he could not resist turning {{to catch a glimpse of}} the noble appendage, while his own brief member wagged with the proud consciousness that though the tail did not match the head, it was <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> of all men and dogs.|$|R
