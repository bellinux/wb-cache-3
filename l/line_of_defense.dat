5|$|The Battle of Five Forks {{occurred}} on April 1, 1865. Five Forks {{is a small}} community in Dinwiddie County, located between Dinwiddie Court House and Petersburg. For this Union victory, Sheridan received reinforcements from the Fifth Corps and a division of cavalry from the Army of the James. Sheridan's plan was to capture the Confederate infantry that had isolated itself beyond the Confederate <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> after pursuing Sheridan at Dinwiddie.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese regrouped {{west of the}} Matanikau, the U.S. forces {{concentrated}} on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift—beginning on 19 September—to establish an unbroken <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> around the Lunga perimeter. Vandegrift's forces' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the Matanikau River from 23–27 September and 6–9 October.|$|E

After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862, Cleburne was promoted to division command and {{served at the}} Battle of Stones River, where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and drove it back to the Nashville Pike and its final <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense.</b> He was promoted to major general on December 13.|$|E
5|$|Prospect Park, Brooklyn, Battle Pass: {{along the}} eastern side of Center Drive in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, is a large granite boulder with a brass plaque affixed, and another marker lies near the road for the Dongan Oak, a very large and old tree felled to block the pass from the British advance.

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense,</b> and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E

5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar {{lines to the}} British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
5|$|When an {{aircraft}} carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a last <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E

The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents {{have all that}} is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung {{does not meet the}} expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E
5|$|Breaking out {{of their}} newly {{established}} bridgehead west of the Canal at {{the northern end of}} the Great Bitter Lake, the IDF launched an offensive from Deversoir toward Ismailia. A combined force of Egyptian paratroopers and commandos fought a delaying battle, falling back upon defensive positions further north under increasing pressure from IDF infantry and armor. By October 22, they were occupying a last <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense,</b> including positions along the Ismailia canal. Though outnumbered, they repulsed a final Israeli effort to capture the city; a United Nations ceasefire was then imposed, bringing the battle to an end. The Egyptians registered a tactical and strategic victory in the defense of Ismailia, stopping an encirclement of their large forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal and ensuring their supply lines remained open.|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense.</b> Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side of}} Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E
50|$|Given this objective, all <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> play are checked {{against all}} {{possible}} defenses for each distribution of opponent's cards, and the objective function is determined {{for each of}} these cases. Each <b>line</b> <b>of</b> play combined with each distribution of opponent's cards can then be assigned a minimum value of the objective function resulting from the best defense for that layout. The optimum <b>line</b> <b>of</b> play is selected as the line that maximises the minimum value of the objective function averaged over all possible layouts. As a result, the optimum solution to the suit combination takes into account all <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> (including all forms of falsecarding), and guards against the best <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense,</b> but is not necessarily optimal in terms of exploiting errors made by the defense.|$|R

5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943. This was the {{beginning}} of a new war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich’s industrial complex. Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection. He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit the first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.|$|E

On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in {{the streets in the}} hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E
