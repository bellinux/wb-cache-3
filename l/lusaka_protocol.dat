5|$|The UN spent $1.6billion from 1994 to 1998 in {{maintaining}} a peacekeeping force. The Angolan military attacked UNITA {{forces in the}} Central Highlands on 4 December 1998, {{the day before the}} MPLA's fourth Congress. Dos Santos told the delegates the next day that he believed war to {{be the only way to}} ultimately achieve peace, rejected the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol,</b> and asked MONUA to leave. In February 1999, the Security Council withdrew the last MONUA personnel. In late 1998, several UNITA commanders, dissatisfied with Savimbi's leadership, formed UNITA Renovada, a breakaway militant group. Thousands more deserted UNITA in 1999 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|Government troops killed Jonas Savimbi on 22 February 2002, in Moxico province. UNITA Vice President António Dembo took over, but {{died from}} {{diabetes}} 12days later on 3 March, and Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba became UNITA's leader. After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over how to proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did say that he had not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> in Luena on 4 April, with Santos and Lukambo observing.|$|E
5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> in Lusaka, Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said {{they would be willing to}} meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E
50|$|Kaunda's successor, {{president}} Frederick Chiluba (1991-2002), {{also played}} an important role in African politics. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks that led to the 1994 <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocols.</b> Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in Mozambique, Rwanda, Angola, and Sierra Leone. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the International Tribunal investigation of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.|$|R
50|$|President Chiluba {{assumed a}} {{somewhat}} higher profile internationally in the mid- and late 1990s. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks {{that led to}} the 1994 <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocols.</b> Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in Mozambique, Rwanda, Angola, and Sierra Leone. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda into the Rwandan genocide in 1994.|$|R
25|$|In 1999 he was {{appointed}} as Minister-Counselor to the Portuguese Embassy in Luanda, Angola, a position he held until 2002. During his post in Luanda, marked {{by the death of}} UNITA’s Angolan rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, and {{the final days of the}} Angolan Civil War, Luís de Almeida Sampaio was a member of the Portuguese delegation (comprising the “troika for peace” with the United States of America and Russia) responsible for the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the clearest}} shift in U.S. foreign policy emerged when President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12865 on 23 September, {{labeling}} UNITA a [...] "continuing {{threat to the}} foreign policy objectives of the U.S." [...] By August 1993, UNITA had gained control over 70% of Angola, but the government's military successes in 1994 forced UNITA to sue for peace. By November 1994, the government had taken control of 60% of the country. Savimbi called the situation UNITA's [...] "deepest crisis" [...] since its creation. It is estimate that perhaps 120,000 {{people were killed in}} the first eighteen months following the 1992 election, nearly half the number of casualties of the previous sixteen years of war. Both sides of the conflict continued to commit widespread and systematic violations of the laws of war with UNITA in particular guilty of indiscriminate shelling of besieged cities resulting in large death toll to civilians. The MPLA government forces used air power in indiscriminate fashion also resulting in high civilian deaths. The <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> of 1994 reaffirmed the Bicesse Accords.|$|E
500|$|In January 1995, U.S. President Clinton sent Paul Hare, his {{envoy to}} Angola, {{to support the}} <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and impress the {{importance}} of the ceasefire onto the Angolan government and UNITA, both in need of outside assistance. The United Nations agreed to send a peacekeeping force on 8 February. Savimbi met with South African President Mandela in May. Shortly after, on 18 June, the MPLA offered Savimbi the position of Vice President under dos Santos with another Vice President chosen from the MPLA. Savimbi told Mandela he felt ready to [...] "serve in any capacity which will aid my nation," [...] but he did not accept the proposal until 12 August. The United States Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency's Angola operations and analysis expanded in an effort to halt weapons shipments, a violation of the protocol, with limited success. The Angolan government bought six Mil Mi-17 from Ukraine in 1995. The government bought L-39 attack aircraft from the Czechoslovakia in 1998 along with ammunition and uniforms from Zimbabwe Defence Industries and ammunition and weapons from Ukraine in 1998 and 1999. U.S. monitoring significantly dropped off in 1997 as events in Zaire, the Congo and then Liberia occupied more of the U.S. government's attention. UNITA purchased more than 20 FROG-7 transporter erector launchers (TEL) and three FOX 7 missiles from the North Korean government in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|As Savimbi resumed fighting, the U.N. {{responded by}} {{implementing}} an embargo against Unita through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173. [...] The UN-commissioned Fowler Report detailed how Unita continued to finance its war effort through {{the sales of}} diamonds (later {{to be known as}} blood diamonds) and resulted in further sanctions in the form of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295 and action to end to the trade in blood diamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. [...] The U.S. government, which had never recognized the legitimacy of the MPLA, finally recognized the Angolan government, further alienating Savimbi. [...] After failed talks in 1993 to end the conflict, another agreement, the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol,</b> was implemented in 1994 to form a government of national unity. [...] In 1995, U.N. peacekeepers arrived. [...] But Unita broke away from the Lusaka agreement in 1998, citing violations of it by the MPLA. [...] In late 1998, a militant group calling itself Unita Renovada broke away from mainstream Unita, when several Unita commanders dissatisfied with the leadership of Jonas Savimbi ended their allegiance to his organization. Thousands more deserted Unita in 1999 and 2000.|$|E
50|$|After {{the failed}} peace {{agreement}} signed in Lisbon (1991) and the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> (1994), Samakuva led a party {{delegation to the}} Joint Commission established to monitor {{the implementation of the}} <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{reiterated the}} {{importance}} it {{attached to the}} implementation of the Peace Accords, the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and relevant Security Council resolutions, and was deeply concerned about the delays in the implementation of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and the worsening humanitarian situation. The importance of rehabilitating the Angolan economy was emphasised. It was noted that in Resolution 976 (1995), the Council expected that UNAVEM III would complete its mandate in February 1997, but that the implementation of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> was behind schedule.|$|E
50|$|The Bicesse Accords largely punished {{the weaker}} {{signatory}} while the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> guaranteed UNITA's hold over important governorships.|$|E
5000|$|The {{importance}} of full {{implementation of the}} peace agreements, including the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol,</b> for Angola was emphasised, and all parties were reminded of their obligations.|$|E
50|$|The Security Council again {{welcomed the}} signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between UNITA and the Angolan {{government}} on 4 April 2002 relating to the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> Furthermore, {{the efforts of the}} Angolan government to promote peaceful and secure conditions and national reconciliation and the efforts of UNITA to become active in the political process in the country were welcomed. The implementation of the Accordos de Paz, <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and relevant Security Council resolutions was stressed, while the disbanding of UNITA's military wing was commended.|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{recalled}} {{a statement from}} its President expressing readiness to amend or exempt measures imposed against UNITA if progress had been made. It welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between UNITA and the government on 4 April 2002 relating to the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> Furthermore, {{the efforts of the}} Angolan government to promote peaceful and secure conditions and national reconciliation in the country were welcomed. The implementation of the Accordos de Paz, <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and relevant Security Council resolutions was stressed, with UNITA urged to fully co-operate with the demobilisation, quartering and reintegration of its troops into civil society.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol,</b> {{signed in}} Lusaka, Zambia on October 31, 1994, {{attempted}} {{to end the}} Angolan Civil War by integrating and disarming UNITA and starting national reconciliation. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of the}} protocol on November 20.|$|E
50|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1087: There {{was slow}} {{progress}} in the peace process, including implementing the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The Council approved the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's recommendation {{to reduce the size}} of UNAVEM III during February 1997, due to donor fatigue.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{reaffirmed the}} {{importance}} of the implementation of the Acordos de Paz. It welcomed the signing of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> in Lusaka, Tanzania, on 20 November 1994 as an important step towards reconciliation and peace in Angola. If there was a ceasefire, the United Nations presence could be expanded significantly, and further delays in implementing the peace accords were unacceptable. Reports of renewed clashes in the country after the implementation of the ceasefire caused concern in the Council which would have effects on the implementation of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol,</b> the civilian population and the mandate of UNAVEM II. All states were reminded to implement the arms embargo against UNITA in Resolution 864 (1993).|$|E
50|$|In 1998 the Angolan {{government}} bought {{ammunition and}} uniforms from Zimbabwe Defence Industries {{in violation of}} the arms embargo established under the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> Thanks to foreign arms shipments the Angolan government regained the upper hand, ultimately ending the war in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Mackenzie {{served as}} a {{military}} leader with National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita). He defected from UNITA in 1992, during the Angolan Civil War.Previously part of UNITA, Mackenzie's forces have been largely integrated into the FAA under the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Executive Outcomes employees, Captains Daniele Zanata and Raif St Clair (who {{was also}} {{involved}} in the aborted Seychelles Coup of 1981), fought {{on behalf of the}} MPLA against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the 1990s in violation of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{expressed}} concern at {{the effects of}} the civil war on the humanitarian situation, and welcomed steps taken by the Angolan government to implement the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and other agreements. It also reaffirmed its commitment to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola.|$|E
50|$|The {{preamble}} of {{the resolution}} deplored the failure of UNITA to complete its tasks under the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and noted declarations by UNITA concerning the complete demilitarisation of its forces and of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation (GURN) legalising UNITA as a political party.|$|E
5000|$|UNMA was {{established}} for an initial period {{of six months}} until 15 February 2003 and would be headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

50|$|The Security Council deplored {{the deteriorating}} {{political}} and security situation in Angola, {{primarily due to}} the failure of UNITA to complete its obligations under the Acordos de Paz, <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and relevant Security Council resolutions. Additionally, it noted that positive steps were taken to build confidence in the peace process.|$|E
50|$|United Nations Security Council {{resolution}} 1045, adopted unanimously on 8 February 1996, after reaffirming Resolution 696 (1991) and {{all subsequent}} resolutions on Angola, the Council discussed {{the implementation of}} the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol,</b> and extended the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III) until 8 May 1996.|$|E
5000|$|While the UN {{declared}} {{the presidential election}} generally [...] "free and fair," [...] fighting continued. 120,000 {{people were killed in}} the first eighteen months following the 1992 election, nearly half the number of casualties of the previous sixteen years of war. The <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> of 1994 reaffirmed the Bicesse Accords.|$|E
50|$|Established {{to assist}} the Government of Angola and the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) in {{restoring}} peace and achieving national reconciliation {{on the basis of}} the Peace Accords for Angola, signed on 31 May 1991, the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> signed on 20 November 1994, and relevant Security Council resolutions.|$|E
50|$|Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on November 15, 1994 {{to boost}} support symbolically for the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> Mugabe and Mandela both {{said they would}} be willing to meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come.|$|E
5000|$|The Security Council {{reaffirmed the}} need for the full {{implementation}} of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> and other agreements, and supported adjustments to the mandate of UNOA. It viewed the United Nations presence in Angola as necessary to contribute to the consolidation of peace through the promotion of political, military,human rights, humanitarian and economic goals.|$|E
50|$|UNAVEM III {{was then}} {{established}} {{to help restore}} peace and promote national reconciliation. It had a maximum deployment of 7,000 troops, 350 military observers and 260 police observers. The latter two groups would be immediately deployed to monitor the ceasefire, while the infantry units would be deployed {{when there was a}} cessation of hostilities, a provision of all relevant military data and where UNITA's forces would be placed. The importance of a mine clearance programme and establishment a United Nations radio station was stressed. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report monthly on the mandate of UNAVEM III and the implementation of the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> If the parties did not co-operate, the role of the United Nations in Angola would be reviewed; if there was co-operation, UNAVEM III would be terminated after the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> was fully implemented, expected by February 1997.|$|E
50|$|American {{relations}} with the Frontline States reached their peak during the human rights push of the Carter administration. Under the Reagan administration's Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chester Crocker, the Frontline States were engaged diplomatically to reach landmark peace accords between South Africa, Mozambique, Angola (<b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol),</b> and Namibia (New York Accords).|$|E
50|$|As peace-building adviser, Gonzalez {{took part}} in {{relevant}} peace negotiations in Africa, including the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> for the Angolan peace process (1994); the Bangui Peace Accord for Central African Republic (1997), the Dar es Salaam Accord for the Demilitarization of the Ituri in DRC (2004) and the Pretoria Talks for the Burundi peace-building process (April 2009).|$|E
50|$|The Security Council {{began by}} reaffirming the {{sovereignty}} and {{territorial integrity of}} Angola {{and the importance of}} the implementation of the peace agreements, including the <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> It stressed that the Government of Angola and UNITA had to take urgent and decisive steps forward in the peace process to ensure the continued involvement of the international community.|$|E
5000|$|The Government of Angola and {{specifically}} UNITA had to urgently complete {{the implementation of}} the Acordos de Paz and <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol</b> peace agreements. The Council noted that overall, {{there was a lack of}} significant progress, mainly due to UNITA not fulfilling its obligations. It recognised the important role of MONUA at this stage in the peace process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resolution}} {{noted that}} {{the formation of a}} Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was again delayed because UNITA did not comply with the established timetable {{in the context of the}} <b>Lusaka</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The implementation of political and military aspects of the peace agreements had also been delayed and stressed the importance of UNITA in fulfilling its obligations.|$|E
