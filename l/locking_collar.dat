50|$|As the {{war effort}} began winding down in 2011, Fisher Enterprises and Smith Enterprise ceased their {{collaboration}} and Smith made some changes to the M14 DC and renamed the new model as the Wind Talker. These features included a new baffle design, a shortened <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> made from nitrocarburized stainless steel and revolver cylinder cuts on the coupler which allowed propellant gas to exit just forward of the <b>locking</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{pressure}} fuzed landmines this {{is achieved}} by having the fuze react differently based on {{the duration of the}} pressure impulse. For example, a number of Italian landmines like the VS-1.6 use an air system, where air is forced through a small hole into an air bladder, the inflation of which rotates a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> and releases the striker into the detonator. The sudden impulse from impact or explosion does not have sufficient duration to inflate the bladder and rotate the <b>locking</b> <b>collar,</b> whereas steady pressure from a vehicle's wheel or track does.|$|E
50|$|The current Opinel knife {{consists}} of a blade, wooden handle, stainless steel metal clamping band, stainless pivot pin (axle), and (except {{in the case of}} the smaller models) a stainless steel Virobloc <b>locking</b> <b>collar,</b> which locks the blade open or closed.|$|E
50|$|Collars can be {{made from}} lighter {{materials}} such as cotton, or heavier materials such as leather. Steel collars are also worn by some and lockable (metal) necklaces are also regarded as a form of collar. A very few even choose to wear permanently <b>locking</b> <b>collars</b> (these click into place and have no unlocking key), that cannot be removed except by cutting the steel.|$|R

50|$|The locking collar(Virobloc) was {{patented}} in 1955 by Marcel Opinel, and is {{only found}} on the larger Opinel models (#6 and up). While simple, the locking mechanism is quite sturdy, and converts the folding Opinel knife into nearly {{the equivalent of a}} fixed-blade knife for all practical purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} the <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> tapers, the blade does not loosen over time and can be fixed firmly even once the mechanism is quite worn. In 2000 the <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> was modified slightly to allow the blade to be locked in the closed as well as the open position. This feature prevents the blade from opening by accident when carried in a pocket.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 {{the body}} of the {{suppressor}} was changed to titanium and this dropped the weight of the suppressor from over 2 lbs to 1.42 lbs. In 2009 Fisher designed an optional <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> for use on the M1A SOOCOM rifle, which uses a different style of flash suppressor/muzzle brake.|$|E
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board later {{reported}} that Walton had improperly reinstalled the rear <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> {{on the elevator}} control torque tube. This allowed the torque tube to move rearward during his flight and loosened the elevator control cable tension. The outcome of the failed repair was an inflight loss of pitch control, without which Walton could not control the aircraft's altitude.|$|E
5000|$|A {{live axle}} is {{probably}} the most common axle setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the axle spins along with the wheel, sprocket, and other pieces anchored to the axle. Since the axle spins, bearings are mounted to the swing arm frame. This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set screws or <b>locking</b> <b>collars.</b> The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the axle. This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the axle and the components.|$|R

50|$|Dogs can {{be fitted}} with {{microchip}} implants {{that make them}} identifiable if they are found. This enables a dog to be identified unless the chip has been removed or has degraded, been assimilated or otherwise been deactivated. Similar methods such as DNA sampling or ear-tattooing are used to identify individual animals and to deter dognappers. Other prevention devices include flashing lights on the dog's collar and strong leashes <b>locked</b> to the <b>collar.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1 {{guns were}} {{upgraded}} to Marks 5 and 8 {{in the late}} 1930s. The Mark 5's have a larger chamber to permit larger charges and a new liner with a heavier taper carbon steel along with a liner locking ring and <b>locking</b> <b>collar.</b> The Mark 8, similar to the Mark 5, had a uniform rifling with a chromium plated bore for increased life.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Opinel {{is designed}} to be opened with two hands, and a nail nick is provided on the blade. It is possible to adjust the fitting of the safety <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> in the event that the latter is either too tight or too loose. Those practiced in the art often utilize the coup du savoyard—tap the heel of the handle hard on the table once and the blade should open slightly from the handle, allowing it to be rotated into position with the thumb.|$|E
50|$|To arm an SB-33, a small pin {{is removed}} {{from the side of the}} mine. After the mine has been armed, gradual {{pressure}} on the pressure plate (i.e. when the victim steps on it) rotates a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> until the striker is released, which flips into a stab-detonator and the mine explodes. However, sudden pressure (e.g. from a mine-clearing charge) causes the striker to lock the rotating collar in position for the duration of the pressure, preventing the mine from detonating. The combination of low metal content and resistance to overpressure make the mine extremely difficult to remove.|$|E
40|$|PT Sinar Terang Logamjaya is an {{automotive}} components manufacturer for motorcycles and car). The {{industry is}} dealing with materials from iron plate and process with sheet metal shaping techniques to produce products. One of the product is a motorcycle component, is called Oil <b>Lock</b> <b>Collar.</b> This product is been made in large quantities to meet demands. Hence, it is resulted in the workload experienced by workers and will touch on the productivity of workers. Modified Cooper Harper Scale (MCH) is a 10 -point scale that was originally produced to assess the subjective workload of airplane pilots. The original index probes overall ease of handling of the selected task or required operation and asks more specific questions related to the aircraft characteristics, the demands on the pilot, and finally, the pilot rating. This method is fit to evaluate work activities with the manual controls. MCH scale decision tree shaped with a rating scale from very easy (point 1) to very difficult (10 points). This study has two purposes. First wqs modified version of MCH scale which {{was used to measure}} the subjective workload of performing in industrial process. The second purpose was concerned with the categorizing task activities into under load category, optimal category, or overload category. Based on the framework that has been built, 8 operators were selected and they have to fill up the form to be assessed by MCH to obtain operator feel about their tasks. The results of the data processing indicate that 12 task activities were under load categorized, 5 task activities were optimal category and 11 task activities were overload category. This result can be useful for the industry to change work processes or maximum demand of products. Keywords: Subjective Workload, Framework, Measurement, Cooper Harper Scal...|$|R
2500|$|Now {{bedridden}} from cancer, John instructs Amanda to abduct Dr. Lynn Denlon {{from her}} hospital. She {{is brought to}} John and instructed to keep him alive until the other victim has completed his game. As John explains the rules, Amanda <b>locks</b> a <b>collar</b> around Lynn's throat that connects to John's heart rate monitor and will detonate if John dies or Lynn moves out of range. The other victim, Jeff, awakens in a box in an abandoned meatpacking plant and learns from a microcassette recorder that he must undergo tests which will lead him to [...] "the man responsible {{for the loss of}} his child". Jeff has become unstable and vengeful in the three years since his son Dylan was killed by a drunk driver, and is now estranged from his wife and neglects his daughter Corbett.|$|R
5000|$|On Saturday, 14 August 1915, the 08:45 Birmingham to Euston express {{passenger}} train hauled by LNWR George the Fifth Class locomotive No. 1489 lost a taper pin; its {{purpose was to}} <b>lock</b> a screwed <b>collar</b> which retained the offside coupling rod to its crank pin. The coupling rod detached and struck one of the sleepers on the up line; pushing the track out of alignment just as the 08:30 Euston to Holyhead Irish Mail train approached. It consisted of 15 coaches hauled by two locomotives LNWR Renown Class No. 1971 and Precedent Class No. 1189 and was travelling at 60 miles per hour. Both locomotives and every carriage was derailed; several being thrown down an embankment, killing 10 passengers and injuring 21 more. The approximate location of the collision was [...] between Weedon and Stowe Hill tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{normally}} olive green or sand-coloured and is circular with two circular bands around the circumference, which act to cushion shock when the mine is deployed from the air. The fuze is air pressure driven with {{pressure on the}} top plate of the mine forcing air into a diaphragm which exerts pressure on the striker. Shocks from overpressure are too short to inflate the diaphragm; additionally the striker must first rotate a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> before it can activate the mine, this requires gradual pressure giving even greater resistance to shock. The sealed nature of the mine means {{that it can be}} deployed in up to 1 meter of water.|$|E
5000|$|A sheave {{can also}} {{refer to a}} pulley which has an {{adjustable}} operating diameter for use with a mechanical belt. This is accomplished by constructing the pulley out of several pieces. The two main [...] "halves" [...] of the pulley can be moved closer together or farther apart, thus altering the operational diameter. The usual construction {{is some sort of}} <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> or set screws to secure the components, one half with a threaded central shaft and one half with a threaded center. By rotating the components one can [...] "screw" [...] the parts closer together or further apart, thus changing the distance between the two halves and allowing the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove. The adjustments are constrained to a specific range of size and are not limitless. One application of this is the Variomatic automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|Less {{well-known}} but plentiful is {{a family}} of projectors based around a design originated by Sawyer's and later sold under other brand names. That manufacturer's first slide projectors, in the late 1950s, had used straight trays. In 1963, the Sawyer's Rotomatic, the first version using circular trays (called Rototrays), was introduced. These are distinguished by the round tray being in an upright orientation, like a Ferris wheel. Unlike the Carousel tray's use of a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> to hold the slide in the tray, the Rototray held slides in place using friction {{against the side of}} each slide. Projectors using the 100-slide Rototray were backward-compatible with the TDC-Universal straight slide trays that had been popular since the late 1950s. The 1960s would also see the introduction of a plethora of less popular tray designs, most incompatible with each other, introduced by manufacturers possibly hoping to profit from the Razor-and-blades business model.|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{replication}} forks are universally {{powered by}} ring-shaped, hexameric helicases that encircle and unwind DNA. To {{better understand the}} molecular mechanisms and control of these enzymes, we used an ensemble of methods to investigate the bacterial replicative helicase, DnaB. A 3. 3 Å crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus DnaB complexed with nucleotide reveals a new conformational state for this family of motor proteins. Electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering studies confirm the state seen crystallographically, showing that the DnaB ATPase domains and an associated N-terminal collar transition between two physical states in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Mutant helicases <b>locked</b> into either <b>collar</b> state are active, but display different capacities to support critical activities such as duplex translocation and primase-dependent RNA synthesis. Our findings establish the DnaB collar as a key auto-regulatory hub that controls {{the ability of the}} helicase to transition between different functional states in response to nucleotide and both replication initiation and elongation factors...|$|R
50|$|In a {{synchromesh}} gearbox, {{to correctly}} match {{the speed of}} the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the <b>collar</b> <b>locking</b> into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings, the latter being spelled balk in the U.S.). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone clutch and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{varieties}} of Luer taper connections: locking and slipping. Their trade names are confusingly {{similar to the}} nonproprietary names. [...] "Luer-Lok" [...] and [...] "Luer-slip" [...] are registered trademarks of Becton Dickinson. [...] "Luer-Lok" [...] style connectors are often generically referred to as [...] "Luer lock", and [...] "Luer-slip" [...] style connectors may be generically referred to as [...] "slip tip". Luer lock fittings are securely joined {{by means of a}} tabbed hub on the female fitting which screws into threads in a sleeve on the male fitting. The Luer lock fitting was developed in the United States by Fairleigh S. Dickinson.'Luer lock' style connectors are divided into two types [...] "one piece luer lock" [...] and [...] "two piece luer <b>lock</b> or rotating <b>collar</b> luer lock". One piece Luer lock comes as a single mold, and locking is achieved by rotating the entire luer connector or system. In two piece luer lock, a free rotating collar with threads is assembled to the luer and the locking is achieved by rotating the collar.|$|R
5000|$|Most modern manual-transmission {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft. The locking mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or dog collar) on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or dogs) on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally locked to the shaft and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of linkages, so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when [...] "shifting gears", the <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, {{in the other direction}} selects another.|$|E
50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and locking ring. With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner locking ring. The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{design for}} carabiners (tether hooks used in mountaineering, rock climbing, and rescue) {{is intended to}} make it possible to operate these devices even while wearing thick gloves. According to the proposal, the gate of a carabiner would be capable of swinging either toward or away from the hook body, relative to the closed position. The gate would be spring-biased to return to the closed position. An external <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> would be pinned to an internal locking rod that would be springloaded to slide the collar longitudinally over the gate to lock the gate in the closed position. The gate would be unlocked by sliding the collar axially against the spring load. To reduce the probability of inadvertent unlocking, the rod-and-collar mechanism would include two locking buttons. Optionally, the rod-and-collar mechanism could be replaced with an external locking mechanism based on a longer collar...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] (literally [...] "black reading princess"), or Black Biblioprincess. She is a {{young girl}} with long black hair tinted purple and large dark pink eyes, and a metal box with a <b>lock</b> at her <b>collar,</b> where a ribbon would {{normally}} go. She is the custodian of the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian housing 900,666 Phantom Books. In novel volume 1 chapter 4 Huey is looking for the library his grandfather left him, but can't find in his mansion. She asks him if he has heard of 'Vase World', of Chinese legend. She tells him that it eventually came into the possession of his grandfather. In the last pages of the chapter Huey learns that Dalian is the vase world, and inside her is contained the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian. Because of this, she generally considers herself of great importance and believes herself to be more knowledgeable than most humans, even {{going so far as}} to praise others in a presumptuous manner when they exhibit more wisdom than she anticipated. She also has another self. She appears as the mysterious librarian inside the archives of the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian. In the last episode of the anime television series, her [...] "other self" [...] overlaps with the current one in an attempt to save Huey when he almost lost his conscience in the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian. When asked a question that calls for a [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answer, she will reply appropriately in English rather than Japanese. She is often seen as a judgmental and arbitrary character, which clashes with her unexpected weakness for sweets; whenever presented with something sweet, or the opportunity to eat something sweet, a small lock of her hair will flick out from the rest of her head. She and Huey appear to share a very formal and business-like, but in reality is a really lighthearted and caring, relationship. She is shown to be considerate of others but reluctant to show as much in a tsundere fashion style.|$|R
40|$|A {{coupling}} device for tubular members of large truss structures with a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> {{being the only}} moving part is described. Each tubular member is constructed with an end bell section that has a belled flange with a mating face, and a necked area which is smaller in diameter than the tubular members to be joined. A split ring is affixed to each tubular member and is constructed so that when two tubular members are laterally moved into axial alignment and the collar is rotated over it, the split ring loads the joint with axial forces by pressing the belled flange mating surfaces together, and a preloading force {{is provided by the}} collar mating with a taper {{on the outside of the}} split rings. All free play is thereby removed by preloaded force. A major object is to provide an ability to remove and replace individual tubular members without disturbing other structural parts of a truss structure. An additional anticipated use of this joint is to couple high pressure fluid lines...|$|E
