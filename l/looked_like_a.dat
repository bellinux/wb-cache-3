5|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Chicago Bears, Johnson caught a pass with 31seconds left in {{regulation}} {{in the end zone}} for what <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> game-winning touchdown. However, referee Gene Steratore ruled the catch incomplete, saying that Johnson had not maintained possession of the ball through the entire process of the catch. The Lions lost the game by a score of 1914.|$|E
5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to {{the features of the}} people it mentions. Jesus probably <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> typical Jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to his ascetic and itinerant lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E

5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared {{in the image of}} Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Students {{moved into}} the center on May 8, 1987. The school {{remained}} unfinished, but the dormitory levels had been completed. Students had formerly been housed at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. In 1988, before the center's dedication, a few Jerusalem locals complained that {{the arrangement of the}} windows at night <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Christian cross. The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use the symbol of the cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E

5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E
5|$|For Pokiri, Mahesh {{sported a}} longer hair style {{than in his}} {{previous}} films and shed five kilograms of weight. He used a new wardrobe and the same pair of shoes throughout the film. Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl who <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} {{has led to the}} description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{physically}} demanding, {{especially for}} the passenger. This is reflected in most in the Swedish term for passenger, burkslav, roughly translated as trunk/body/barrel-slave.
