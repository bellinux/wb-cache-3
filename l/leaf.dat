5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that <b>leaf</b> shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as <b>leaf</b> miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of <b>leaf</b> colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help undermine the camouflage of herbivores.

5|$|Whelihan {{replaced}} <b>Leaf</b> on November 8 after <b>Leaf</b> completed only 4 of 15 {{passes and}} became starter {{on a permanent}} basis afterwards. <b>Leaf</b> finished the season having played 10 games with 1,289 passing yards, 45.3% completed passes, 2 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions, with an abysmally poor quarterback rating of 39.0.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} <b>leaf</b> veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has <b>leaf</b> veins which terminate in the notches between the <b>leaf</b> tips, rather than extend to the tip of the <b>leaf,</b> as is found in the <b>leaf</b> structure of other members of this family.|$|E

5|$|After <b>Leaf</b> threw four {{interceptions in}} the first half against the New York Giants in the Week 4 game (September 28), coach Kevin Gilbride benched <b>Leaf</b> in favor of Craig Whelihan. The {{following}} game on October 4 against the Indianapolis Colts matched <b>Leaf</b> against the number one 1998 draft pick Peyton Manning. Indianapolis won 17–12, as both quarterbacks completed 12 of 23 passes with an interception each, but <b>Leaf</b> threw for 160 yards (23 more than Manning), and only Manning threw a touchdown. Manning was never sacked; <b>Leaf</b> was sacked four times. Inside the final two minutes and San Diego down 14–6, Leaf's 56-yard pass to Charlie Jones set up a one-yard Natrone Means touchdown run, but Leaf's potential tying two-point conversion pass to Webster Slaughter was incomplete.|$|E
5|$|After his NFL career ended, <b>Leaf</b> {{completed}} his degree at Washington State.

5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these <b>leaf</b> blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the <b>leaf</b> surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its <b>leaf</b> edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the <b>leaf</b> surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the <b>leaf</b> surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the <b>leaf</b> surface.|$|E

5|$|<b>Leaf</b> {{would again}} play poorly, as he threw four interceptions on December 3 against the San Francisco 49ers and {{completed}} only 9 of 23 passes on December 10 against the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens.

In the Chargers' final drive, with nearly two minutes remaining in the game, <b>Leaf</b> completed a 10-yard pass to Curtis Conway that referees ruled was six inches short of the end zone. On first down, however, miscommunication between <b>Leaf</b> and running back Jermaine Fazande resulted in a fumble and 8-yard loss, and the next two plays followed by a penalty forced a fourth down and goal 10 yards from the end zone, and Leaf's fourth down pass was incomplete. On {{the final game of}} the season on December 24, <b>Leaf</b> made a 71-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Graham on the first play from scrimmage, but San Diego lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 34–21. In the game, <b>Leaf</b> completed 15 of 29 passes for 171 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception and fumbled his final snap.

5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all <b>leaf</b> litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the <b>leaf</b> litter in a region. The <b>leaf</b> litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of <b>leaf</b> fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of the <b>leaf</b> litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.|$|E
