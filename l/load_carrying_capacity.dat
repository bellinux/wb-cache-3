25|$|After {{the first}} stage of {{aggradation}} and sediment transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily erodible sediment upstream, thus decreasing its sediment load and increasing its <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> downstream. With more capacity downstream, the river began to incise into the alluvial fan it previously created, moving sediment stored for a long time on its original floodplains to newer floodplains even further downstream.|$|E

The concept of the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM) is {{a powerful tool for}} estimating nominal probability level of failure associated with uncertainties and it is the method invoked for the reliability estimations.

25|$|In some cases, pipe piles {{are filled}} with {{concrete}} to provide additional moment capacity or corrosion resistance. In the United Kingdom, this is generally not done {{in order to reduce}} the cost. In these cases corrosion protection is provided by allowing for a sacrificial thickness of steel or by adopting a higher grade of steel. If a concrete filled pipe pile is corroded, most of the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the pile will remain intact due to the concrete, while it will be lost in an empty pipe pile.|$|E
25|$|When , the truss {{is said to}} be statically determinate, {{because the}} (m+3) {{internal}} member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2j equilibrium equations, once we know the external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member is taken out (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the members.|$|E

40|$|Modular steel {{scaffolds}} {{are commonly}} used as supporting scaffolds in construction, and structural instability is always an important design consideration for their safe and effective use. This paper presents a systematic study on the structural behaviour of multi-storey door-type modular steel scaffolds through both experimental and numerical investigations. Three one-storey and three two-storey modular steel scaffolds were built and tested to failure {{in order to examine}} the structural behaviour of typical multi-storey door-type modular steel scaffolds. Test data from literature on three-storey door-type modular steel scaffolds with similar member configuration and geometrical dimension were also adopted for investigation. An advanced non-linear finite element model with high performance beam-column elements was established to evaluate the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of these scaffolds under idealised boundary conditions. Moreover, in order to provide practical design guidance on the safe and effective use of multi-storey door-type modular steel scaffolds, the structural behaviour of these scaffolds under a wide range of positional and rotational restraints at the top and the bottom of the scaffolds is also examined through an extensive parametric study. It is demonstrated that the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of these scaffolds are sensitive to both the types and the magnitudes of restraints provided at the top and the bottom of the scaffolds, and also to the presence of cross-bracings. Hence, the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of two-storey and three-storey modular steel scaffolds are only 85 and 80 % of those of one-storey modular steel scaffolds respectively. Moreover, depending on the boundary conditions provided at the top and the bottom of the modular steel scaffolds, the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> are found to vary from 50 to 120 % of those obtained from tests. Engineers are thus urged to design, specify and erect multi-storey door-type modular steel scaffolds with caution. Careful interpretation on test results and safe load data is essential to the safe use of these scaffolds on sites, in particular, for those scaffolds with boundary conditions significantly different from those adopted in tests.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to service load test {{a representative sample of}} old reinforced concrete bridges (some of them historic and some of them scheduled for demolition) with the results being used to create a database so the performance of similar bridges could be predicted. The types of bridges tested included two reinforced concrete open spandrel arches, two reinforced concrete filled spandrel arches, one reinforced concrete slab bridge, and one two span reinforced concrete stringer bridge. The testing of each bridge consisted of applying a static load at various locations on the bridges and monitoring strains and deflections in critical members. The load was applied by means of a tandem axle dump truck with varying magnitudes of load. At each load increment, the truck was stopped at predetermined transverse and longitudinal locations and strain and deflection data were obtained. The strain data obtained were then evaluated in relation to the strain values predicted by traditional analytical procedures and a <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the bridges was determined based on the experimental data. The response of a majority of the bridges tested was considerably lower than that predicted by analysis. Thus, the safe <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of the bridges were greater than those predicted by the analytical models, and in a few cases, the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> were found to be three or four times greater than calculated values. However, the test results of one bridge were lower than those predicted by analysis and thus resulted in the analytical rating being reduced. The results of the testing verified that traditional analytical methods, in most instances, are conservative and that the safe <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of a majority of the reinforced concrete bridges are considerably greater than what one would determine on the basis of analytical analysis alone. In extrapolating the results obtained from diagnostic load tests to levels greater than those placed on the bridge during the load test, care must be taken to ensure safe bridge performance at the higher load levels. To extrapolate the load test results from the bridges tested in this investigation, the method developed by Lichtenstein in NCHRP Project 12 - 28 (13) A was used...|$|R

End moment ratio ρ (=M_ 2 /M_ 1, M_ 2, M_ 1 = bending moment {{at the ends of}} a specimen, |M_ 2 |＜|M_ 1 |) and lateral slenderness ratio ℓ_b/j_y (ℓ_b=laterally unbraced length, j_y=radius of gyration of a cross section about weak axis) were selected for the experimental variables. The test program concists of three series. For two of them with the value of ρ equal to 0 or - 0. 4, the values of ℓ_b/j_y are 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105.
