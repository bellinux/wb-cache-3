According to government data, the figure for 2015 was 181 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The MDG mark was 143 per 100,000. A further reduction of maternal mortality is now part of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.The target of the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) is to reduce the global maternal mortality rate (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{difficulties}} in testing the hadron models by using the N ∗ parameters extracted from the empirical amplitude analyses of the πN and γN reaction data. As an alternative or perhaps a more advantageous approach, we present a Hamiltonian formulation that can relate the pion production dynamics and the constituent quark models of N ∗ structure. The application of the approach in investigating the ∆ and N ∗ (S 11) excitations is reviewed. It is found that while the ∆ excitation can be described satisfactory, the πN scattering in S 11 channel can not be described by the constituent quark models based on either the one-gluonexchange or one-meson-exchange mechanisms. A phenomenological quark-quark potential has been constructed to reproduce the S 11 amplitude. One of the challenging theoretical problems is to understand the hadron structure within Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD). There exist two different approaches. The most fundamental one is the Lattice QCD calculation. The second one is to develop various QCD-inspired models.

40|$|The {{field of}} ultra-high energy cosmic rays made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>progresses</b> last years with large area {{experiments}} {{such as the}} Pierre Auger Observatory, HiRes and the Telescope Array. A suppression of the cosmic ray flux at energies above $ 5. 5 x 10 ^{ 19 }$ eV is observed {{at a very high}} level of significance but the origin of this cut-off is not established: it can be due to the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin suppression but it can also reflect the upper limit of particle acceleration in astrophysical objects. The key characteristics to be measured on cosmic rays is their composition. Upper limits are set above $ 10 ^{ 18 }$ eV on primary photons and neutrinos and primary cosmic rays are expected to be hadrons. Identifying the precise composition (light or heavy nuclei) will permit to solve the puzzle.

40|$|Positioning {{techniques}} made <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> in {{the last}} decades, thanks to the wide usage of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). During a satellite survey, interruption or complete absence of positioning service can happen due to obstacle presence or constrained environments. To avoid these problems, it is suitable to simulate a positioning survey determining {{the number of the}} GNSS satellites in view and their availability trend for a selected location. Using more than one constellation the number of the observed satellites is increased and the continuity and reliability of positioning significantly improved. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the impact of multi-GNSS constellation on positioning calculation in terms of number of available satellites and geometrical distribution in the sky. A simulation is conducted for different cut-off angles, ranging from 0 ° to 30 °: satellites visibility predictions are performed for the city of Benevento (Italy) using short observing sessions (96 daily) and considering GPS, GLONASS and GALILEO constellation. The benefits of their combinations are investigated: in order to assess the observation quality, the Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP) is used as criteria to prove how it is possible to reduce degradation of the position accuracy by using multi-GNSS combinations. Particularly, GPS+GLONASS supplies higher performances compared to the other solutions. Because the low number of satellites in view, the contribution of GALILEO is limited, and its presence instead of GPS or GLONASS in the two constellation solutions produces a decrease in positioning accuracy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} {{is focused on}} early {{recognition}} of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Two large early arthritis recognition clinics were started in Leiden and Groningen. The results showed that this initiative reduces the GP-delay significantly. Secondly, it was investigated whether an association between shorter symptom duration and a beneficial outcome in RA exists. Furthermore, it was questioned {{whether there was a}} confined period in which the start of DMARD therapy has a more beneficial effect. In the third part of the thesis certain disease features/ symptoms were investigated in more detail to assess if they had a prognostic or diagnostic value in arthralgia, early arthritis or RA patients. Finally, in the last part focused on mortality in RA. It was observed that patients that were treated early and with aggressive DMARD therapy had no increased mortality compared to the Dutch general population. In conclusion, the current thesis showed that <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> was made in the attempt to recognize rheumatoid arthritis earlier, that a therapeutic window of opportunity exits and that with prompt initiation of adequate DMARD-treatment RA should no longer be tagged as a chronic condition but that drug-free remission and improved survival are both achievable goals.
