5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that he would run for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> Clinton.

5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> Rodham Clinton {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E

5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E

If you're not familiar with it, you should see it and read about it." [...] She had also written about {{the organization}} in her book, It Takes a Village.
