50|$|The <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> spawns March through September; it is {{sexually mature}} at 6 in (15 cm). It feeds on the bottom, taking crustaceans, mollusks, and smaller fish. Like {{other species of}} snappers, it is prized for its tasty, white meat. <b>Lane</b> <b>snapper</b> are more {{typically}} caught in shallower (20-60 ft) waters than many other snappers, most commonly yellowtail snapper and mangrove snapper. Larger specimens {{can be found in}} somewhat deeper waters, but are typically less plentiful.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lane</b> <b>snapper</b> are {{generally}} caught on hook and line, and {{are considered to}} be more aggressive and easier to catch than other snappers, as they tend to be less wary of hooks and lines. They are easily caught on a variety of live and frozen baits, such as shrimp, squid, cut bait, and minnows; artificial lures and baits have also been known to be effective. Generally, <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> are not specifically targeted by anglers, but many are caught as a bycatch by anglers fishing for grouper or other species of snapper, as well as other shallow to mid-depth bottom fish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus synagris) is {{a species}} of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina to {{southern}} Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.

40|$|NOAA's Biogeograpy Branch, the National Park Service (NPS), US Geological Survey, and the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) {{are using}} acoustice {{telemetry}} to quantify spatial patterns and habitat affinities of reef fishes in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). The {{objective of the}} study is to define the movements of reef fishes among habitats within and between the Virgin Islands Coral Reef Nationla Monument (VICRNM), adjacent to Virgin Islands National Park (VIIS), and USVI Territorial waters. In order to better understand species habitat utilization patterns and movement of fishes among management regimes and areas open to fishing around St. John, we deployed an array of hydroacoutstic receivers and acoustically tagged reef fishes. A total of 150 fishes, representing 18 species and 10 families were acoustically tagged along the south shore of St. John from July 2006 to June 2008. Thirty six receivers with a detection range of approximately 300 m each were deployed in shallow nearshore bays and across the shelf to depths of approximately 30 m. Receivers were located within reefs and adjacent to reefs in seagrass, algal beds, or sand habitats. Example results include the movement of <b>lane</b> <b>snappers</b> and blue striped grunts that demonstrated diel movement from reef habitats during daytime hours to offshore seagrass beds at night. Fish associated with reefs that did not have adjacent seagrass beds made more extensive movements than those fishes associated with reefs that had adjacent seagrass habitats. The array comprised of both nearshore and cross shelf location of receives provides information on fine to broad scale fish movement patterns across habitats and among management units to examine the strength of ecological connectivity between management areas and habitats.

50|$|The {{northern}} red snapper's body is {{very similar}} in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, mutton snapper, <b>lane</b> <b>snapper,</b> and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers.This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about 39 cm. The common adult length is 60 cm, but may reach 100 cm. The maximum published weight is 84 lb, and the oldest reported age is 100+ years.Coloration of the northern red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays. Juvenile fish (shorter than 30-35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides, below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age.|$|E

40|$|Three low-relief banks (Heald Bank, Sabine Bank, Freeport Rocks) in {{the northwestern}} Gulf of Mexico were {{evaluated}} as <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus synagris Linnaeus, 1758) nursery habitat. Trawl surveys were conducted in three habitat types (inshore mud, shell ridge, offshore mud), designated by side-scan sonar surveys, to determine patterns of distribution and abundance. Heald Bank and Sabine Bank were trawled in 2003 while Freeport Rocks was trawled in 2000 (Freeport A) and 2004 (Freeport B). Density of <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> was higher on Sabine Bank (20. 8 ? 2. 8 ind ha- 1) than on Heald Bank (1. 1 ? 0. 4 ind ha- 1), Freeport A (12. 7 ? 2. 3 ind ha- 1) or Freeport B (3. 0 ? 1. 0 ind ha- 1). Habitat-specific differences in density were observed, although patterns were not consistent among banks. Highest densities of <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> were found on Heald Bank?s offshore habitat (1. 7 ? 1. 0 ind ha- 1), Sabine Bank?s ridge habitat (26. 5 ? 6. 9 ind ha- 1), and on the inshore habitat of Freeport A and B (17. 6 ? 4. 9 ind ha- 1 and 4. 8 ? 3. 6, respectively). Otolith microstructure analysis was performed on <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> collected in trawl surveys to determine age, hatch-date distribution, growth and mortality of new recruits. Hatch dates ranged from May 1 to August 31, peaking in June for Freeport (A and B) and in July for Heald Bank and Sabine Bank. Growth rates varied from 0. 90 mm d- 1 at Heald Bank to 1. 27 mm d- 1 at Sabine Bank, and rates were highest on the ridge habitat of Sabine Bank (1. 31 mm d- 1). Mortality of post-settlement <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> was higher on Sabine Bank (15. 2 % d- 1; Z = 0. 165), than on Freeport A (9. 2 % d- 1; Z = 0. 097), and was greatest on the ridge habitat of Sabine Bank (24 % d- 1; Z = 0. 275). Recruitment potential (G : Z), evaluated on habitats at Sabine Bank, was highest on the offshore habitat, with a value greater than 1. 0, indicating higher potential contribution to the adult population.

40|$|This {{technical}} memorandum {{describes a}} developing project {{under the direction}} of NOAA’s Biogeography Branch in consultation with the National Park Service and US Geological Survey to understand and quantify spatial patterns and habitat affinities of reef fishes in the US Virgin Islands. The purpose of this report is to describe and disseminate the initial results from the project and to share information on the location of acoustic receivers and species electronic tag ID codes. The Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM), adjacent to Virgin Islands National Park (VIIS), was established by Executive Order in 2000, but resources within the monument are poorly documented and the degree of connectivity to VIIS is unknown. Whereas, VICRNM was established with full protection from resource exploitation, VIIS has incurred resource harvest by fishers since 1956 as allowed in its enabling legislation. Large changes in local reef communities have occurred over the past several decades, in part due to overexploitation. In order to better understand the habitat utilization patterns and movement of fishes among management regimes and areas open to fishing around St, John, an array of hydroacoustic receivers was deployed while a variety of reef fish species were acoustically tagged. In July 2006, nine receivers with a detection range of ca. 350 m were deployed in Lameshur Bay on the south shore of St. John, within VIIS. Receivers were located adjacent to reefs and in seagrass beds, inshore and offshore of these reefs. It was found that <b>lane</b> <b>snappers</b> and bluestriped grunts showed diel movement from reef habitats during daytime hours to offshore seagrass bed at night. Timing of migrations was highly predictable and coincided with changes in sunrise and sunset {{over the course of the}} year. Fish associated with reefs that did not have adjacent seagrass beds made more extensive movements than those fishes associated with reefs that had adjacent seagrass habitats. In April 2007, 21 additional receivers were deployed along much of the south shore of St. John (ca. 20 km of shoreline). This current array will address broader-scale movement among management units and examine the potential benefits of the VICRNM to provide adult “spillover” into VIIS and adjacent harvested areas. The results from this work will aid in defining fine to moderate spatial scales of reef fish habitat affinities and in designing and evaluating marine protected areas...|$|R
40|$|The fish {{community}} in the Terminos Lagoon inlets presents no less than 125 species. Two of them are typical or dominant species and were chosen for this study: Polydactylus octonemus (Atlantic thread fin) and Lutjanus synagris (<b>Lane</b> <b>snapper).</b> Both species are demersal-pelagic components of the community, L. synagris is stenohaline and P. octonemus is eurihaline. P. octonemus has a wide trophic spectrum with at least 11 items. It is considered second order consumer. L. synagris has a trophic spectrum of 9 items, and is conside second-third order consumer.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of bathymetric distribution of five snappers caught along the Brazilian Northeastern coast by artisanal fleets through {{the analysis of}} the catch composition and relative abundance (CPUE) showed that, on the overall, fished mean size increased along depth and that particular species dominated the catch according to the depth strata. Mutton snapper, L. analis, yellowtail snapper, L. chrysurus, and dog snapper, L. jocu were mainly caught at intermediate depth (20 - 80 m) whereas <b>lane</b> <b>snapper,</b> L. synagris, and silk snapper, L. vivanus, inhabit respectively shallow (80 m) waters. Each fleet category exploited preferentially a particular combination of species and their size range.

40|$|Creel and trawl {{surveys of}} Biscayne Bay {{were carried out}} in 1982 - 1983 to assess {{commercial}} fish and macro-invertebrate habitats and fisheries. Dredged and/or barren bottom was dramatically less productive than seagrass, algae or hard bottom areas. Low fish abundance and diversity in north Biscayne Bay appeared to be correlated with high turbidity and low seagrass abundance. Substantive increases in fish and crustacean productivity in north Biscayne Bay will occur only if seagrass communities can be re-established. Deeper dredged areas in North Bay will not likely become recolonized with seagrass even if turbidity levels are reduced. Hard bottom areas in South Bay are associated with high diversity of fish fauna and serve as nursery areas for several highly desirable species (e. g. hogfish, yellowtail snapper, <b>lane</b> <b>snapper).</b> The area between Julia Tuttle and 79 th Street Causeways, which had very dense seagrass abundance, was the richest area on either North or South Biscayne Bay for juvenile fish and shrimp.

40|$|Population {{structure}} of <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus synagris in U. S. {{waters in the}} northern Caribbean Sea was assessed using nuclear-encoded microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from samples from four localities in the U. S. Caribbean and one locality in the Florida Keys. Significant heterogeneity was detected for both allele and genotype distributions (microsatellites) and for haplotype distribution (mtDNA). Pairwise comparisons revealed that fish in the Florida Keys differed significantly from fish in the U. S. Caribbean with respect to both microsatellites and mtDNA. A parsimony network of mtDNA haplotypes was consistent with division of the five sample localities into two distinct populations. Genetic diversity at both microsatellites and mtDNA was greater among fish from the Florida Keys. The average, long-term migration rate from the U. S. Caribbean westward to the Florida Keys was approximately 1. 75 -fold greater than the reverse, suggesting that the elevated genetic variability among fish from the Florida Keys reflects the westward movement of alleles {{as a function of}} westward-flowing surface currents in the region. Bayesian coalescent analysis (microsatellites) indicated that each of the two populations has experienced a 10 -fold decline in effective population size (Ne). Estimates of long-term effective size, generated using a coalescent, maximum-likelihood method, were 1, 671. 9 (Florida Keys) and 2, 923. 2 (U. S. Caribbean).

[...] 1 pageSmall-scale {{fisheries}} {{target to}} several resources, using {{a diversity of}} gears. These fisheries provide employment to limited-income European communities, while are also supporting the food security by local communities from developing countries. Nevertheless, few target species are assessed and monitored, whereas most of gears and métiers are hardly considered into a regular management. Exploring multi-gear and multi-species scenarios without the trawling participation, we analyze competition among gears in the Colombian Caribbean area. Thus, the competition indicators were determined for 22 métiers, operating in data-poor artisanal fisheries, between 2006 and 2014. The results show an increasing dominance of encircling gillnets both wooden and fiberglass boats, because {{they are able to}} catch target species of many others métiers. Conversely, all the canoe fleet, as well as the bottom gillnet and longline fleets have lost both dominance and independence at the expense of encircling gillnets. These results suggest that encircling gillnets, which high catches and few fishers, are promoting activity reduction on many métiers that are supporting the majority of employment. Additionally, this gear removes small size fishes from the ecosystem, resulting in growth overfishing. A single-species pseudo-cohort assessment for two of the most important fishery species Lutjanus synagris (<b>lane</b> <b>snapper)</b> and Haemulon plumierii (white grunt), leads to similar conclusions than competition analysis. Therefore, this multi-gear analysis is useful for an early and inexpensive management on a data-poor context, considering a multi-species fisheryPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Many {{marine fishes}} use the {{mangrove}} ecosystem for foraging, protection, spawning, {{and as a}} nursery habitat. To develop {{a better understanding of}} energy flow between the coastal mangrove and coral reef ecosystems, the ontogentic migration and trophic connectivity of reef fishes were examined through the use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) stable isotope ratios. Juvenile and adult gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> L. synagris, bluestriped grunt Haemulon sciurus, French grunt H. flavolineatum, sailor’s choice H. parra, yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda were collected from both mangrove and coral reef sites located near Port Everglades, Broward County, Florida. All species were analyzed for δ 13 C and δ 15 N of muscle tissues and δ 18 O and δ 13 C of otoliths to evaluate ontogenetic migrations, foraging, and occupation within both the mangrove and reef sites. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N in muscle tissue were more depleted in juvenile fish from the mangroves than their adult forms caught on the adjacent reef. The δ 18 O and δ 13 C otolith data were significantly different between species, age class, and habitat, with lower δ 18 O values for juvenile fish caught in the mangroves. A general trend of increasing δ 13 C in otoliths corresponded to increasing total length, also suggesting juvenile movements from mangrove to nearshore reefs with age. Overall, {{the findings of this study}} further confirm that several commercially and recreationally important reef-associated fishes utilize mangrove ecosystems during juvenile life stages...|$|E

40|$|In {{a context}} of {{potential}} overexploitation of fisheries resources in the Sabana-Camagu&# 776;ey Archipelago (Cuba), the Cuban national authorities have expressed the need to collect more in situ information on fish of commercial interest in spawning areas. A newly developed low cost single-beam scientific echosounder has been recently acquired by the Cuban Fisheries Research Centre (CIP). In this work, we provide first results of a comparative analysis {{carried out in the}} Sabana-Camagu&# 776;ey Archipelago (Cuba), with the aim to evaluate the suitability of this type of echosounder as a tool for assessing fish aggregations in shallow waters. To this end, data acquired with the single-beam Simrad EK 15 (200 kHz) have been compared with data acquired with a split-beam Biosonics DT-X (208 kHz), the latter representing the standard system for comparison. Both systems were calibrated following standard procedures and data have been analysed using Echoview software. The additional use of CCTV underwater video ("drop cam") allowed real-time monitoring of fish present in the study area. Identification of fish species was possible due to the low water turbidity in the coral habitat and was performed using either video images or observations by divers. Fish schools and spawning aggregations of Lutjanidae such as <b>lane</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus synagris) were observed. Target strength (TS) of individual fish was determined by using split-beam data of individuals {{from the edge of the}} school. Additionally, existing knowledge of TS of some major tropical fish species in Cuban waters provided the possibility to apply the regressions of TS versus size of fish and compare sizes with information available from fishermen in the area. A first synthesis of information available from all these different sources suggests the suitability of low-cost scientific echosounders as a tool to obtain valuable data on spawning aggregations on the Cuban shelf to depths of about 50 m. The use of a video syst- m simultaneously with hydroacoustic methods in clear and shallow waters proves to be a useful ground-truth tool to improve the reliability of this kind of assessments...|$|E
