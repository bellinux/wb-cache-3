5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E
5|$|The first form of {{sanctions}} {{initiated by the}} US against Yugoslavia took place already from 1990 as the Nickels Amendment, which was sponsored by senators Don Nickles and Bob Dole. The amendment was passed due to concerns about Albanians being arrested in Kosovo. The amendment officially came into <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> from May 6, 1992; although it applied only to $5 million-worth of US foreign aid, it was reported as instrumental in denying SFR Yugoslavia its last application for IMF loans before its breakup and hyperinflation episode.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{so-called}} merger clauses while drafting contracts {{governed by the}} civil law is becoming increasingly popular. Since merger clauses originated from the common law, {{it is not easy}} to ascertain their <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> under the civil law. This is also the case in Polish law. Not only is there little mention in the legal literature of the effects of merger clauses, but also legal scholars' views on the issue differ widely. This article tries to answer the question of what the <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of using merger clauses under Polish law are. Among others, it tackles the important issue of how a merger clause inserted into a contract influences the process of its interpretation and closing its loopholes. Moreover, it attempts to compare merger clauses' <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> under Polish law and European private law model rules. The starting point of the analysis performed in the paper is the distinction between two functions of contractual clauses, which leads to a clearer description of the consequences of merger clauses' usage. The adoption of the aforementioned distinction leads to the conclusion that the <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of merger clauses under Polish law may be far more significant than is often considered. Additionally, it can be observed that these effects do not differ from the <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of merger clauses under European law model rules as much as has been claimed...|$|R

40|$|The EU has perfect {{human rights}} {{obligations}} towards distant strangers. My argument has two limbs: Firstly, in numerous policy areas, the EU asserts jurisdiction via ‘territorial extension’, which combines territorially limited enforcement jurisdiction with {{a claim of}} geographically unbounded prescriptive jurisdiction. Doctrinally, this strongly resembles the Lotus principle, and viewed analytically, amounts to a claim not just of power but of political authority. Thus, the EU creates not just factual <b>effects,</b> but <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> abroad. Secondly, assertions of political authority, even if only de facto, give rise to perfect human rights obligations. I illustrate this by reference to the Strasbourg Court’s case-law, which demonstrates {{that the creation of}} <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> extraterritorially suffices to give rise to extraterritorial human rights jurisdiction, and therefore obligations. I therefore reject accounts of human rights jurisdiction premised upon ‘capability’, ‘control’, or other aspects of mere power...|$|R
