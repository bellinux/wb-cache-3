25|$|Since the Roman Empire, {{most western}} {{contributions}} to Western <b>legal</b> <b>culture</b> was {{the emergence of}} a class of Roman jurists. During the Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas, the most influential western scholar of the period, integrated the theory of natural law with the notion of an eternal and biblical law. During the Renaissance, Prof. Alberico Gentili, the founder of the science of international law, authored the first treatise on public international law and separated secular law from canon law and Roman Catholic theology. Enlightenment's greatest legal theorists, Cesare Beccaria, Giambattista Vico and Francesco Mario Pagano, are well remembered for their legal works, particularly on criminal law.|$|E
25|$|Sociology {{of law is}} {{a diverse}} field of study that {{examines}} the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as criminology. The institutions of social construction, social norms, dispute processing and <b>legal</b> <b>culture</b> are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called law and society studies; in Europe it is more {{often referred to as}} socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, Eugen Ehrlich, who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts. Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.|$|E

40|$|Legal systems, {{institutions}} and organizations comprise {{more than just}} rules, regulations and laws. They are also made up of individuals that create, implement and regulate those systems, {{institutions and}} organizations. Humans themselves, however, are not so easily compartmentalized and will tend to bring their home <b>legal</b> <b>cultures</b> into the international legal order. Additionally, they will tend to create new <b>legal</b> <b>cultures</b> within those international intergovernmental organizations (2 ̆ 2 lOs 2 ̆ 2) and fields. But, the interactions and operations of those legal cultures- be they domestic or international, new or old, competing or complementing- will often have significant implications for the processes and functions of those different <b>legal</b> <b>cultures,</b> individually or together. Accordingly, examination of those <b>legal</b> <b>cultures</b> and their interactions is necessary to really understand the international legal order, on its own or in its interactions with domestic systems. This article will thus introduce the idea of applying comparative legal cultural analyses to the international legal order, and specifically to lOs-the backbone of the international legal order. Because such analyses are somewhat unusual and little known, this paper will also provide a methodological toolbox for those analyses...|$|R

2500|$|Lawrence M. Friedman {{is among}} socio-legal {{scholars}} who introduced {{the idea of}} <b>legal</b> <b>culture</b> into the sociology of law. For Friedman, <b>legal</b> <b>culture</b> [...] "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system". It can also consist of [...] "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole. Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures {{at different levels of}} abstraction, e.g. {{at the level of the}} legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the [...] "internal" [...] and [...] "external" [...] legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.|$|E
2500|$|Iorga's {{writings}} {{insisted on}} the importance of Byzantine Greek and Levantine influences in the two countries after the fall of Constantinople: his notion of [...] "Byzantium after Byzantium" [...] postulated that the cultural forms produced by the Byzantine Empire had been preserved by the Principalities under Ottoman suzerainty (roughly, between the 16th and 18th centuries). Additionally, the Romanian scholar described the Ottoman Empire itself as the inheritor of Byzantine government, <b>legal</b> <b>culture</b> and civilization, up to the Age of Revolution. However, the Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches postulated that the Ottoman decline was irreversible, citing uncompromising Islam as one of the causes, and playing down the cohesive action of Ottomanism.|$|E

2500|$|The Maliki madhhab was {{introduced}} to Ifriqiya by the jurist Asad ibn al-Furat (759-829), yet {{he was known to}} waver somewhat between the prior Hanafi and the Maliki.

Sa'id) (776-854), provided a [...] "vulgate of North-African Malikism" [...] for practical use during the period when Maliki legal doctrines won the field against its rival, the Hanafi. Abu Hanifa (700-767) (founder of the Hanafi school) drew out fiqh that was perhaps better suited to its origin in Baghdad, a sophisticated imperial capital; while Malik ibn Anas (716-795) initiated the school bearing his name in the smaller, rural city of Medina. By choosing the then more marginal Maliki school, the jurists of Kairouan probably obtained more discretion in defining Maghriban <b>legal</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The English {{influence}} on Singapore's governmental system is visibly strong, though Singapore's system fundamentally {{differs from that}} of the United Kingdom as it is unicameral. Singapore's take on the separation of powers is greatly informed by its unique values and <b>legal</b> <b>culture.</b> The traditional separation of powers doctrine in the United Kingdom is based on a fundamental distrust of human nature, and by extension, an even greater distrust of power, which [...] "tends to corrupt". As a result, it is necessary for each branch of government to be checked and managed, to prevent its otherwise absolute and uncurtailed power being abused. Singapore, on the other hand, has based its system of government on the election of trustworthy and honourable leaders, instead of on the implementation of a system specifically to prevent dishonourable ones misusing their power. In other words, aside from legal methods of controlling government– that is, through institutionalised checks and balances– non-legal methods are used as well, [...] "internally from Parliament and the Executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy".|$|E
