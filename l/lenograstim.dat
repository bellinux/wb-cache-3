40|$|Background. Intensive {{chemotherapy}} for acute {{myelogenous leukemia}} (AML) continues to yield {{low rates of}} complete remission and survival among patients {{over the age of}} 65 years. Infection-related mortality is particularly high among these patients during the period of neutropenia that follows chemotherapy. We determined the effect of <b>lenograstim</b> (glycosylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) on mortality at eight weeks (the main end point) and the rate of complete remission among patients with AML who were 65 years old or older. Methods. After induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 4 days) and cytarabine (200 mg per square meter per day for 7 days), 173 patients with newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned on day 8 to receive either <b>lenograstim</b> (5 mu g per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo, starting on day 9, until there was neutrophil recovery or a treatment failure, or for a maximum of 28 days. Salvage chemotherapy was also followed by <b>lenograstim</b> or placebo. Patients with a complete remission received two consolidation courses of chemotherapy without <b>lenograstim</b> or placebo. Results. The mortality rate at eight weeks was similar in the <b>lenograstim</b> and placebo groups (23 and 27 percent, respectively; P = 0. 60), as was the incidence of severe infections. The median duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, {{less than or equal to}} 1000 per cubic millimeter) was shorter in the <b>lenograstim</b> group (21 days, as compared with 27 days in the placebo group; P< 0. 001).

Equivalent doses of two hematopoetic growth factors (filgrastim 5 µg/kg/day, S. C; <b>lenograstim</b> 150 µg/m 2 /day, S.

RESULTS: Delay in the new chemotherapy cure following chemotherapy protocol was median 5 days in <b>lenograstim</b> arm (16 patients, 37 %) while it was 3 days in filgrastim arm (10 patients; % 25) however the difference was not statistically significant (p= 0. 188). In lenogastrim arm, febrile neutropenia occurred in 6 patients and infections without neutropenia were seen in 4 patients (pneumonia in 2 patients, otitis media in 1 patient and pharengitis in 1 patient).

40|$|Neutrophil {{functions}} can {{be modified}} by Recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) treatment, with divergent effects on phagocytosis, motility, bactericidal activity, and surface molecule expression.

Little information is available about actin polymerization in neutrophils from subjects treated with the two types of rhG-CSF.

40|$|Chemotherapy-induced febrile {{neutropenia}} is a potentially fatal complication of cancer treatment {{and is also}} the main reason of dose-reduction and/or delay of chemotherapy regimen. Prophylaxis with G-CSF is applicable {{to reduce the risk}} of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Two molecules of recombinant G-CSF are available for clinical use: <b>lenograstim,</b> identical to human native G-CSF, that is derived from mammalian cells and filgrastim, different to human native G-CSF, expressed in E coli and commercialized in normal form and pegilated long-acting form. Neutrophil morphology and expected defense functions are modified by treatment with filgrastim, while they are not affected by <b>lenograstim.</b> These functionality differences observed in vitro are recently confirmed in a clinical trial that shows a lower incidence of febrile episodes with <b>lenograstim</b> compared to filgrastim in presence of G-CSF induced neutrophils. The long-term safety of <b>lenograstim</b> was supported by the results of a prospective, longer-term study involving almost 4, 000 healthy donors. Another important question is the respect of timing of administration of G-CSF and chemotherapy. Absolutely in no case the plasma concentration of G-CSF is to be detected 48 h before to 24 h post chemotherapeutic drugs administration. In fact, this combination could result in an increased risk of mielotoxicity and a potential for an increase in sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic-mutagenic chemotherapy potential. <b>Lenograstim</b> and filgrastim shows short half-life time, instead pegfilgrastim shows detectable concentrations for 16 days after a single administration. This is important to be considered, in particular in bi-weekly and tri-weekly adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.

40|$|AIM: Several {{neutrophil}} functions can {{be modified}} by rhG-CSF administration. Neutrophil morphology changes {{in the course of}} treatment with Filgrastim (nonglycosylated rhG-CSF), along with impairment of chemotaxis. Both morphology and chemotaxis are not affected by treatment with <b>Lenograstim</b> (glycosylated rhG-CSF). Thus, we evaluated actin polymerization in neutrophils induced by treatment with the two forms of rhG-CSF. In fact, actin polymerization is crucial for neutrophil motility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated twelve healthy subjects undergoing peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilization for allogeneic transplantation to HLA-identical siblings. Neutrophils were isolated by peripheral venous blood before and after administration of either Filgrastim (six PBSC donors) or <b>Lenograstim</b> (six PBSC donors). Actin polymerization was investigated by a flow cytometric assay, using FITC-phalloidin as a specific probe for F-actin, and two parameters were measured: spontaneous actin polymerization in resting neutrophils; fMLP-stimulated actin polymerization. Results were expressed as relative F-actin content. Fifteen blood donors were studied as a control group. RESULTS: Filgrastim administration induced an increased relative F-actin content in resting neutrophils; however, no further actin polymerization was observed after fMLP stimulation. Neutrophils from subjects treated with <b>Lenograstim</b> showed a normal behaviour in terms of both spontaneous and stimulated actin polymerization. CONCLUSIONS: Glycosylated and nonglycosylated rhG-CSF differently affect actin polymerization in newly generated neutrophils. Such effects may explain some previous findings concerning both morphology and chemotactic properties and may be due to different effects of the two forms of rhG-CSF on proteins involved in neutrophil motility regulation...|$|E

Results The review identified the following studies comparing G-CSF prophylaxis to no primary G-CSF prophylaxis: 5 studies of pegfilgrastim, 9 studies of filgrastim and 5 studies of <b>lenograstim.</b> In addition, 5 studies were identified comparing pegfilgrastim to filgrastim. The two synthesis methods (meta-analysis and MTC) demonstrated that all three G-CSFs significantly reduced FN rate. Pegfilgrastim reduced FN rate {{to a greater extent than}} filgrastim (significantly in the head-to-head meta-analysis and in the MTC of all studies, and not quite significantly when the MTC was restricted to RCTs only). In the absence of direct trials, the MTC gave an 80 - 86...|$|E

40|$|A wide use of {{recombinant}} human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) and their pegylated equivalent {{is a significant}} step forward {{in the treatment of}} both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Evidence-based use of these molecules resulted in more intensive treatments, safely extended to frail and elderly patients, and development of response- and comorbidity-tailored approaches. The available G-CSFs are filgrastim, and the long-acting PegFilgrastim, which are produced in E. Coli cells, and are chemically different from native human G-CSF, and <b>lenograstim,</b> a molecule produced in mammalian cells, with a chemical structure identical to native human G-CSF. These chemical differences produce a diverse interaction with receptors and stimulated neutrophils. For instance, <b>lenograstim</b> binds to receptors in the same way of endogenous ligand, and neutrophils obtained from stimulation with this G-CSF have a physiological activity profile similar to neutrophils normally generated in humans. Conversely, the different interaction between filgrastim and G-CSF receptor is more frequently associated with morphological abnormalities, reduced motility and chemotaxis and a reduced response to bacterial stimuli in induced neutrophils. On this background, we reviewed available evidence in order to analyze the impact of these chemical and pharmacodynamic differences among G-CSF molecules on safety, particularly in healthy peripheral-blood stem-cells donors, functional qualities of inducted neutrophils, and mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells.  </p...|$|E

In this paper we show that in resting Filgrastim (non-glycosylated G-CSF) -pulsed cells, F-actin polymerization, membrane-linked RhoA and cell polarization are enhanced compared to those found in resting <b>Lenograstim</b> (glycosylated G-CSF) -cells. The basal hyper-activation of RhoA could be responsible for the morphological and functional modifications of Filgrastim-mobilized cells. Moreover, Filgrastim-mobilized cells, but not Lenograstim-mobilized cells, are unable to correctly respond to LPS stimulation, as demonstrated by minor further RhoA activation and cell elongation...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of recombinant DNA-technology, the DNA-derived drugs represent a new therapeutic concept for human diseases (1). Two forms of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF) are currently commercially available for medical treatment, non-glycosylated protein (filgrastim) and glycosylated protein <b>lenograstim,</b> with molecular mass of 19. 6 kDa (2). Glycosylation has been repor-ted to confer many advantages over non-glycosylation, including improvement of phy-sical stability (3 – 6) and higher biological and pharmacological potency (5, 7, 8). A common phenomenon of protein instability and a dominant degradation path-way for therapeutic proteins is formation of aggregates (9). It is encountered routinely during refolding, purification, sterilization, shipping and storage processes (10, 11). Ag...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{report a}} {{cost-effectiveness}} evaluation of granulocyte colony–stimulating factors (G-CSFs) {{for the prevention}} of febrile neutropenia (FN) after chemotherapy in the United Kingdom (UK). MethodsA mathematical model was constructed simulating the experience of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Three strategies were modeled: primary prophylaxis (G-CSFs administered in all cycles), secondary prophylaxis (G-CSFs administered in all cycles after an FN event), and no G-CSF prophylaxis. Three G-CSFs were considered: filgrastim, <b>lenograstim,</b> and pegfilgrastim. Costs were taken from UK databases and utility values from published sources. A systematic review provided data on G-CSF efficacy. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined the effects of uncertainty in model parameters. ResultsIn the UK, base-case analysis with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £ 20 K per quality-adjusted life year gained and also using list prices, the most cost-effective strategy was primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim for a patient with baseline FN risk greater than 38 %, secondary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim for baseline FN risk 11 % to 37 %, and no G-CSFs for baseline FN risk less than 11 %. Using a WTP threshold of £ 30 K and list prices, primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim was cost-effective for baseline FN risks greater than 29 %. In all analyses, pegfilgrastim dominated filgrastim and <b>lenograstim.</b> Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that higher WTP threshold, younger age, earlier stage at diagnosis, or reduced G-CSF prices result in G-CSF prophylaxis being cost-effective at lower baseline FN risk levels. ConclusionPegfilgrastim was the most cost-effective G-CSF. The most cost-effective strategy (primary or secondary prophylaxis) was dependent on the FN risk level for an individual patient, patient age and stage at diagnosis, and G-CSF price...|$|E

G-CSFs are used to mobilize CD 34 + cells and accelerate engraftment after transplantation. However, in Asia, particularly in Japan, data for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization by this biosimilar G-CSF are currently lacking. Therefore, the clinical efficacy and safety of biosimilar G-CSF for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation needs to be evaluated in a Japanese context. Materials and methods: The subjects included two groups of patients with malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma. All patients received chemotherapy priming for the mobilization of PBSCs. All patients were treated with chemotherapy followed by the administration of either the biosimilar G-CSF, filgrastim XM 02 (FBNK), or the originators, filgrastim, or <b>lenograstim.</b> Results: There {{were no significant differences}} among FBNK, filgrastim, and <b>lenograstim</b> treatments in the numbers of CD 34 + cells in harvested PBSCs, the scores for granulocyte/macrophage colony forming units, or for malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients evaluated as separate or combined cohorts. In addition, {{there were no significant differences}} in safety, side effects, complications, or the time to engraftment after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conclusion: Biosimilar FBNK shows the same efficacy and safety as originator G-CSFs for facilitating bone marrow recovery in Japanese malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. In addition, it is less expensive than the originators, reducing hospitalization costs.

40|$|Objectives This study aims to {{highlight}} the benefits of Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC), within {{a case study of}} the efficacy of three treatments (pegfilgrastim, filgrastim and <b>lenograstim)</b> for the prevention of febrile neutropenia (FN) following chemotherapy. Methods Two published meta-analyses have assessed the relative efficacy of the three treatments based on head-to-head trials. In the present study, all the trials from these meta-analyses were synthesised within a single network in a Bayesian MTC. Following a systematic review, the evidence base was then updated to include further recently-published trials. The metaanalyses and MTC were re-analysed using the updated evidence base. Results Using data from the previously-published meta-analyses only, the relative risk of FN for pegfilgrastim vs. no treatment was estimated at 0. 08 (95...|$|E
