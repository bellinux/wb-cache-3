6000|$|P.S.--I {{will not}} <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on your time by {{requiring}} an answer, lest [...] you say, as Butler said to Tatersall (when I had written his reverence [...] an impudent epistle on the expression before mentioned), viz.

6000|$|... "Tobacco!"

60|$|And then {{consider}} the gross ignorance and folly of our <b>laying</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> upon the Sicilians! Taxation in its proper sense can only exist {{where there is}} a free circulation of capital, labour, and commodities throughout the community. But <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> the people in countries like Sicily and Corsica, where there is no internal communication, is mere robbery and confiscation. A crown taken from a Corsican living in the sierras would not get back to him again in ten years.|$|R
6000|$|... [240] If colours were {{twenty times}} as costly as they are, {{we should have}} many more good painters. If I were Chancellor of the Exchequer I would <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of twenty shillings a cake on all colours except black, Prussian blue, Vandyke brown, and Chinese white, which I would leave for students. I don't say this jestingly; I believe such <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> would do more to advance real art than a great many schools of design.|$|R

5000|$|The {{views of}} Knox, Grenville and Burke {{did not go}} unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy [...] "internal" [...] taxes [...] "for the {{purposes}} of raising a revenue" [...] {{without the consent of}} actual representatives of the [...] "Commons of America". [...] "It is my opinion," [...] Pitt said, [...] "that this kingdom has no right <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> upon the colonies." ...|$|R
60|$|This last undaunted parry {{altogether}} foiled Mr. Cruickshanks, who, {{though not}} quite satisfied either with the reserve {{of the master}} or the extreme readiness of the man, was contented <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on the reckoning and horse-hire that might compound for his ungratified curiosity. The circumstance of its being the fast day was not forgotten in the charge, which, on the whole, did not, however, amount to much more than double what in fairness it should have been.|$|R

6000|$|If I {{were to be}} asked, Who ought in {{particular}} {{to be charged with}} this work? I would answer in general those who have a portion of understanding extraordinary. Not that I would <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> upon any man's brains, or discourage wit by appointing wise men to maintain fools; but, some tribute is due to God's goodness for bestowing extraordinary gifts; and who can it be better paid to than such as suffer for want of the same bounty? ...|$|R
50|$|For a cap {{and trade}} {{situation}} or even <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> be truly effective they need to affect the individuals of the populations. Applying <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> gas would greatly reduce the populationâ€™s willingness to drive and make alternatives to drive more attractive. Also incentives to purchase hybrid cars, use biodiesel, and other climate friendly alternatives will greatly reduce fossil fuel dependence and use.|$|R
6000|$|... 176. Next, {{respecting}} general tone. I said, just now, that, for {{the sake}} of students, my tax should not be laid on black or on white pigments; but if you mean to be a colorist, you must <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on them yourself when you begin to use true color; that is to say, you must use them little, and make of them much. There is no better test of your color tones being good, than your having made the white in your picture precious, and the black conspicuous.|$|R

6000|$|Q. If the act should pass {{requiring}} the American assemblies to make compensation to the sufferers, {{and they should}} disobey it, and then the Parliament should, by another act, <b>lay</b> <b>an</b> internal <b>tax,</b> would they then obey it? ...|$|R

60|$|The Board of Trade {{therefore}} did {{not approve}} of it, nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd, supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and {{to draw on the}} treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament <b>laying</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on America. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political papers that are printed.|$|R

5000|$|In his concurring opinion, Justice Frank Murphy {{addressed}} {{concerns that}} had been raised by the dissenting justices that the majority decision would [...] "open the door to exemption of wealthy religious institutions, like Trinity Church in New York City, from the payment of taxes on property investments from which support is derived for religious activities." [...] Murphy rebutted these arguments by stating that [...] "(t)here is an obvious difference between taxing commercial property and investments undertaken for profit, whatever use is made of the income, and <b>laying</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> directly on <b>an</b> activity that is essentially religious in purpose and character or on an exercise of the privilege of free speech and free publication." ...|$|R
