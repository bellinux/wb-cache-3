40|$|Despite the {{presence}} of β- 1, 2 -glucan in nature, few β- 1, 2 -glucan degrading enzymes {{have been reported to}} date. Recently, the Lin 1839 protein from Listeria innocua was identified as a 1, 2 -β-oligoglucan phosphorylase. Since the adjacent lin 1840 gene in the gene cluster encodes a putative glycoside hydrolase family 3 β-glucosidase, we hypothesized that Lin 1840 is also involved in β- 1, 2 -glucan dissimilation. Here we report the functional and structural analysis of Lin 1840. A recombinant Lin 1840 protein (Lin 1840 r) showed the highest hydrolytic activity toward sophorose (Glc-β- 1, 2 -Glc) among β- 1, 2 -glucooligosaccharides, suggesting that Lin 1840 is a β-glucosidase involved in sophorose degradation. The enzyme also rapidly hydrolyzed <b>laminaribiose</b> (β- 1, 3), but not cellobiose (β- 1, 4) or gentiobiose (β- 1, 6) among β-linked gluco-disaccharides. We determined the crystal structures of Lin 1840 r in complexes with sophorose and <b>laminaribiose</b> as productive binding forms. In these structures, Arg 572 forms many hydrogen bonds with sophorose and <b>laminaribiose</b> at subsite + 1, which seems to be a key factor for substrate selectivity. The opposite side of subsite + 1 from Arg 572 is connected to a large empty space appearing to be subsite + 2 for the binding of sophorotriose (Glc-β- 1, 2 -Glc-β- 1, 2 -Glc) in spite of the higher Km value for sophorotriose than that for sophorose. The conformations of sophorose and <b>laminaribiose</b> are almost the same on the Arg 572 side but differ on the subsite + 2 side that provides no interaction with a substrate.

Recently, the reversion of glucose in dilute sulfuric acid has been studied and the kinetics of conversion into various disaccharides has been modeled [22]. In food science, the oligomerization of glucose upon heating is recognized as a reaction that occurs during caramelization. Sugisawa and Edo [23] reported that various disaccharides such as kojibiose, sophorose, nigerose, <b>laminaribiose,</b> maltose, cellobiose, isomaltose, and gentiobiose were isolated from caramel upon heating glucose at 150  °C {{in the absence of a}} catalyst.|$|E
40|$|Banana lectin (Banlec) is a dimeric plant lectin {{from the}} jacalin-related lectin family. Banlec {{belongs to a}} {{subgroup}} of this family that binds to glucose/mannose, but is unique in recog-nizing internal 1, 3 linkages as well as 1, 3 linkages at the reducing termini. Here we present the crystal structures of Banlec alone and with <b>laminaribiose</b> (LAM) (Glc 1, 3 Glc) and Xyl- 1, 3 -Man [...] O-Methyl. The structure of Banlec has a -prism-I fold, similar to other family members, but differs from them in its mode of sugar binding. The reducing unit of the sugar is inserted into the binding site causing the second saccharide unit {{to be placed in}} the opposite orientation com-pared with the other ligand-bound structures of family mem-bers. More importantly, our structures reveal the presence of a second sugar binding site that has not been previously reported in the literature. The residues involved in the second site are common to other lectins in this family, potentially sig-naling a new group of mannose-specific jacalin-related lectins (mJRL) with two sugar binding sites.

40|$|Free soluble {{carbohydrates}} {{of different}} wine samples {{were analyzed by}} GC-MS as their trimethylsilyloximes using a methylsilicone column. Besides alpha,alpha-trehalose, several beta-glucosylglucoses such as cellobiose, sophorose, <b>laminaribiose</b> and gentiobiose were the main disaccharides identified. With the exception of gentiobiose, these disaccharides are now reported {{for the first time}} in wine. Lactose (4 -O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-glucose), previously described in this product, was also tentatively identified. Several free glycosides: beta-ethyl-glucoside and seven glyceryl-glycosides (including glucosides and galactosides) were also identified {{for the first time in}} wine. On the contrary, disaccharides in grape juice were mainly constituted of fructose derivatives, including sucrose, and no glycosides were detected. Although the total amount of disaccharides was different in white wines (< 50 mg/L) from those in rosé and red wines (80 - 130 mg/L), the chromatographic profile was noticeably similar in all wine samples. The method here reported allows the identification of several carbohydrates which have not been previously detected in wines and could contribute to increase the understanding of enzymatic activity during winemaking.

30|$|It has {{not been}} clear whether rAaBGL 1 has transglycosylation {{activity}} because of its potent saccharifying activity. During hydrolysis of gentiobiose, we could not detect any oligosaccharide except for substrate (Figure  3 B). On the other hand, gentiobiose was detected in the middle stage of hydrolysis for cellobiose and <b>laminaribiose</b> as a substrate (Figure  3 A,C). These results indicated that rAaBGL 1 has transglycosylation activity, and can produce gentiobiose at least. This result {{is consistent with the}} report the glucose molecule at subsite + 1 points its C 6 hydroxyl to C 1 hydroxyl of the glucose molecule at subsite − 1 in AaBGL 1 -glucose complex (Suzuki et al. 2013). In fact, {{it has been reported that}} BGL from A. niger also produces gentiobiose as one of transglycosylation products (Seidle et al. 2004). Moreover, it has been reported that some BGLs transferred glucose from non-reducing end of substrate to O 6 position of non-reducing end of β-linked disaccharides (Kawai et al. 2004; Kono et al. 1999; Seidle et al. 2004; Watanabe et al. 1992). However, we could not clearly identify to produce trisaccharide as a transglycosylation product by rAaBGL 1 under the condition used in this study.|$|E

Bacteriol. 91 : 1526 – 1532. 1966. —Strains of Streptomyces, Nocardia, and Pseudomonas capable of lysing hyphae of Fusarium solani or Neurospora crassa {{were obtained by}} selective culture, but attempts to isolate an organism lysing Rhizoctonia solani failed. When provided with F. solani or N. crassa as carbon sources, the actinomycetes tested produced β-(1 → 3) glucanase and chitinase. A mixture containing purified chitinase and β-(1 → 3) glucanase induced spheroplast formation in F. solani, caused some morphological changes in N. crassa, but had almost no effect on R. solani hyphae. The polysaccharides in R. solani walls, which contain {{a large amount of}} glucose as well as galactose, mannose, and glucosamine, were not hydrolyzed appreciably by the two enzymes. <b>Laminaribiose</b> and laminaritriose were released by enzymatic hydrolysis of F. solani and N. crassa walls, and gentiobiose was liberated from R. solani and N. crassa walls. Melaninlike materials were found in R. solani walls, accounting for 8. 50 % of the wall weight. A role for melanin in protecting hyphae from microbial lysis is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{fermented}} beverage of plant extracts was prepared from about fifty kinds {{of vegetables and}} fruits. Natural fermentation was carried out mainly by lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc spp.) and yeast (Zygosaccharomyces spp. and Pichia spp.). We have previously examined the preparation of novel four trisaccharides from the beverage: O -β-D-fructopyranosyl-(2 -> 6) - O -β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 3) -D-glucopyranose, O -β-D-fructopyranosyl-(2 -> 6) - O -[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 3) ]-D-glucopyranose, O -β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 1) - O -β-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 1) -α-D-glucopyranoside and O -β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 -> 1) - O -β-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 1) - α-D-glucopyranoside. Results Three further novel oligosaccharides have been found from this beverage and isolated from the beverage using carbon-Celite column chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural confirmation of the saccharides was provided by methylation analysis, MALDI-TOF-MS and NMR measurements. Conclusion The following novel trisaccharides were identified: O -β-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 -> 1) - O -[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 3) ]-β-D-glucopyranoside (named " 3 G -β-D-glucopyranosyl β, β-isosucrose"), O -β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 2) - O -[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 4) ]-D-glucopyranose (4 1 -β-D-glucopyranosyl sophorose) and O -β-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 -> 6) - O -β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 3) -D-glucopyranose (6 2 -β-D-fructofuranosyl <b>laminaribiose).</b> </p...|$|E
