5|$|A {{fluorinated}} form of <b>L-DOPA</b> {{known as}} fluorodopa {{is available for}} use in positron emission tomography to assess {{the function of the}} nigrostriatal pathway.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to <b>L-DOPA</b> in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. <b>L-DOPA</b> is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, some {{amino acids}} {{derivatives}} {{are used in}} pharmaceutical industry. They include 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression, <b>L-DOPA</b> (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for Parkinson's treatment, and eflornithine drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used {{in the treatment of}} sleeping sickness.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical <b>L-DOPA,</b> which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, <b>L-DOPA,</b> can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or <b>L-DOPA).</b> Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with <b>L-DOPA.</b> Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses <b>L-DOPA</b> as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (<b>L-DOPA),</b> with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the central}} nervous system, <b>L-DOPA</b> is also {{converted}} into dopamine from within the peripheral nervous system. Excessive peripheral dopamine signaling causes many of the adverse side effects seen with sole <b>L-DOPA</b> administration. To bypass these effects, it is standard clinical practice to coadminister (with <b>L-DOPA)</b> a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) such as carbidopa (medicines containing carbidopa, either alone or in combination with <b>L-DOPA,</b> are branded as Lodosyn (Aton Pharma) Sinemet (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited), Pharmacopa (Jazz Pharmaceuticals), Atamet (UCB), and Stalevo (Orion Corporation) or with a benserazide (combination medicines are branded Madopar or Prolopa), to prevent the peripheral synthesis of dopamine from <b>L-DOPA.</b> Coadministration of pyridoxine without a DDCI accelerates the peripheral decarboxylation of <b>L-DOPA</b> {{to such an extent}} that it negates the effects of <b>L-DOPA</b> administration, a phenomenon that historically caused great confusion.|$|E
25|$|Very {{recently}} the orphan OA1 receptor has been de-orphaned. Studies showed that <b>L-DOPA</b> is the specific ligand for the OA1 receptor. <b>L-DOPA</b> is {{a by-product of}} melanin biosynthetic pathway. During melanin synthesis, <b>L-DOPA</b> is released to the retina in the retinal pigment epithelium and is necessary for specific stages of retinal development. Activation of the OA1 receptor by <b>L-DOPA</b> leads to the secretion of a neurotropic factor by the retinal pigment epithelium that helps in normal retinal development.|$|E
25|$|<b>L-DOPA</b> has a {{counterpart}} with opposite , D-DOPA. As is true {{for many}} molecules, the human body produces {{only one of these}} isomers (the <b>L-DOPA</b> form). The enantiomeric purity of <b>L-DOPA</b> may be analyzed by determination of the optical rotation or by chiral thin-layer chromatography (chiral TLC).|$|E
25|$|Levodopa (or <b>L-DOPA)</b> {{has been}} the most widely used {{treatment}} for over 30 years. <b>L-DOPA</b> is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by dopa-decarboxylase. Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra, the administration of <b>L-DOPA</b> temporarily diminishes the motor symptomatology.|$|E
25|$|Nausea, {{which is}} often reduced by taking the drug with food, {{although}} protein reduces drug absorption. <b>L-DOPA</b> is an amino acid, so protein competitively inhibits <b>L-DOPA</b> absorption.|$|E
25|$|<b>L-DOPA</b> {{crosses the}} {{protective}} blood–brain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot. Thus, <b>L-DOPA</b> {{is used to}} increase dopamine concentrations {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. This treatment was made practical and proven clinically by George Cotzias and his coworkers, for which they won the 1969 Lasker Prize. Once <b>L-DOPA</b> has entered the central nervous system, it is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor in this reaction, and may occasionally be administered along with <b>L-DOPA,</b> usually in the form of pyridoxine.|$|E
25|$|L-tyrosine → para-tyramine or <b>L-DOPA</b> → {{dopamine}} → (S)-norlaudanosoline → (S)-reticuline → 1,2-dehydroretinulinium → (R)-reticuline → salutaridine → salutaridinol → thebaine → neopinone → codeinone → codeine → morphine (S)-Norlaudanosoline (also {{known as}} tetrahydropapaveroline) {{can also be}} synthesized from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a metabolite of <b>L-DOPA</b> and dopamine. Urinary concentrations of endogenous codeine and morphine {{have been found to}} significantly increase in individuals taking <b>L-DOPA</b> for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>L-DOPA</b> is {{produced}} from the amino acid L-tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. It {{is also the}} precursor for the monoamine or catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Dopamine is formed by the decarboxylation of <b>L-DOPA</b> by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).|$|E
25|$|In the {{dopamine}} {{hypothesis of}} schizophrenia, schizophrenia was hypothesised {{to be caused}} by disturbed dopamine neurotransmission. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter which is involved in other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. There is evidence for increased activity of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopaminergic pathway, in schizophrenia patients. This comes from the discovery of increased <b>L-DOPA</b> decarboxylase levels in the brains of these patients. <b>L-DOPA</b> decarboxylase is an enzyme which converts <b>L-DOPA</b> to dopamine by removing a carboxyl group. Animal models were first produced for schizophrenia by altering the dopaminergic system using drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>L-DOPA</b> can be {{directly}} metabolized by catechol-O-methyl transferase to 3-O-methyldopa, and then further to vanillactic acid. This metabolic pathway is nonexistent in the healthy body, but becomes important after peripheral <b>L-DOPA</b> administration in patients with Parkinson's disease or in the rare cases of patients with AADC enzyme deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>L-DOPA</b> {{is a key}} {{compound}} {{in the formation of}} marine adhesive proteins, such as those found in mussels. It is believed to be responsible for the water-resistance and rapid curing abilities of these proteins. <b>L-DOPA</b> may also be used to prevent surfaces from fouling by bonding antifouling polymers to a susceptible substrate.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease described by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or <b>L-DOPA.</b> This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether <b>L-dopa</b> is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of <b>L-dopa</b> will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or in-vitro, some still believe that the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Levels of {{dopamine}} {{can be used}} {{to distinguish}} between these two types. Tetrahydrobiopterin is required to convert Phe to Tyr and is required to convert Tyr to <b>L-DOPA</b> via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. <b>L-DOPA,</b> in turn, is converted to dopamine. Low levels of dopamine lead to high levels of prolactin. By contrast, in classical PKU (without dihydrobiopterin involvement), prolactin levels would be relatively normal.|$|E
25|$|Clinicians try {{to avoid}} these side effects by {{limiting}} <b>L-DOPA</b> doses {{as much as possible}} until absolutely necessary.|$|E
25|$|Levodopa (<b>L-Dopa),</b> a drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease, improves parkinsonian symptoms in a small percentage of MSA patients. A recent trial reported that only 1.5% of MSA patients experienced a less than 50% improvement when taking levodopa, and even this was a transient effect lasting less than one year. Poor response to <b>L-Dopa</b> has been suggested as a possible element in the differential diagnosis of MSA from Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{dopamine}} dysregulation: The {{long-term use}} of <b>L-DOPA</b> in Parkinson's disease {{has been linked}} to the so-called dopamine dysregulation syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{adverse effects}} are {{associated}} with <b>L-DOPA,</b> in particular psychiatric ones, it has fewer than other antiparkinsonian agents, such as anticholinergics and dopamine receptor agonists.|$|E
25|$|In its pill form, {{selegiline}} is used {{to treat}} symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It {{can be used on}} its own or in a combination with another agent, most often <b>L-DOPA.</b>|$|E
25|$|Herbal {{extracts}} containing <b>L-DOPA</b> are available; high-yielding sources include Mucuna pruriens (velvet bean), and Vicia faba (broad bean), {{while other}} sources include the genera Phanera, Piliostigma, Cassia, Canavalia, and Dalbergia.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is {{produced}} {{in the human body}} along the same biosynthetic pathway as morphine. Urinary concentrations of endogenous codeine and morphine have been found to significantly increase in individuals taking <b>L-DOPA</b> for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|The main {{prevention}} measure proposed is the prescription {{of the lowest}} possible dose of dopamine replacement therapy to individuals at risk. The minimization {{of the use of}} dopamine agonists, and of short duration formulations of <b>L-Dopa</b> can also decrease risk of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a {{retrospective}} analysis comparing the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) between patients taking vs. not taking <b>L-DOPA</b> found that the drug delayed onset of AMD by ~8 years. The authors state that significant effects were obtained for {{both dry and wet}} AMD.|$|E
25|$|The 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry {{was also}} related to L-DOPA: the Nobel Committee awarded one-quarter of the prize to William S. Knowles {{for his work on}} chirally catalysed {{hydrogenation}} reactions, the most noted example of which was used for the synthesis of <b>L-DOPA.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is a minor}} {{contributor}} to total circulating catecholamines (<b>L-DOPA</b> is at a higher concentration in the plasma), though it contributes over 90% of circulating epinephrine. Little epinephrine is found in other tissues, mostly in scattered chromaffin cells. Following adrenalectomy, epinephrine disappears below the detection limit in the blood stream.|$|E
25|$|Selegiline delays {{the time}} point when the <b>L-DOPA</b> (levodopa) {{treatment}} becomes necessary from about 11 months to about 18 months after diagnosis, which is beneficial despite not being definitive evidence of neuroprotection. The rationale for adding selegiline to levodopa is {{to decrease the}} required dose of levodopa and thus reduce the motor complications of levodopa therapy.|$|E
25|$|L-Phenylalanine is biologically {{converted}} into L-tyrosine, {{another one of}} the DNA-encoded amino acids, and beta-phenethylamine. L-tyrosine in turn is {{converted into}} <b>L-DOPA,</b> which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenethylamine is further converted into N-methylphenethylamine. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier, and, in large quantities, interferes with the production of serotonin.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Calvin {{discovered}} that copper(II) complexes oxidized H2. The 1960s witnessed {{the development of}} well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes, e.g., Wilkinson's catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3). Soon thereafter cationic Rh and Ir were found catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls. In the 1970s, asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated in the synthesis of <b>L-DOPA,</b> and the 1990s saw the invention of Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation. The development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the oxo process and Ziegler–Natta polymerization.|$|E
