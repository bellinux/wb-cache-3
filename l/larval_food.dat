5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or in small groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as <b>larval</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
25|$|The female heath {{fritillary}} lays its eggs (or ova) in batches of (15–)80–150 {{on the underside}} of leaf of a <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant or on a plant adjacent to the <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant.|$|E

50|$|One {{interesting}} {{example of}} plant/animal interaction involves the butterfly Placidula euryanassa, which uses Brugmansia suaveolens {{as one of}} its main <b>larval</b> <b>foods.</b> It has been shown that these can sequester the plant's tropane alkaloids and store them through the pupal stage on to the adult butterfly, where they are then used as a defense mechanism, making themselves less palatable to vertebrate predators.|$|R

25|$|This species {{does not}} fly high, but seems to keep within 3m {{of the ground}} and tends to rest on {{vegetation}} in the regions of a meter off the ground. Acraea terpsicore {{can be seen in}} abundance wherever its <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant (Passiflora species) is found. The adult tends to avoid dense undergrowth and shady areas, instead keeping to open spaces in all types of vegetation.|$|E
25|$|This species {{engages in}} {{trophallaxis}} with the larvae. Regardless of the attributes {{and conditions of}} each larva, they are fed roughly {{the same amount of}} liquid food. The rate of trophallaxis may increase with <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> deprivation, but such increase depends on the size of each larva. Larvae that are fed regularly tend to be given small amounts. To reach satiation, all larvae regardless of their size generally require the equivalent of eight hours of feeding.|$|E
25|$|The <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> {{plants in}} Southern Africa are Sclerocroton integerrimus (Sapium integerrimum) and the jumping-seed tree (Sclerocroton ellipticus). In Kenya, the larva have been {{recorded}} on Excoecaria, Phyllanthus, Macaranga, Kigelia and Sterculia. The larvae are gregarious and at first only eat the upper layer of the leaves, working from the tip to the base, and leaving a pale green dead leaf behind. As they grow older, the larvae begin to eat the entire leaf, starting at the leaf margin. Sometimes the larvae defoliate individual trees.|$|E

5000|$|This {{butterfly}} primarily breeds on Scotch lovage (Ligusticum scoticum) and {{is often}} found very near the ocean where its <b>larval</b> stage <b>food</b> sources grow. It is especially fond of headlands with Scotch lovage {{and members of the}} parsley family (Apiaceae), including cow parsnip (Heracleum species), angelica (Angelica atropurpurea). It is a very strong flier so windy locations are not an issue.|$|R
50|$|Fragrant in {{the evenings}} to attract pollinating moths, they hang half-closed during the day, but return to their peak again {{in the evenings}}. Brugmansia have two main stages to their life cycle. In the initial {{vegetative}} stage the young seedling grows straight up on usually a single stalk, until it reaches its first main fork at 80 - 150 cm high. It will not flower until after it has reached this fork, and then only on new growth above the fork. Cuttings taken from lower vegetative region must also grow to a similar height before flowering, but cuttings from the upper flowering region will often flower at a very low height.One interesting example of plant/animal interaction involves the butterfly Placidula euryanassa, who uses Brugmansia suaveolens {{as one of its}} main <b>larval</b> <b>foods.</b> It has been shown that these can sequester the plant's tropane alkaloids and store them through the pupal stage on to the adult butterfly, where they are then used as a defense mechanism, making themselves less palatable to vertebrate predators.|$|R
25|$|The red body, slow {{peculiar}} flight, bright colouration {{and pattern}} of the wings are meant to indicate to predators that this butterfly is inedible, being well protected by the poisons it has sequestered from its <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant. It also emits a nasty smelling substance when handled to further enhance its unappealing qualities. Hence it is rarely attacked by predators, a strategy so successful, that edible butterflies have evolved to mimic it, the classic example being that of the female morph of the common Mormon that is Papilio polytes, female form stichius.|$|E
25|$|In the UK the Glanville {{fritillary}} occurs only on soft undercliff and chine grassland {{and where}} its main <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant Plantago lanceolata (English plantain) occurs in abundance on sheltered, south facing slopes. The Glanville fritillary {{is a highly}} restricted species within the UK, being confined to the southern coast of the Isle of Wight. It also occurs in the Channel Islands, and since 1990 {{there has been a}} mainland site on the Hampshire coast, possibly the result of an introduction. There are small introduced populations on the Somerset coast and two in Surrey: one near Wrecclesham, and one at a nature reserve in Addington, near Croydon.|$|E
2500|$|The larvae feed on creepers and climbers of {{the genus}} Aristolochia, family Aristolochiaceae, and they {{sequester}} toxins such as aristolochic acid in their bodies.

50|$|It is {{believed}} that the adult butterfly's black-spotted orange markings are a sign of unpalatability, {{and they may be}} toxic due to the <b>larval</b> stage's poisonous <b>food</b> plants. It is suspected that they may form part of a mimicry ring with Telchinia serena.|$|R

2500|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study from}} 2008 suggests firstly that Baronia brevicornis Salvin 1893, rather than belonging to an outgroup Baroniinae belongs to Parnassiini, together with Hypermnestra and Parnassius. Secondly that the earliest split within the genus Parnassius is between subgenus Parnassius (the 'apollo' group, whose caterpillars feed on Crassulaceae, exceptionally Saxifragaceae) and the ancestor {{of the remaining}} seven subgenera. The existence of the subgenera is confirmed by molecular phylogenies. Six of the other subgenera have Fumariaceae as the <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant, while the larvae of the remaining genus Kreizbergia feed on Scrophulariaceae ...|$|E
2500|$|A female Glanville {{fritillary}} {{will lay}} {{as many as}} 10 clutches of eggs in her lifetime. These clutches can {{range in size from}} 50 up to 300 eggs and are laid {{on the underside of the}} <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plant of either Plantago lanceolata (ribwort plantain) or Veronica spicata (spiked speedwell).. After hatching, the caterpillars feed on their host plants until the end of the summer where they spin a [...] "winter nest" [...] to diapause. When winter is over they emerge from their nest to feed again before pupating around the beginning of May. A month later, the adult fritillaries emerge and go about their adult lives of feeding, mating, and laying eggs.|$|E
2500|$|Overwintering {{populations of}} D. plexippus {{are found in}} Mexico, California, along the Gulf Coast, year round in Florida, and in Arizona where the habitat has the {{specific}} conditions necessary for their survival. On the US East Coast, they have overwintered {{as far north as}} Lago [...] Mar, Virginia Beach, Virginia. Their wintering habitat typically provides access to streams, plenty of sunlight (enabling body temperatures that allow flight), and appropriate roosting vegetation, and is relatively free of predators. Overwintering, roosting butterflies have been seen on basswoods, elms, sumacs, locusts, oaks, osage-oranges, mulberries, pecans, willows, cottonwoods, and mesquites. While breeding, monarch habitats can be found in agricultural fields, pasture land, prairie remnants, urban and suburban residential areas, gardens, trees, and roadsides – anywhere where there is access to larval host plants. Habitat restoration is a primary goal in monarch conservation efforts. Habitat requirements change during migration. During the fall migration, butterflies must have access to nectar-producing plants. During the spring migration, butterflies must have access to <b>larval</b> <b>food</b> plants and nectar plants.|$|E
50|$|Opomyza florum {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 3.5-5 mm. These small flies are rusty-yellow coloured, with several dark setae on mesonotum and scutellum. Eyes are reddish. Wings are {{yellowish}} and transparent, with some smoky-brown spots. The <b>larval</b> main <b>food</b> plants are wild cereals, leguminous and cereal crops. Larvae are oligophagous stem borer, feeding on the stems of plants. They {{can be found in}} early spring while adults fly at the end of May-June until October. This species is an agricultural pest, damaging winter cereals such as wheat, barley and rye.|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{distribution}} of first-feeding <b>larval</b> anchovyand their <b>food</b> were made to test the hypothesis that the upper mixed layer of the ocean must be in a stable (non-turbulent) state for survival of enough larval anchovy to insure the production of a good year-class. Turbulent conditions destroy food aggregations and dilute potential food organisms to below feeding threshold concentrations of first-feeding larval anchovies. Surveys during the anchovy spawning season of 1975, 1976, and 1978 provided data supporting this hypothesis. <b>Food</b> of first-feeding <b>larval</b> anchovies became limiting when storms (1978) or drastic upwelling (1975) occurred which diluted food aggregations. A complicating factor was that nutritionally inadequate <b>larval</b> fish <b>food</b> could be occasionally overwhelmingly dominant in the larva's environment (1975). The drought year (1976) was characterized by stable conditions in the Southern California Bight and produced one of the best of the last 16 anchovy year-classes; 1975 produced one of the worst. Partial success of the anchovy year-class in 1978 is predicted based on the onset of stable conditions and food aggregations {{in the latter part of}} the spawning season...|$|R
40|$|Diets of 76 {{species of}} fish larvae from most oceans of the world were {{inventoried}} {{on the basis of}} information in 40 published studies. Although certaln geographlc, size- and taxon-specific patterns were apparent, certain zooplankton taxa appeared in the diets of larvae of a variety of fish species in numerous localities. Included were six genera of calanoid copepods (Acartia, Calanus, Centropages, Paracalanus, Pseudocaianus, Temora), three genera of cyclopoid copepods (Corycaeus, Oilhona, Oncata), harpacticoid copepods, copepod nauplii, tintinoids, cladocerans of the genera Evadne and Podon, barnacle nauplii, gastropod larvae, pteropods of the genus Limacina, and appendicularians. Literature on feeding habits of these zooplankters reveals that most of the copepods are omnivorous, feeding upon both phytoplankton and other zooplankton. Some taxa, such as Calanus, Paracalanus, Pseudocalanus, and copepod nauplii appear to be primarily herbivorous, while others, such as Acartia, Centropages, Temora, and cyclopoids exhibit broad omnivory or carnivory. The noncopepod zooplankters are primarily filter-feeders upon pbytoplankton and/or bacterioplankton. Despite the importance of zooplankters in <b>larval</b> fish <b>food</b> webs, spectic knowledge of the feeding ecology of many taxa is poor. Further, much present knowledge comes only from laboratory investigations that may not accurately portray feeding habits of zooplankters in nature. Lack of knowledge of the feeding ecology of many abundant zooplankters, which are also important in <b>larval</b> fish <b>food</b> webs, precludes realistic understanding of pelagic ecosystem dynamics.
