25|$|Analog scopes do not {{necessarily}} include a calibrated reference grid for size measurement of waves, {{and they may not}} display waves in the traditional sense of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for signal analysis by feeding a reference signal into one axis and the signal to measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a <b>Lissajous</b> <b>curve.</b> The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the measurement signal in relation to the reference signal, and is useful across a wide range of oscillation frequencies.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we study}} multivariate {{polynomial}} interpolation and quadrature rules on non-tensor product node sets related to <b>Lissajous</b> <b>curves</b> and Chebyshev varieties. After classifying multivariate <b>Lissajous</b> <b>curves</b> and the interpolation nodes linked to these curves, we derive a discrete orthogonality structure on these node sets. Using this orthogonality structure, we obtain unique polynomial interpolation in appropriately defined spaces of multivariate Chebyshev polynomials. Our results generalize corresponding interpolation and quadrature {{results for the}} Chebyshev-Gauß-Lobatto points in dimension one and the Padua points in dimension two.

40|$|Motivated by an {{application}} in Magnetic Particle Imaging, we study bivariate Lagrange interpolation at the node points of <b>Lissajous</b> <b>curves.</b> The resulting theory is a generalization of the polynomial interpolation theory developed for a node set known as Padua points.

An explicit formula for the Lagrange polynomials allows to compute the interpolating polynomial with a simple algorithmic scheme. Compared to the already established schemes of the Padua and Xu points, the numerical results for the proposed scheme show similar approximation errors and a similar growth of the Lebesgue constant.
