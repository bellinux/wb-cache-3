5|$|According to the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{the most}} common species' of birds found within the woods are mute swan, Canada goose, robin, green woodpecker, jay, nuthatch, <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> greater spotted woodpecker, cuckoo, sparrowhawk, tree creeper, tawny owl, willow tit and woodcock.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European green woodpecker and the <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E
50|$|Populations of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> {{are mostly}} resident, {{but can be}} nomadic to some degree. Annual {{fluctuations}} in population numbers are common. The winter temperatures may have a direct effect on winter survival of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> by heat loss, whereas weather conditions during spring have an indirect effect on breeding performance by affecting food sources. In 2017, the UK population of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> {{was reported to have}} almost halved since 2009, to around 2,000. The British Ornithology Trust blamed modern habits of removing dead trees quickly from parks and woodland, depriving the birds of the decaying wood which is their favoured nesting habitat.|$|R

500|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} (Dendrocopos major) is {{a medium-sized}} woodpecker with pied black and white plumage and a red patch on the lower belly. Males and young birds also have red markings on the neck or head. This species is found across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Across most of its range it is resident, but in the north some will migrate if the conifer cone crop fails. Some individuals {{have a tendency to}} wander, leading to the recent recolonisation of Ireland and [...] to vagrancy to North America. Great spotted woodpeckers chisel into trees to find food or excavate nest holes, and also drum for contact and territorial advertisement; they have anatomical adaptations to manage the physical stresses from the hammering action. It is similar to the less common <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|E

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{exceptions}} to the general responses of migratory and non-migratory bird species. Among the European non-migratory forest specialists, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Spotted</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> (Dendrocopos minor) declined from a very high population in the 1980 s, when they benefited from the widespread death of trees from acid rain (Flousek 1989). Bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) have also declined, {{for reasons that are}} unknown (Siriwardena et al. 2001; Marquiss 2007), and have remained at a low level in parts of Europe. However, populations of both species appear to have stabilized over the past 5 to 10 [*]years. There are also regionally migrating species that show increasing abundance, such as Stock Doves (Columba oenas), which might profit not only from the increasing abundance of Black Woodpeckers (Drycopus martius), because they use old nesting holes made by woodpecker (Kosiński et al. 2011) but also from increasing maize cultivation in agriculture, and Common Chiffchaffs (Phylloscopus collybita), which profit from an increase in the area of mixed forests (Gregory et al. 2007). Among the continentally migrating species, there is one species that has increased (Common Redstart, Phoenicurus phoenicurus; Fig.  2 b). Common Redstarts breed in parks, gardens, sport fields, and other habitats where trees do not form a continuous canopy (Sedláček et al. 2004) and rely on areas with sparse vegetation for foraging (Martinez et al. 2010). Thus, the apparent increase may reflect a recovery from low numbers in the late twentieth century.|$|R

40|$|Over 9 years, 116 {{breeding}} attempts made by individually marked <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Dendrocopos minor) {{were followed}} {{in a study}} area in southern Sweden. The home-range area decreased from on average 742 ha in winter to a defended territory of 103 ha prior to breeding and 43 ha during nesting. The annual timing of the breeding varied between years but was each year synchronized with the bud burst of oaks. The mean clutch size was constant between years but showed a steep decline within the season. Early broods produced more recruited young, and the clutch size laid is suggested to be adjusted to the declining reproductive value of young, as influenced by the laying date relative {{to the rest of}} the population. Most birds died in spring and summer and the survival of both sexes was related to factors in the breeding season. Winter mortality was remarkably low, and as judged by foraging behaviour, energy was not limiting in winter. The main cause of breeding failure was the loss of the partner, whereupon the widowed bird gave up the breeding attempt. Failures occurred predominantly in pairs breeding together for the first time, leading to a considerably higher success for established pairs, who also started breeding earlier. Hence, there clearly was a high premium in retaining the mate, which may explain the strong mate and site fidelity found. An implication of this is that the fitness of either bird in the pair was influenced by the condition of the partner. This, and the overall lower survival of females compared to males, may explain the larger share in parental care assumed by the male. In situations with a skewed sex-ratio, multi-nest polygamy occurred. In 16 % of the breeding attempts, males were mated to polyandrous females, and in 6 % females were mated to polygynous males. Polyandrous females invested equally in all nests and polyandry was clearly succesful for the females, producing more young than monogamous females. Polygynous males appeared to invest mainly in the primary nest and were less succesful than polyandrous females...|$|R
