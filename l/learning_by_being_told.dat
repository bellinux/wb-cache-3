40|$|Can {{computers}} learn? Recent {{research on}} learning {{theory suggests that}} in an appropriate sense {{the answer to this}} question is affirmative. We take a peek at some learning theories our predecesors and ourselves have developed in the history of science. 1 1 Principle of Simplicity We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. [Isaac Newton, Principia, 1686] The Oxford English Dictionary defines induction as "the process of inferring a general law or principle from the observations of particular instances". This is what we call "learning" in this lecture. In AI one speaks about learning by examples, learning from observation, and, perhaps, learning by analogy. There are other kinds of learning paradigms such as rote learning, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told,</b> and so on [?]. It might be debatable whether the latter methods of acquiring knowledge should be studied as learning or as programming. In this talk, we are intereste [...] ...|$|E

40|$|MediaMOO is a text-based, networked, {{virtual reality}} {{environment}} {{designed to enhance}} professional community among media researchers. MediaMOO officially opened on January, 20 th, 1993, and as of December 1994 has more than 1000 members from 29 countries. An application is required to join, and only those actively engaged in media research are admitted. Unlike many virtual environments, the world of MediaMOO is continuously being constructed and reconstructed by its members. This paper analyzes experience with the system to date, and {{highlights the importance of}} “constructionist ” principles in virtual reality design. The philosophy of constructionism argues that people learn with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful projects; learning by doing is better than <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told.</b> This approach is most often applied to children’s learning. We believe that not enough attention is paid to its broader applicability.

5000|$|Research {{conducted}} by Shaffer, D., Squire, K., Halverson, R., & Gee, J. P. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison shows {{the educational and}} social benefits of digital games. Games {{do not need to}} be specifically geared towards education to be educational tools. Games can bring together ways of knowing, ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of caring. [...] As John Dewey argued, schools are built on an obsession with facts. Students need to <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> doing, and with gaming, students can <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> doing something as a part of a larger community of people who share common goals and ways of achieving those common goals, making gaming a benefit for social reasons as well. Gaming has also changed the look of content-driven curriculum in schools. In content-driven media, people <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told</b> and reflecting on what they are told. In gaming, game designers create digital environments and game levels that shape, facilitate and even teach problem solving.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this article was to review the {{literature}} on lecture effectiveness and to suggest avenues for improvements. Methods: Selective literature review with an emphasis on active learning in the classroom setting. Results: Conventional lectures are effective only to a limited extent in attaining important curriculum objectives. They do not promote critical thinking; student attendance tends to be low and so is cognitive engagement; furthermore, the idea that lectures should and can cover all essential subject matter is false. Moreover, empirical literature on what students actually learn from lectures is lacking. A most fundamental problem of lectures is that they are based on the information transmission fallacy, the idea that students <b>learn</b> just <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told.</b> The paper proposes an alternative approach to lecturing based on studies in teaching the natural sciences: active learning in the classroom. This approach has four key elements: (a) an initial individual <b>learning</b> attempt <b>by</b> students to master important concepts or ideas, (b) the presentation of a relevant problem by the teacher in the classroom setting, (c) elaborative activities of individual students or small groups of peers to come up with solutions to the problem, and (d) feedback of the teacher. Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that active learning in the classroom setting supports and fosters learning to a much larger extent than conventional large-group teaching...|$|R
60|$|This maxim, however, when {{considered}} as a principle of reasoning, appears suited {{to a system of}} metaphysics once indeed generally received, but which for the last two centuries has been {{considered as}} finally abandoned, though there have not been wanting in our own day attempts at its revival. So long as what are termed Universals were regarded as a peculiar kind of substances, having an objective existence distinct from the individual objects classed under them, the dictum de omni conveyed an important meaning; because it expressed the intercommunity of nature, which it was necessary on that theory that we should suppose to exist between those general substances and the particular substances which were subordinated to them. That every thing predicable of the universal was predicable of the various individuals contained under it, was then no identical proposition, but a statement of what was conceived as a fundamental law of the universe. The assertion that the entire nature and properties of the substantia secunda formed part of the nature and properties of each of the individual substances called by the same name; that the properties of Man, for example, were properties of all men; was a proposition of real significance when man did not mean all men, but something inherent in men, and vastly superior to them in dignity. Now, however, when it is known that a class, a universal, a genus or species, is not an entity per se, but neither more nor less than the individual substances themselves which are placed in the class, and that there is nothing real in the matter except those objects, a common name given to them, and common attributes indicated by the name; what, I should be glad to know, do we <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told,</b> that whatever can be affirmed of a class, may be affirmed of every object contained in the class? The class is nothing but the objects contained in it: and the dictum de omni merely amounts to the identical proposition, that whatever is true of certain objects, is true of each of those objects. If all ratiocination were no more than the application of this maxim to particular cases, the syllogism would indeed be, what it has so often been declared to be, solemn trifling. The dictum de omni is on a par with another truth, which in its time was also reckoned of great importance, “Whatever is, is.” To give any real meaning to the dictum de omni, we must consider it not as an axiom, but as a definition; we must look upon it as intended to explain, in a circuitous and paraphrastic manner, {{the meaning of the word}} class.|$|R
40|$|The {{layout of}} {{information}} is a complex task, and is usual-ly entrusted to a professional graphic designer. Research into automatic layout attempts to develop computational models of problem solving techniques used by graphic designers to solve layout problems. Graphic designers develop their problem solving skills through years of learning by following three approaches: i) <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told,</b> ii) learning by example, and iii) learning by doing. Each form of learning involves the development of internal representations of that which is learned. This research seeks to develop computer-based knowledge representations of {{the result of the}} learning experiences from each of the three approaches, with the eventual goal of developing a methodology to build page layout understanding systems. In this research, understanding is defined as the task of automatically creating a high-level, structured representation of the layout from a structurally poor representation. As part of this research, we have built an experimental system which automatically converts a structurally poor representation of an existing layout- an image obtained by optically scanning an existing layout- into a high-level, structured representation- the input layout is encode...|$|E
40|$|Another {{thing about}} moose-crossing is that I {{feel as if}} I can really help someone. I like {{learning}} and doing stuff on my own, but the real reason I come to moose-crossing is that I feel needed, and wanted. While programing? {{is a lot of}} fun, I don’t think I’d do it, if there wasn’t anyone who would apprecitate it”. Rachael (girl, age 13) Abstract. MOOSE Crossing is a text-based virtual reality environment (or “MUD”) designed to be a constructionist learning environment for children ages eight to thirteen. The constructionist philosophy of education argues that learning through designing and constructing personally meaningful projects is better than <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told.</b> Children on MOOSE Crossing learn computer programming and improve their reading and writing by working on self-selected projects in a self-motivated, peer-supported fashion. In experience with over 180 children and 90 adults using the system since October 1995, we have found that the community provides essential support for the children’s learning experiences. The community provides role models; situated, ubiquitous project models; emotional support to overcome technophobia; technical support; and an appreciative audience for completed work. This paper examines the nature of that support in detail, and argues that community support for learning is an essential element in collaborative work and learning on the Internet...|$|E
40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{explains a}} typical data mining algorithm, i. e., ID 3 and shows some examples. Knowledge for Making Decisions (classifications) There are three {{ways in which}} humans acquire knowledge: <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told</b> learning by observation and discovery; and learning by induction. The knowledge engineer acquires knowledge from the domain expert by the first two means. These means may be augmented by software, but not automated. This process is very time consuming averaging between 2 and 5 rules per person day! The latter means however may be automated and is a most efficient method of capturing knowledge. Knowledge acquisition is the activity whereby the machine acquires expert knowledge in order to solve some specific problems. It results in a knowledge base. Probably, knowledge acquisition {{is the most difficult}} aspect in developing an expert system because experts are more likely to know how to solve a particular problem under certain circumstances rather than saying how to solve problems under various circumstances. Expert systems need large chunks of knowledge to achieve high levels of performances, and the process to obtain knowledge from experts is tedious and time-consuming; this impasse is universally known as Feigenbaum bottleneck (see figure 1). To circumvent this problem, the research believes that: The only realistic approach to the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is to automate the process (Quinlan, 1987) ...|$|E

40|$|An {{architecture}} for {{a flight}} expert system (FLES) to assist pilots in monitoring, diagnosing, and recovering from inflight faults is described. A prototype was implemented and {{an attempt was made}} to automate the knowledge acquisition process by employing a <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told</b> methodology. The scope of acquired knowledge ranges from domain knowledge, including the information about objects and their relationships, to the procedural knowledge associated with the functionality of the mechanisms. AKAS (automatic knowledge acquisition system) is the constructed prototype for demonstration proof of concept, in which the expert directly interfaces with the knowledge acquisition system to ultimately construct the knowledge base for the particular application. The expert talks directly to the system using a natural language restricted only by the extent of the definitions in an analyzer dictionary, i. e., the interface understands a subset of concepts related to a given domain. In this case, the domain is the electrical system of the Boeing 737. Efforts were made to define and employ heuristics as well as algorithmic rules to conceptualize data produced by normal and faulty jet engine behavior examples. These rules were employed in developing the machine learning system (MLS). The input to MLS is examples which contain data of normal and faulty engine behavior and which are obtained from an engine simulation program. MLS first transforms the data into discrete selectors. Partial descriptions formed by those selectors are then generalized or specialized to generate concept descriptions about faults. The concepts are represented in the form of characteristic and discriminant descriptions, which are stored in the knowledge base and are employed to diagnose faults. MLS was successfully tested on jet engine examples...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{two main}} themes, {{autonomous}} agents and concepts. An autonomous agent {{is a system}} capable of interacting with its environment via its own sensors and effectors {{in order to accomplish}} some task. Arguments against both purely reactive and purely deliberative agent architectures are presented in favor for hybrid approaches. A novel hybrid approach based on the concept of anticipatory systems is suggested. The basic idea is to let a meta-level component ``run'' a world model faster than real time to make predictions of future states. These predictions are used to guide the agent's behavior on a high-level, whereas the low-level behavior is controlled by a reactive component. A specialization of this architecture, a linearly quasi-anticipatory agent architecture, which treats all agents in the domain (itself included) as being reactive, has been implemented. According to this approach, the state space is divided into desired and undesired regions. When the meta-level component detects that the simulated reactive system has reached an undesired state, it modifies the actual reactive system in order to avoid reaching this state. Results from both single and multi-agent experiments indicate that the behavior of such agents is superior to that of the corresponding reactive agents. Autonomous agents also provide the framework in which the representation and the acquisition of concepts are studied. However, these topics should not be studied without first answering some more fundamental questions regarding concepts, such as: What does it mean to have a concept? What functions do, or should, concepts serve? What is known about the nature of categories? Thus, by trying to answer these questions, we investigate the very concept of concepts. Although these topics seldom are discussed within Artificial Intelligence, they have received some attention in related fields, e. g., cognitive psychology and philosophy. One of the main goals of this thesis is to pull together different lines of argumentation that have emerged from the cognitive sciences in order to establish a solid foundation for further AI research. Previous approaches to concept representation are evaluated {{in the light of the}} answers to the questions above. It is concluded that none of the existing approaches is able to serve all the desired functions and that it is unrealistic to expect that any monolithic representation would be adequate. Based on this insight, a novel composite representation scheme is presented in which each component is motivated by the functions a concept should serve. Regarding the acquisition of concepts, some of the requirements that any autonomous concept learning system must meet are identified and provide the basis for an evaluation of the existing theories. A method for making any learning algorithm satisfy one such requirement, namely that of representing concepts by characteristic descriptions, is presented together with some promising experimental results. In contrast to previous methods for learning characteristic descriptions, it is possible with this method to control the degree of generalization. In addition, a new model for integrating <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told,</b> learning from examples and learning by observation is outlined...|$|E
40|$|The human {{resources}} approach to national development has challenged educators {{to find ways}} of communicating with village people that do not rely on the written word. Pictures are being used increasingly as a way to deliver messages to illiterate groups. Recent cross-cultural research has shown, however, that many of the assumptions made about the kinds of information that can be delivered through pictures needs to be re-examined. Part I of the study sets forth the rationale for using pictures in nonformal educational settings and examines two current approaches to the problem of picture perception. The 2 ̆ 2 constructive 2 ̆ 2 theory maintains that pictures are inherently ambiguous and require active interpretation {{on the part of the}} viewer. The 2 ̆ 2 registration 2 ̆ 2 theory suggests that pictures give information which derives from the ecology of light. In this view, the recognition of graphic depictions is considered to be a fairly passive matter and a gift allowed to us by the environment. The evidence of cross-cultural research in picture perception which fives support to each of these positions is reviewed. Part I also discusses cross-cultural studies of intelligence and examines a body of literature which demonstrates that the intellectual demands of village life are often such that they do not stimulate some of the higher cognitive processes identified by Piaget. The author takes the position advanced by Piaget and Vygotsky that the development of conceptual awareness advances from an intuitive level to one of conscious understanding. Bruner 2 ̆ 7 s thesis concerning three modes of learning is also discussed. The traditional modes of learning in village settings are enactive (learning by doing) and iconic (learning by modeling). Symbolic learning which is <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>told,</b> usually takes place out of the context of ongoing action and, as such, is a radical departure from traditional practice. Like written language, pictures provide a form of symbolically coded experience, and in many cases the learner must be consciously aware of the cures of pictorial expression and how they are used, in order to properly decode their meaning. Part II details an empirical study carried out in Nepal with four samples of adult subjects: villagers with no schooling, villagers wit some primary or secondary schooling, workers in a furniture factory in the capital city of Kathmandu, and students at Tribhuvan University 2 ̆ 7 s Institute of Engineering. A series of sixteen experiments was carried out. The abilities tested were the recognition of depicted objects, the understanding of spatial relationships in concrete situations, and the comprehension of pictorial space. In an effort to avoid introducing arbitrary graphic conventions, photographs and line drawings based on photographs were primarily used as the pictorial stimuli. The recognition of familiar objects in pictures was found to be a great deal easier than the comprehension of pictorial space. The village samples showed a generally poor understanding of euclidian and projective relationships both with regard to real objects and in interpreting pictures. The furniture factory workers and the engineering students performed at higher levels on all experiments, showing that environmental influences or specific experiences of some kind are important both in the development of spatial abilities and in the understanding of pictorial space. On the other hand, topological relationships in pictures were easily grasped by almost all of the villagers. The author concludes that perspective information was understood at only an intuitive level by the majority of the villagers tested and could not be consciously applied to the interpretation of spatial relationships in pictures. Projective information was consistently interpreted topologically by most of the village subjects. The author suggests that the recognition of familiar objects in pictures is largely an ability which does not require special learning, but that the interpretation of pictorial space is an active process which calls for conscious awareness of projective principles. Recommendations for the design of visual materials for use in nonformal educational settings are made...|$|E
