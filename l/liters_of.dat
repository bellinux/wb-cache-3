5|$|Oil spills are {{recorded}} both {{in case of}} maritime routes and pipeline routes to the main refineries. Oil spills, amounting {{to as much as}} 7.56 billion <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> oil entering the oceans every year, occur due to damaged equipment or human error.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} have had stones, {{prevention}} is by drinking fluids such that more than two <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol may be taken. It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Between 1996 and 1998, {{the average}} pH of Little Nescopeck Creek was 4.6. During the same period, {{the waters of}} the creek {{contained}} an average of 130.87 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> sulfate, 4.03 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> aluminum, 2.01 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> iron, 1.83 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> manganese, and 0.31 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> zinc.|$|R
5|$|On {{the western}} side of the lower reaches of the Kettle Creek watershed, there is an {{underground}} mine complex with 26 sources of acid mine drainage. The acid mine drainage enters Kettle Creek, among other streams in the area and the sources of it have an average discharge of 479 gallons per minute. They also have 304 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> acidity, 44 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> iron, 21 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> aluminum, 8 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> manganese, and 930 milligrams per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> sulfates. The alkalinity load from the Alvin R. Bush Dam is about 15 times greater than the acidity load from these acid mine discharges.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Malaysia ran {{its first}} project in June, 2015, and {{is run by}} a Malaysia-based social {{business}} called Incitement, founded by Zikry Kholil and Daniel de Gruijter, which runs several social initiatives. <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Malaysia has thus far completed 21 projects, predominantly for marginalized communities in Pahang, Malaysia and the Oran Asli communities living in Cameron Highlands. After Incitement launched <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Malaysia, it has also pushed <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light into the Italian market under the umbrella of Incitement Italy. For 2016 <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Malaysia had another 6 projects confirmed [...] and also plans to do several projects in Sabah and Sarawak, Borneo, to benefit a further 1000 families. Till date, <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Malaysia has installed 908 solar powered lamps in the rural areas of Malaysia, effectively providing light at night for more than 3,000 underprivileged Malaysians.|$|R
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E
5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon, with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story has it that a man kept such an ala in his barn; she drank thirty <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E
5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E
25|$|One <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other words, for {{the same}} energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient. A larger percentage of the energy available in a <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> alcohol fuel {{can be converted to}} useful work. This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|R
50|$|<b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Netherlands aims at realizing {{projects}} in suitable countries {{with the purpose}} of establishing a local <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light sub-organization and its work is threefold. Prior to the project, the work focuses mainly on gathering information, preparing the projects, promoting and fundraising. During the projects abroad, the project focuses on spreading the idea and inspiring people to get involved with <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light and even starting their own project. Therefore, empowering the partner organization is a major goal and includes holding bottle-building workshops on site and setting up an operational framework. After the project, the partner organizations will be assisted and continuously supported by <b>Liter</b> <b>of</b> Light Netherlands.|$|R
25|$|There {{are between}} 10 and 36 micrograms per <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> copper in nine {{different}} sites in and near Little Nescopeck Creek.

The average concentration of sulfates upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel is below 10 milligrams per liter, but it is 257 milligrams per <b>liter</b> downstream <b>of</b> the tunnel. The average concentration of calcium carbonate upstream of the tunnel is 33 milligrams per <b>liter,</b> and downstream <b>of</b> it, it is 272 milligrams per liter.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the final, Hamm {{collapsed in the}} locker room from severe hydration. She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, she joined the team for magazine cover shoots, went to Disneyland for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{by-products}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} of heavy water—a key component in nuclear weapons, and necessary for the Germany designs as a moderator. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> heavy water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} an export license. In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, T'Pol teaches some of {{the colonists}} how to evade edged-weapon attacks (from Vulcan martial-art 'Suus-mahna'), while Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) teach other colonists how to fire their weapons more accurately. Archer and Tucker then suggest the colonists shift the entire colony to the south 50 meters. When the Klingon marauders arrive, the colony appears deserted and silent. Finally the {{defenders}} show themselves, and in the ensuing fight the Klingons are lured into an area surrounded by the capped-off deuterium well heads. On cue, the wells are ignited, surrounding the Klingons with flames. Tessic then tells the Klingons to leave and never come back. After they depart, Archer is rewarded with 2,000 <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> deuterium by the grateful miners.|$|E
5|$|On {{the supply}} side, since 2005 the {{gasoline}} fuelling stations selling more than 3 million <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> fuel {{a year are}} required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E
