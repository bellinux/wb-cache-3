40|$|There {{is a rich}} {{scholarly}} {{literature on}} sovereign default on external debt. Comparatively {{little is known about}} sovereign defaults on domestic debt. Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980 s. We have filled this gap in the literature by compiling a database on central government public debt (external and domestic). The data span 1914 to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many. Our findings on debt sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal. First, domestic debt is big [...] for the 64 countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total public debt. For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial repression era between WWII and financial liberalization). Second, the data go a <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>toward</b> explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds. Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation. In fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes. Last, the widely-held view that domestic residents are strictly junior to external creditors does not find broad support. ...|$|R

500|$|Named a [...] "sensation", [...] "phenomenon", {{or other}} hyped up words {{in his first}} two years in the league, most of Clyde's {{troubles}} were attributed to the rush to get him into the majors before he was ready. This was due to the fact the Rangers finances were weak at the time. The Rangers averaged a near-capacity crowd in Clyde's six home starts, but 6,000 fans for the other 75 home dates. Prior to Clyde's debut, the highest crowd in Rangers history was 24,000. At the end of the 1973 season, Clyde drew nearly a third of all fans in attendance for Rangers home games throughout the year. According to journalist Randy Galloway, Clyde put baseball on the map in Dallas, as the city started to get interested on the sport, even after Clyde's inconsistency forced him out of the league. Longtime Rangers coach Jackie Moore agreed with Galloway, stating that Clyde and Corbett buying the team [...] "went a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> saving the franchise". Using Clyde success of bringing attendance up as an example, Short sold the Rangers to Brad Corbett in 1974, which prevented the American League from taking over the team, thus potentially saving the franchise.|$|E
60|$|Private Grayrock did not sleep; to {{have done}} so would have imperiled the {{interests}} of the United States, for he was a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> outside the lines and subject to capture or death {{at the hands of the}} enemy. Moreover, he was in a frame of mind unfavorable to repose. The cause of his perturbation of spirit was this: during the previous night he had served on the picket-guard, and had been posted as a sentinel in this very forest. The night was clear, though moonless, but in the gloom of the wood the darkness was deep. Grayrock's post was at a considerable distance from those to right and left, for the pickets had been thrown out a needless distance from the camp, making the line too long for the force detailed to occupy it. The war was young, and military camps entertained the error that while sleeping they were better protected by thin lines a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> out <b>toward</b> the enemy than by thicker ones close in. And surely they needed as long notice as possible of an enemy's approach, for they were at that time addicted to the practice of undressing--than which nothing could be more unsoldierly. On the morning of the memorable 6th of April, at Shiloh, many of Grant's men when spitted on Confederate bayonets were as naked as civilians; but it should be allowed that this was not because of any defect in their picket line. Their error was of another sort: they had no pickets. This is perhaps a vain digression. I should not care to undertake to interest the reader in the fate of an army; what we have here to consider is that of Private Grayrock.|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} trend in multiagent system {{research is the}} use of decentralized control models (notably the decentralized MDP formalism) as the basis for decision theoretic studies of multiagent problem solving. Research often focuses on the development of solution algorithms for some special classes of decentralized MDPs. While these studies will no doubt enhance our understanding of the formal foundations for multiagent system, they have a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go <b>toward</b> the actual making and deployment of decision-theoretic agents. This leads to the need for some new thinkings toward the role of MDPs in multiagent research. Since MDP policies define the mapping between an agent’s knowledge (information states) and its actions, they can be viewed as abstractions to, or be regarded as an external view of, the internal agent reasoning processes. As such, we propose the use of MDPs as a tool for agents to establish meta-level capabilities such as selfmonitoring and self-control. These capabilities are essential for agents to learn organizational knowledge. Furthermore, we also propose to apply this MDP formalism to the group level, to represent the group control and coordination knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{regeneration}} can be {{an effective}} tool to promote sustainability and enhance macro-level quality of life if the principles of encouraging participation, building community character, advancing equity, improving environment and enlivening the economy are observed. Through the assessment of various quality of life indicators related to these five basic principles for sustainable urban regeneration by the public, private and community sectors, this paper finds that Hong Kong falls far short of realizing these fundamental principles. There are also considerable discrepancies between the public and non-public (private and NGOs) sectors in terms of evaluating existing quality of life issues and perceiving their relative priorities. The private and community sectors tend to have lower rating of existing situation and consequently a longer priority list. On the contrary, the public sector seems to be more complacent with the existing quality of life situations and has a much shorter priority list. The public sector's more relaxed attitude coupled with a top-down executive-led polity mean that Hong Kong will probably have a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go <b>toward</b> sustainable urban regeneration. © Springer 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

William Skidelsky in The Guardian agreed that the chapter was [...] "by no means {{the highlight of the}} book". [...] He also wrote: [...] "Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't always give herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic.

Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for her subject and lively style go a <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a gift for summing up an idea with a single vivid image." [...] Allan Massie, reviewing for The Scotsman, could not find a coherent argument being presented and found her writing style [...] "veering uncomfortably between the academic and the jokily colloquial, [...] tiresome, [...] some of her writing is pretentious, much obvious and platitudinous". The reviewers in Salon.com and The Scotsman, as well as The Economist, were all uncomfortable with Atwood not distinguishing or contrasting 'good' and 'bad' debt.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN was {{positive}} about [...] "Homer The Whopper", giving it an 8.6/10 rating. He {{commented that the}} first act of the episode was the strongest, while the others were weaker.

[...] He added, however, that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find [...] "a few new angles with the weight jokes, so it's not a complete loss." [...] Overall, Canning thought [...] "Homer The Whopper" [...] was a good start to the twenty-first season, and although the plot may not be very original, the writers added [...] "freshness to the proceedings." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff did not think the script was as good as Gervais', but commented that Rogen and Goldberg [...] "managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere."

[...] Music critic Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "One reason why her new Ray of Light is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul-searching {{of a woman who}} is at a point in her life where she can look at herself with surprising candor and perspective." [...] Writing for Melody Maker in February 1998, Mark Roland drew comparisons with the music of St Etienne and Björk's Homogenic album, highlighting Ray of Lights lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: [...] "It's not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation, rather it's been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, Ray of Light is like the ugly mug that doesn't match but is all the more special because of it." [...] Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe said that Ray of Light is a remarkable album.
