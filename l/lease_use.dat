By examining leasing within a pecking order framework, profitability and growth are introduced as potentially important determinants of leasing. Financial leases are found to substitute for debt and to be used relatively more by firms with higher credit risk. On the other hand, short-term operating leases do not substitute for debt. Operating leases are used by smaller firms, non-tax paying firms and firms experiencing more rapid sales growth. By confining the sample to one industry, asset factors which are potential determinants of <b>lease</b> <b>use</b> can be controlled for...|$|E
40|$|Land in Ethiopia is {{a public}} property. Farmers have use right to {{transfer}} or <b>lease</b> <b>use</b> rights of agricultural land. Thus, land tenure systems under the existing public ownership of land derive from official allocation by local government authorities and/or through transfer of land use rights. Farmers 2 ̆ 7 practice of leasing agricultural land {{in the country is}} mostly limited to a few years, for instance to maximum of three years in one agreement. The common types of transaction of agricultural land include inheritance, cash renting, sharecropping and gift. The process and act of land transfer among land users, however, is often non-transparent. The transaction usually takes place informally. The land lease market (sharecropping and cash rental) is constrained, inter alia, by lack of clear rules and regulations for secure and transparent land lease transaction. Such situation is therefore expected to influence farmers to differentially manage leased-in and own land parcels in terms of application of sustainable land management technologies. On the other hand, however, most of the agricultural land in Ethiopia requires conservation-based land management technologies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze land tenure systems and examine the impact of land tenure systems on the use of land management technologies and draw policy lessons...|$|E
