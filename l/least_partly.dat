5|$|In addition, Cantor's {{maternal}} great uncle, a Hungarian violinist Josef Böhm, {{has been}} described as Jewish, which may imply that Cantor's mother was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> descended from the Hungarian Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{responded that}} her apology {{came at a}} time when a group of New England Veterans had {{launched}} a campaign to disrupt a film project she was working on, leading to the charge that her apology was motivated at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> by self-interest.|$|E

Confirming the block, a {{spokesperson}} for GitHub said: [...] "It does appear that we're at <b>least</b> being <b>partly</b> blocked by the Great Firewall of China". The block was lifted on January 23, 2013 after an online protest on Sina Weibo.|$|R
5|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the clade Megaraptora, usually considered to be allosauroids, are basal tyrannosauroids. However, other authors disputed the placement of megaraptorans within Tyrannosauroidea, and a study of megaraptoran hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even the original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> reject their prior conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The active {{constituents}} {{of this species}} are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> detoxifies A.muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5000|$|However, by the 1970s {{the market}} {{began to decline}} as people began to holiday abroad taking {{advantage}} of the new, cheap package holidays. [...] Pontins was <b>least</b> affected, <b>partly</b> as they were already providing packaged holidays and partly because their smaller camps meant that they had fewer beds to fill. Butlins attempted to diversify into this same market, purchasing smaller camps, and caravan parks and marketing them under the freshfields name.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} criteria {{for assessing the}} respective merits of different systems of tax rulings. Both the Australian and UK arrangements fit what {{might be described as}} a 2 ̆ 2 Revenue Service Model of Tax Rulings 2 ̆ 2. The analysis presented suggests that a system of rulings should at <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> 2 ̆ 2 consumer driven 2 ̆ 2 and that tax rulings should be issued by an independent body and not by the tax authorities...|$|R
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> sunny aspect.|$|R
5|$|At <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Emma Goldman {{was born}} on June 27, 1869. Her father used {{violence}} to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> a result of sexual frustration.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> {{demolished}} and rebuilt around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196. The fort was modified or wholly rebuilt about the year 300. It {{appears to have been}} preceded by an Iron Age fort, followed by a Roman camp before the permanent fort was constructed.|$|E

6000|$|The earl said to himself, [...] "This spectre can eat apples, apparently. We shall find out, now, {{if that is}} a specialty. I think, myself, it's a specialty. Apples, without doubt, {{constitute}} the spectral limit. It {{was the case with}} our first parents. No, I am wrong--at <b>least</b> only <b>partly</b> right. The line was drawn at apples, just as in the present case, but it was from the other direction." [...] The new clothes gave him a thrill of pleasure and pride. He said to himself, [...] "I've got part of him down to date, anyway." ...|$|R
30|$|One {{would have}} to be very careful not to {{attribute}} the decline to Tagmemics itself, or at <b>least</b> only <b>partly,</b> because at the time the context was that of the dominant generative linguistics at the time. Their interest in language was so different from Pike’s that they didn’t engage with him, and they didn’t understand the importance of his contributions. But other folks did. If you look at the introduction or forward to Talmy Givón’s 1979 book, On Understanding Grammar, there he cites Pike as one of the key influential linguists together with Bolinger. But certainly, he emphasized the importance of Pike’s work.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> {{responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and {{other areas of the}} Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the wood}} pigeon is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction of the passenger pigeon in North America was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> due to shooting for use as food. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in Victorian industrial Britain.|$|E
5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} mirror {{in several ways}} the story of Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995. Caviezel and Scott did not deny this, and both admitted that the Oerstadt character was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> based on McVeigh. Ross Johnson of The New York Times also compared the ferry bombing at the film's beginning to the Oklahoma City bombing.|$|E
40|$|DOI: 10. 1177 / 1359105304042348 The {{two studies}} {{reported}} here focus on knowledge and representations of HIV/AIDS (study 1) plus sexual behaviour and hedonistic values (study 2) among 14 – 17 -year-old school children and similar aged shelter children. Results indicate that shelter {{children are more}} sexually active, less knowledgeable about means of HIV transmission {{and are more likely}} to hold stereotyped representations of those most at risk of infection. Russian respondents were the most sexually active, a finding which could at <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> explained by their higher levels of hedonistic values. These findings are discussed in the context of a climate of continuing social change in this region...|$|R

Haven't I gone into harness--yoked myself down to a house and land, with a mortgage on both of them; haven't I slept for several months now under at <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> shingled roof? If any more proof is wanted, haven't I come to terms with Corporal Slaney and given up the excitement of bluffing the police; and haven't I decided, as far as it's possible for me, to leave Nevis unmolested?

60|$|The adventurer forward, though nearest to the enemy, was <b>least</b> exposed. <b>Partly</b> {{covered by}} the bowsprit, he ran nimbly out on that spar till he reached the stay. Here he cut the stop of the fore-topmast halyards, {{overhauled}} the running part, and let the block swing in. He then hooked a block that he had carried out with him, and in which the bight of a rope had been rove through the thimble, and ran in as fast as possible. This duty, which had appeared the most hazardous of all the different adventures, {{on account of the}} proximity of the bowsprit to the reef, was the first done, and with the least real risk; the man being partly concealed by the smoke of the gun, {{as well as by the}} bowsprit. He escaped uninjured.|$|R
5|$|The land {{which became}} Sullivan County was {{purchased}} from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, {{as part of}} the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. It was part of Northumberland County, then became part of Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. Sullivan County itself was formed from the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847. It was the thirteenth and last county formed at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> from Lycoming County, and the fifth entirely formed from it.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E
50|$|Battling {{these issues}} {{for much of}} the season, the Hornets {{finished}} the season with a record of 49 - 33, 7 games off the franchise best record of the previous season. This meant that the Hornets only finished 4th in the Southwest Division and 7th in the Western Conference. In the 2009 NBA Playoffs the Hornets lost 4-1 in the first round to the second seeded Denver Nuggets. All four losses were severe, the worst being a 58-point drubbing at home in game 4 which tied for the most lopsided loss in NBA Playoff history. Naturally lamented by fans and media alike, the embarrassing performance can at <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> explained by the health situation of the players, with arguably the top 5 Hornets ailing to varying injuries.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the frame of}} reference of auditory responses in the inferior colliculus in monkeys fixating visual stimuli at different locations. Eye position modulated the level of auditory responses in 33 % of the neurons we encountered, {{but it did not}} appear to shift their spatial tuning. The effect of eye position on auditory responses was substantial—comparable in magnitude to that of sound location. The eye position signal appeared to interact with the auditory responses in at <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> multiplicative fashion. We conclude that the representation of sound location in primate IC is distributed and that the frame of reference is intermediate between head- and eye-centered coordinates. The information contained in these neurons appears to be sufficient for later neural stages to calculate the positions of sounds with respect to the eyes...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, a new {{organization}} installed {{itself in the}} mountains and the forests above the coffee estates. The Revolutionary Organization of Armed People (ORPA) was started by local youth and university intellectuals. Of the various Guatemalan guerrilla groups, ORPA seemed the <b>least</b> violent, <b>partly</b> because it was led by the urbane Rodrigo Asturias, the son of Miguel Ángel Asturias, Guatemala's Nobel Laureate in literature. ORPA was also a group to which, with a few horrifying exceptions, the army did not respond with its trademark village massacres. Why this was so is an interesting question. One possibility is ORPA's decision not to organize villages as publicly declared support bases. Another possible explanation is that planters needed their workers' labor too much for the army to slaughter them en masse.|$|R
5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, {{there were}} many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which {{proceeded}} to significant degrees. The most well known, the 20 July plot, came from within Germany and was at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war. In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900people.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed to be at <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their {{ability to communicate with}} foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at <b>least,</b> <b>partly</b> responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E
5000|$|L. lufengensis had a {{diet that}} {{consisted}} of both hard and soft fruits based on the paleoenvironment. L. lefungensis had similarly developed molar shearing crests to other miocine hominids such as Proconsul nyanzae, Ouranopithecus macedoniensis, Dendropithecus macinnesis and a Yuanmou hominoid, indicating a possible preference for harder fruits. However, the Yuanmou hominoid differs from teeth of the genus Lufengpithecus in several aspects of the evidence studied such as tooth size proportions, M2 shearing crest development, tooth enamel thickness and body weight [...]When compared to hominoid species of similar regions such as a Yuanmou hominid, L. lufengensis has smaller front teeth indicating at <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> more folivorous diet compared to other extinct hominoids. This means along with consuming some hard fruits, they would also consume berries and leaves.|$|R
6000|$|This is a {{specimen}} of the customary encounter of our wits. I {{place it on}} record in my Journal, to excuse myself to myself. When she left us at last, later in the day, I sent a letter after her to the hotel. Not having kept a copy of it, let me present the substance, like a sermon, under three heads: I begged to be excused for speaking plainly; I declared {{that there was a}} total want of sympathy between us, on my side; and I proposed that she should deprive me of future opportunities of receiving her in this house. The reply arrived immediately in these terms: [...] "Your letter received, dear girl. I am not in the <b>least</b> angry; <b>partly</b> because I am very fond of you, partly because I know that you will ask me to come back again. P. S.: Philip sends his love." ...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} not just one type of cancer. Differences in outcome and {{reaction}} to treatment can at <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> explained by different histological and molecular subtypes. Recognition of these differences may influence treatment decisions. However, there is huge variation {{in the amount of}} information that is available. Several tumour types such as mucinous carcinoma, signet ring cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma have such a distinct phenotype that they are readily recognised. However, due to the rarity of signet ring cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma, limited data are available. More recently defined subtypes, like medullary carcinoma, serrated adenocarcinoma and micropapillary carcinoma, are not adequately diagnosed, which limits research possibilities using large-scale data from registries. In the current review, we systematically describe the histologic subtypes with the clinical and molecular background. We evaluate their prognosis compared to adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified and speculate about the clinical relevance...|$|R
