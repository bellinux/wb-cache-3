5000|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> is not {{identical}} across all variants, thus {{there is a}} marked difference between a BNC and BNCR mount, for instance. BNCR is only the current convention {{as it was the}} last version of the camera and in relatively current use through until the 1990s. The mount contains four pronged flanges only one of which contains a notch towards the center. This notch is used to align the mount to a locating pin located approximately 45 degrees clockwise {{from the top of the}} camera's <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> This radial <b>indexing</b> is of particular importance when shooting an anamorphic format (CinemaScope or Panavision, or equivalent). The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring which, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. The quality of this design has been a key influence in the design of the Arri PL and Panavision PV mounts, both of which are the main film camera mounts in use today, and both of which have four-pronged flanges oriented based on locating pin-notch combinations. The Arri PL mount in particular is very similar in appearance to the BNCR mount, the only immediately apparent difference being the ability to seat any of the four notched prongs against the locating pin. (The flange focal distance and diameter also differ.) ...|$|R
50|$|Canon, Minolta (Sony), Olympus, {{and other}} {{manufacturers}} have changed <b>lens</b> <b>mounts.</b> Much older Canon film cameras used the FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which was discontinued in 1987 {{in favor of}} the EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> Olympus discontinued the OM <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for the OM series cameras {{in favor of the}} Four Thirds System <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> However, due {{to the size of the}} Four Thirds mount it is possible to fit legacy SLR lenses from any manufacturer using an adapter, albeit with manual aperture and focus control. Minolta (Sony after 2006) phased out its bayonet-mount MC and MD Rokkor lenses for a modified bayonet mount (supporting autofocus) in 1985.|$|R
50|$|At {{the heart}} of the system is the EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which {{replaced}} the previous FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which mainly supported only manual-focus lenses.|$|R
50|$|Canon FL {{refers to}} a <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{standard}} for 35mm single-lens reflex cameras from Canon. It was introduced in April 1964 with the Canon FX camera, replacing the previous Canon R <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> It was in turn replaced in 1971 by the Canon FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> FL <b>lenses</b> {{can also be used}} on FD-mount cameras.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} issue for compatibility between cameras and lenses. There is no universal standard for <b>lens</b> <b>mounts,</b> and each major camera maker typically uses its own proprietary design, incompatible with other makers. A few older manual focus <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> designs, such as the Leica M39 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for rangefinders, M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for early SLRs, and the Pentax K mount are found across multiple brands, but this is not common today. A few mount designs, such as the Olympus/Kodak Four Thirds System mount for DSLRs, have also been licensed to other makers. Most large-format cameras take interchangeable lenses as well, which are usually mounted in a lensboard or on the front standard.|$|R
50|$|The Canon AC lens-mount was a {{proprietary}} <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> for the Canon T80. The <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> was {{a variation of}} the then-standard Canon FD for auto-focus.|$|R
50|$|Konica's AR <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{kept the}} same flange-film {{distance}} that the earlier Konica F <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> had (40.5 mm), {{but it has a}} larger diameter of 47 mm.|$|R
50|$|Cosina Voigtländer {{refers to}} {{photographic}} {{products manufactured by}} Cosina under the Voigtländer name since 1999. Cosina leases rights to the Voigtländer name from RINGFOTO GmbH & Co. ALFO Marketing KG in Germany. Cosina Voigtländer products have included 35mm film SLR and rangefinder camera bodies, and lenses for the M39 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> (Leica screw <b>mount),</b> M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> Leica M <b>mount,</b> and other <b>lens</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many cameras with {{interchangeable}} lenses use a bayonet <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> to allow <b>lenses</b> {{to be changed}} rapidly and locked accurately in position. Camera <b>lens</b> <b>mounts</b> usually employ stronger flattened tabs rather than pins, though their function is the same.|$|R

5000|$|Like Zunow, Yashica {{found it}} {{difficult}} to gain market acceptance with its proprietary SLR <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> and redesigned its SLR camera line in 1962 to accept the Contax/Praktica M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> [...] The new SLR camera was introduced as the Penta J.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Canon {{introduced}} the EF-S <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> a derivative of the EF mount that is strictly for digital EOS cameras with APS-C sensors released after 2003. EF <b>lenses</b> can be <b>mounted</b> on EF-S bodies but EF-S <b>lenses</b> cannot be <b>mounted</b> on EF bodies. In October 2012, Canon {{introduced the}} EF-M <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> a derivative designed exclusively for mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) with APS-C sensors. EF and EF-S <b>lenses</b> can be <b>mounted</b> on EF-M bodies via the optional Mount Adapter EF-EOS M.|$|R

50|$|Canon's {{series of}} L lenses (Canon Luxury Lenses) are a {{professional}} line of SLR photography lenses made by Canon. Canon produces both L-series zoom and prime lenses for their past FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{and for their}} current EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> used on all Canon EOS cameras (digital and film).|$|R
5000|$|Canon, Nikon and Pentax {{have all}} {{developed}} digital SLR cameras (DSLRs) {{using the same}} <b>lens</b> <b>mounts</b> as on their respective film SLR cameras. [...] Konica Minolta did the same, but in 2006 sold their camera technology to Sony, which built DSLRs based on the Minolta <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> before abandoning the technology in favor of cameras built around a semi-transparent fixed mirror. Samsung builds DSLRs based on the Pentax <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> Olympus, on the other hand, chose {{to create a new}} digital-only Four Thirds System SLR standard, adopted later by Panasonic and Leica.|$|R
50|$|When used on {{a digital}} crop body with a field of view {{compensation}} factor of 2× (Four Thirds body), it provides a field of view equivalent to a 100 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> in a 35 mm body. In a 1.6× body, such as the Canon EOS 7D, it provides a narrower field of view, equivalent to an 80 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35 mm frame body. With a 1.5× body such as the Nikon D300, it provides a less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 75 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35 mm frame body. With a 1.3× body such as the Canon EOS-1D Mark III, it provides an even less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 65 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35 mm frame body.|$|R
5000|$|Lenses are not labeled or sold {{according}} to their angle of view, but rather by their focal length, usually expressed in millimeters. But this specification is insufficient to compare lenses for different cameras because field of view also depends on the sensor size. For example, a 50 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Nikon D3 (a full-frame camera) provides approximately the same field of view as a 32 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Sony α100 (an APS-C camera). Conversely, the same lens can produce different fields of view when mounted on different cameras. For example, a 35 mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Canon EOS 5D (full-frame) provides a slightly wide-angle view, while the same <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Canon EOS 400D (APS-C) provides a [...] "normal" [...] or slightly telephoto view.|$|R
50|$|The Canon FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> is a {{physical}} standard for connecting a photographic lens to a 35mm single-lens reflex camera body. The standard was developed by Canon of Japan and was introduced in March 1971 with the Canon F-1 camera. It served as the Canon SLR interchangeable <b>lens</b> <b>mounting</b> system until the 1987 introduction of the Canon EOS series cameras, which use the newer EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> The FD mount lingered through {{the release of the}} 1990 Canon T60, the last camera introduced in the FD system, {{and the end of the}} Canon New F-1 product cycle in 1992.|$|R
50|$|When used on {{a digital}} crop body with a field of view {{compensation}} factor of 1.6x, such as the Canon EOS 450D, it provides a narrower field of view, equivalent to an 240mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35mm frame body. With a 1.5x body such as the Nikon D300 It provides a less narrow field of view, equivalent to an 225mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35mm frame body. With a 1.3x body such as the Canon EOS-1D Mark III It provides an even less narrow field of view, equivalent to an 195mm <b>lens</b> <b>mounted</b> on a 35mm frame body.|$|R

50|$|The Canon EF-M <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> {{introduced}} in 2012, is a derivative of the Canon EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{designed for use}} with the Canon EOS M mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera. It has an 18 mm flange focal distance (compared to 44 mm for EF and EF-S) and a 47 mm throat diameter (compared to 54 mm for EF and EF-S). As it is designed for use with an APS-C-sized image sensor, it features the same crop factor (of roughly 1.6) as the existing EF-S <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> It allows the use of Canon EF and EF-S lenses with a Canon-made adapter, {{but it is not}} backwards-compatible with Canon's existing DSLR cameras.|$|R

These lenses {{may also be}} used for other purposes, often being suited for indoor sports photography as well, due to suitable focal length and wide aperture, though autofocus speed is an issue in sports photography that is less important in portraiture.|$|R
50|$|Minolta {{introduced}} a new <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> the A system, breaking compatibility with its earlier manual-focus lenses in the MC and MD system. The A <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{is still the same}} today, but some modifications have been made to the electronic contacts to facilitate new functions such as motor zoom (xi lenses, now discontinued) and a more sophisticated flash metering system (ADI).|$|R
50|$|The {{first series}} of Konica single-lens reflex cameras used the Konica F <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> {{named after the}} first camera to use it. This was a bayonet mount, and is not {{compatible}} with later Konica <b>lens</b> <b>mounts.</b> The flange focal distance of the F-mount was 40.5 mm, {{one of the smallest}} ever used for a 35 mm SLR. The diameter was 40 mm.|$|R
