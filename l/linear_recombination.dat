5000|$|MORE {{makes use}} of network {{encoding}} techniques and brings about spatial re-use by allowing all the nodes to transmit at the same time. Given a file,the source node breaks up the file into K packets. The number of packets each file is divided into varies. The uncoded packets are called [...] "native packets". The source node then creates a linear combination of K packets and forwards them. The code vector represents the random co-efficients chosen by the node to perform encoding. The source also attaches a MORE header to each packet along with a forwarding list. The forwarders listen to the transmission of the source node. If the node that listens to this packet is in the forwarding list, it checks if the packet has any new information which are called as innovative packets. If the packet is innovative, it performs a <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> of the packets. This is essentially the <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> of the native packets again. The node ignores all non-innovative packets. The destination receives the packets and checks for innovative-ness. Upon receiving K innovative packets, it sends back ACK to the source and continues decoding the packets. The intermediate nodes hear this ACK and stop further transmission followed by the purging of packets in the buffer.|$|E

Whereas the ability to perform allelic exchanges has provided a useful method of gene disruption in other organisms, in the clinically important species of mycobacteria, such as M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, similar approaches have thus far been unsuccessful. In this communication, we report {{the development of a}} shuttle mutagenesis strategy that involves the use of long <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> substrates to reproducibly obtain recombinants by allelic exchange in M. tuberculosis. Long <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> substrates, approximately 40 to 50 kb in length, were generated by constructing libraries in the excisable cosmid vector pYUB 328. The cosmid vector could be readily excised from the recombinant cosmids by digestion with PacI, a restriction endonuclease for which there exist few, if any, sites in mycobacterial genomes. A cosmid containing the mycobacterial leuD gene was isolated, and a selectable marker conferring resistance to kanamycin was inserted into the leuD gene in the recombinant cosmid by interplasmid recombination in Escherichia coli. A long <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> substrate containing the insertionally mutated leuD gene was generated by PacI digestion. Electroporation of this recombination substrate containing the insertionally mutated leuD allele resulted in the generation of leucine auxotrophic mutants by homologous recombination in 6 % of the kanamycin-resistant transformants for both the Erdman and H 37 Rv strains of M. tuberculosis.

L 39 (DLR) /CHEM/ATTILA. Numerous simulations employing idealized aircraft-like emissions are carried out to systematically study effects of air traffic on contrail coverage, water vapour, ozone and methane and air traffic induced radiative forcing {{with respect to the}} emission location and altitude. For the composition of present day air traffic emissions, the overall radiative forcing from non-CO 2 effects increases strongly with emission altitude and slightly from the extra-tropics to the tropics, with the largest potential contributions resulting from ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The results of these idealized simulations are used to test whether the climate impact of a realistic air traffic inventory can be reconstructed by linearly recombining these pre-calculated idealized data. This methodology may be particularly useful for the optimization of flight paths with respect to minimum climate impact, as this off-line reconstruction of air traffic perturbations could bypass time consuming global three-dimensional simulations. Perturbations determined by the <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> indeed compare well with effects determined by comprehensive chemistry-climate-model simulations.

We report here a facile method for stoichiometrically incorporating several different modifications at multiple, specific, and widely spaced sites in supercoiled DNA. The method is based upon generating an appropriately gapped circular DNA, starting from single-strand circular DNA from two phagemids with oppositely oriented origins of replication. The gapped circular DNA is annealed with labeled and unlabeled synthetic oligonucleotides to make a multiply nicked circle, which is covalently sealed and supercoiled. The method is efficient, robust and can be readily scaled up to produce large quantities of labeled supercoiled DNA for biochemical and structural studies. We have applied this method to generate dye-labeled supercoiled DNA with heteroduplex bubbles for a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of supercoiled Holliday junction intermediates in the λ integrative recombination reaction.

Stretched exponential kinetics originated from <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> of nonequilibrium charge involving different Shockley–Read centers, which energy dispersion is caused by structural disorder. In more details, the excitation with 650  nm creates electron–hole pairs in both the GaAs spacers and the InGaAs, which causes photoconductivity. Upon switching off the excitation, those free electrons in the conductivity channels recombine with holes and the conductivity drops. The Shockley–Read centers {{play a key role}} in recombination slowdown of electron–hole pairs in GaAs spacers due to carrier trapping by deep levels. As noted in the works [7, 8, 20], the nearest surrounding of InGaAs quantum dots is characterized by the presence of some defect levels with different energies and fluctuations of the energy band edge potential in the GaAs spacers and deep levels position in the bandgap of GaAs, most likely, due to strain fields and fluctuations of the composition (concentrations of indium and gallium atoms) in the epitaxial planes. There might be different paths (e.g., recombination through different defects) for different carriers, characterized by different mono-exponential functions.

40|$|Holliday {{junctions}} are {{a central}} intermediate in diverse pathways of DNA repair and recombina-tion. The isomerization of a junction determines the directionality of the recombination event. Pre-vious {{studies have shown}} that the identity of the cen-tral sequence of the junction may favor one of the two isomers, in turn controlling the direction of the pathway. Here we demonstrate that, in the absence of DNA sequence-mediated isomer preference, poly-cations are the major contributor to biasing strand cleavage during junction resolution. In the case of wild-type phage l excision junctions, spermidine plays the dominant role in controlling the isomeri-zation state of the junction and increases the rate of junction resolution. Spermidine also counteracts the sequence-imposed bias on resolution. The spermidine-induced bias is seen equally on super-coiled and <b>linear</b> excisive <b>recombination</b> junction intermediates, and thus is not just an artefact of in vitro recombination conditions. The contribution of spermidine requires the presence of accessory factors, and results in the repositioning of Int’s core-binding domains on junctions, perhaps due to DNA-spermidine–protein interactions, or by influencing DNA conformation in the core region. Our results lead us to propose that spermidine together with accessory factors promotes the formation of the second junction isomer.

In semiconductors, this approach is valid for a linear non radiative recombination path, but not for a non <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> rate as in the general Shockley Read Hall recombination scenario. Here, {{the evolution of the}} ECPL signal was studied for deep trap recombination following Shockley Read Hall statistics. Analytic solutions can be obtained for a fast minority trapping regime and steady state recombination. For the steady state case, our results show that the quadratic radiative term plays only a minor role, and that the shape of the measured signal is mostly determined by the non linearity of the recombination itself. We find that measurements with unbalanced intense pump and probe pulses can directly provide information about the dominant non radiative recombination mechanism. The signal traces follow the charge carrier concentrations, despite the complex origins of the signal, thus showing that ECPL can be applied to study charge carrier dynamics in semiconductors without requiring elaborate calculations.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{original}} approach for automatic speaker identification especially applicable to environments which cause partial {{corruption of the}} frequency spectrum of the signal. The general principle is to split the whole frequency domain into several subbands on which statistical recognizers are independently applied and then recombined to yield a global score and a global recognition decision. The choice of the subband architecture and the recombination strategies are particularly discussed. This technique had {{been shown to be}} robust for speech recognition when a narrow band noise degradation occur. We first objectively verify this robustness for the speaker identification task. We also study which information is really used to recognize speakers. For this, speaker identification experiments on independent subbands are conducted for 630 speakers, on TIMIT and NTIMIT databases. The results show that the speaker specific information is not equally distributed among subbands. In particular, the low-frequency subbands (under 600 Hz) and the high-frequency subbands (over 3000 Hz) are more speaker specific than middle-frequency ones. In addition, experiments on different subband system architectures show that the correlations between frequency channels are of prime importance for speaker recognition. Some of these correlations are lost when the frequency domain is divided into subbands. Consequently we propose a particularly redundant parallel architecture for which most of the correlations are kept. The performances obtained with this new system, using <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> strategies, are equivalent to those of a conventional fullband recognizer on clean and telephone speech. Experiments on speech corrupted by unpredictable noise show a better adaptability of this approach in noisy environments...|$|E
30|$|While filling {{different}} types of electron traps in the dot surrounding {{was found to be}} the origin of a multi-exponential photoconductivity relaxation involving levels of Shockley–Read centers in the GaAs spacers, the InGaAs nanostructures are responsible for observation of the lower τ in the case of their selective excitation with wavelength of 980  nm. Moreover, observation of the effective radiative recombination involving InGaAs quantum-sized states and PC nonlinearities [21] gives further evidence of strong impact of InGaAs on PC relaxation. This was taken into account for formula (5), which has received confirmation during PC kinetics analysis of the samples, excited by radiation with λ[*]=[*] 980  nm, when bimolecular recombination can dominate. Excitation with λ[*]=[*] 980  nm (hv[*]=[*] 1.27  eV) leads to appearance of electron–hole pairs only in the InGaAs, while GaAs is transparent in the spectral range (1.43  eV at 290  K). In order to give a contribution to the photoconductivity, electron–hole pairs, photoexcited in QWR or QDs, have to escape from the InGaAs potential well in various ways, such as thermal emission, Poole-Frenkel emission [22, 23], or tunneling [24]. Whereas the activation energy of holes in InGaAs is much smaller than the activation energy of electrons, interband excitation leads to the accumulation of electrons in QWR or QDs and the creation of local electric fields around them. Nanoscale potential barriers around InGaAs/GaAs interfaces significantly reduce the electron capture in InGaAs from GaAs matrix and enhance photoconductivity [25]. This effect is known for low-dimensional InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures as artificial doping effect [26]. Thus, while studying photoconductivity relaxation, excited by interband transitions in InGaAs, we should take into account that the accumulation of negative charges increases the recombination probability of electrons and holes via the QWR quantum states, which leads to non-exponential relaxation described by Eq. (2). Moreover, faster photoconductivity relaxation is because these structures show a higher electron–hole recombination probability via quantum states of InGaAs QWRs compared to QDs. In structure with QWR, <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> involving Shockley–Read centers in the GaAs surrounding appeared as dominant channel of photoconductivity relaxation.|$|E

The interaction of recombinant aMerR with merHp DNA, studied using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, demonstrated that complex formation was template specific and dependent on the presence of the IR sequence but insensitive to Hg(II) addition and site-specific IR mutations that relieved in vivo merHp repression. Despite containing a motif resembling a distant ArsR homolog, these results indicate aMerR remains continuously DNA bound to protect and coordinate Hg(II) -responsive control over merHAI transcription.

Over 2, 500 serovars exist and infections in {{humans and animals}} may produce a spectrum of symptoms from enteritis to typhoid depending on serovar- and host-specific factors. S. Enteritidis is the most prevalent non-typhoidal serovar isolated from humans with acute diarrhoeal illness in many countries. Human infections are frequently associated with direct or indirect contact with contaminated poultry meat or eggs owing {{to the ability of}} the organism to persist in the avian intestinal and reproductive tract. The molecular mechanisms underlying colonisation of poultry by S. Enteritidis are ill-defined. Targeted and genome-wide mutagenesis of S. Typhimurium has revealed conserved and host-specific roles for selected fimbriae in intestinal colonisation of different hosts. Here we report the first systematic analysis of each chromosomally-encoded major fimbrial subunit of S. Enteritidis in intestinal colonisation of chickens. Results The repertoire, organisation and sequence of the fimbrial operons within members of S. enterica were compared. No single fimbrial locus could be correlated with the differential virulence and host range of serovars by comparison of available genome sequences. Fimbrial operons were highly conserved among serovars in respect of gene number, order and sequence, with the exception of safA. Thirteen predicted major fimbrial subunit genes were separately inactivated by lambda Red recombinase-mediated <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> followed by P 22 /int transduction. The magnitude and duration of intestinal colonisation by mutant and parent strains was measured after oral inoculation of out-bred chickens. Whilst the majority of S. Enteritidis major fimbrial subunit genes played no significant role in colonisation of the avian intestines, mutations affecting pegA in two different S. Enteritidis strains produced statistically significant attenuation. Plasmid-mediated trans -complementation partially restored the colonisation phenotype. Conclusion We describe the fimbrial gene repertoire of the predominant non-typhoidal S. enterica serovar affecting humans and the role played by each predicted major fimbrial subunit in intestinal colonisation of the primary reservoir. Our data support a role for PegA in the colonisation of poultry by S. Enteritidis and aid the design of improved vaccines. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{multi-band}} automatic {{speech recognition}} (MBASR) has been proposed by Bourlard et al. and Hermansky et al. to improve robustness under noisy environment. It is motivated by the empirical findings by Harvey Fletcher of Bell Labs from a thorough study of human speech recognition in which partial speech recognition in sub-bands is believed to take place and then the sub-band decisions are recombined {{to arrive at a}} global decision. They found that the full-band error rate is empirically equal to the product of sub-band error rates. This implies that human can recognize speech correctly if there exists a correct sub-band recognition. The MBASR framework proposed by Bourlard et al. and Hermansky et al. is to divide the full frequency band into sub-bands and a speech recognizer is built for each sub-band. During recognition, decisions from individual sub-band recognizers are recombined at some phonetic or linguistic level. In this thesis, we study MBASR by implementing the following features. First, it can be used for continuous speech recognition. Second, it allows asynchronous recombination of sub-band information at any modeling units. Third, sub-band information are recombined in an optimal sense. HMM composition framework is introduced as the back-bone in our multi-band system to address the sub-band asynchrony issue. In addition, continuous speech recognition can easily be realized under this framework. Using <b>linear</b> <b>recombination</b> of sub-band log-likelihoods, string-based minimum classification error criterion with competing strings derived from the N-best algorithm is employed to optimize the sub-band weightings using simulated noisy speech. Finally, the multi-band system is evaluated under various noisy environments. Our experimental results suggested that our multi-band framework can achieve the best sub-band performance at all evaluated noisy environments. With ideal end-points, it maintains the same or better performance than a full-band system at most evaluated noisy environments. With non-ideal end-points, it performs slightly worse than a full-band system on real noises that we evaluated...|$|E
40|$|We present {{photoconductivity}} of high-performance functionalized pentacene and anthradithiophene {{thin films}} on time scales from picoseconds to many seconds after photoexcitation. The polycrystalline thin films were deposited from solution on glass substrates with patterned interdigitated aluminum electrodes. In studies of fast transient photoconductivity, {{the samples were}} excited with laser pulses of ~ 100 fs duration at a wavelength of 400 nm, and the photocurrent due to transport of photoexcited charge carriers was monitored using 50 GHz digital sampling oscilloscope. The photoconductivity at longer (milliseconds through seconds) time scales was investigated using continuous wave (cw) illumination and a source-delay-measure unit. Both experiments were performed under conditions of varied electric field strength, fluence and temperature. In all samples, we observed fast charge carrier photogeneration (< 30 ps, limited by time resolution of our setup) followed by decay of the photocurrent over the period of ~ 5 - 50 ns, depending on the material, due to charge trapping and <b>recombination,</b> <b>linear</b> dependence of the peak photoconductivity on the fluence and super-linear dependence of the peak photocurrent on the applied electric field...|$|R
40|$|Recombination {{increases}} dramatically during meiosis {{to promote}} genetic exchange and generate recombinant progeny. Interestingly, meiotic recombination is unevenly distributed throughout genomes, and, as a consequence, genetic and physical map distances {{do not have}} a simple <b>linear</b> relationship. <b>Recombination</b> hotspots and coldspots have been described in many organisms and often reflect global features of chromosome structure. In particular, recombination frequencies are often distorted within or outside sex-determining regions of the genome. Here, we report that recombination is elevated adjacent to the mating-type locus (MAT) in the pathogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. Among fungi, C. neoformans has an unusually large MAT locus, and recombination is suppressed between the two > 100 -kilobase mating-type specific alleles. When genetic markers were introduced at defined physical distances from MAT, we found the meiotic recombination frequency to be ~ 20 % between MAT and a flanking marker at 5, 10, 50, or 100 kilobases from the right border. As a result, the physical/genetic map ratio in the regions adjacent to MAT is distorted ~ 10 - to 50 -fold compared to the genome-wide average. Moreover, recombination frequently occurred on both sides of MAT and negative interference between crossovers was observed. MAT heterozygosity was not required for enhanced recombination, implying that this process is not due to a physical distortion from the two non-paired alleles and could also occur during same-sex mating. Sequence analysis revealed a correlation between high G + C content and these hotspot regions. We hypothesize that the presence of recombinational activators may have driven several key events during the assembly and reshaping of the MAT locus and may have played similar roles in the origins of both metabolic and biosynthetic gene clusters. Our findings suggest that during meiosis the MAT locus may be exchanged onto different genetic backgrounds and therefore have broad evolutionary implications with respect to mating-type switching in both model and pathogenic yeasts...|$|R
40|$|Recombination {{is crucial}} for genetic evolution, which not only {{provides}} new allele combinations but also influences the biological evolution and efficacy of natural selection. However, recombination variation is not well understood outside of the complex species' genomes, and it is particularly unclear in Gossypium. Cotton {{is the most important}} natural fibre crop and the second largest oil-seed crop. Here, we found that the genetic and physical maps distances did not have a simple <b>linear</b> relationship. <b>Recombination</b> rates were unevenly distributed throughout the cotton genome, which showed marked changes along the chromosome lengths and recombination was completely suppressed in the centromeric regions. Recombination rates significantly varied between A-subgenome (At) (range = 1. 60 to 3. 26 centimorgan/megabase [cM/Mb]) and D-subgenome (Dt) (range = 2. 17 to 4. 97 cM/Mb), which explained why the genetic maps of At and Dt are similar but the physical map of Dt is only half that of At. The translocation regions between A 02 and A 03 and between A 04 and A 05, and the inversion regions on A 10, D 10, A 07 and D 07 indicated relatively high recombination rates in the distal regions of the chromosomes. Recombination rates were positively correlated with the densities of genes, markers and the distance from the centromere, and negatively correlated with transposable elements (TEs). The gene ontology (GO) categories showed that genes in high recombination regions may tend to response to environmental stimuli, and genes in low recombination regions are related to mitosis and meiosis, which suggested that they may provide the primary driving force in adaptive evolution and assure the stability of basic cell cycle in a rapidly changing environment. Global knowledge of recombination rates will facilitate genetics and breeding in cotton...|$|R
30|$|Volvox carteri f. nagariensis is an oogamous {{species that}} has heterothallic {{sexuality}} {{determined by the}} sex-determining chromosomal region or mating-type locus where the presence of sex-specific genes (genes harboring in {{only one of the}} two sexes) and sex-based divergent shared genes (gametologs; two homologous genes harboring in this regions of both of the two sexes) was recently demonstrated (Ferris et al. 2010). Sex in V. carteri f. nagariensis is determined based on {{the presence or absence of}} such genes. However, sex identification in natural populations of this species has not previously been conducted by using molecular markers. Furthermore, the mating-type locus of V. carteri f. nagariensis is composed of a >[*] 1  Mbp <b>linear</b> chromosome where <b>recombination</b> is suggested to be repressed (Ferris et al. 2010). Although the mating-type locus or sex chromosomal region does not exhibit recombination in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under the laboratory conditions, recombination and gene conversion of C. reinhardtii mating-type locus genes were demonstrated in natural populations of this species (De Hoff et al. 2013). However, recombination of the mating-type locus genes has not been examined in natural populations of V. carteri.|$|R
