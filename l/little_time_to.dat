5|$|Alexander {{was also}} noted for his {{nepotism}} that was partially {{due to his}} advanced age and belief that his family would have <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> profit from his reign. This was in contrast to his predecessor Innocent XI, who was known for being austere and had not caused any scandals through nepotism.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, 10 {{years after}} signing its first record {{deal with the}} {{publishing}} company Warner/Chappell Music Scandinavia, Meshuggah extended its cooperation with the company. In November 2005, Haake {{said in an interview}} that the band was not content with the productions of Chaosphere and Nothing, because, being on tour, they had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> devote to them.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November, while Allenby {{was at the}} British XXI Corps {{headquarters}} at El Kastine, {{the decision was made}} to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills. This was in the hope of ensuring that the Ottoman army had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> regroup or construct defences which, given more time, might prove impregnable.|$|E
30|$|The first {{observation}} {{is that the}} distribution of the times is heterogeneous, heavily skewed to the right. That means that, while half of all patches is concentrated in a range of <b>little</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> submission (taking up to 1.1 day to be submitted), the other half is spread over a wider range of longer durations.|$|R

5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} to improvise provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare for individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> learn to assert control over their staff.|$|E
5|$|Using improvised weapons, {{the prisoners}} capture an armored vehicle and the prison helicopter, which Yates uses to kill Zamorro. The prisoners place {{a call to}} Wheeler's {{headquarters}} and inform him of the riot. Winter has <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege, so orders the use of live ammunition against the prisoners.|$|E

50|$|Some {{conductors}} compiled {{their own}} scores rather than use cue sheets; some followed the cue sheet, but used their own choices of music; many followed the cue sheet with what <b>little</b> <b>time</b> they had <b>to</b> produce an opera's worth of music. Much of the time, musicians {{came in and}} sight-read their parts, with <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rehearse.|$|R
5|$|After his {{marriage}} to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spend with them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted {{to spend as much}} time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E
5|$|Although he had {{defeated}} the Neville brothers, Edward had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rest; Margaret landed at Weymouth {{on the day}} of the battle. She feigned a march to London while augmenting her army with recruits from Wales and the Welsh Marches. The Lancastrian queen was disheartened by the news of Warwick's demise, but Somerset suggested that they were better off without the earl. Despite the defeat at Barnet, Lancastrians who fled from the battle looked to the queen to restore their house to the throne. Alerted by his spies to the Lancastrians' true route, Edward intercepted and {{defeated the}}m at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May. Gloucester, Clarence and Hastings again fought to defend the Yorkist crown.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was just}} {{thirty years old}} when the Revolutionary War ended, but his {{greatest}} military achievements were already behind him. After Clark's victories in the Illinois country, settlers continued to pour into Kentucky and live illegally on Indian land north of the Ohio River. From 1784 to 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought Clark a small income, but he devoted very <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> the enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Drusus had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of}} his grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
5|$|In 1479, Báthory {{was made}} {{governor}} of Transylvania and in late August 1479, an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia, commanded by twelve pashas, invaded Transylvania {{with a force}} of 43,000 men. The Turks moved very quickly through the land while pillaging it, giving Báthory <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gather his militia at Sibiu. Pál Kinizsi, the Ban of Timişoara, promised to aid Báthory. As Báthory approached Sebeş, Ali Bey, one of the Turkish pashas, had raised camp on a plain between Mureş and Sebeş, totally unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him.|$|E
5|$|Richard Swinefield (or Richard de Swinfield; died 15 March 1317) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford, England. He {{graduated}} {{doctor of divinity}} before holding a number of ecclesiastical offices, including that of Archdeacon of London. As a bishop, he dedicated consideravle efforts to securing the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, his predecessor, for whom he had worked during his lifetime. Active in his diocese, he devoted <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> politics. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral where a memorial to his memory still stands.|$|E

60|$|Lionel {{knew that}} Killigrew was absent from home just then; {{but he was}} {{expected}} to return by Easter, and to Easter there was but a week. Therefore he had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in which <b>to</b> act, <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in which <b>to</b> execute the project that had come into his mind. He cursed himself for conceiving it, but held to it with all the strength of a weak nature.|$|R

5|$|The British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail — {{a parody}} of the legends of King Arthur by the Monty Python team — was filmed on {{location}} in Scotland in 1974. The film's producers had gained permission from the National Trust for Scotland to film scenes at several of their Scottish castles, {{as well as the}} permission of Lord Moray to film at Doune Castle. However, the National Trust later withdrew their permission, leaving the producers with <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find new locations. Instead, they decided to use different parts of Doune Castle to depict the various fictional castles in the film, relying on tight framing of shots to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|The Mae Shi drummer Brad Breeck commented in an {{interview}} that the band decided to make a song about the incident late in the evening of February 2, 2009. Breeck noted that they listened to the audio of the Bale diatribe and put together their tribute piece within a span of two hours before putting it online. Jacob Cooper, another drummer in the band, commented to The Arizona Daily Star that he was surprised how popular their piece became when they had devoted relatively <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> composing and recording it.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins as}} Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, {{and his wife}} Sumartini (Tini), {{residents}} of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a marital breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving no {{time for him to}} be with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deal with household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work.|$|E

Mr. and Mrs. Yeo's (Jack Neo and Xiang Yun) busy schedules give them <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spend with their children, leading to a strained relationship. With his mother absent, Chengcai was raised by his ex-convict father (Huang Yiliang), whose fighting skills he inherited.|$|E
5|$|The two new Panther battalions – the 51st and 52nd – {{together}} {{equipped with}} 200 Panthers, {{for which the}} offensive had been delayed, were attached to the Großdeutschland Division in the XLVIII Panzer Corps of Army Group South. With the 51st and 52nd Battalions arriving on 30 June and 1 July, the two units had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> perform reconnaissance or to orient themselves to the terrain they found themselves in. This was a breach of the methods of the Panzerwaffe, considered essential for the successful use of armour. Though led by experienced panzer commanders, many of the tank crews were new recruits and had <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> become familiar with their new tanks, let alone train together {{to function as a}} unit. The two battalions came direct from the training ground and lacked combat experience. In addition, the requirement to maintain radio silence until the start of the attack meant that the Panther units had little training in battalion-level radio procedures. Furthermore, the new Panthers were still experiencing problems with their transmissions, and proved mechanically unreliable. By the morning of 5 July, the units had lost 16 Panthers due to mechanical breakdown, leaving only 184 available for the launching of the offensive.|$|E
5|$|With {{the army}} revitalized, Saint-Just {{returned}} briefly to Paris where his success was applauded. However, there was <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> celebrate. He was quickly {{sent back to}} the frontlines, this time in Belgium where the Army of the North was experiencing the same problems of discipline and organization. Again he delivered results ruthlessly and effectively, but after less than a month the mission was cut short. As Paris convulsed in political violence, his assistance was required by Robespierre.|$|E
