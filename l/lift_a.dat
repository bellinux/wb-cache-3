5|$|During operations, the He 111Z did {{not have}} enough power to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, but this was not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E

5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E

After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back.

5|$|In 2012–13, Benfica's {{run in the}} Champions League run was not so successful, {{and they}} dropped again to the Europa League. In this tournament, however, the team excelled and reached their ninth European final, 23 years after their last appearance. On 17 May 2013, Benfica played the final against the Champions League holders Chelsea, losing 2–1 with an injury-time header from Branislav Ivanović and {{extending}} the club's run of European final losses to seven. In an almost identical 2013–14 season, Benfica competed in the Europa League after failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, and advanced {{all the way into}} a second successive final. In the progress, they eliminated Juventus in the semi-finals, after a tense match in Turin, where the final was to be played. On 15 May 2014, Benfica faced the 2006 and 2007 winners Sevilla, missing usual starters Enzo Pérez, Lazar Marković and Eduardo Salvio, who were suspended due to yellow card accumulation. The match ended goalless after 120 minutes of play and was decided through a penalty shootout, which Benfica lost 4–2 after Rodrigo and Óscar Cardozo had their penalty kicks stopped by Beto. For the eight time – and second in two years – Benfica were unable to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> European trophy. In the following season, they returned to UEFA's prime tournament, but did not progress further than the group stage for the fourth time since 2010. In 2015–16, Benfica reached their fourth knock-out stage of the Champions League. They eliminated Zenit Saint Petersburg in the last 16, and qualified for the quarter-finals for their 18th time, where they lost 3–2 on aggregate to Bayern Munich.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} trunk muscle activity when <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> {{object of}} greater weight than expected, which {{may contribute to}} the development of low back pain. DesignElectromyographic evaluation of trunk muscle activity. SettingUniversity of Tsukuba, Spine laboratory. ParticipantsEleven healthy men with a mean age of 24 (SD 2) years. InterventionsTrunk muscle activity was measured when subjects <b>lifted</b> <b>an</b> object with their right arm in immediate response to a light stimulus. Surface and wire electrodes were used to measure the activity of the rectus abdominis, external oblique and erector spinae muscles, and the transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus muscles, respectively. The lifting tests were performed in three different settings: <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> expected 1 -kg object, <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> unexpected 4 -kg object (erroneously expected to weigh 1 kg), and <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> expected 4 -kg object. Main outcome measuresThe muscle activity induced when subjects lifted objects of different weights was compared by calculating the root mean square (RMS) of muscle activity at rest and % maximum voluntary contraction. ResultsWhen the subjects were aware of the weight of the object to be lifted, the activity of the external oblique, transversus abdominis, erector spinae and lumbar multifidus muscles increased immediately after lifting. When the subjects were not aware of the weight of the object to be lifted, the increase in muscle activity was delayed (P < 0. 05). ConclusionsTrunk muscles may not be able to function appropriately when individuals <b>lift</b> <b>an</b> object that is much heavier than expected...|$|R
