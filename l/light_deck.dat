6000|$|After dinner, Spike {{took his}} siesta. He {{slept in a}} little state-room that stood on the {{starboard}} side of the quarter-deck, quite aft; as Mulford did in one on the larboard. These two state-rooms were fixtures; but a <b>light</b> <b>deck</b> overhead, which connected them, shipped and unshipped, forming a shelter for {{the man at the}} wheel, when in its place, {{as well as for the}} officer of the watch, should he see fit to use it, in bad weather. This sort of cuddy, Spike termed his [...] "coach-house." ...|$|E
60|$|Three lights, {{disposed}} in {{the form}} just named were then hoisted at the gaff-end of the Coquette. It was an order for the boats in the Cove to proceed. The signal was quickly answered from the launch, and then a small rocket was seen sailing over the trees and shrubbery of the shore. All on board the Coquette listened intently, to catch some sound that should denote the tumult of an assault. Once Ludlow and Trysail thought the cheers of seamen came on the thick air of the night; and once, again, either fancy or their senses told them they heard the menacing hail which commanded the outlaws to submit. Many minutes of intense anxiety succeeded. The whole of the hammock-cloths {{on the side of}} the ship nearest to the land were lined with curious faces, though respect left Ludlow to the sole occupation of the short and <b>light</b> <b>deck</b> which covered the accommodations; whither he had ascended, to command a more perfect view of the horizon.|$|E

5000|$|World War I ships had a <b>light</b> upper armored <b>deck</b> {{to protect}} the {{secondary}} guns and a main armored deck whose sides sloped down to meet the lower edge of the belt, but their thickness was usually no more than 1.5", or 2" [...] for the slopes. As soon as long-range engagements became common and aerial threats increased, crash programs to improve deck and turret roof protection started. US Navy [...] "all-or-nothing" [...] armor layout introduced a flat heavy armor deck, which abutted the upper edges of the armored belt, and light armored weather and lower decks: this design was used by all World War II ships except Reichsmarine units, that kept a heavier lower <b>deck</b> and a <b>lighter</b> upper <b>deck.</b> Main deck armor thickness ranged from 4" [...] to 6" [...] or even 9" [...] for , usually increased over magazines: <b>lighter</b> <b>decks</b> were 1.5" [...] to 2" [...] thick.|$|R

Voltmeter with selector switch for engine and domestic battery monitoring. 2 battery isolation switches.|$|E
50|$|Orthotropic decks {{permit a}} very shallow deck depth which reduces the {{steepness}} of approach gradients and hence their costs. The form is also widely used on bascule and other moveable bridges where significant savings {{in the cost}} of the mechanical elements can be made where a <b>lighter</b> <b>deck</b> is used. The El Ferdan Railway Bridge across the Suez Canal of Egypt is the record span bridge. The Erasmus Bridge has an orthotropic deck for both its cable-stayed bridge and bascule span. The Danziger Bridge of New Orleans is a very large vertical lift bridge.|$|R

50|$|The two Cape V-class ships {{function}} {{the same}} {{in their ability to}} load wheeled and tracked vehicles via the stern ramp. MV Cape Victorys most notable feature is its total deck capacity consisting of 133,621 sq. ft of which 103,181 is militarily useful. MV Cape Victory has 103,181 sq. ft of heavy deck strength (over 525psf with 13 f. clearances) and 30,440 sq.ft of <b>light</b> <b>deck.</b> In addition Cape Victory has 100, 450 volt reefer outlets.|$|E

50|$|Fire {{focuses on}} low-power, low-mana creatures as swift attackers. This civilization {{contains}} no blockers. Fire {{has a lot}} of Dragon support, as well as Speed Attacker, Power Attacker (shared with Nature), attacking if able, power-limited creature destruction, blocker and mana destruction, putting shields into graveyard, untapping after winning battles, unattackable creatures (shared with Water), breaking extra shields, taking extra turns, searching and reducing the costs of cross gears effects. A pure Fire deck tends to struggle against a well-designed pure <b>Light</b> <b>deck</b> or other mixed decks. Therefore, many fire cards are designed to aid Armored Dragons, as well as to be used along Nature and Darkness cards, and vice versa. A few Fire cards directly penalize blockers and creatures from Light and Water civilizations.|$|E

40|$|Glass fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) composite bridge decks behave {{differently than}} comparable reinforced concrete (RC) decks. GFRP decks exhibit reduced composite behaviour (when designed {{to behave in}} a composite manner) and exhibit reduced transverse distribution of forces as compared to comparable RC decks. Both of these effects are shown to counteract the beneficial effects of a <b>lighter</b> <b>deck</b> structure and result in increased internal stresses in the supporting girders. The objective {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate through an illustrative example the implications of RC-to-GFRP deck replacement on superstructure stresses. Regardless of superstructure stresses, substructure forces will be uniformly reduced due to the resulting lighter superstructure...|$|R

50|$|The {{ship was}} built by Earle's Shipbuilding in Hull and {{launched}} on 8 April 1891 by Mrs. Pollitt, wife of Henry Pollitt {{the general manager of}} the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. She was described in the Hull Daily Mail of 9 April 1891 as being constructed of iron for the railway company’s continental passenger and cargo traffic, her dimensions being as follow: Length, 240 feet; breadth, 32 feet; depth 16 feet, and she is arranged with poop- for first-class passengers, long bridge, with officers’ quarters under (forming also shelter for <b>light</b> <b>deck</b> cargo), and top-gallant forecastle for crew. The ship is built to Lloyds’ 100 A1 class, with additions to the scantlings in various parts to meet the requirements of the traffic. The first-class accommodation includes staterooms and beds for 36 passengers, with dining-saloon, smokeroom, ladies’-room, and conveniences, worked out in polished and hard woods, and finished in a tasteful manner. Complete fittings are also provided for 100 emigrants in the forward ‘tween decks. The boats and their outfit, with life-belts, &c., will be in accordance with the provisions of the Life-Saving Applicances Act of 1888, which recently came into force. Steam winches and cranes of new and powerful description are fitted, together with all necessary booms and derricks for the rapid working of cargo. Steam steering gear my essrs Amos and Smith is fitted amidships and hand screw gear aft. The cellular bottom of the ship is utilized for water-ballast, and by more complete sub-division than usual this will enable the ship to be trimmed very readily. The vessel will be schooner rigged, with two pole masts and fore and aft canvas. The machinery, also made by Earle’s Company, consists of a set of triple-compound three-crank engines, having cylinders 22in, 35in, and 57in diameter, with a stroke of 42in, and two steel single ended boilers, 14ft 3in mean diameter by 11ft inside length at top, made in accordance with Lloyd’s and the Board of Trade requirements for a working pressure of 170lbs per square inch.|$|E

5000|$|Each game {{requires}} {{one player}} {{to play the}} Light Side of the Force while the other plays the Dark Side. In friendly play, a player can specialize in {{one side or the}} other, but for tournaments, players need both Dark and <b>Light</b> <b>decks.</b> This two-sided aspect is rare in customizable card games (Netrunner being the other notable example). The action of the game occurs at various [...] "Location" [...] cards (both interstellar and planet-bound) familiar from the Star Wars Universe. Locations can be deployed as the game progresses; furthermore, most locations come in both Dark and Light-side flavors, and an on-the-table location can be [...] "converted" [...] (changed to the other side) at any time.

40|$|In 1977, the Weyerhaeuser Company {{developed}} {{a system for}} short-span timber bridges. The girder-free system consisted of longitudinal, vertically-laminated glulam panels joined by below-deck Transverse Stiffener Beams (TSB). This project addresses two potential areas of improvement in the construction and design of these bridges: a reinforced deck panel and an improved method for TSB design. This project has two objectives: (1) To evaluate the behavior and advantages of longitudinal glulam deck panels reinforced with Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) and (2) To evaluate existing AASHTO empirical TSB design criteria. The tension-reinforced deck panels can alleviate reliance on high grade wood laminations and allow longer spans and <b>lighter</b> <b>decks.</b> The new panels have the middle two-thlrds of the tension side reinforced with longitudinal E-glass FRP. The researchaddressed {{the selection of the}} FRP material system, the manufacturing process used for applying the reinforcement to the panels, the structural and economic benefits of FRPglulam panels, and the durability of the FRP. The approach included design, laboratory manufacture, and construction of a municipal pier in Milbridge, Maine. Wet-impregnated unidirectional E-glass fabric...|$|R
60|$|Donkin {{closed the}} door behind him gently but firmly. Sleeping men, huddled under jackets, made on the <b>lighted</b> <b>deck</b> shapeless dark mounds that had the {{appearance}} of neglected graves. Nothing had been done all through the night and he hadn't been missed. He stood motionless and perfectly astounded to find the world outside as he had left it; there was the sea, the ship--sleeping men; and he wondered absurdly at it, as though he had expected to find the men dead, familiar things gone for ever: as though, like a wanderer returning after many years, he had expected to see bewildering changes. He shuddered a little in the penetrating freshness of the air, and hugged himself forlornly. The declining moon drooped sadly in the western board as if withered by the cold touch of a pale dawn. The ship slept. And the immortal sea stretched away immense and hazy, like the image of life, with a glittering surface and lightless depths. Donkin gave it a defiant glance and slunk off noiselessly as if judged and cast out by the august silence of its might.|$|R
