Tomando como base um acontecimento histórico – a declaração feita por um policial e veiculada fortemente pela mídia, de que as mulheres são estupradas porque se vestem como vadias –, pretende-se delinear o percurso sócio-histórico que levou ao acontecimento discursivo chamado Marcha das Vadias. Assim como um acontecimento histórico pode gerar um acontecimento discursivo, este, por sua vez, também pode ser determinante para a ocorrência de um acontecimento lingüístico. As três noções de acontecimento se pautam na Teoria da Análise do Discurso de orientação francesa e são exploradas neste artigo, levando-se em conta sua relação com a atualização dos discursos,os efeitos de sentido pretendidos e produzidos pelos discursos, a produção e circulação dos discursos e a constituição da identidade feminina nesse panorama.

However, differences in semantic content and the deliberateness ascribed to a musical or <b>linguistic</b> <b>event</b> inhibit {{the extent to which}} a music-language comparison can advance without qualification.

This topic is con-sidered in the light of evidence from synaesthesia and sound symbolism. Having endeavoured to show the relevance of a joint discussion on music and language, the second experiment explores the level of accord within the linguistic and musical academic communities (university students and teachers/researchers) on salient themes relative to such a discussion.

The first focuses on the functionalities of the aspectual markers 着 zhe 0 'ZHE', 了 le 0 'LE' and 过 guo 4 'GUO'. The other focuses on the aspectual classification of verbs (situation aspect). However, very few studies concern {{about the relationship between}} aspectual markers and situation aspect. Situation classification in Chinese, itself, is also problematic, e. g. whether the classification should be performed in word, phrase or sentence level. This question is actually related to the philosophical question how human perceive events and treat them differently, which is addressed in ontological descripitions of different event types. In this sense, previous studies have been trying to classify linguistic units into ontological categories, encountering the problems being discussed for decades. The intrinsic reason is that each linguistic unit in various granularities including word, phrase and sentences can be used to describe different ontological event types. This thesis describes a study on aspectual classification in Chinese. Different from previous studies that have tried to classify linguistic units into different situation types directly, this study will first describe ontological event types that are potentially shared by all human beings. After that, the study will focus on how these events are described in language, which then involves the concept of viewpoint aspects, which can be defined as the viewpoint we choose in order to describe this event, e. g. the starting point, ending point etc. There are researchers who argue that viewpoint aspect is still shared universally and thus in ontological level however in linguistic domain. Such ontological events with viewpoint aspects can be called ontological linguistic events, or just <b>linguistic</b> <b>event.</b> Then, the study will focus on how such ontological events with certain viewpoint aspects are described in Chinese, which will be language dependent. Finally, linguistic units in Chinese can be classified according to how they are usually used to realize linguistic events. The Chinese aspectual system thus includes two different levels: linguistic units that denote ontological situation types, and lingusitic units that denote viewpoint aspect. Situation types are mainly expressed by verbs and their arguments. This motivates most of the research works on classifying verbs, phrases or sentences into situation types. The aspectual markers 着 zhe 0 'ZHE', 了 le 0 'LE' and 过 guo 4 'GUO' in addition to some aspectual verbs/adverbs, such as 在 zai 4 'progressive', 开始 kai 1 shi 3 'start', 结束 jie 2 shu 4 'end', 继续 ji 4 xu 4 'continue', 停止 ting 2 zhi 3 'stop', 完成 wan 2 cheng 2 'finish' etc., are linguistic devices that are used to express certain viewpoints, so as to form linguistic events. On the other hands, linguistic units may not be associated with unique situation types or viewpoint aspects. This also raised the difficulties encountered in previous studies that would not be resolved unless we can have an overall view of the whole Chinese aspectual system in different levels. The study described in this thesis thus starts from the ontological perspective to examine how human perceives events in the world and then go through all different levels to linguistic units in Chinese to examine how these units are used to describe linguistic events. In detail, the following issues will be discussed. 1) How many situation types are there? Vendler (1957) presented four situation types, namely state, activity, accomplishment and achievement, which were suggested to be ontological categories later. Simith (1991) adopted another category, namely semelfactive, in his framework. By analyzing the primitives of events, I give a theorectical analysis how many situation types are there and propose eight basic categories. 2) How many viewpoints are there? Theorectically, there are unlimited number of viewpoints from which we can observe and describe an event. Linguistically, we only choose meaningful viewpoints in order to express the right and necessary information with pragmatic factors. Previously, different viewpoint aspects have been discussed, including inchoative, progressive, terminative and completive etc. 3) What is the relation between viewpoints and situation types? As have been shown that progressive is not compatible with instantaneous events. I will discuss this issue in a systematic way in the ontological level with the consideration that such compatibilities should be shared all over the world. 4) What are the consequences by proposing the different <b>linguistic</b> <b>event</b> types? I first give formal representation, mostly in first order logic. Finally, it seems clear that a <b>linguistic</b> <b>event</b> is associated with a reference time or duration based on which a background situation is described. The study of aspect {{turns out to be the}} study of the relation between the reference time or duration and different situation types. 5) How are the aspectual markers and some constructions such as RVCs related with different <b>linguistic</b> <b>event</b> types and indirectly with different situation types? I will discuss different aspectual markers, 着 zhe 0 'ZHE', 了 le 0 'LE' and 过 guo 4 'GUO' in addition to some verbs and adverbs, including 在 zai 4 'progressive', 开始 kai 1 shi 3 'start', 结束 jie 2 shu 4 'end', 继续 ji 4 xu 4 'continue', 停止 ting 2 zhi 3 'stop', 完成 wan 2 cheng 2 'finish'. These words across different word classes are discussed together with the consideration that they all function in the domain of aspects. 6) Does the aspect framework covers all possible cases in real data? I will present an annotated corpus containing more than about 5000 sentences. The annotation framework will incorporate different modalities as their presence can affect the acceptability of certain linguistic events. 7) Is it possible to identify the aspectual information automatically by computer? I will conduct experiments with machine learning approaches on the annotated corpus, using general syntactic features, e. g. tokens, dependency relations etc. The results show a promising result, proving that the aspectual system I proposed is effective and potentially useful for computational applications.

40|$|According to the Motor Theory of Speech Perception (MTSP), {{listeners}} perceive {{speech by}} way of the articulatory gestures they would perform themselves in producing a similar signal. The theory postulates a module that allows extracting gestural information from the signal. The gestures constitute the event perceived. According to the Modulation Theory (MDT), speech is modulated voice. Listeners perceive it by demodulating the signal. The properties of the voice convey nonlinguistic information while the linguistically coded information is conveyed by its modulation. The modulation pattern constitutes the <b>linguistic</b> <b>event</b> perceived. The theories agree in requiring a linkage or mapping between perception and production. According to MDT, phonetically labeled links between exteroception and proprioception (mirror and echo neurons) are established in the brain during speech acquisition. The set of links embodies the knowledge of the relation. While MDT describes the device that MTSP would need in order to be implemented, it makes it redundant to recruit the motor system. Demodulation is also necessary in speechreading and in order to perceive sign language, when a face or body is ‘modulated ’ instead of a voice. In audiovisual speech perception, there are two percepts: a normally dominant vocal one and a gestural one that does not need to agree with it. MTSP knows of only one of these. It is concluded that all the specific claims of MTSP are false while MDT rests on ‘first principles’. Two theories A theory based on articulatory gesture...|$|E

40|$|What {{explains}} the rich patterns of deverbal nominalization? Why do some nouns have argument structure, while others do not? We seek a solution in which properties of deverbal nouns are composed from properties of verbs, properties of nouns, and {{properties of the}} morphemes that relate them. The theory of each plus the theory of how they combine, should give the explanation. In exploring this, we investigate properties of two theories of nominalization. In one, the verb-like properties of deverbal nouns result from verbal syntactic structure (a “structural model”). See, for example, van Hout & Roeper 1998, Fu, Roeper and Borer 1993, 2001, to appear, Alexiadou 2001, to appear). According to the structural hypothesis, some nouns contain VPs and/or verbal functional layers. In the other theory, the verbal properties of deverbal nouns result from the event structure and argument structure of the DPs that they head. By “event structure” we mean {{a representation of the}} elements and structure of a <b>linguistic</b> <b>event,</b> not a representation of the world. We refer to this view as the “event model”. According to the event model hypothesis, all derived nouns are represented with the same syntactic structure, the difference lying in argument structure – which in turn is critically related to event structure, in the way sketched in Grimshaw (1990), Siloni (1997) among others. In pursuing these lines of analysis, and at least to some extent disentangling their properties, we reach the conclusion that, with respect to a core set of phenomena, the two theories are remarkably similar – specifically, they achieve success with the same problems, and must resort to the same stipulations to address the remaining issues that we discuss (although the stipulations are couched in different forms) ...|$|E

40|$|Music is a {{multifaceted}} phenomenon: beyond addressing our auditory channel, {{the consumption of}} music triggers further senses. Also in creating and communicating music, multiple modalities are at play. Next to this, it allows for various ways of interpretation: the same musical piece can be performed in different valid ways, and audiences can in their turn have different reception and interpretation reactions towards music. Music is experienced in many different everyday contexts, which are not confined to direct performance and consumption of musical content alone: instead, music frequently is used to contextualize non-musical settings, ranging from audiovisual productions to special situations and events in social communities. Finally, music is a topic under study in many different research fields, ranging from the {{humanities and social sciences}} to natural sciences, and—with the advent of the digital age—in engineering as well. In this thesis, we argue that the full potential of digital music data can only be unlocked when considering the multifaceted aspects as mentioned above. Adopting this view, we provide multiple novel studies and methods for problems in the Music Information Retrieval field: the dedicated research field established to deal with the creation of analysis, indexing and access mechanisms to digital music data. A major part of the thesis is formed by novel methods to perform data-driven analyses of multiple recorded music performances. Proposing a top-down approaches investigating similarities and dissimilarities across a corpus of multiple performances of the same piece, we discuss how this information can be used to reveal varying amounts of artistic freedom over the timeline of a musical piece, initially focusing on the analysis of alignment patterns in piano performance. After this, we move to the underexplored field of comparative analysis of orchestral recordings, proposing how differences between orchestral renditions can further be visualized, explained and related to one another by adopting techniques borrowed from visual human face recognition techniques. The other major part of the thesis considers the challenge of auto-suggesting suitable soundtracks for user-generated video. Building on thoughts in Musicology, Media Studies and Music Psychology, we propose a novel prototypical system which explicitly solicits the intended narrative for the video, and employs information from collaborative web resources to establish connotative connections to musical descriptors, followed by audiovisual reranking. To assess what features can relevantly be employed in search engine querying scenarios, we also further investigate what elements in free-form narrative descriptions invoked by production music are stable, revealing connections to <b>linguistic</b> <b>event</b> structure. Further contributions of the thesis consist of extensive positioning of the newly proposed directions in relation to existing work, and known practical end-user stakeholder demands. As we will show, the paradigms and technical work proposed in this thesis managed to push significant steps forward in employing multimodality, allowing for various ways of interpretation and opening doors to viable and realistic multidisciplinary approaches which are not solely driven by a technology push. Furthermore, ways to create concrete impact at the consumer experience side were paved, which can be more deeply acted upon in the near future.

40|$|Trying to {{automatically}} detect laughter and other nonlin-guistic events in speech raises a fundamental question: Is it appropriate to simply adopt acoustic features that have tradi-tionally {{been used for}} analyzing <b>linguistic</b> <b>events?</b> Thus we {{take a step back}} and propose syllabic-level features that may show a contrast between laughter and speech in their intensity-, pitch-, and timbral-contours and rhythmic patterns. We mo-tivate and define our features and evaluate their effectiveness in correctly classifying laughter from speech. Inclusion of our features in the baseline feature set for the Social Signals Sub-Challenge of the Computational Paralinguistics Challenge yielded an improvement of 2. 4 % in Unweighted Average Area Under the Curve (UAAUC). But beyond objective metrics, an-alyzing laughter at a phonetically meaningful level has allowed us to examine the characteristic contours of laughter and to rec-ognize the importance of the shape of its intensity envelope...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{detecting}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>events</b> at interword boundaries, such as sentence boundaries and disfluency locations, in speech transcribed by an automatic recognizer. Recovering such events is crucial to facilitate speech understanding and other natural language processing tasks. Our approach {{is based on a}} combination of prosodic cues modeled by decision trees, and word-based event N-gram language models. Several model combination approaches are investigated. The techniques are evaluated on conversational speech from the Switchboard corpus. Model combination is shown to give a significant win over individual knowledge sources. 1. INTRODUCTION Current automatic speech recognition systems output a string of words. Most natural language understanding systems, however, require structural information such as punctuation, which is present in text but not overtly indicated in spoken language. Similarly, for speech understanding and information extraction, it is important to fi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|S. Branca-Rosoff, A. Collinot, J. Guilhaumou, F. Mazière The {{research}} {{of this article}} centers on a commitment to a discourse analysis focusing on history. Herein lies an attempt at interpreting the meaning of utterance in the forms of language and in the effects of archivization. It is first question of a historian-observer describing <b>linguistic</b> <b>events</b> in a precise historical environment. Then the linguist devises an observatory of various discourses which {{make it possible to}} confront the materiality of forms and the values of social practices. Finally, a study of utterances based on linguistic and discursive properties (reflexivity, interdiscursivity) goes towards constructing an observatory of interpretative processes.

40|$|Grammar-based natural {{language}} processing has reached a level where it can `understand' language to a limited degree in restricted domains. For example, {{it is possible to}} parse textual material very accurately and assign semantic relations to parts of sentences. An alternative approach originates from the work of Shannon over half a century ago [41], [42]. This approach assigns probabilities to <b>linguistic</b> <b>events,</b> where mathematical models are used to represent statistical knowledge. Once models are built, we decide which event is more likely than the others according to their probabilities. Although statistical methods currently use a very impoverished representation of speech and language (typically finite state), it is possible to train the underlying models from large amounts of data. Importantly, such statistical approaches often produce useful results. Statistical approaches seem especially well-suited to spoken language which is often spontaneous or conversational and not readily amenable to standard grammar-based approaches...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept and}} features of lexico-semantic ‘intraference’ in Educated Nigerian English (ENE). The tendency of nonnative speakers in a(n) ESL setting, like Nigeria, to redeploy the lexico-semantic rules of English to ‘kill,’ weaken, strengthen and reverse the SBE and native English meanings of words is termed lexico-semantic intraference in this paper. Questionnaires, interviews, library research, empirical studies, the Internet and recording of live <b>linguistic</b> <b>events</b> were used to gather data from 2004 to 2013. It was discovered that educated Nigerians regularly impose meanings on some words, extend the meanings of words, weaken or reverse word meanings and also redeploy the lexico-semantic dynamics of the language to fabricate lexical items with new meanings or meanings already in some well established SBE words. These habits generate words and meanings that distinguish ENE lexico-semantics from the lexico-semantics of SBE and some other international varieties of English. </p...|$|R
