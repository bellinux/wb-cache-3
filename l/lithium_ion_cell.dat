The distribution and inhomogeneity of internal state values in the cell like temperature, current, power loss, SOC as well as voltage can be predicted reliably with this kind of models. The demand for calculating these state values on battery management systems can be met with a model order reduction introduced in this paper. Moreover, the interdependency of the temperature inhomogeneities and the inhomogeneities of inner state values in the cell can be studied.

The parametrised model obtained is validated using a vehicle driving cycle and a deviation of 30 mV in Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) value between measurement and simulation is obtained.
