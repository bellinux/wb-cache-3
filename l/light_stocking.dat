The light grazing and heavy grazing treatments each occurred in two replicate pastures that are about 50 ha each with gently rolling terrain.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of Heteropogon contortus and Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca populations were studied in {{a subset of}} treatments in an extensive grazing study conducted in central Queensland between 1988 and 2001. These treatments were 4 stocking rates in native pasture and 2 of these stocking rates in legume oversown and supplement/spring burning treatments. For the 1999 - 2000 summer, population data for H. contortus in 5 of these native pasture and supplement/burning treatments were compared with those for an additional burnt treatment. Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was below the long-term mean and mean annual pasture utilisation ranged from 24 to 61 %. Increasing stocking rate from 5 to 2 ha/steer in native pasture reduced H. contortus plant density. Increasing stocking rate reduced seedling recruitment {{as a result of}} its effect on soil seedbanks. Seedling recruitment was the major determinant of change in plant density, although some individual H. contortus plants did survive throughout the study. Burning in spring 1999, particularly at <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> rate, promoted seedling recruitment above that in both unburnt native and legume oversown pasture and resulted in increased H. contortus plant density. In the legume oversown treatments, S. scabra cv. Seca density increased rapidly from 15 plants/m 2 in 1988 to 140 plants/m 2 in 2001 following a lag phase between 1988 and 1993. This increased S. scabra density was associated with an eventual decline in H. contortus plant density through reduced seedling recruitment. It was concluded that H. contortus population density is sustainable at stocking rates of 4 and 5 ha/steer (30 % pasture utilisation) and that spring burning at <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> rate can promote H. contortus populations.

40|$|A stochastic, compartmental Model for Adaptive Livestock Management (MALM) was {{developed}} for cow-calf enterprise for Rolling Plains of Texas from an existing model, Simple Ecological Sustainability Simulator (SESS). The model simulates forage and animal production. It runs on a monthly time step. Two stocking strategies, flexible and fixed, were evaluated at seven stocking levels for effects on forage and animal production, range condition, and net ranch income. Evaluation data were obtained from published and unpublished data from Texas A&M Agricultural Experimental Station at Vernon for Throckmorton. The model adequately simulated forage and animal production. Light fixed stocking rates and flexible stocking strategies resulted in cows of median body condition score (BCS) 5, compared to low BCS of 4 under moderate fixed stocking rate, and BCS of 3 under heavy fixed stocking. BCS declined from autumn to early spring and peaked in summer. Cows under light fixed stocking rates and under flexible stocking were heavier (460 kg) compared to those under heavy fixed stocking (439 kg). Replacement rates were lower under <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> (22 %), compared to flexible (37 %) and heavy stocking (56 %). Calf crops were all above the reported 90 % expected for bred heifers because of the replacement policy. Flexible stocking strategy resulted in higher net income ($ 19. 62 ha- 1), compared to fixed light ($ 5. 93 ha- 1) or fixed heavy ($- 17. 35 ha- 1) stocking strategies. Coefficient of variation (CV) in net income was highest under heavy stocking (90 %) compared to <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> (60 %) and flexible stocking (50 %). Maximum net income was obtained between 0. 05 AUM??ha- 1 and 0. 13 AUM??ha- 1 when fixed stocking strategy was used but when flexible stocking strategy was used maximum net income was obtained between 0. 1 AUM??ha- 1 and 0. 17 AUM??ha- 1. Range condition rapidly declined under fixed heavy stocking, increased under fixed and light flexible stocking, and remained constant under moderate flexible stocking. Heavy fixed stocking decreased range condition rapidly over a 20 -year period. MALM was an effective tool to demonstrate effects of different management strategies. The model can function as a strategic or a tactical decision aid. It is concluded that there is potential for this model to assist managers in improving the sustainability of agriculture...|$|E

Killing silver-leaved ironbark trees near Rubyvale produced no measurable improvement in pasture growth or quality for at least 6 years whereas at Injune the same treatment of poplar box trees resulted in an immediate and large enhancement in pasture production and carrying capacity. The gritty red duplex soil at Rubyvale was much more erodible than the grey solodic at Injune although the latter becomes very erodible if the stable surface soil is breached.

The step-up lighting regimen was compared to a low intensity (2. 5 lx) step-down lighting program. Toms were used in Trial 1 and both sexes were employed in Trial 2. Body weight, feed/gain ratio, and mortality of toms of Trial 1 did not differ significantly between lighting regimens. The incidence of leg deformities and the length of the tarsometatarsal bone were significantly decreased, whereas plasma androgen and testes weights were increased for toms of Trial 1 in the high intensity step-up lighting. The same trends were apparent for toms of Trial 2 with the exceptions that feed/gain ratios were adversely affected and testes weights were significantly lower for toms of the high intensity step-up lighting program. The performance of hens in the high intensity step-up lighting program of Trial 2 was affected adversely; however, incidence of leg abnormalities and length and width of the tarsometatarsus responded {{in the same manner as}} with toms. The results of this study indicate that a high intensity step-up lighting program can significantly reduce leg weakness problems in turkeys. Possible explanations for light stimulation reducing the incidence of leg abnormalities are through increased exercise and shortening of long bones.

MethodsForty legs (28 patients) with chronic venous oedema were randomised to either short-stretch bandages applied weekly for 2 weeks, followed by an elastic stocking for 2 weeks (group A) or a <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> (“liner”) for 1 week followed by superimposing a second stocking for 3 weeks (group B). Interface pressures and leg volumes were measured weekly. ResultsDespite differences in the pressure (median ± interquartile range) applied (bandage: 67  mmHg [55. 7 – 73. 0] vs. liner 24. 5  mmHg [21. 2 – 26. 5]) volume reduction after 1 week was equal (12. 8 % [8. 7 – 16. 5] and 13. 0 % [10. 4 – 20. 6]). After 2 weeks (group A: 17. 8 % [10. 6 – 20. 0] vs. group B 16. 2 % [13. 0 – 25. 4]) and 4 weeks (group A: 17. 3 % [9. 6 – 22. 8] vs. group B: 17. 0 % [13. 1 – 24. 1]) volume reductions remained identical.

40|$|Abstract. Rainfall {{variability}} is {{a challenge}} to sustainable and profitable cattle production in northernAustralia. Strategies recommended tomanage for rainfall variability, like light orvariable stocking, arenotwidely adopted. This is duepartly to the perception that sustainability and profitability are incompatible. A large, long-term grazing trial was initiated in 1997 in north Queensland, Australia, to test the effect of different grazing strategies on cattle production. These strategies are: (i) constant <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> (LSR) at long-term carrying capacity (LTCC); (ii) constant heavy stocking (HSR) at twice LTCC; (iii) rotational wet-season spelling (R/Spell) at 1. 5 LTCC; (iv) variable stocking (VAR), with stocking rates adjusted inMay based on available pasture; and (v) a Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) variable strategy, with stocking rates adjusted in November, based on available pasture and SOI seasonal forecasts. Animal performance varied markedly over the 10 years for which data is presented, due to pronounced differences in rainfall and pasture availability. Nonetheless, lighter stocking at or about LTCC consistently gave the best individual liveweight gain (LWG), condition score and skeletal growth; mean LWG per annum was thus highest in the LSR (113 kg), intermediate in theR/Spell (104 kg) and lowest in theHSR (86 kg). MeanLWGwas 106 kg in theVARand 103 kg in the SOI but, in all years, the relative performance of these strategieswas dependent upon the stocking rate applied. After 2 years on the trial, steers from lightly stocked strategies were 60 – 100 kg heavier and received appreciable carcass price premiums at the meatworks compared to those under heavy stocking...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of an {{increasingly}} variable climate, long-term cattle weight gain datasets are rare, yet invalu-able, for determining site-specific influences of seasonal weather patterns on cattle production. Here,we present a long-term (1936 – 2005) yearling Hereford steer dataset collected at the Northern GreatPlains Research Laboratory (NPGRL) near Mandan, ND, USA. Data were analyzed using weighted AICcmodel averaging {{to examine the effects of}} spring (April–June) and summer (July–September) temper-ature and precipitation, as well as prior growing season (prior April–September) and prior fall/winter(prior October–March) precipitation on cattle production (kg/ha) under light (37. 4 ± 5. 3 SD Animal UnitDays [AUD]/ha across all study years) and heavy (91. 6 ± 22. 2 SD AUD/ha) stocking rates. Because Ken-tucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) invaded the grassland at NPGRL in the early 1980 s, we modeled cattleproduction separately for pre- (1936 – 1983) and post-invasion (1986 – 2005) years to determine if theplant community shift influenced sensitivity to seasonal weather patterns. Cattle production under heavystocking was more sensitive to seasonal weather variability than under <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> during both pre-and post-invasion years. Interestingly, the magnitude and robustness of coefficients changed between thepre- and post-invasion years, with seasonal weather patterns explaining more cattle production variationduring the post-invasion years. Though cattle sensitivity to seasonal weather patterns differed betweenlight and heavy stocking for both pre- and post-invasion years, invasion status did change cattle responseto weather. For example, cattle production in P. pratensis invaded pastures was more heavily influencedby cool, wet springs and wet prior grazing seasons than was production in un-invaded pastures. Forcattle stocked heavily in native pastures, wet winters more strongly increased cattle production than ininvaded pastures...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> is an 18 square {{kilometer}} copper-bearing granitoid intrusion {{within the}} Plumas Copper Belt {{in the northern}} California Sierra Nevada. Engels Mine, Superior Mine, and Moonlight Valley represent the main copper-mineralization in the Lights Creek district and small prospects include the Ruby Mine, and Moonlight Creek. The Moonlight Valley deposit within the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> has been previously considered a porphyry copper deposit {{on the basis of}} stockwork veinlets in a granitic host. The granitic host rock of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> contains hydrothermal tourmaline and biotite as well as disseminated and vein copper-sulfides (bornite-chalcocite-chalcopyrite), and these features are supportive of porphyry-style mineralization. Nonetheless, the mineral alteration assemblages and zonation observed at Moonlight Valley and the Superior and Engels Mines differ significantly from literature descriptions of porphyry systems. Ores in the Lights Creek district are notably sulfur-poor and copper-rich. Mineralization includes copper-sulfide veins with pink potassium-feldspar selvages, tourmaline veins with albitic-chlorite selvages, and actinolite-apatite veins, as well as albite-magnetite alteration in the Kettle Rock volcanic sequence intruded by the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock.</b> These features are similar to the class of ores known as iron oxidecopper- gold (IOCG) deposits. Lights Creek represents one of several copper- and iron -bearing ore districts associated with early Mesozoic intrusions in northern Nevada and California, including both porphyry copper-skarn ores and IOCG deposits. This region is underlain by an early Mesozoic marine province of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, including evaporites, intruded by shallowly emplaced Jurassic, and in some cases, Triassic plutons (Stewart et al., 1997; Proffett and Dilles, 2008). This scenario is ideal for formation of IOCG deposits produced by advection of sedimentary brines by the heat of the intrusions (Barton and Johnson, 1996). A uranium-lead zircon age of 178. 1 ± 3. 9 (2 s) Ma was observed from two samples of hypabyssal quartz monzonite {{on the east side of}} the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> where it intrudes the Early Jurassic volcanics of the Kettle Rock sequence. The <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> originally contained igneous hornblende, which exhibits hydrothermal alteration to tourmaline, chlorite and local biotite associated with narrow sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite) and tourmaline veins. Apatite-actinolite veins and albite-alteration zones also cut the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock.</b> In the Superior Mine, east-dipping ore-bearing veins (< 10 cm to 2 m wide) are zoned from central copper-rich zones (bornite, chalcopyrite, magnetite) associated with hydrothermal tourmaline and biotite alteration to outer sulfide-rich zones (chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite) with sericite-chlorite alteration. Gently dipping intermineral lamprophyre dikes cut the bornite-bearing veins, but are in turn cut by the pyrite-chalcopyrite-rich veins. Similar ore zonation was observed by Storey (1981) in the northwest part of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> at the large Moonlight Valley deposit. In the Moonlight Valley, Engels Mine, and Superior Mine deposits porphyry dikes are absent. The observations are consistent with an IOCG association of copper mineralization broadly synchronous with the emplacement of the 178 Ma <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock.</b> The light-colored, relatively fresh and unmineralized China Gulch Granite intrudes the east side of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock,</b> and yielded a uranium-lead zircon age of 148. 1 ± 1. 3 (2 s) Ma. Quartz porphyry dikes intrude Middle Jurassic volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks of the Mount Jura sequence (Christe, 2011) west of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> along Moonlight Creek, and are here cut by quartz-tourmaline sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite) veins associated with strong sericitic alteration. Muscovite from this alteration zone yielded an ⁴⁰Ar-³⁹Ar plateau age of 146. 05 ± 0. 88 (2 s) Ma, the same age as the China Gulch Granite to the east, and suggest latest Late Jurassic age of porphyry copper mineralization. Copper-sulfides from Moonlight Valley and Superior are characterized by lead isotope values of ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴Pb 19. 4, while lead isotope values of copper-sulfides from Moonlight Creek and Engels are close to the igneous values of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> at ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴Pb 18. 6. The lead isotope data support the hypothesis that the fluids that formed the Moonlight Creek deposits and a portion of the ore of the Engels deposit were magmatic-hydrothermal, while the Moonlight Valley and Superior Mine ores are in part derived from non-magmatic fluid source reflecting an older lead source. Copper mineralization in the Lights Creek district likely included components of both porphyry-type magmatic-hydrothermal and IOCG-like non-magmatic sedimentary brine fluids. The <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> was emplaced in the late Early Jurassic (178 Ma) and was in turn intruded by the younger late Late Jurassic China Gulch Granite (148 Ma). Magmatic fluids derived from the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> produced tourmaline ± biotite ± magnetite ± chalcopyrite ± bornite veins in potassic alteration containing zones of hydrothermal potassium feldspar + biotite. Contemporaneously, the intrusion of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock</b> drove advection of sedimentary brines through the adjacent metavolcanic rocks and margins of the stock. These sedimentary brines produced zones of albitic alteration and ores characterized by apatite + actinolite + titanite + magnetite + ilmenite ± chalcopyrite ± bornite ± epidote observed at Sulfide Ridge and the Superior Mine. Mixed fluids then produced zones of of albite ± chalcocite ± chalcopyrite ± tourmaline occuring at Sulfide Ridge, Superior Mine, and Moonlight Valley. In the late Late Jurassic (148 Ma), renewed magmatic activity resulted in the intrusion of the China Gulch Granite and granite porphyry dikes. The latter produced small-scale porphyrystyle mineralization along Moonlight Creek and Ruby Mine west of the <b>Lights</b> Creek <b>Stock...</b>|$|R

Treatments included a range of stocking rates in native pastures, legume-oversown native pasture and animal diet supplement/spring-burning pastures. Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was below the long-term mean. Mean annual pasture utilisation ranged from 13 to 61 %. Annual liveweight gains per head in native pasture were highly variable among years and ranged {{from a low of}} 43 kg/steer at 2 ha/steer to a high of 182 kg/steer at 8 ha/steer. Annual liveweight gains were consistently highest at <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> and decreased with increasing stocking rate. Annual liveweight gain per hectare increased linearly with stocking rate. These stocking rate trends were also evident in legume-oversown pastures although both the intercept and slope of the regressions for legume-oversown pastures were higher than that for native pasture. The highest annual liveweight gain for legume-oversown pasture was 221 kg/steer at 4 ha/steer. After 13 years, annual liveweight gain per unit area occurred at the heaviest stocking rate despite deleterious changes in the pasture. Across all years, the annual liveweight advantage for legume-oversown pastures was 37 kg/steer. Compared with native pasture, changes in annual liveweight gain with burning were variable. It was concluded that cattle productivity is sustainable when stocking rates are maintained at 4 ha/steer or lighter (equivalent to a utilisation rate around 30 %). Although steer liveweight gain occurred at all stocking rates and economic returns were highest at heaviest stocking rates, stocking rates heavier than 4 ha/steer are unsustainable because of their long-term impact on pasture productivity...|$|E

40|$|Rainfall {{variability}} is {{a challenge}} to sustainable and pro. table cattle production in northern Australia. Strategies recommended to manage for rainfall variability, like light or variable stocking, are not widely adopted. This is due partly to the perception that sustainability and profitability are incompatible. A large, long-term grazing trial was initiated in 1997 in north Queensland, Australia, to test the effect of different grazing strategies on cattle production. These strategies are: (i) constant <b>light</b> <b>stocking</b> (LSR) at long-term carrying capacity (LTCC); (ii) constant heavy stocking (HSR) at twice LTCC; (iii) rotational wet-season spelling (R/Spell) at 1. 5 LTCC; (iv) variable stocking (VAR), with stocking rates adjusted in May based on available pasture; and (v) a Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) variable strategy, with stocking rates adjusted in November, based on available pasture and SOI seasonal forecasts. Animal performance varied markedly over the 10 years for which data is presented, due to pronounced differences in rainfall and pasture availability. Nonetheless, lighter stocking at or about LTCC consistently gave the best individual liveweight gain (LWG), condition score and skeletal growth; mean LWG per annum was thus highest in the LSR (113 kg), intermediate in the R/Spell (104 kg) and lowest in the HSR(86 kg). MeanLWGwas 106 kg in the VAR and 103 kg in the SOI but, in all years, the relative performance of these strategies was dependent upon the stocking rate applied. After 2 years on the trial, steers from lightly stocked strategies were 60 - 100 kg heavier and received appreciable carcass price premiums at the meatworks compared to those under heavy stocking. In contrast, LWG per unit area was greatest at stocking rates of about twice LTCC; mean LWG/ha was thus greatest in the HSR (21 kg/ha), but this strategy required drought feeding in four of the 10 years and was unsustainable. Although LWG/ha was lower in the LSR (mean 14 kg/ha), or in strategies that reduced stocking rates in dry years like the VAR(mean 18 kg/ha) and SOI (mean 17 kg/ha), these strategies did not require drought feeding and appeared sustainable. The R/Spell strategy (mean 16 kg/ha) was compromised by an ill-timed fire, but also performed satisfactorily. The present results provide important evidence challenging the assumption that sustainable management in a variable environment is unprofitable. Further research is required to fully quantify the long-term effects of these strategies on land condition and profitability and to extrapolate the results to breeder performance at the property level...|$|E
