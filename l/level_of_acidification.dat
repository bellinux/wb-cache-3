40|$|Coccolithophorids are enigmatic {{plankton}} {{that produce}} calcium carbonate coccoliths, which over geological time have buried atmospheric CO 2 into limestone, changing both {{the atmosphere and}} geology of the Earth. However, the role of coccoliths for the proliferation of these organisms remains unclear; suggestions include roles in anti-predation, enhanced photosynthesis and sun-screening. Here we test the hypothesis that calcification stabilizes the pH of the seawater proximate to the organisms, providing a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> countering the detrimental basification that occurs during net photosynthesis. Such bioengineering provides a more stable pH environment for growth and fits the empirical evidence for changes in rates of calcification under different environmental conditions. Under this scenario, simulations suggest that the optimal production ratio of inorganic to organic particulate C (PIC : POCprod) will be lower (by approx. 20 %) with ocean acidification and that overproduction of coccoliths in a future acidified ocean, where pH buffering is weaker, presents a risk to calcifying cells...|$|E
40|$|Seagrasses {{are often}} {{regarded}} as climate change ‘winners’ because they exhibit {{higher rates of}} photosynthesis, carbon fixation and growth when exposed to increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification.</b> However, questions remain whether such growth enhancement compromises the biomechanical properties of the plants, altering their vulnerability to structural damage and leaf loss. Here, we investigated the short-term (6 wk) effects of decreasing pH by CO 2 enrichment on the growth, morphology and leaf-breaking force of the temperate seagrass Cymodocea nodosa. We found that the plant biomass balance under <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> representative <b>of</b> short-term climate change projections (pH 8. 04) was positive and led {{to an increase in}} leaf abundance in the shoots. However, we also found that plant biomass balance was negative under <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> experienced presently (pH 8. 29) and those projected over the long-term (pH 7. 82). Leaf morphology (mean leaf length, thickness and width) was invariant across our imposed acidification gradient, although leaves were slightly stronger under [CO 2] representative of short-term climate change. Taken together, these findings indicate that a subtle increase in growth and mechanical resistance of C. nodosa is likely to occur following short- to medium-term changes in ocean chemistry, but that these positive effects are unlikely to be maintained over the longer term. Our study emphasises the need to account for the interdependencies between environmental conditions and variations in multiple aspects of the structure and functioning of seagrass communities when considering the likely consequences of climate change...|$|R

40|$|The {{secretory}} pathway {{is one of}} {{the hallmarks}} of eukaryotic cells. The pathway furnishes the cells with an elaborate membrane network operating in the space between the nucleus and the plasma membrane. It includes all the cellular organelles and membranes, excluding the organelles that emerged as a result of bacterial endosymbiosis (mitochondria, chloroplasts and peroxisomes). The organelles and membranes of the secretory pathway as well as the plasma membrane are connected to each other by a continuous membrane flow that results in exchange of materials and directional sorting of membrane proteins and lipids. Nevertheless, the composition of the membranes of all the organelles connected with the secretory pathway is unique, and the specific internal contents of the organelles are maintained. The assembly and maintenance of this dynamic entity require energy at several levels. Although part of the energy is provided by cytoplasmic metabolic processes, {{a large part of the}} energy utilized to build up and maintain the unique composition of the lumen is provided by ion pumps. The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) provides much of this energy in the form of a proton-motive force. Energetization of organelles by V-ATPase also results in their acidification. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> is dependent on the extent and quality of secondary transport systems, as well as on the specific properties of the specific V-ATPase operatin...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} was to {{understand}} the capabilities of a dairy based meat alternative. This was done in three phases: 1) the production of a dairy protein gel as a base for a dairy based meat alternative, 2) texturization of the dairy protein gel base to produce a nugget like texture, and 3) a consumer test to determine the acceptability of the dairy based nugget compared to meat and meat alternatives on the market. For phase I, a dairy protein gel base was tested to understand the textural attributes. Milk to whey percentages and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> were examined to determine their effects on instrumental textural attributes of the protein gel. The milk to whey percentages and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> that were tested were 5 / 95, 10 / 90, and 15 / 85, and pH 5. 70 - 5. 60, 5. 15 - 5. 05, and 4. 6 - 4. 5; respectively. The texture was objectively measured using a texture analyzer. The results showed that there was an increase in the hardness, gumminess and chewiness which was associated with an increase of the milk to whey ratio. Also a firmer dairy protein gel was produced using a low pH. A milk to whey percentage of 15 / 85 and a pH of 4. 6 - 4. 5 produced the highest overall instrumental textural attributes, specifically. For phase II, the dairy protein gel composed of a milk to whey ratio of 15 / 85 and pH of 4. 6 was evaluated in the formulation of a dairy based nugget. The grinding of the dairy protein gel was used to determine if different size grinding plates and the presence of a gum can influence the textural attributes of the dairy protein gel. The dairy protein gel base was evaluated by a trained sensory panel to compare to the results of the objective texture analyzer. The dairy protein gel was processed using a meat grinder with a grind size of 3 mm, 6 mm and a blend of 4 parts 6 mm grinded and 1 part 3 mm. The increase in the grind size produced an increased instrumental hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness and gumminess. The usage of gum in the dairy protein gel system produced a higher instrumental adhesiveness. The sensory results showed that an increase in the grind size increased the sensory attributes; hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness and adhesiveness. The use of gum in the system had no influence on the sensory textural attributes. Both the texture analyzer and trained sensory testing showed a similar trend for the texture attributes. No correlation between the texture analyzer and sensory was found. This was a surprise because literature indicates there are significant correlations between instrumental textural attributes and sensory texture attributes. The lack of correlation may be explained by the variability of the panelists (P-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) for each sample. For phase III, an acceptability test was performed on untrained consumers of chicken nuggets to determine if the dairy based meat alternative was acceptable compared to meat nuggets and meat alternatives on the market. Texture, flavor, and appearance were evaluated by a consumer panel. The consumers evaluated the dairy based meat alternative and concluded that the appearance, texture and flavor needed improvement. From this research, it was concluded that a dairy based meat alternative can be created to imitate meat and meat alternative textures. By understanding the processing conditions to produce the dairy protein gel base and grinding of the product, an acceptable meat alternative can be produced. Dairy based meat alternative texture attributes were produced from a milk to whey percentage of 15 / 85 and a pH of 4. 6, and a large grind plate of 6 mm with the use of methylcellulose...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{improvement}} of concepts for the efficient application of anionic salts to optimise prophylactic effects whilst minimising side effects. To this end, an observational study was made of a commercial dairy farm (housing 1 700 lactating Holstein-Frisian dairy cows, annual average production about 11 000 kg of milk, 3. 83 % fat and 3. 33 % protein). The anionic rations were compared with a low calcium diet to analyse the effects on the metabolism and health of the cows of feeding anionic salts. The application of anionic salts was made over a 9 months period according to a test plan (aim: DCAD around 0 mEq/kg DM, calcium content 9 - 14 g Ca/kg DM). Afterwards the dairy farm switched from the feeding of the anionic rations to the low calcium diet (aim: DCADbetween + 100 mEq/kg DM and + 200 mEq/kg DM, calcium content 4 - 6 g Ca/kg DM). In order to record the effect of the different feed preparations on the metabolism of the cows, blood samples were taken from the calving animals (n= 705 fed with anionic salts and n= 168 with the low calcium diet) and urine samples (n= 445 fed with anionic salts and n= 135 with the the low calcium diet) from the cows in the close-up-period. Furthermore feed samples from the prepared rations (n= 13 fed with anionic salts and n= 6 with the the low calcium diet) were also examined in regular intervals. The potassium content of the feed rations in this study was the determining factor for the DCAD (sr 2 = 0, 23; p + 100 mmol/l) and simultaneously to a decrease of the calcium concentration in the urine (< 3. 0 mmol/l). By measuring the pH, NABE and calcium concentration of the urine the achieved <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> in conjungtion with effects on the calcium mobilisation and the bioavailability of calcium in the feed can be determined and used operatively to control the herd. The acidifying effects of the anionic salts can be adjusted at the animals from their urine parameters (urine-pH, NABE, urine calcium concentration) alone. It is possible to monitor the anionic rations via single or pool samples. The variations in the values from the feed analysis and urine parameters show that the application of anionic rations requires regular monitoring. Owing to the individual variance of the values around the intended acidification level (DCAD around 0 mEq/kg TS) it is necessary to determine reference ranges for the safe acidification effects in the evaluation of pool and single samples. From {{the results of this study}} reference ranges can be derived for pool (pH: 7. 0 to 7. 7; NABE: 0 mmol/l) and single samples (pH: 6. 2 to 7. 8; NABE: - 50 mmol/l to + 50 mmol/l) which agree with the international, mainly used in North America, reference values for the use of anionic salts. The time of sampling for controlling the anionic rations does not have any influence on the measurement which confirms the results of other studies. Due to the variation in individual values from single urine pH samples, the mean of the single samples should be calculated and compared with the reference values for practical monitoring at the farm. Depending on the size of the herd the pH should be determined at least twice a week from the urine of 8 to 10 cows which have been feeding anionic rations for at least 3 days. The successful use of anionic rations as a safe prophylactic tool to prevent hypocalcemia in a dairy herd is dependent upon high standards of feed management on the farm and in practice requires intensive monitoring and control of the anionic rations. There are several important points to consider to use anionic rations effectivly. Basis of application of anionic salts is the feeding of a diet which meets the requirements and ensures rumination. In order to avoid depressing feed intake, taste neutral anionic salts and/or capsules should be used. It is important to increase the calcium content (9 to 13 g/kg DM) of the feed for the safe use of anionic rations. From this study it can be inferred that the bioavailability of calcium for the cow from the feed or individual rations has a decisive effect on the safe use of anionic salts. To allow for the increased calcium requirements in the feed calciumcarbonate should be used because it is an inorganic source of calcium which provides high and safe bioavailability for the cow and can be added in relatively large amounts without negative effects. Therefore further research is required regarding the bioavailability of calcium in individual feeding stuffs which will improve the calcium substitution of anionic rations...|$|E

Even in regions where the emissions have fallen substantially, biological recovery of many waters has been slower and more uneven than chemical recovery. In Scotland, the Galloway hills of the South West have been identified as showing particularly noteworthy discrepancies between predicted and observed recovery from acidification.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Since the Industrial Revolution of {{the late}} 1700 's, {{atmospheric}} and marine carbon dioxide levels have drastically increased. Ocean acidification {{is the result of}} the shift in the marine carbon cycle caused by the increase in marine and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Changing environmental conditions caused by ocean acidification have been shown to have adverse effects on different marine species as well as life history stages. As a result, ecologically and economically important teleost fish species such as walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) could be adversely affected by ocean acidification conditions. This study explores the responses of walleye pollock eggs and larvae incubated under different projected <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification,</b> looking at hatch timing and growth parameters to examine potential adverse responses to more acidic conditions. Older walleye pollock juveniles (age 1 +) were used to uncover potential physiological responses to ocean acidification pertaining specifically to stress, overall body condition indices, and blood chemistry. I found that while the two early life history stages of walleye pollock could survive under ambient, high, medium, and low pH conditions (pH 8. 1, 7. 9, 7. 6, and 7. 2, respectively), there were some physiological responses to projected <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification.</b> Hatch timing was not delayed in the lowest pH treatment as expected. In addition, size at hatch, yolk area, and eye diameter did not differ among pH treatments. Walleye pollock juveniles reared under projected <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> demonstrated shifts in blood gas levels and blood pH. However, exposure to a lower pH environment of pH 7. 9, 7. 6, or 7. 2 did not induce a response for either the stress indicators or body condition indices that were measured. To uncover the mechanism for their resilience, more testing is needed to gain further insight into underlying compensatory mechanisms of various life history stages and populations...|$|R

Here, we describe phytoplankton communities from the turbid, acidified, and eutrophic Sungai Brunei and Brunei Bay estuarine system. Four sampling stations were selected, representing {{the full spectrum of}} the salinity (0. 4 - 28. 5 PSU) and pH (5. 87 - 8. 06) gradients associated with this system. A total of 25 microalgal families of phytoplankton (including 22 diatom and seven dinoflagellate genera) and one of ciliates were recorded in the survey, which was carried out between August 2011 and June 2012. Phytoplankton density ranged from 7 to 9107 cells ml(- 1). Diatoms were a dominant component of the communities, with Nitzschia spp., Rhizosolenia spp., and Leptocylindrus sp. reaching the highest abundances. Phytoplankton communities present at the four sampling stations differed significantly in terms of both algal abundance and composition and were strongly influenced by the effect of season (30 % of the total variance). The interactive effects of pH and salinity, and of pH and temperature, explained 16. 7 % and 17. 5 % of the total observed variation, respectively. A positive correlation between pH and the number of taxa found was detected.

E. coli cells were grown in Brain Heart Infusion broth {{until they reached the}} stationary phase (≈ 10 (9) cfu/mL). Approximately 30 min before thermal inactivation the early stationary phase cells were added in Brain Heart Infusion broth with a specific pH value, achieved with addition of either acetic (50 % (v/v)), lactic (50 % (v/v)) or hydrochloric acid (30 % (v/v)), and inactivation experiments took place at 54 °C and 58 °C. The inactivation dynamics are analysed using the inactivation model of Geeraerd et al. (2000). This enables to define the induced thermotolerance of E. coli as a prolongation of the shoulder and/or a reduction of the inactivation rate. Generally, addition of acids increased the heat resistance of E. coli.

Despite this concern, the impact on seafood quality and success of the seafood industry is unknown. Using a short-term study, we test these concerns using a major aquaculture species—Crassostrea gigas—exposing them to three acidification and warming scenarios: (1) ambient pCO 2 (~ 400 ppm) & control temperature (15 °C), (2) ambient pCO 2 (~ 400 ppm) & elevated temperature (20 °C), (3) elevated pCO 2 (~ 1, 000 ppm) & elevated temperature (20 °C).

The study was conducted in 2013 in the former Sulfur Mine „Jeziórko” located on the Tarnobrzeg Plain between Tarnobrzeg and Stalowa Wola cities (Podkarpackie Voivodeship, south Poland). It covered an area of land reclaimed as the arable or forest land. The most important problems connected with sulfur exploitation was the occurrence of a layer of solid sulfur which was previously removed. During the reclamation process, embankments and excavations were leveled through replenishing large amounts of ground, post-flotation lime, mineral fertilizers, and sewage sludge. Moreover, studies upon degraded and non-reclaimed area (by 2013) were also carried out. Examined land was characterized by granulometric composition of sands, loamy sands, and sandy loams. Re-leveling of degraded land using post-flotation lime contributed to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> <b>of</b> reclaimed soil surface.

40|$|The {{stunting}} effect <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> {{on development}} <b>of</b> calcifying invertebrate larvae {{has emerged as}} a significant effect of global change. We assessed the arm growth response of sea urchin echinoplutei, here used as a proxy of larval calcification, to increased seawater acidity/pCO 2 and decreased carbonate mineral saturation in a global synthesis of data from 15 species. Phylogenetic relatedness did not influence the observed patterns. Regardless of habitat or latitude, ocean acidification impedes larval growth with a negative relationship between arm length and increased acidity/pCO 2 and decreased carbonate mineral saturation. In multiple linear regression models incorporating these highly correlated parameters, pCO 2 exerted the greatest influence on decreased arm growth in the global dataset and also in the data subsets for polar and subtidal species. Thus, reduced growth appears largely driven by organism hypercapnia. For tropical species, decreased carbonate mineral saturation was most important. No single parameter played a dominant role in arm size reduction in the temperate species. For intertidal species, the models were equivocal. <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> causing a significant (approx. 10 – 20 +%) reduction in arm growth varied between species. In 13 species, reduction in length of arms and supporting skeletal rods was evident in larvae reared in near-future (pCO 2 800 + µatm) conditions, whereas greater acidification (pCO 2 1000 + µatm) reduced growth in all species. Although multi-stressor studies are few, when temperature is added to the stressor mix, near-future warming can reduce the negative effect <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> on larval growth. Broadly speaking, responses of larvae from across world regions showed similar trends despite disparate phylogeny, environments and ecology. Larval success may be the bottleneck for species success with flow-on effects for sea urchin populations and marine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Seaweeds are key {{species of}} the Baltic Sea benthic ecosystems. They are the {{substratum}} of numerous fouling epibionts like bryozoans and tubeworms. Several of these epibionts bear calcified structures and could be impacted by the high pCO 2 events of the late summer upwellings in the Baltic nearshores. Those events are expected to increase in strength and duration with global change and ocean acidification. If calcifying epibionts are impacted by transient acidification as driven by upwelling events, their increasing prevalence could cause a shift of the fouling communities toward fleshy species. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the sensitivity of selected seaweed macrofoulers to transient elevation of pCO 2 in their natural microenvironment, i. e. the boundary layer covering the thallus surface of brown seaweeds. Fragments of the macroalga Fucus serratus bearing an epibiotic community composed of the calcifiers Spirorbis spirorbis (Annelida) and Electra pilosa (Bryozoa) and the non-calcifier Alcyonidium hirsutum (Bryozoa) were maintained for 30 days under three pCO 2 conditions: natural 460 ± 59 µatm, present-day upwelling 1193 ± 166 µatm and future upwelling 3150 ± 446 µatm. Only the highest pCO 2 caused a significant reduction of growth rates and settlement of S. spirorbis individuals. Additionally, S. spirorbis settled juveniles exhibited enhanced calcification of 40 % during daylight hours compared to dark hours, possibly reflecting a day-night alternation of an acidification-modulating effect by algal photosynthesis as opposed to an acidification-enhancing effect of algal respiration. E. pilosa colonies showed significantly increased growth rates at intermediate pCO 2 (1193 µatm) but no response to higher pCO 2.

40|$|Fish exhibit {{impaired}} sensory {{function and}} altered behaviour at <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> expected to occur owing to anthropogenic {{carbon dioxide emissions}} during this century. We provide the first evidence of the effects <b>of</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> on reproductive behaviour of fish in the wild. Satellite and sneaker male ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus) compete to fertilize eggs guarded by dominant nesting males. Key mating behaviours such as dominant male courtship and nest defence did not differ between sites with ambient versus elevated CO 2 concentrations. Dominant males did, however, experience significantly lower rates of pair spawning at elevated CO 2 levels. Despite the higher risk of sperm competition found at elevated CO 2, we also found a trend of lower satellite and sneaker male paternity at elevated CO 2. Given the importance of fish for food security and ecosystem stability, this study highlights the need for targeted research into the effects of rising CO 2 <b>levels</b> on patterns <b>of</b> reproduction in wild fish...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of acidic precipitation on the environmental mobility of the metalloids arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) has not been given much attention and is poorly understood. As with other elements, the interest here is the potential effect <b>of</b> environmental <b>acidification</b> on environmental behavior {{in ways that are}} relevant to human exposure to these metalloids. Available information on acid precipitation and the environmental behavior of these metalloids do, however, permit some preliminary conclusions to be drawn. Both As and Se appear to be mobilized from household plumbing into tap water by the corrosive action of soft, mildly acidic water, while surface water catchment systems in areas impacted by acidic deposition may contain elevated soluble As <b>levels.</b> <b>Acidification</b> <b>of</b> aquatic ecosystems that are drinking water sources may pose the prospect of enhanced release of As from sediment to water as well as reduction in water <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Se. <b>Acidification</b> <b>of</b> ground waters, where As appears to be especially mobile, is of particular concern in this regard. The {{potential impact}} of acidic deposition on As and Se in soils cannot readily be assessed with respect to human exposure, but {{it would appear that the}} behavior of these metalloids in poorly buffered, poorly immobilizing soils, e. g., sandy soils of low metal hydrous oxide content, would be most affected. The effect is opposite for the two elements; lowered pH would appear to enhance As mobility and to reduce Se availability. Altered acidity of both soil and aquatic systems poses a risk for altered biotransformation processes involving both As and Se, thereby affecting the relative amounts of different chemical forms varying in their toxicity to humans as well as influencing biogeochemical cycling...|$|R

40|$|We relate {{here the}} {{distributions}} of two carbonate system key properties (total alkalinity, A T; and total dissolved inorganic carbon, C T) measured along a {{section in the}} Mediterranean Sea, going from Marseille (France) {{to the south of}} the Cyprus Island, during the 2008 BOUM cruise. The three main objectives of the present study are (1) to draw and comment on the distributions of A T and C T in the light of others properties like salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, (2) to estimate the distribution of the anthropogenic CO 2 (C ANT) in the intermediate and the deep waters, and (3) to calculate the resulting variation <b>of</b> pH (<b>acidification)</b> {{since the beginning of the}} industrial era. Since the calculation of C ANT is always an intense subject of debate, we apply two radically different approaches to estimate C ANT : the very simple method TrOCA and the MIX approach, the latter being more precise but also more difficult to apply. A clear picture for the A T and the C T distributions is obtained: the mean concentration of A T is higher in the oriental basin while that of C T is higher in the occidental basin of the Mediterranean Sea, fully coherent with the previous published works. Despite of the two very different approaches we use here (TrOCA and MIX), the estimated distributions of C ANT are very similar. These distributions show that the minimum of C ANT encountered during the BOUM cruise is higher than 46. 3 μmol kg − 1 (TrOCA) or 48. 8 μmol kg − 1 (MIX). All Mediterranean water masses (even the deepest) appear to be highly contaminated by C ANT, as a result of the very intense advective processes that characterize the recent history of the Mediterranean circulation. As a consequence, unprecedented <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> are reached with an estimated decrease of pH since the pre-industrial era of − 0. 148 to − 0. 061 pH unit, which places the Mediterranean Sea as one of the most acidified world marine ecosystem...|$|R

A single nucleo-tide polymorphism (SNP) in the Kir 6. 2 subunit causes a point mutation of Glu 23 to lysine and reduces the ATP sensitivity of pancreatic KATP channels. The SNP found in 58 % of Caucasians accounts for 15 % of type 2 diabe-tes. Here we show evidence for dysregulations of mus-cular KATP channels with the E 23 K variation. We were particularly interested in the channel modulation by intracellular protons, as pH changes widely and fre-quently in skeletal muscles. Surprisingly, we found that the defect of the E 23 K variant was more related to pH than ATP.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{environmentally}} deleterious effects of industrialization is the <b>acidification</b> <b>of</b> freshwater, which results in part from precipitative inputs of anthropogenic pollutants. Considerable effort has been allocated to the study and remediation of severely acidified aquatic systems, with the effects <b>of</b> weak <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> (pH 6 – pH 7) on biological communities having received less attention. One effect that has been studied is the chemical mediation of predator-prey interactions in freshwater and marine fishes. Following mechanical damage to the epidermis, as would likely occur during a predation event, many taxa release chemical alarm cues which elicit antipredator responses from conspecifics and other opportunistic receivers subject to similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> predation risk and potentially enhance the survival of alarm cue receivers during subsequent interactions with predators. Under weakly acidic conditions (pH < 6. 6), these chemical alarm cues are rendered non-functional and do not elicit alarm responses from conspecific or heterospecific receivers. Weak acidification effectively deprives prey fishes of one source of chemosensory information on ambient risk levels. 	Here, I describe a series of field experiments designed to evaluate {{the effects of this}} environmentally-mediated loss of information on wild populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in four acidic and five neutral streams in the Miramichi River system, New Brunswick, Canada. Acid-impacted Atlantic salmon in these experiments demonstrated a loss of response to conspecific and heterospecific chemical alarm cues, as well as significantly greater responses to remaining (visual) threat cues than salmon under neutral conditions. Fish in neutral streams appeared to demonstrate additive responses to multiple risky cues consistent with dynamic threat-sensitivity and the sensory complementation hypothesis, whereas fish in acidic streams demonstrated non-threat-sensitive responses consistent with the absence of sensory complementation and greater value being assigned to information received through visual cues. Contrary to predictions, juvenile salmon do not appear to suffer increased mortality through predation {{as a result of this}} loss of information, nor do they experience negative growth effects resulting from temporal trade-offs between antipredator and foraging behaviours. Rather, acid-impacted Atlantic salmon demonstrated behavioural compensation through increased preference for complex habitats which offer greater abundance of physical refugia and limit line-of-sight for visually foraging predators, effectively mitigating the increased risk of predation associated with limited information. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of key process parameters on the flow properties of a novel High Protein Dairy Food (HPDF). HPDF was manufactured by an approach similar to that of manufacture of Halloumi cheese (a semi hard cheese originally from Cyprus). The effect of pasteurization condition, pH <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> and homogenization were investigated on flowability, composition and texture of the HPDF. The study consisted of three different stages. After each stage of experimentation, the HPDF was analyzed for compositional, textural (by texture profile analysis) and flow properties during heating by microwave, oven and hot water was measured by Schreiber melt test. The first stage of experimentation screened 18 batches of HPDF under three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pasteurization conditions (191 °F/ 16 sec, 175 °F/ 16 sec and 161 °F/ 16 sec), three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pH <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> (5. 8, 6. 2 and 6. 6) and two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> homogenization conditions (two stage homogenization (2000 psi/ 500 psi) and no homogenization). Based on the results of the first stage, a statistically powerful second stage of experiment was designed in which two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pasteurization condition (191 °F/ 16 sec and 161 °F/ 16 sec) and three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pH <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> (5. 8, 6. 2 and 6. 6) were employed in duplicate to manufacture HPDF. The third stage of experimental design was to investigate the effect of two-stage homogenization treatment (2000 psi/ 500 psi) with two levels (homogenization and no homogenization). 	The results of all three stages of experimentation proved that HPDF made from milk pasteurized under higher pasteurization condition (191 °F/ 16 sec) had significantly higher flow resistance under all three heating conditions. There was significant interaction between pH of coagulation of milk and pasteurization condition on flow properties of HPDF with pH of coagulation 5. 8 restriction flow of HPDF under all three heating conditions. The role of homogenization in restricting flow of HPDF was not significant, although the mean flow of HPDF, made from homogenized milk, decreased. The mean protein content and mean moisture content of HPDF was significantly affected by all three processing conditions, although the mean fat content of HPDF was not influenced by any of these conditions. The mean fat, protein and moisture content of HPDF were in the range of 10. 5 - 11, 26 - 34 and 47 - 54 percent respectively. The primary textural properties affected significantly by the processing condition were hardness, chewiness and gumminess. Particularly, hardness was influenced by higher pasteurization condition and lower pH <b>of</b> <b>acidification.</b> 	Further, to judge the consumer acceptability of HPDF, various recipes made out of HPDF with different heating applications (baking, stir-frying and soup) were served to 12 panelists of DPTC. Their opinions were collected and analyzed statistically. The analysis of limited focus group survey showed that consumer liking for HPDF recipe was significantly influenced by prior familiarity with the recipe, although there was some preference for HPDF over tofu due to its ‘dairy’ flavor. When the texture of HPDF manufactured from milk pasteurized at 191 °F/ 16 sec and pH <b>of</b> <b>acidification</b> 5. 8 and 6. 2 were compared with various commercial protein sources, the hardness of the HPDF was very close to extra firm tofu. All the other textural properties of HPDF were significantly different from firm, silken, baked or reduced fat tofu. 	From this project, it is evident that a high protein food, which can be part of day-to-day human diet and potential tofu alternative, can be obtained using halloumi approach by optimizing pasteurization condition (191 °F/ 16 sec) and pH of coagulation (5. 8) ...|$|R
