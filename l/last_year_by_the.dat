[...] The community had experienced rapid demographic change in recent years; in 2000, just {{over half of the}} population was black. [...] An annual report <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> office of Missouri's attorney general concluded that Ferguson police were [...] "twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops as they were whites." [...] This is after accounting for the increased proportion of population of African-Americans in the community, as this statistic measured the likelihood of being arrested after one had already been stopped as part of a traffic stop.|$|E

This evening he was arrested by an officer who came down especially from New York, aided by our own active and intelligent police authorities, on the charge of stealing a great number of valuable securities, the property of the Brownsville Bank, which institution was, as our readers may remember, threatened with a run, towards the conclusion of <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> discovery of a robbery, which was at that time supposed to have been effected by Mr. William Partridge, the cashier of the bank.|$|E

60|$|The {{researches}} of Schroeder and Dusch in 1854, and of Schroeder alone, in 1859, {{cleared up}} this point by experiments which are simply refinements upon those of Redi. A lump of cotton-wool is, physically speaking, {{a pile of}} many thicknesses of a very fine gauze, the fineness of the meshes of which depends upon {{the closeness of the}} compression of the wool. Now, Schroeder and Dusch found, that, in the case of all the putrefiable materials which they used (except milk and yolk of egg), an infusion boiled, and then allowed to come into contact with no air but such as had been filtered through cotton-wool, neither putrefied, nor fermented, nor developed living forms. It is hard to imagine what the fine sieve formed by the cotton-wool could have stopped except minute solid particles. Still the evidence was incomplete until it had been positively shown, first, that ordinary air does contain such particles; and, secondly, that filtration through cotton-wool arrests these particles and allows only physically pure air to pass. This demonstration has been furnished within the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> remarkable experiments of Professor Tyndall. It has been a common objection of Abiogenists that, if the doctrine of Biogeny is true, the air must be thick with germs; and they regard this as the height of absurdity. But nature occasionally is exceedingly unreasonable, and Professor Tyndall has proved that this particular absurdity may nevertheless be a reality. He has demonstrated that ordinary air is no better than a sort of stirabout of excessively minute solid particles; that these particles are almost wholly destructible by heat; and that they are strained off, and the air rendered optically pure, by its being passed through cotton-wool.|$|E

Three cases are presented: 1) classical probabilities and random variables; 2) quantum probabilities and observable operators; 3) dynamic probabilities and observation trees. This {{gives rise to a}} new kind of topology for information processes. We discuss briefly its application to complex data, in particular to the structures of information flows in biological systems.
