50|$|The DB Class 66 (German: Baureihe 66) was a {{class of}} two Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) {{locomotives}} designed for <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> and passenger train services on the main and branch lines of Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), the national railway of the former West Germany.|$|R
25|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the Great Western Railway {{encouraged}} these two traffics by running <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> from the area to London and other population centres, and by heavily marketing the holiday opportunities of Cornwall and providing imaginative train services for the purpose. Mineral traffic developed too.|$|R
50|$|Two Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) 2-6-4T Class 66 locomotives, {{designed}} for <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> and passenger train service, {{were built in}} 1955 {{as part of the}} DB's Neubaulok construction programme. They were both withdrawn from service in 1968. One, DB 66 002, has been preserved at the Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} war {{increasingly}} stifled {{the purchase of}} <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> locomotives until, in January 1941, the existing orders were cancelled completely. On 2 June 1941, MF Esslingen delivered the last Class 41 locomotive, no. 41 352, to the DRB. With that a total of 366 engines of this class had been built in just under four years.|$|R
5000|$|The Up <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{was running}} late {{by the time}} it reached Exeter. Despite the train being too long to be {{accommodated}} in the loop at that station, the signaller night-officer turned the train into the loop. When the locomotive had reached the points at the Sydney end of the station, the rear of the train was still on the Main line at the southern end.|$|R
5000|$|After the <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> had passed, the {{signalman}} {{moved the}} pilot engine {{back to the}} down main line - while this movement was taking place, at 1:23 am, the up boat train was offered to the signalman by the preceding signal box. Forgetting that the slow <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{was still on the}} up main line, the signalman accepted the boat train, and cleared his signals for it. [...] At 1:24 am, with full steam on at a speed estimated at 50 mph, the boat train passed the signal box and ran into the <b>goods</b> <b>train.</b> The driver and fireman of the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> managed to jump clear before the accident, but were unable to give any signal in the short time they had. The guard of the boat train did not recall any braking before the impact.|$|R
50|$|The Prussian Class G 5.1 {{steam engines}} {{were the first}} 2-6-0 goods {{locomotives}} in Europe. They were developed for the Prussian state railways from the Class G 4 {{and a total of}} no less than 268 units of this class were placed in service in Prussia between 1892 and 1902. The twin-cylinder G 5.1 had been designed to raise the speed of <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> on main lines. In addition, more powerful engines were needed for the increasingly heavy train loads. The locomotives, which were equipped with a compressed air brake, were used in charge of <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> (Eilgüterzugdienst) and also passenger trains due to their impressive top speed of 65 km/h. The G 5.1 was fitted with inside Allan valve gear and the carrying wheels were of the Adams axle design.|$|R
50|$|In {{the search}} for a new, <b>fast,</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> locomotive, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) in 1934 was {{attracted}} by the proposal from the Berliner Maschinenbau (BMAG, formerly Louis Schwartzkopff) for a 2-8-2 (1'D1'h2) engine. The design, produced by Friedrich Wilhelm Eckhardt (1892-1961), differed from the DRG's original requirement for a 2-8-0 (1'D) engine, because the required performance with an 18-ton axle load was easier to generate on a 2-8-2 engine rather than one with a 2-8-0 wheel configuration. Continued adherence to this instruction would in the end have given the new engine no significant advantage over the Prussian <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> locomotives which were to be withdrawn. The Reichsbahn Central Office Engineering Works (RZM) eventually agreed to this proposal; the BMAG was tasked to develop the proposed design and produce two prototypes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the railway, <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> still ran at top speeds of only about 20 mph. However, the {{introduction}} of through brakes using air pipes (such as the Kunze-Knorr brakes in Germany) from the 1920s enabled higher speeds to be safely achieved. Modern goods wagons are authorised for speeds up to around 75 mph and in certain countries, wagons are increasingly equipped with GPS receivers and transponders which provide location monitoring as required. The Deutsche Bahn (DB) even has goods wagons cleared for high-speed rail travel at up to 100 mph. Because the braking distance of <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> is longer than the separation between distant and home signals (as are Express Passenger trains), they may only run at high speeds of 150 mph with locos on routes with early signalling systems in the driver’s cab (LZB, FZB and ETCS).|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{themselves have}} personalities and talk {{in a manner}} reminiscent of what in real life would be {{the manner of the}} men who operate them. Human beings appear in the story only as seen {{from the perspective of the}} engines. The story relates a sort of rite of passage. A <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> was derailed by hitting a shoat (young pig) which got on the track, and ended up in a farm field[...]007, a [...] "sensitive", new, youthful engine performs in a heroic and manly way pulling the breakdown train, winning him the respect of his fellow engines. At the conclusion, the highest-ranking engine Purple Emperor, a [...] "superb six-wheel-coupled racing-locomotive, who hauled the pride and glory of the road, the millionaires' south-bound express" [...] inducts him into a fraternal organisation: ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} {{because it had}} been shown during the First World War that it was a great disadvantage, from a {{servicing}} and maintenance point of view, for each state railway to have its own locomotive classes with no standardization. In addition, the military railways needed a <b>fast,</b> powerful, <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> locomotive, that did not, however, have a high axle load.|$|R
50|$|The 2-8-2 Class 41 <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{locomotive}} (many {{of whose}} parts {{were the same}} as those of the Class 03) was designed for <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> e.g. for the transportation of fish and fruit. With its 1,600 mm wheel diameter it could reach a top speed of 90 km/h. That put it within the range of light express train duties, for which it was often used e.g. on the Thuringian Forest lines (e.g. to Meiningen from Arnstadt and Eisenach). Other engines built to standard designs, albeit in smaller numbers, appeared from 1936 {{in the shape of the}} heavy and especially powerful 2-10-2 Class 45 <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> locomotives. In order to raise performance and improve economy, the boiler pressure on the Class 45, and other classes, was increased to 20 bar experimentally. However the steel boiler used and the type of steel employed were not up to it, so that the pressure had to be reduced to the usual 16 bar. In many cases, the boilers were later completely replaced.|$|R
50|$|From 1956 to 1958, 40 guards vans of the CP design were {{constructed}} by A.E. Goodwin (NSW), and painted in a Passenger Red livery. They {{were intended to}} run on passenger <b>trains</b> and some <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> and had a freight capacity of 10 tons. The vans were of all-steel construction and welded to an underframe, which rested on two 4-wheeled bogies fitted with roller bearings. The vans had many amenities, including a stainless steel wash basin, toilet, mirror and stove. The walls and ceilings were lined with wool and the interior lining was of painted plywood, while the floor was instulated with a rubber layer. All windows were of armour-plate safety glass. Earlier vans had three windows per sliding door, while later vans had one per sliding door. All vans were fitted with axle-mounted generators for electric lighting.|$|R
50|$|The GCR Class 8F was a {{class of}} ten 4-6-0 {{locomotives}} built for the Great Central Railway in 1906 by Beyer, Peacock and Company {{to the design of}} John G. Robinson for working <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> and fish <b>trains.</b> They passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 grouping and received the classification 'B4'.|$|R
5000|$|The winter 1890 GN & GE Joint Working Timetable (WTT) {{shows the}} line had {{generated}} {{a fair amount}} of traffic. In the WTT, there are only two GE worked coal trains daily from Doncaster to Whitemoor although these are augmented by a further four daily [...] "as required" [...] paths which would run if there was enough traffic. The bulk of the Up (southbound) Joint goods service was composed of mixed <b>goods</b> and coal <b>trains,</b> a daily total of six from Doncaster to Whitemoor, two from Lincoln and one from Sleaford. In addition, the GN worked one block coal train a day from Doncaster to Whitemoor, as well as a goods service from Lincoln Holmes Yard and various pick up trains (trains that picked up and dropped off goods at stations en route) from Doncaster to Lincoln. There were four GE worked <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> from Doncaster including one that is shown to have originated at Bradford, and two from Lincoln, both of these being very smart connections out of Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway express goods services from Manchester.In the opposite direction, the GE-worked freight services comprised eight <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> workings, including two to Lincoln, four mixed goods and coal (1 to Lincoln) and five empty wagon services. There were also four [...] "as required" [...] paths to balance the Up service. The Down GN goods workings were an empties train from Whitemoor to Doncaster and a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to Sleaford and a service from Spalding to Doncaster. Also shown are a New England (Peterborough) to Colwick pick up goods via Spalding and Sleaford and several GN freights between Lincoln and Doncaster, most starting from New England and running via Boston.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability of}} the railway to carry fresh produce to distant markets such as Bristol, London and Manchester enabled local farmers and {{fishermen}} to sell more produce and at better prices. The special [...] "perishable" [...] train soon became {{a feature of the}} railway, these being <b>fast</b> extra <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> carrying potatoes, broccoli or fish depending on the season. In August 1861 1,787 tons of potatoes, 867 tons of broccoli, and 1,063 tons of fish were dispatched from the station. Fruit and flowers were also carried; the mild climate around Penzance and on the Scilly Isles meant that they were ready for market earlier and could command high prices.|$|R
50|$|When new, {{they were}} used to haul <b>fast</b> {{passenger}} and <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. In SAR service, they were also used on mainline workings out of Port Elizabeth. In later years they were relegated to shunting, particularly working in Natal but also in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and in Transvaal. None of them was reboilered with a Watson Standard boiler with a round-topped firebox.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were placed}} in service hauling all the <b>fast</b> passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> between Durban and Pietermaritzburg and were the first locomotives to accomplish a return working of this service within a day, with the same crewmen. These locomotives opened up a new era on the NGR, where the tank locomotive was at last withdrawn from mainline working. Later, in SAR service, these locomotives were also used on mainline workings out of Port Elizabeth.|$|R
50|$|The Class 746 {{initially}} {{operated on}} the Milan-Bologna-Florence-Rome-Naples main line; after {{portion of it}} were electrified, they served on the Milan-Turin and the Milan-Brescia railways. In the 1960s they were operating in Sicily and on the Adriatic coast railway, until their withdrawals, which were concluded by 1967. While fast, powerful and suitable for both <b>fast</b> passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> the Class 746 proved difficult to start and somewhat uneasy when running at or close to its top speed (with both problems originating from its compound engine); also, at higher speeds the low-pressure cylinders contributed relatively little to the locomotive's power output. The locomotives fitted with Caprotti valve gear also {{turned out to have}} problems when functioning in reverse.|$|R
50|$|The Kunze-Knorr brake (Kunze-Knorr-Bremse or KK-Bremse) is an {{automatic}} compressed-air brake for goods, passenger and express trains. It {{was the first}} graduated brake for <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> in Europe. When it was introduced after the First World War, <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> brakes switched from hand operation to compressed-air in various European countries. The Deutsche Reichsbahn alone put the cost of equipping German goods wagons with Kunze-Knorr brakes between 1918 and 1927 at 478.4 million Reichsmarks. The operating cost savings from <b>faster</b> <b>goods</b> services and having fewer brakemen was assessed by the Reichsbahn at almost 96.3 million Reichsmark annually.|$|R
500|$|Heavy {{traffic was}} carried from the {{agricultural}} and fishing {{areas in the}} south west of England, often in fast [...] "perishables" [...] trains, for instance more than 3,500 cattle were sent from [...] in the 12 months to June 1869, and in 1876 nearly than 17,000 tons of fish was carried from west Cornwall to London. The perishables trains running {{in the nineteenth century}} used wagons built to the same standards as passenger coaches, with vacuum brakes and large wheels to allow <b>fast</b> running. Ordinary <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> on the GWR, as on all other British railways at the time, had wheels close together (around [...] apart), smaller wheels and only hand brakes. In 1905 the GWR ran its first vacuum-braked general <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> between London and Bristol using newly built goods wagons with small wheels but vacuum brakes. This was followed by other services to create a network of fast trains between the major centres of production and population that were scheduled to run at speeds averaging [...] Other railway companies also followed the GWR's lead by providing their own vacuum-braked (or [...] "fitted") services.|$|R
50|$|Jayan was a {{high risk}} taker and {{throughout}} his career, he was popular for stellar performances in fight and stunt sequences. Dangerous and thrilling stunts were often featured in action films with Jayan in the lead. These were usually highlighted during fight scenes as added promotions to his machismo image and daredevilry. Numerous movies {{in which he has}} acted have one or more notable stunt performances.A few prominent examples may be Puthiya Velicham ('New Light',1979) in which he performs train stunts jumping onto and from a <b>fast</b> running <b>goods</b> <b>train,</b> Aavesham ('Inspiration',1979) which shows the actor swimming through the dangerous waters of Hogenakkal Falls through {{a major part of the}} climax sequence without using any kind of safety measures. Movies like Thadavara ('Prison',1981) and Sharapancharam (1979) demonstrate his brilliant horseriding skills performing almost effortlessly on horseback while films like Mamangam involved dangerous fights with wild animals. In a film called Moorghan ('Cobra', 1981) he broke through a brick wall riding on a motor bike (a Royal Enfield Bullet) and it also featured sequences that had the actor sliding through ropes tied at high elevations. Perhaps the most famous movie stunt featuring Jayan came in Chandrahasam ('Moonsword',1980) in which he held on to the UV clamp of a massive ship crane and was elevated to a height of around 200 feet before jumping off to the top of the vessel. In one of his final stunt scenes, in Ariyappedatha Rahasyam ('Secret never known', 1981) he was involved in a fight scene with an elephant.|$|R
2500|$|Although it {{had been}} built to work the Western line to Ararat, a number of bridges along the route {{required}} strengthening before the H class locomotive with its 23¼ ton axle load could enter regular service on that line. The necessary work was deferred due to wartime restrictions on available resources. Therefore, H220 was put {{to work on the}} only line able to accommodate its loading gauge and high axle load, the North-Eastern line to Albury, where it hauled express passenger services, <b>fast</b> <b>goods</b> services, troop <b>trains,</b> and on the odd occasion when the regular S class Pacific was not available, the Spirit of Progress, particularly in the postwar period when S class locomotives were affected by poor coal and reduced availability. H220 gave an indication of its capabilities on one such run of the Spirit in the late 1940s by reportedly topping the [...] long 1 in 50 Glenroy Bank at [...] (three times the typical S class-hauled speed at this point,) going on to pass Seymour 13 minutes ahead of schedule and arriving at Albury at 20 minutes ahead of the 10:40 pm scheduled arrival time.|$|R

5000|$|The two <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> were {{proceeding}} {{much slower}} than the parcels train. To prevent delays to the more important parcels train, signalman H. Button of Charfield Box and R.H Smith of Berkeley Road Junction (the block post before Charfield) agreed to shunt the two <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> clear. Button shunted the LMS <b>Goods</b> <b>Train</b> into a siding at Charfield whilst Smith shunted the GWR <b>Goods</b> <b>Train</b> into a siding at Berkeley Road Junction. The parcels train quickly raced through the Stations. After signalman F.W Booking of Wickwar (the signalbox after Charfield) signaled [...] "out of section" [...] to Button, he signaled for the LMS <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to depart the sidings. However, the driver of this train chose to spend five minutes taking on water at Charfield, something he wasn't booked to do. Nor did he inform Button of this. As a result, the original plan for the GWR <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> had to be altered. The mail train meanwhile was fast approaching Charfield and with this in mind, Button was forced to shunt the GWR <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> into the sidings in Charfield once the LMS <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> had left.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line had}} been built {{primarily}} to handle the many <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> that ran between Lancashire and Yorkshire. A typical weekday in Autumn 1952 saw at least thirty-seven eastbound <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> running into Yorkshire using the Micklehurst Loop and a similar number of westbound trains. The loop had easier gradients than the original line through Mossley and Greenfield and this caused most of the heavy <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> to use it.|$|R
5000|$|An Übergabegüterzug (abbreviated to: Üg or Übergabe, {{literally}} <b>goods</b> exchange <b>train)</b> is a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{that moves}} individual goods wagons {{on the first}} or last stage of their journey i.e. from the start to the first railway hub or from the final railway hub to its destination. Between hubs the wagons are hauled by Nahgüterzüge (Ng), i.e. local <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> or Durchgangsgüterzüge (through <b>goods</b> <b>trains).</b> These trains generally cover relatively short distances and {{only have a few}} wagons that are delivered to and collected from industrial or loading sidings, either individually or in so-called wagon groups.|$|R

50|$|The <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> hauled {{agricultural}} {{products in the}} main, but the transportation of logs was also important. The only industries were in Celle.Military transportation to the various military installations was also important. Even after the Second World War further military facilities were added and, on many stations, tank-loading ramps were built. Until 1978 the DB also ran <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> through the line because the distances were shorter than on their own DB lines; towards the end this amounted to 135,000 t per year. In 2006 three <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> ran on the line each week, as well as ad hoc <b>trains</b> and <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> hauled by the OHE between DBAG routes.|$|R
50|$|A Nahgüterzug (abbreviation: Ng) is {{the name}} given to a {{category}} of local <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> in German-speaking countries. It describes a type of <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> that, unlike the Durchgangsgüterzug (through <b>goods</b> <b>train)</b> - does not stay together for its entire journey; instead wagons can be added or dropped off at intermediate stations en route. And unlike the Übergabegüterzug (<b>goods</b> exchange <b>train)</b> Nahgüterzüge run from one railway hub to another, usually between two marshalling yards. Along the way various groups of wagons are detached or collected at the intermediate stations.|$|R
