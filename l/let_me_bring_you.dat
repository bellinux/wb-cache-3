6000|$|ANDERSON. Well, {{perhaps you}} will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> the news myself. Judith: {{will you give}} Mr. Dudgeon his tea, and keep him here until I return? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you pardon me," [...] he said, [...] "if I {{remark that}} this {{conversation}} has no particular interest for me? Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> any further {{out of your}} way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stephen moved {{step by step}} as if he {{were being}} unwillingly dragged, until he had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden by a screen of draperies. Maggie went on {{counting}} her money till she suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, [...] "Aren't you very tried? Do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> something,--some fruit or jelly, mayn't I?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I prithee, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> where crabs grow; and I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts" ...|$|R
6000|$|Calib. I pr'ythee <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> where crabs grow; and I, with my long nails, will dig thee pig-nuts, shew thee a jay's nest, and {{instruct}} thee how to snare the marmozet: I'll <b>bring</b> <b>thee</b> to clustered filberts. Wilt thou go with me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish <b>you</b> would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him to <b>you.</b> He did {{not know}} until this moment you were in town. I have not seen him since we met yesterday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know how. I {{have only}} speculated on the coincidence; I have not tried {{to account for}} it. I feel sure he will return. When he does, dear John, let me tell him that I have at last spoken to you, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> together. He will {{certainly}} help us to a new livelihood. His entreaty was that he might do something to smooth my life and yours; and I gave him my promise that if we ever wanted a friend, I would remember him.' ...|$|E
60|$|There, there, I am a fool! Tears! I have {{sometimes}} {{been moved to}} tears by a chapter of fine writing in a novel; but what have I to do with tears now? All depends on me--Father, this poor girl, the farm, everything; and they both love me--I am all in all to both; and he loves me too, I am quite sure of that. Courage, courage! and all will go well. (Goes to bedroom door; opens it.) How dark your room is! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> in here where there is still full daylight. (Brings EVA forward.) Why, you look better.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A custom I devoutly hope King Harry will break!' exclaimed Ralf. 'If not, I'll {{some day}} find the way between those painted ribs of Monseigneur de la Mort, I can tell him! I had nearly {{given him a}} taste of my sword as it was, only some Gascon rogue caught my arm, and he was off ere I could get free. So I jumped off, that your poor corpse should not be trodden by French heels; and I hardly know how it was, but the Lady Esclairmonde was by my side as I dragged you out, and caused these good folks to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> in behind their shop.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No harm! lurking here in {{that fashion}} in the dark! You'll not make <b>me</b> believe that! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> hear what <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> here! The truth, mind!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, my brother," [...] said Ravonino to the youth, in {{tones of}} unusual tenderness, [...] "and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know what <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> here so unexpectedly." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS DUBEDAT. He {{made those}} drawings; {{and they are}} not the best--nothing like the best; only I did not bring the really best: so few people like them. He is twenty-three: his whole life is before him. Wont <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him to <b>you?</b> wont you speak to him? wont you see for yourself? ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot said to Sir Percival: [...] "Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to my lady." [...] And therewith he took Sir Percival by {{the hand}} and led him up into the gallery and to where the Lady Elaine sat in the midst of her court. And Sir Percival looked with a very earnest regard upon that lady, and it {{appeared}} to him that he had never before beheld so sweet and gentle and beautiful a countenance as that which he then looked upon. And Sir Percival said: [...] "Lady, now that I see thee I wonder not that Sir Launcelot hath remained thus hidden away from the sight of all of us for these two years past. For if this island wherein ye dwell is a fair paradise then certes art thou a very fitting queen to that dwelling-place." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR MISS ARCHER--I don't {{know whether}} you will have heard of my coming to England, {{but even if you}} have not it will {{scarcely}} be a surprise to you. You will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at Albany, three months ago, I did not accept it. I protested against it. You in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that I had the right on my side. I had come to see you with the hope that you would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> over to my conviction; my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best. But you disappointed it; I found you changed, and you were able to give me no reason for the change. You admitted that you were unreasonable, and it was the only concession you would make; but it was a very cheap one, because that's not your character. No, you are not, and you never will be, arbitrary or capricious. Therefore it is that I believe you will let me see you again. You told me that I'm not disagreeable to you, and I believe it; for I don't see why that should be. I shall always think of you; I shall never think of any one else. I came to England simply because you are here; I couldn't stay at home after you had gone: I hated the country because you were not in it. If I like this country at present it is only because it holds you. I have been to England before, but have never enjoyed it much. May I not come and see you for half an hour? This at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are wrong," [...] said Perkins gently. [...] "They {{would have}} given him the {{alternative}} of betraying his trust, and confessing everything--which he would probably have accepted. Pardon me!--this is no insinuation against you," [...] he interrupted,--"but I regret {{to say that my}} experience with the effete Latin races of this continent has not inspired me with confidence in their loyalty to trust. Let me give you an instance," [...] he continued, smiling: [...] "the ship you are expecting is supposed to be an inviolable secret of the Church, but it is known to me--to my friends ashore--and even to you, my poor friend, a heretic! More than that, I am told that the Comandante, the Padre, and Alcalde are actually arranging to deport some of the American women by this vessel, which has been hitherto sacred to the emissaries of the Church alone. But you probably know this--it is doubtless part of your errand. I only mention it to convince you that I have certainly no need either to know your secrets, to hang you from the yard-arm if you refused to give them up, or to hold you as hostage for my messenger, who, as I have shown you, can take care of himself. I shall not ask you for that secret despatch you undoubtedly carry next your heart, because I don't want it. You are at liberty to keep it until you can deliver it, or drop it out of that port-hole into the sea--as you choose. But I hear the boat returning," [...] continued Perkins, rising gently from his seat as the sound of oars came faintly alongside, [...] "and no doubt with Winslow's messenger. I am sorry you won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> together. I dare say he knows all about you, and it really need not alter your opinions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, Hal! I {{want you}} to help me to persuade father, and if you get your temper up you'll like as not go against <b>me.</b> If he <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> go I'll <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> in as soon as I dare. That's a promise. I guess I know how much I'd like to have you." ...|$|R
60|$|Next, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> before <b>you</b> the pious {{care that}} was taken of our allies under that treaty which {{is the subject of}} the Company's applauses. These allies were Ragonaut Row, for whom we had engaged to find a throne; the Guickwar, (one of the Guzerat princes,) who was to be emancipated from the Mahratta authority, and to grow great by several accessions of dominion; and, lastly, the Rana of Gohud, with whom we had entered into a treaty of {{partition}} for eleven sixteenths of our joint conquests. Some of these inestimable securities called vague articles were inserted in favor of them all.|$|R
6000|$|... "We mean {{to try to}} be; {{and some}} day <b>you</b> must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> her to <b>you,</b> and shew her. I shall not be satisfied, {{if you do not}} know my wife." [...] She told Martha {{afterwards}} that she hoped that Mr. Hugh had sown his wild oats, and that matrimony would sober him. When, however, Martha remarked that she believed Mr. Hugh to be as hardworking a young man as any in London, Miss Stanbury shook her head sorrowfully. Things were being very much changed with her; but not even yet was she to be brought to approve of work done on behalf of a penny newspaper.|$|R
6000|$|My dear Fanny--I {{am afraid}} you will think me very negligent in not having {{answered}} your Letter--I {{see it is}} dated June 12. I did not arrive at Inverness till the 8th of this Month so I am very much concerned at your being disappointed so long a time. I {{did not intend to}} have returned to London so soon but have a bad sore throat from a cold I caught in the island of Mull: therefore I thought it best to get home as soon as possible, and went on board the Smack from Cromarty. We had a nine days' passage and were landed at London Bridge yesterday. I shall have a good deal to tell you about Scotland--I would begin here but I have a confounded toothache. Tom has not been getting better since I left London and for the last fortnight has been worse than ever--he has been getting a little better for these two or three days. I shall ask Mr. Abbey to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> to Hampstead. If Mr. A. should see this Letter tell him that he still must if he pleases forward the Post Bill to Perth as I have empowered my fellow traveller to receive it. I have a few Scotch pebbles for you from the Island of Icolmkill--I am afraid they are rather shabby--I did not go near the Mountain of Cairn Gorm. I do not know the Name of George's ship--the Name of the Port he has gone to is Philadelphia whence he will travel to the Settlement across the Country--I will tell you all about this when I see you. The Title of my last Book is Endymion--you shall have one soon.--I would not advise you to play on the Flageolet--however I will get you one if you please. I will speak to Mr. Abbey on what you say concerning school. I am sorry for your poor Canary. You shall have another volume of my first Book. My toothache keeps on so that I cannot write with any pleasure--all I can say now is that your Letter is a very nice one without fault and that you will hear from or see in a few days if his throat will let him, ...|$|E
5000|$|The record {{deals with}} Marling's {{feelings}} of solitariness and dislocation in Los Angeles. Marling has described Los Angeles {{as a city}} that rejects negative attitudes in people, and this {{is reflected in the}} sixth track, ″Don't <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> Down″, in which she sings [...] "Living here is a game I don't know how to play." [...] Marling's activities in Joshua Tree are referenced when she sings [...] "I've got us lost so I've turned us off in Joshua tree," [...] in the song ″Easy″, her implied exploration with psychedelics apparent in the line, [...] "It was a bit too high for me/ I spent a month thinking I was a high desert tree." [...] Marling describes another part of her American experience in the lead single, ″False Hope″, which is about her time in Manhattan when Hurricane Sandy struck. The title of the record comes from a meeting Marling had with a hippie in a bar in Mount Shasta. Often his response to what Marling said was, [...] "It's a short fucking movie, man," [...] this attitude influencing the lyrics on the title song.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ordered a}} carriage; shall I show him where it is? Perhaps you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{take you to}} it? They are so stupid here. They would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY MARKBY. Good evening, dear Gertrude! So kind of <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> my friend, Mrs. Cheveley. Two such charming {{women should}} know each other! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{not only}} because he's a genius that I ask <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him here; it's because he's a human being, and he is ill and poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, thanks most awfully," [...] {{interrupted}} Freddie. [...] "It's fearfully good of <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him along. I must be staggering off now. Lot {{of things}} to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|Albert {{sprang up}} to help her put down the wood in her arms. [...] "I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the wood," [...] he said pleadingly, as she refused his aid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> my Uncle Joe {{to dinner}} tomorrow," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "The poor old fellow is {{stranded}} here for Thanksgiving, and he hates hotels. May I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Martha eagerly {{interrupted}} the hesitating voice,--and it was easily interrupted! [...] "Yes, yes, gran'father. They'll {{be sure to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> home some for you. I'll be quite, quite sure to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's a scrape! Do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> that wicked boy over {{to explain}} and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him." [...] And Jo made for the door again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Strickland is very ill. He may be dying. He {{is alone}} in a filthy attic, {{and there is not}} a soul to look after him. I want <b>you</b> to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> to a {{close the}} story of [...] "The Rover Boys on the River." [...] The trip had been full of adventures, but it now looked as if all would end happily.|$|R

6000|$|ACRES Odds bullets, no!--by my valour! {{there is}} no merit in killing him so near; do, my dear Sir Lucius, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> him down at a long shot:--a long shot, Sir Lucius, if you love me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's rich enough," [...] said Jimmy; {{getting up}} and {{reaching}} for his hat. [...] "In dollars, that is. Some ways he's poor enough. Well, I must be going. Thanks ever so much for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Uncle Joe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{be seen by}} you--it {{comes to}} the same thing. She's really worth seeing; <b>you</b> must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> her; you'll find her very suggestive. That idea that you should paint her--she appears to {{consider}} it a sort of bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is lying!" [...] Lenora insisted. [...] "I {{tell you}} there's another {{creature}} there, something we don't understand. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> the Electro-thought transference apparatus; let us read his mind. If I am wrong, I {{will go down}} on my knees and beg for forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see,' {{said the}} young man,'the Marshal's family {{living in the}} country at present, the Marshal has given Miss Dorrit one of the rooms in his house to use when she likes. Don't you think you had better come up there, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> Miss Dorrit?' ...|$|R
