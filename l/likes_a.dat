25|$|Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|E

500|$|... "The Bart Wants What It Wants" [...] was {{directed}} by Michael Polcino and written by John Frink and Don Payne. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February17,2002. Although the episode was written by Frink and Payne, {{the idea for the}} episode was conceived by staff writer Matt Selman, who pitched an episode in which Bart <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> girl because she has [...] "awesome things", while the girl likes him for his personality. Because the Simpsons visit Toronto in the episode, the Fox network decided to promote it as the episode's main focus, even though Canada is not mentioned before the third act. To help promote the episode, Fox requested that the city of Toronto declare February17,2002, the day the episode first aired, to be [...] "The Simpsons Day" [...] and award the Simpson family a key to the city. However, the request was turned down because the city does not allow for-profit companies to receive a key. According to executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean, Fox's request [...] "upset" [...] Canada, and a [...] "sternly worded" [...] editorial in The Toronto Star criticized the network's ways of promoting the episode. The newspaper also credited Canadian The Simpsons staff writers Joel H. Cohen and Tim Long for pitching the episode, but this was refuted in the episode's DVD commentary. While [...] "The Bart Wants What It Wants" [...] features the Simpsons' first travel to Canada, the family would return in two later episodes: season sixteen's [...] "Midnight Rx", where Homer and Grampa visited Winnipeg so they could smuggle cheap medication; and season 21's [...] "Boy Meets Curl", where Marge and Homer travel to Vancouver, so they can participate in the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E

She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend.

[...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E
