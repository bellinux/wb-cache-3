500|$|This attack {{resulted}} in {{an extended period of}} wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a <b>leg</b> <b>brace,</b> had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed [...] "shorter than the other" [...] (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs [...] "Zomby Woof" [...] and [...] "Dancin' Fool"), resulting in chronic back pain. Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.|$|E

500|$|Gardner was {{diagnosed}} with antisocial personality disorder. [...] In June 1985, Gardner pleaded guilty {{to the murder of}} Otterstrom and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At one point, Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a <b>leg</b> <b>brace</b> that would lock if he attempted to escape again. He was advised by guards that it would be to his benefit to behave in front of prospective jurors. District Judge Jay E. Banks instructed the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the option of a verdict for the lesser offense of manslaughter if they found Gardner to be under mental or emotional duress when he shot Burdell. The jurors deliberated less than three hours and found Gardner guilty of capital murder. Ultimately sentenced to death, Gardner selected execution by firing squad over lethal injection. Legislators in Utah had eliminated the firing squad as a method of execution in 2004, but convicts who were sentenced before that date, such as Gardner, could still select that option. Since 1976, only two other people have been executed by firing squad in the United States, both in Utah: Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor. In contrast to Taylor, who said he chose the firing squad to embarrass the state, Gardner's attorney said that his client did not want to attract attention and simply preferred to die this way.|$|E

Nicole Kelly, Miss Iowa, became the first contestant born without part of one arm (her left forearm) and Miss Florida, Myrrhanda Jones, won the preliminary talent competition for her baton twirling routine in the week prior to the Miss America 2014 pageant, despite suffering a torn ACL and MCL in rehearsal {{just a few hours}} prior to her scheduled performance.

Glennie was Byron's first [...] "serious teacher", but also one with whom Catherine Gordon would {{constantly}} squabble, especially over the control of her son's schedule. Catherine's actions alienated her from both Glennie and Lord Carlisle, with Byron unable {{to do anything but}} observe. Regardless of his suffering, Byron was able to perform his [...] "first dash into poetry" [...] in 1800; he wrote a love poem in honour of his cousin, Margaret Parker, [...] "one of the most beautiful of evanescent beings"., and she would inspire another poem two years later when she {{died at the age of}} 15. Byron also refused to let his lameness prevent him from participating in any of the usual physical activities that schoolboys engage in, and on one occasion threw his <b>leg</b> <b>brace</b> into a pond in defiance.|$|E
2500|$|With the Miss America 2014 pageant, held on September 15, 2013, the {{competition}} returned to Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey. Miss New York (Nina Davuluri) won {{the title of}} Miss America. Davuluri {{was also the first}} Indian-American and second Asian-American to win the crown. Shortly after her win, however, Davuluri became the target of xenophobic and racist comments in social media relating the proximity of the event date to the 9/11 anniversary and to anti-Indian sentiment. News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab, associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda, and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas 2013, Theresa Vail, (a soldier who won the [...] "America's Choice" [...] award and was the first contestant to display tattoos during the swimsuit competition). Davuluri said that she was prepared for this backlash because [...] "as Miss New York, I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks", and Vail denounced the social media backlash, offering her support to Davuluri. In addition, a torn ACL and MCL forced Miss Florida 2013, Myrrhanda Jones, to perform her baton routine with a decorated <b>leg</b> <b>brace,</b> while Nicole Kelly (Miss Iowa 2013) was the first contestant without a forearm to compete in the pageant.|$|E

[...] On July 27, 2010 a {{settlement}} was reached. New York City agreed to pay Sean Bell's family $3.25 million. Joseph Guzman, 34, who uses a cane and a <b>leg</b> <b>brace</b> and has four bullets lodged in his body was to receive $3 million, and Trent Benefield, 26, was to receive $900,000. The total amount of the settlement was $7.15 million. Paultre Bell said, [...] "I believe the settlement is fair, {{but the most important}} thing is that our fight, my fight, doesn't end here. No amount of money can provide closure." [...] New York City Corporation Counsel stated, [...] "The city regrets the loss of life in this tragic case, and we share our deepest condolences with the Bell family." [...] The head of the New York City Detectives Endowment Association said he thought the settlement was [...] "a joke". [...] "The detectives were exonerated ... and now the taxpayer is on the hook for $7 million, and the attorneys are in line to get $2 million, without suffering a scratch." [...] Guzman said the settlement did not change the underlying reality that the lives of black and Hispanic men were not worth much in New York; he said that the incident was bound to be repeated.|$|E
