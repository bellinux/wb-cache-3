2500|$|Established in 1975 {{with the}} {{objective}} of giving a thrust to the Malayalam film industry and for nurturing it in the state, the Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC) has succeeded in uprooting the Malayalam film industry from Kodambakkam in Chennai and planting it here. The Chitranjali studio complex, inaugurated in 1980, was the first step towards facilitating the growth of good cinema. Facilities are available for 39 processing and printing 35mm and 16mm colour and black-and-white films. Reduction and blowing up equipments are also available. Nagra recorders, the latest technology to transfer sound from 16mm to 35mm, optical tone magnetic recorders, state-of-the-art video production facilities for non <b>linear</b> <b>editing,</b> and a six-track DTS mixing facility are special facilities of the complex. The recording theatre is equipped with [...] "soundscape" [...] pro-tool work ...|$|E
5000|$|Jack Calaway of Calaway Engineering was {{the first}} to produce a lower-cost, PC-based, [...] "CMX-style" [...] <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> system which greatly {{expanded}} the use of <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems throughout the post-production industry. Following suit, other companies, including EMC and Strassner Editing Systems, came out with equally useful competing editing products.|$|E

5000|$|In 1944, Méliès's widow Jehanne d'Alcy {{claimed to}} the Cinémathèque française that Zecca had [...] "massacred" [...] the film, cutting {{out the best}} scenes, {{including}} one in which pumpkins race each other across a garden. D'Alcy asserted that the editing was deliberate sabotage, intended to ruin Méliès's career. This charge against Zecca was never proven, though the abrupt <b>linear</b> <b>edits</b> do suggest that Zecca's work extended to a reedit of the entire film.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} five of Méliès's last films, The Knight of the Snows was made under {{contract}} with the Pathé Frères. The abrupt <b>linear</b> <b>edits</b> in the film are markedly different from Méliès's usual cutting style, strongly implying that the film, like Cinderella or the Glass Slipper the same year, was completely recut by the Pathé director Ferdinand Zecca before release. The film was released by the Pathé Frères studio in February 1913, and advertised as a féerie fantastique enfantine.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{a vision}} mixer {{would be found}} in a video {{production}} environment such as a television studio, production truck, OB Van or <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> bay of a post-production facility.|$|R
50|$|It houses channel ready TV-studios, a {{radio studio}} and an {{animation}} facility, along with Non- <b>Linear</b> <b>Editing</b> suites.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Linear</b> video <b>editing,</b> using {{video tape}} and is edited {{in a very}} linear way. Several video clips from {{different}} tapes are recorded to one single tape in the order that they will appear.|$|R
50|$|A {{non-linear}} editing system (NLE) is a video (NLVE) or audio editing (NLAE) digital audio workstation (DAW) system that performs non-destructive editing on source material. The name {{is in contrast}} to 20th century methods of <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> and film editing.|$|R
50|$|Sony HDVS is a {{range of}} high-definition video {{equipment}} developed in the 1980s to support an early analog high-definition television system {{thought to be the}} broadcast television systems that would be in use today. The line included professional video cameras, video monitors and <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{non-linear}} editing, {{the original}} source files are not lost or modified during editing. This {{is one of}} the biggest advantages of non-linear editing compared to <b>linear</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
50|$|WMPA {{currently}} utilizes {{a variety}} of recording media/formats including VHS/svhs, DVD, and dv. Editing is conducted on a jvc VHS system or on an abode based non <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Sony and Panasonic {{created their}} {{proprietary}} versions of DV aimed toward professional & broadcast users, which {{use the same}} compression scheme, but improve on robustness, <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> capabilities, color rendition and raster size.|$|E
50|$|Expression Encoder is a {{transcoding}} and <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> program. It {{features a}} {{graphical user interface}} based on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) {{as well as a}} command line interface. It can export videos to H.264 or VC-1 formats or prepare video streams for distribution via Microsoft Silverlight. It supports Silverlight player controls and Silverlight templates.|$|R
50|$|Online editing is a {{post-production}} <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> {{process that}} is performed in {{the final stage of}} a video production. It occurs after offline editing. For the most part, online editing has been replaced by video editing software that operate on non-linear editing systems (NLE). High-end postproduction companies still use the Offline-Online Editing workflow with NLEs.|$|R
5000|$|... ivsEdits is a {{resolution}} independent and [...] "timeline based" [...] video editor, featuring advanced editing tools, realtime effects, LIVE features, like up to 4 Live inputs, Live non <b>Linear</b> Multicamera <b>Editing</b> and remote of DMX Devices (lights, smoke machines, et.c). It supports several file formats and codecs {{as well as}} Blackmagic Design I/O cards and Firewire/iLink OHCI devices.|$|R
50|$|The bulk of <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> is done simply, {{with two}} {{machines}} and an edit controller device to control them. Many video tape machines {{are capable of}} controlling a second machine, {{eliminating the need for}} an external editing control device.|$|E
50|$|Non-linear editing is {{the most}} natural {{approach}} when all assets are available as files on video servers or hard disks, rather than recordings on reels or tapes—while <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> {{is tied to the}} need to sequentially view film or hear tape.|$|E
50|$|The suite {{may have}} an either a Non-linear editing system (NLE) or <b>Linear</b> <b>editing</b> system to control the source and record device. This may be {{internal}} to the color grading device, as in a Pandora's poggle or Da Vinci's 2k or external, as in Da Vinci's TLC (telecine controller).|$|E
50|$|EDLs {{are created}} by offline editing systems, or can be paper {{documents}} constructed by hand such as shot logging. These days, <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> systems have been superseded by non-linear editing (NLE) systems which can output EDLs electronically to allow autoconform on an online editing system - the recreation of an edited programme from the original sources (usually video tapes) and the editing decisions in the EDL.|$|R
50|$|Some U-Matic VCRs {{could be}} {{controlled}} by external video editing controllers, such as the cuts-only Sony RM-440 for <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> systems. Sony and other manufacturers such as Convergence, Calaway, and CMX Systems produced A/B roll systems, which permitted two or more VCRs to be controlled and synchronised for video dissolves and other motion effects, integration of the character generator, audio controllers and digital video effects (DVE).|$|R
50|$|In film, {{this effect}} is usually created with an optical printer by {{controlled}} double exposure from frame to frame. In <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> or a live television production, the same effect is created by interpolating voltages of the video signal. In non-linear video editing, a dissolve is done using software, by interpolating gradually between the RGB values of each pixel of the image. The audio track optionally cross-fades between the soundtracks.|$|R
5000|$|Selecting a {{consistent}} field dominance in vision switching and <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems will maintain color framing synchronization. Re-editing old video material already edited {{with a different}} field dominance convention can be problematic, as {{it can lead to}} [...] "flash fields" [...] when old and new edits are made too close together.|$|E
50|$|A {{video editor}} can also {{refer to a}} {{computer}} device controller that controls video machines to mechanically put pieces of a film together using a 9-Pin Protocol. This is {{also referred to as}} machine to machine or <b>linear</b> <b>editing.</b> Video editors usually use non-linear editing software today to accomplish the task of editing.|$|E
50|$|Broadcast {{automation}} {{systems and}} post-production <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> facilities use RS-422A to remotely control the players/recorders {{located in the}} central apparatus room. In most cases the Sony 9-pin connection is used, which makes use of a standard DE-9 connector. This is a de facto industry standard connector for RS-422 used by many manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Turtle Beach {{began to}} work on {{developing}} its first hardware product, a hard disk based audio editing system. Among {{the first of its}} kind, the product was named the [...] "56K digital recording system" [...] and was released in 1990. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non <b>linear</b> playlist <b>editing</b> of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded.|$|R
50|$|Modern offline video editing is {{conducted}} in a non-linear editing (NLE) suite. The digital revolution has made the offline editing workflow process immeasurably quicker, as practitioners moved from time-consuming (video tape to tape) <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> online editing suites, to computer hardware and video editing software such as Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, Avid, Sony Vegas, Lightworks and VideoPad. Typically, all the original footage (often tens or hundreds of hours) is digitized into the suite at a low resolution. The editor and director are then free to work with all the options to create the final cut.|$|R
50|$|Video editing is {{the process}} of editing {{segments}} of motion video production footage, special effects and sound recordings in the post-production process. Motion picture film editing is a predecessor to video editing and, in several ways, video editing simulates motion picture film editing, in theory and the use of <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> and video editing software on non-linear editing systems (NLE). Using video, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goals of editing is to manipulate these events to bring the communication closer to the original goal or target. It is a visual art.|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{presenting}} difficult characters whose inner desires {{were not}} easily understood, Cassavetes {{paid little attention}} to the “impressionistic cinematography, <b>linear</b> <b>editing,</b> and star-centred scene making” that are fashionable in Hollywood and art films. Instead, he chose to shoot mostly hand held with general lighting or documentary style to accommodate the spontaneity of his actors.|$|E
50|$|CMX also {{developed}} the CMX-300 in 1972, a system used for online editing (and CMX's first online product). It was a computer-controlled <b>linear</b> <b>editing</b> system, with support {{for up to}} four VTRs, and also included and controlled a simple video mixer for wipes and fades. The edits were input to the 300 (and displayed) using a Digital VT-05 terminal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems cannot {{dissolve}} between clips on {{the same}} video tape. Hence, one of these clips {{will need to be}} dubbed onto a new video tape. EDLs designate these occurrences by marking such dissolves' source reels as B-roll of [...] "b-reels". For example, the EDL will change the 8th character of the reel name to the letter B.|$|E
5000|$|When videotapes {{were first}} {{developed}} in the 1950s, {{the only way to}} edit was to physically cut the tape with a razor blade and splice segments together. While the footage excised in this process was not technically [...] "destroyed", continuity was lost and the footage was generally discarded. In 1963, with the introduction of the Ampex Editec, video tape could be edited electronically with a process known as <b>linear</b> video <b>editing</b> by selectively copying (or dubbing) the original footage to another tape called a [...] "master". The original recordings are not destroyed or altered in this process.|$|R
50|$|The program {{emphasizes}} industry-standard equipment {{with a mix}} of <b>linear</b> and nonlinear <b>editing</b> equipment, {{including a}} Leightronix Ultranexus broadcast computer, a MAC Pro Quad Core desktop workstation with Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Production Premium CS6. LUTV broadcast students work with Panasonic AG-HMC150 AVCCAM camcorders and a Newtek Tri-Caster system to support LUTV programming.|$|R
50|$|Besides hard cuts (switching {{directly}} {{between two}} input signals), mixers can also generate {{a variety of}} transitions, from simple dissolves to pattern wipes. Additionally, most vision mixers can perform keying operations and generate color signals (called mattes in this context). Most vision mixers are targeted at the professional market, with newer analog models having component video connections and digital ones using Serial Digital Interface (SDI). They are used in live television with video tape recording (VTR) and video servers for <b>linear</b> video <b>editing,</b> even though the use of vision mixers in video editing has been largely supplanted by computer based Non-linear editing systems (NLE).|$|R
