40|$|The <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> (sometimes {{called the}} tidal efficiency) is often {{neglected}} when simulating the head response in an aquifer to water level changes in lakes and streams. This {{is not appropriate}} when the lake or stream only partially penetrates the aquifer. In such cases, the aquifer extends below the lake or stream and is hydraulically connected through a semiconfining layer of lower permeability. The <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> is the ratio between the instantaneous head response below a lake or stream and the water level change in the lake or stream. In sand and clay, whose particles are not cemented together, the instantaneous head response below a stream or lake is nearly equal to the stage change, and the <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> is close to 1.

The current project has investigated the synthesis and characterization of Fe@Ag NPs followed by their functionalization, with an aim to study the <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> and release kinetics of a standard drug, paracetamol. Spherical Fe@Ag NPs with an average diameter of 39 nm have been synthesized using a solution based synthetic route, employing heterogeneous nucleation on pre-synthesized Fe core NPs. These NPs were functionalized using functional polymers (PNIPAM and Poly Lysine) and a carrier protein, BSA (Bovine serum albumin) and thereafter used to study paracetamol <b>loading.</b> The <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> was optimized with respect to particle concentration and drug concentration, achieving upto 8 % of loading eeficiency.

PMECA particles were prepared using the inverse emulsification polymerization technique. The effects of various formulationparameters such as dispersed phase volume, polymer to drug weight ratio, and surfactant concentration on <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> and size of the prepared particles were investigated. The amount of drug was determined by UV spectrophotometery at 331 nm.

Methods: Cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, colistin, doxycycline, and vancomycin were loaded at 10 and 20 wt% into PLGA MPs using a water-in-oil-in water double emulsion fabrication protocol. Microparticle morphology, size, <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency,</b> release kinetics, and antibiotic efficacy were assessed. Results: The results from this study demonstrate that the chemical nature of loaded antibiotics, especially charge and molecular weight, influence the incorporation into and release of antibiotics from PLGA MPs. Drugs with molecular weights less than 600 Da displayed biphasic release while those with molecular weights greater than 1, 000 Da displayed triphasic release kinetics. Large molecular weight drugs also had a longer delay before release than smaller molecular weight drugs. The negatively charged antibiotic cefazolin had lower <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> than positively charged antibiotics. Microparticle size appeared to be mainly controlled by fabrication parameters, and partition and solubility coefficients did not appear to have an obvious effect on <b>loading</b> <b>efficiency</b> or release.
