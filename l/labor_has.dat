5|$|Whereas the ACT's federal electorates {{have been}} mainly held by Labor, the Liberal Party {{has been able}} to gain some footing in the ACT Assembly, and were in {{government}} for just over eight of the Assembly's 21-year history. Most of this was during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, which ended when Labor gained a 14.1% swing at the polls. In contrast to the state elections, <b>Labor</b> <b>has</b> polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberals at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points.|$|E
5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost <b>labor,</b> <b>has</b> allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E

25|$|As the Philippines {{among other}} {{countries}} who train and export labor repeatedly has faced failures in protecting labor rights the deskilling of <b>labor</b> <b>has</b> increased {{on a global}} scale. A strong worldwide demand for healthcare workers causes many Filipinos to emigrate without ever getting hired or become deskilling while possibly raising their salary. The result is a no-win situation for the sending and receiving country. The receiving countries lose as skilled workers are not fully utilizing their skills while the home country simultaneously experience a shortage of workers in emigrating prone sectors.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan is {{a patriarchal}} society where {{men are the}} primary {{authority}} figures and women are subordinate. Gender {{is one of the}} organizing principles of Pakistani society.

25|$|Political {{support for}} {{same-sex}} marriage has lagged behind public opinion. When marriage was officially restricted to opposite-sex couples by the Commonwealth Parliament in 2004, both the Coalition and the Australian Labor Party voted to prevent same-sex marriage, with the Australian Greens consistently in favour. Since that time, <b>Labor</b> <b>has</b> moved to supporting same-sex marriage (with members bound {{to vote in}} favour from 2019) while a number of Coalition politicians have also expressed their support for same-sex marriage. The political shift in favour of same-sex marriage is attributed to the weakening political influence of social conservatives, including the Australian Christian Lobby.|$|E
25|$|The {{governing}} Liberal and National Coalition {{chose not}} to contest the by-election, as Werriwa had long been considered a safe Labor seat; <b>Labor</b> <b>has</b> held it for all but nine years since 1906. Nevertheless, the by-election received substantial public attention, due to both the surprise nature of Latham's resignation and a brutal Labor preselection battle between two potential candidates. This resulted in the drafting of a compromise candidate, industrial mediator Chris Hayes. Labor increased their margin with 55.4 percent of the primary vote and 70.1 percent of the two-candidate-preferred vote. All of the 15 remaining candidates received a primary vote of less than 10 percent.|$|E
25|$|Ashfield is {{generally}} considered a safe Labor area.

However, the Liberals and Greens have strong voices in the area with the Council electing {{a member of the}} Greens Party as mayor and the northern part of Ashfield represented by a Liberal Party member in the NSW Parliament. Prior to the 1970s, the area was more conservative, generally returning members who were Free Trade, Nationalist, UAP or Liberal although it wasn't unheard of for Labor members to get elected during this period.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} impact of market {{integration}} on union density or on workers themselves, organized <b>labor</b> <b>has</b> been engaged {{in a variety of}} strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation, crop rotation, and {{fertilizers}} {{were introduced}} {{soon after the}} Neolithic Revolution and developed much further in the past 200 years, starting with the British Agricultural Revolution. Since 1900, agriculture in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human <b>labor</b> <b>has</b> been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised political issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement and regenerative agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of <b>Labor</b> <b>has</b> {{sought to}} address {{one of the}} main causes of homelessness, a lack of {{meaningful}} and sustainable employment, through targeted training programs and an increase in access to employment opportunities that can help homeless people to develop sustainable lifestyles. This has included the development of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which addresses homelessness on the federal level in addition to connecting homelesss individuals to resources at the state level. All individuals who are in need of assistance are able, in theory, to access employment and training services under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government, with veterans also being able to use the Veterans Workforce Investment Program.|$|E

25|$|Global {{economic}} change. Global {{economic change}} is one cause for illegal immigration because information and transportation technologies now foster internationalized production, distribution and consumption, and labor. This has encouraged many countries {{to open their}} economies to outside investment, then {{increasing the number of}} low-skilled workers participating in global labor markets and making low-skilled labor markets all more competitive. This and the fact that developed countries have shifted from manufacturing to knowledge-based economies, have realigned economic activity around the world. <b>Labor</b> <b>has</b> become more international as individuals immigrate seeking work, despite governmental attempts to control this migration. Because the United States education system creates relatively few people who either lack a high school diploma or who hold PhDs, {{there is a shortage of}} workers needed to fulfill seasonal low-skilled jobs as well as certain high-skilled jobs. To fill these gaps, the United States immigration system attempts to compensate for these shortages by providing for temporary immigration by farm workers and seasonal low-skilled workers, and for permanent immigration by high-skilled workers.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the larger}} {{societal}} context of Bedouin culture is changing, {{particularly in the}} Negev. For the past several decades, {{the policy of the}} Israeli government has been to move the Negev Bedouin from the desert to official settlements. This has had several significant effects on Negev Bedouin society. Significantly, the move from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one has displaced the Bedouin women from their previously critical economic roles. Moreover, the shift to a sedentary lifestyle means that wage <b>labor</b> <b>has</b> largely replaced agriculture as the main economic structure for the Negev Bedouin. Traditionally, women in Negev Bedouin society were not allowed to work outside the home. This expectation is still in place today. As the Negev Bedouin have shifted away from agriculture, the productive responsibilities have shifted to the men. Meanwhile, the patriarchal system that developed around the traditional economic structure has been maintained. Ultimately, this has resulted in a loss of power within the household for Bedouin women. It is still considered culturally inappropriate for women to interact with strangers (especially strange men), and the men of the family still mediate their families' interactions with society as a whole. The loss of their economic capabilities has meant that Negev Bedouin women are increasingly excluded from decision-making within the household. As a result, the overwhelming majority of important household decisions are made by men.|$|E
