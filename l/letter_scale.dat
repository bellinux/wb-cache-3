25|$|The Bouncer is {{structured}} {{as a series}} of short gameplay segments interspersed with cinematic cutscenes that tell the game's story. With the Active Character Selection (ACS) system, when a cutscene concludes, the player is given the choice to control one of the three protagonists and proceed onto the next gameplay segment. The player then controls this character {{for the duration of the}} level, whilst the other two characters are controlled by the AI. At the conclusion of each gameplay segment, the player is able to spend Bouncer Points (BP), the game's equivalent of experience points, using the Point Exchange System. BPs can be used to boost the character's statistics (health, power and guard) and unlock new fighting moves. Spending BPs allows the character to level up, with their rank graded on a <b>letter</b> <b>scale</b> from G to A, and finally, an S-Rank.|$|E

40|$|SummaryHow {{does the}} human motor system encode our {{incredibly}} diverse motor repertoire in an efficient manner? One possible way of encoding movements efficiently is {{to represent them}} according to their shape/trajectory without regard to their size, by using neural populations that are invariant across scale. To examine this hypothesis, we recorded movement kinematics and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) while subjects wrote three letters in two different scales. A classification algorithm was trained to identify each letter according to its associated voxel-by-voxel response pattern in each of several motor areas. Accurate decoding of letter identity was possible in primary motor cortex (M 1) and anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) regardless of the <b>letter’s</b> <b>scale.</b> These results reveal that large, distributed neural populations in human M 1 and aIPS encode complex handwriting movements regardless of their particular dynamics and kinematics, in a scale-invariant manner...|$|R

The long extenders are remarkable by today’s standards and they immediately brand the type as {{something that would be}} used for large amounts of text. Majoor cites Centaur & Trinité as indirect influences on Seria’s proportions, though there aren’t many similarities to those two in the specifics of its construction. As in Scala, the details of Seria’s forms are frequently novel and surprising but the effect at small sizes is harmonious through-and-through. Majoor describes the idea behind Seria’s unconventional curves (e.g. the counter of the ‘o’ or the arch of the ‘n’) as stemming from the principle of being ‘wittingly irregular’ (he attributes this phrase to Trinité’s designer Bram de Does). The classic example of these witting irregularities may be Dwiggins’s work, but Majoor seems to be an expert at executing the concept digitally. And this is one instance when single-master type design actually works out well: the features that ‘you can’t see small sizes, but that you maybe can feel’ (to quote Majoor) become arresting when the <b>letters</b> <b>scale</b> up.” ...|$|R

We report two letter-identification experiments using critical-band masking. With sufficiently high-amplitude, low- or high-pass masking noise, observers switched to a different range of spatial frequencies for the task.

When an additional white-noise masker was added to the stimulus to flatten the contrast-sensitivity function, the letter channel used by the observer still depended on letter size, further supporting the hypothesis that letter identification is scale dependent...|$|E
