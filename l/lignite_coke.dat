30|$|Catalyst plays a {{significant}} role in slurry-phase hydrocracking, a catalyst with high activity will result in high yield of light fuel oil and low yield of coke. There are two kinds of catalyst for slurry-phase hydrocracking, heterogeneous solid powder catalysts and homogeneously dispersed catalysts [7]. However, the former, such as hematite, <b>lignite</b> <b>coke</b> and red mud [8, 9, 10, 11], was no longer used because of the difficulty in separation and equipment wear caused by the high dosage [12]. Up to now, many homogeneously dispersed catalysts have been studied and developed, which could be formulated as water-soluble catalysts [13, 14, 15, 16] and oil-soluble catalysts [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Homogeneously dispersed catalysts are metal compounds, and the metal is selected from elements of group IV B–VIII among which the molybdenum, nickel, cobalt and chromium are commonly used [22, 23, 24, 25]. The homogeneously dispersed catalyst and feedstock oil were added into the reactor simultaneously, the catalyst was actually a precursor which could be converted to the active metal sulfides through a sulfuration reaction. Many molybdenum compounds were used as homogeneously dispersed catalysts in slurry-phase hydrocracking due to the high hydrogenation activity of MoS 2 [26, 27, 28, 29].|$|E

30|$|Additionally, {{evaporation}} {{in natural}} environments commonly involves other media {{such as water}} and soils. A few studies have explored the effects of mixture with water and adsorption to soil on carbon isotope fractionation (Harrington et al. 1999; Slater et al. 1999; Höhener et al. 2003; Schüth et al. 2003; Bouchard et al. 2008 a, b). No significant carbon isotope fractionation was observed during the equilibrium vaporization of aqueous solution of toluene and trichloroethylene (Slater et al. 1999), the soil adsorption of BTEX (Harrington et al. 1999) and the sorption of halogenated hydrocarbon compounds (trichloroethene, cis-dichloroethene, vinylchloride) and BTEX compounds onto activated carbon, <b>lignite</b> <b>coke,</b> and lignite (Schüth et al. 2003). However, significant fractionation has been observed after passing some volatile organic compounds across alluvial sand (e.g., ∆ 13 Cvapor–liquid is − 2.14  ±  0.22 ‰, − 1.73  ±  0.52 ‰, and − 1.55  ±  0.45 ‰ for n-pentane, n-hexane, and benzene, respectively) (Bouchard et al. 2008 b), and an unsaturated soil zone (Bouchard et al. 2008 a). Therefore, the matrix effects (of both mixing and soil diffusion) on the evaporation fractionation should be better understood prior to utilizing the δ 13 C value of volatile organic compounds.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{contaminated}} waste waters (e. g. wastewater from textile dying processes or dumpsite leachate) have to {{be treated}} because of their high content of poorly biodegradable organics. A treatment process has to provide both a low cost sink for the organic contaminants and a near-complete removal of critical components. Single step processes can achive {{only one of these}} goals. Powdered adsorbents {{have to be}} used in high (i. e. expensiv) quantities for complete COD-removal (chemical oxigen demand) resulting in little loadings of the adsorbent (mass of eliminated contaminant per mass of adsorbent). Basically, nanofiltration (NF) presents a promising alternative for rejecting COD – but a highly concentrated brine is inevitable. For reducing the concentrates high recovery rates / concentration factors and, consequently, high COD concentrations are mandatory. But high concentrations lead to excessive osmotic pressures and thus reduced driving forces in the membrane process – low permeate fluxes need to be compensated with high membrane areas. Furthermore, high concentrations result (constant membrane rejection assumed) in higher permeate COD concentrations. As a result, the reduction of the concentrates is limited because of economical and ecological reasons. By performing adsorption on powdered adsorbents – e. g. <b>lignite</b> <b>coke</b> dust (LCD) or powdered activated carbon (PAC) – in an NF-module a new hybrid process was developed, which avoids the weaknesses of the single step processes while fully using their strengths: NF as a COD and solids barrier and the adsorbent as a cost effective sink for the organic contaminants. It could be proved experimentally that the proposed process enables reduced discharge concentrations, higher recovery rates / concentration factors and improved permeate fluxes compared to conventional nanofiltration applications. Based on experimental investigations in laboratory- and bench scale a plant for the treatment of 10 mä/h dumpsite lechate was designed. This capacity is identical with the size of the installed plant at the dumpsite Alsdorf-Warden from which the leachate for the experiments was taken. The specific treatment costs of the NF with upstream / combined adsorption are with 44 DM/mä approximately 50 % of the treatment costs in Alsdorf-Warden if <b>lignite</b> <b>coke</b> dust is employed. If powdered activated carbon is added to the leachate upstream of the NF an AOX-concentration in the permeate can be reached that is 50 % of the discharge limits at nearly identical treatment costs (46 DM/mä). But if the discharge limit for AOX – that presents the critical parameter for plant design – can already be reached with a traditional NF (without upstream / combined adsorption) this solution is recommended because of the lowest specific treatment costs of 43 DM/m 3...|$|E
40|$|Iron-ore sinter plants, {{according}} to {{studies conducted in}} the years from 1992 to 1995 by the steel industry and the German Federal Environmental Agency, generated during this period a specific PCDF/D emission of 1 - 4 #mu#g I-TEQ/t sinter and accounted for around 95 % of all the dioxin emitted in {{iron and steel making}} in the Federal Republic. Following theoretical investigations and extensive practical preliminary trials on a semi-industrial and industrial scale, various European sinter plant operators have joined together as a working group to test and demonstrate the practicability of the entrained flow process incorporating downstream catalytic oxidation.

The half-yearly trials using an oxidative catalytic converter revealed a sharp drop in catalytic activity, which was attributed {{to the surface of the}} catalytic converter becoming coated with hydrocarbons. The separation efficiency of the catalytic converter fell in the course of the trials from over 60 % (when new) to the point of ineffectiveness.

The interactions that take place and ultimately control ash behavior in fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) systems are controlled by the abundance and association of the inorganic components in coal and by the system conditions.

Fossil fuels remain {{the main source of}} energy for the operation of gas turbines but the recent increase in environmental awareness has influenced government agencies to impose stringent limits on pollutant emissions from power generation plants. Pollutant emissions control {{is one of the major}} challenges for gas turbine designers. In this study, experimental methods and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technologies are used to study the problems that arise when coal derived fuels are used in Gas Turbine Combustors. ^ Gas turbine designers need both experimental data and combustion models to design combustors that are efficient and have low emission characteristics. The trend in industry is towards less reliance in experimental methods and testing and more on numerical methods which would allow for shorter design cycles. The focus of this work is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the instabilities that develop in gas turbine combustors and to map the operability range of a typical combustor for different fuel compositions. The modeling effort in this study will provide a critical insight on the flow-flame interaction through flow visualization techniques and the use of unsteady computational models. The outcomes from the research will provide design tools for developing gas turbine combustors fueled with gasified coal and other hydrogen containing fuels. ^ It is concluded in this study that when the hydrogen content of the fuel mixture is increased, for any given flow rate, the flashback propensity of the combustor increases. It was determined as well that syngas fuel derived from coals containing higher hydrogen content such as Brown and Bituminous are more prone to flashback than syngas derived from <b>Lignite</b> or <b>Coke</b> coal; this conclusion is congruent with the finding that hydrogen content increases the flashback propensity of a fuel mixture. ...|$|R

30|$|Petroleum <b>coke</b> and <b>lignite</b> are two {{important}} fossil fuels {{that have not}} been widely used in China. Petroleum coke–lignite slurry (PCLS), a mixture of petroleum <b>coke,</b> <b>lignite,</b> water, and additives, efficiently utilizes the two materials. In this study, we investigate the effects of the proportion (α) of petroleum coke on slurryability, rheological behavior, stability, and increasing temperature characteristics of PCLSs. The results show that the fixed-viscosity solid concentration (ω 0) increases with increasing α. The ω 0 of lignite-water slurry (LWS, α =  0) is 46.7  %, compared to 71.3  % for the petroleum coke–water slurry (PCWS, α =  100  %), while that of PCLS is in between the two values. The rheological behavior of PCLS perfectly fits the power-law model. The PCWS acts as a dilatant fluid. As α decreases, the slurry behaves first as an approximate Newtonian fluid, and then turns into a pseudo-plastic fluid that exhibits shear-thinning behavior. With increasing α, the rigid sedimentation and water separation ratio (WSR) increase, indicating a decrease in the stability of PCLS. When α is 60 – 70  %, the result is a high-quality slurry fuel for industrial applications, which has high slurryability (ω 0  =  57 – 60  %), good stability (WSR <  2  %), and superior pseudo-plastic behavior (n ≈  0.9).|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 also {{demonstrates}} that α greatly affects the ω 0 of PCLSs. LWS (α =  0) {{had a very}} low ω 0 of 46.7  %, whereas PCWS (α =  100  %) had a high ω 0 of 71.3  %. The values for ω 0 were 50.0, 51.3, 53.2, 55.7, 57.4, 59.8, and 62.2  % for PCLSs with α values of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80  %, respectively. On one hand, this {{may be attributed to}} the well-developed pore structures and high surface areas in lignite. Water is adsorbed on pore surfaces and forms as pore water. Pore water cannot reduce the mutual friction between the solid particles like free water. As a result, lignite is difficult to use in the preparation of highly concentrated slurries. On the other hand, the content of oxygen is up to 16.3  % for lignite, compared to 0.74  % for petroleum <b>coke.</b> <b>Lignite</b> has a large number of hydrophilic functional groups such as –COOH and –OH, resulting in absorption or trapping of large quantities of water by lignite particles. The high amount of inherent moisture cannot flow freely and is therefore unusable as a lubricant. As a result, the solid concentration of LWS (α =  0) is low. However, petroleum coke displays perfect slurryability due to the absence of inherent moisture content. The majority of water can flow freely as lubricant. Thus, the higher the α value, the more mixed petroleum coke there is, which improves the slurryability of PCLSs.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to contribute to the investigation of the physicochemical behaviour of laterite ores during their roasting reduction, in order to optimize the energy requirements of their metallurgical treatment. Roasting reduction constitutes a critical step of the pyrometallurgical treatment of nickeliferous laterites for ferronickel production. The energy requirements for this step are almost 65 % of the total energy required to produce a ferronickel alloy of 12 - 14 % in Ni, {{while at the same time}} this total energy corresponds to a very significant portion of the treatment cost. Therefore, the optimization of roasting reduction contributes significantly to the economics of the metallurgical process through improving its energy efficiency and reducing the frequency of the operational problems in the following step of smelting reduction. Within the framework of the current study, the reducibility of nickeliferous lateritic ores of domestic and foreign origin with a different mineralogical composition as well as the reducibility of the hematite mineral was investigated, giving special emphasis to the study of the rate controlling mechanisms in the various steps of reduction. The reducibility study included reduction experiments with gaseous (CO-N 2) and solid (<b>lignite</b> and <b>coke)</b> reducing agents. The main part of the study was based on the experimental work including standard ASTM reduction tests with a gaseous reducing mixture (CO-N 2), similar with the ASTM tests designed for the determination of the reducibility of iron ores. It comes from the experimental results that reducibility of the Greek nickeliferous laterite ore of intermediate type (ore of Kastoria origin) is significantly higher than that of the rest of the laterite ores examined under the same conditions. That is, reduction degree of Kastoria ore after 90 minutes in the temperatures 650 to 9000 C, was ranging from 62 to 95 %, whereas that of limonitic type of ores from Evia island and Lokrida, as well as an intermediate type of ore from Indonesia, was 26 - 49 %, respectively. This result was verified for the ores in the form of grains (of 6 to 12 mm size), as well as various ore mixtures in the form of pellets. It was also deduced from this study that ore grain size and composition of the gaseous reducing mixture critically affect the results of reduction. Temperature favors the progress of reduction only within the range 650 - 7500 C, whereas its effect is almost negligible within the range 750 - 9000 C. Nevertheless, the effect of temperature is also critical within the range 750 - 9000 C during reduction of laterite ores with a solid reducing agent (lignite). In such a case, it is considered that a temperature increase leads to the higher activation of the solid fuel, i. e. a more intensive reducing atmosphere due to the increased evolution of CO resulting from the gasification of fuel and the decomposition of hydrocarbons contained in its volatile constituents, resulting in an increased rate of reduction. ...|$|R
40|$|The Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) {{has been}} {{conducting}} research on gasification for six decades. One of the objectives of this gasification research has been to maximize carbon conversion and the water–gas shift process for optimal hydrogen production and syngas quality. This research focus and experience were a perfect fit for the National Center for Hydrogen Technology ® (NCHT®) Program at the EERC for improving all aspects of coal gasification, which ultimately aids in the production and purification of hydrogen. A consortia project was developed under the NCHT Program to develop an improved predictive model for ash formation and deposition under the project entitled “Coal Ash Behavior in Reducing Environments (CABRE) III: Development of the CABRE III Model. ” The computer-based program is now applicable to the modeling of coal and ash behavior in both entrained-flow and fluidized-bed gasification systems to aid in overall gasification efficiency. This model represents a significant improvement over the CABRE II model and runs on a Microsoft Windows PC platform. The major achievements of the CABRE III model are partitioning of inorganic transformations between various phases for specific gas cleanup equipment; slag property predictions, including standard temperature–viscosity curves and slag flow and thickness; deposition rates in gasification cleanup equipment; provision for composition analysis for all input and output streams across all process equipment, including major elements and trace elements of interest; composition analysis of deposit streams for various deposit zones, including direct condensation on equipment surfaces (Zone A), homogeneous particulate deposition (Zone B), and entrained fly ash deposition (Zone C); and physical removal of ash in cyclones based on D 50 cut points. Another new feature of the CABRE III model is a user-friendly interface and detailed reports that are easily exportable into Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or as pdf files. The user interface provides stepwise guides with built-in checks for efficient entry of required input data on fuels of interest to allow a successful execution of the model.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is a combustion technology {{where an}} oxygen carrier {{is used to}} transfer oxygen from the combustion air to the fuel, thus avoiding direct contact between air and fuel. Thus, the CO 2 is inherently separated from the flue gases with a considerable lower energy penalty and cost compared to other techniques for CO 2 separation. The oxygen carrier is circulated between two reactors, a fuel and an air reactor, where the flue gas from the air reactor contains only N 2 and some unreacted O 2 and the flue gas from the fuel reactor contains only CO 2 and H 2 O. The water can easily be condensed and the remaining CO 2 can be transported for underground storage. Most of the prior work with CLC has focused on using natural gas and syngas as fuel. However, recent work on adapting the CLC process for solid fuels shows promising results. Two main strategies for achieving this are: 1) using syngas from coal gasification in the fuel reactor and 2) introduction of the coal directly to the fuel reactor where the gasification of the coal and subsequent reactions with the metal oxide particles will occur simultaneously. This paper will focus on this second route, and present results from reactivity investigations in a laboratory fluidized-bed reactor system {{of a number of}} different solid fuels, including three types of bituminous coal, petroleum <b>coke,</b> <b>lignite</b> and char from bio fuel. As oxygen carrier the previously investigated natural mineral ilmenite is used. The experiments were conducted at 970 °C with 92 % steam in the fluidizing gas. The reaction rates were considerably higher compared to investigations using lower steam fractions. The fraction of volatiles in the fuel was found to be important for the conversion rate of the fuel. Furthermore, the presence of an oxygen-carrier was shown to enhance the conversion rate of the intermediate gasification reaction compared with normal gasification performed without the presence of an oxygen carrier. Introduction Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) has been introduced as a technique where the greenhouse gas CO 2 is inherently separated during combustion. The CLC-process is composed of two fluidized bed reactors, an air and a fuel reactor. The fuel is introduced to the fuel reactor where it reacts with an oxygen carrier to CO 2 and H 2 O, reaction (1). The reduced oxygen carrier is transported to the air reactor where it is oxidized back to its original state by air, reaction (2).
