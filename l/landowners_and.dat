5|$|The species {{suffered}} heavy persecution by 18th century European <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> gamekeepers, but withstood {{attempts to}} eradicate it. For example, {{on the estate}} at Sandringham in Norfolk, 1,645 'hawks' were killed between 1938 and 1950, with 1,115 taken between 1919–1926 at Langwell and Sandside in Caithness, Scotland.|$|E

5|$|By mid-2012, {{the merits}} of the ten routes had been considered, {{including}} the economic, environmental and technical issues involved, and a broad outline of the corridor for the link was scheduled to be published in September. After that, consultation with <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> stakeholders took place, to establish the final route, for which design of the channel and the associated locks, bridges, moorings and pumping stations could then begin.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 1832 and the {{introduction}} of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish politics was taken from the hands of <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> a small number of merchants. The Friends of the People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those landed gentry politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.|$|E
5|$|Kozelsk and Starobelsk {{were used}} mainly for {{military}} officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners {{were members of}} other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, <b>landowners,</b> <b>and</b> law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the land}} was in the {{possession}} of large <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> let out to tenant farmers in holdings of less than , often with buildings in a poor state of repair.

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} he {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> industrialists, especially the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall. Most {{of his works}} have survived, particularly his churches. The city of Chester contains {{a number of his}} structures, the most admired of which are his half-timbered black-and-white buildings and Eastgate Clock. The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of Eccleston, Aldford and Pulford.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, <b>landowners,</b> <b>and</b> hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> against state taxes broke out over {{a large part of}} western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions.|$|E

5|$|In New Hampshire {{the timber}} dispute was {{overlaid}} by ongoing disputes between local <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> Samuel Allen, a London merchant who had acquired the territorial {{claims of the}} heirs of John Mason, the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners. Allen, who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692, only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Eastern Han, Emperor Ming passed laws which {{prohibited}} {{those involved in}} agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade. These laws were largely ineffective, since wealthy <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> landlords made significant profits from the trading of goods produced on their estates. Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 AD), a local commandery administrator who later served as an official in the central government's secretariat, started a winery business in his home {{to pay for his}} father's funeral. His fellow gentry criticized him, claiming the practice was immoral, but not illegal.|$|E
5|$|Loyalties in Somerset {{were divided}} {{at the start}} of the First English Civil War; many of the {{prominent}} <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> those living in the countryside favoured King Charles I, but most of the towns, including Taunton, were Parliamentarian, predominantly due to their Puritan beliefs. By August 1642, the town was held by a small Parliamentarian force. In June the following year, Sir Ralph Hopton led his Royalist army, consisting of eighteen regiments equally split between foot and cavalry, out of Cornwall and into Somerset. He forced the surrender of Taunton to the King without engaging in battle, and established a garrison in Taunton Castle.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} capitalise on the new circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence {{and to make the}} strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs.

Despite vigorous opposition from <b>landowners</b> <b>and</b> the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E
