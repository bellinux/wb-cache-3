In 1982 breakfast television commenced on CTC, with a relay of Nine Network programming. Canberra's only commercial television station beginning to more closely resembling a metropolitan station and in 1983 CTC turned 21.

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E
500|$|Sonny and Cher's first album, <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>Us</b> (1965), {{released}} for the Atco Records {{division of}} Atlantic Records, spent eight weeks at number {{two on the}} Billboard 200, behind the Beatles' Help!. Their material became popular, and the duo successfully competed with the dominant British Invasion and Motown sounds of the era. Sonny and Cher charted ten Billboard top 40 singles between 1965 and 1972, including five top-ten singles: [...] "I Got You Babe", [...] "Baby Don't Go", [...] "The Beat Goes On", [...] "All I Ever Need Is You", and [...] "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done". At one point, they had five songs in the top 50 at the same time, a feat equaled only by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40million records worldwide and had become, according to Time magazine's Ginia Bellafante, rock's [...] "it" [...] couple.|$|E

500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E
500|$|Underoath's {{members are}} Christian and {{have stated that}} they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, [...] " [...] in a {{different}} way. We're not like your average Christian band." [...] He explains that Christianity is the [...] "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles." [...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Shannon was {{compared}} to Paris Hilton, and Lost producer Damon Lindelof described her as a [...] "bitch. She is like a typical spoiled daddy's girl who gets whatever she wants and is not responsible to the slightest bit." [...] Eirik Knutzen of The Repository found Shannon to be [...] "a self-centered twit," [...] and she was also called a [...] "spoiled daddy's girl." [...] Boone describes her as a [...] "self-centered little bitch." [...] On her first night on the Island, Shannon is confident they will be rescued, refusing to help the others organize the luggage. She does not care Rose (L. Scott Caldwell) has lost her husband, and spends {{much of her time}} sunbathing. She manipulates Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) into catching a fish for her, after which Boone apologizes on behalf of Shannon for [...] "using this poor guy like [...] use everyone else." [...] In [...] "Whatever the Case May Be," [...] Boone says to Shannon, [...] "Don't you see the way they <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just – you're useless." [...] This motivates her to help Sayid translate maps he obtained from Rousseau.|$|E

500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father was crying and did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E

We want {{to be engaged in}} Asia; we want to partner with Asia;" [...] The EUHRVP endorsed the Atlanticism suggestion from the German Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen ("We partly gave up national sovereignty but we gained way more political and economic power for that.") that Asian states follow the European model of common defense and security; even as NATO is facing its toughest challenges yet, the Eurozone primed and poised for a financial fire-storm (burden of sovereign debt repayments in the PIGS countries), and populist support for Eurosceptic political parties on the rise within member States of the European Union.|$|E
