50|$|Active phloem loading {{requires}} less carbon, allowing carbon allocation {{to other}} sinks in the plant, such as growth. Active phloem loading allows for higher growth potential. Herbaceous plants {{have a relatively}} high growth rate and many are active phloem loaders. Active loaders {{tend to have a}} high hydraulic conductivity and low solute concentrations, while passive loaders have high solute concentrations and a <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity. Trees also exhibit high solute concentrations and <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity and thus are thought to be passive loaders. Based on early research, scientists correlated herbaceous species with active loading and trees and other woody species with passive loading. However, in 2011, Davidson et al. examined the correlation between growth from and phloem-loading strategy. They found that a loose association exists but not a definitive correlation. Some trees exhibit active loading, while some herbs exhibit passive loading, and many species have mechanisms of both.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners for the confinement of waste disposal facilities mainly {{depends on the}} {{hydraulic conductivity}} of the core bentonite clay encased between the two geotextiles.

Even though sodium bentonite has the <b>lowest</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity to water, calcium bentonite is widely used because of low cost and availability. This research concerns the evaluation of the treatment of calcium bentonite with an anionic polymer, Sodium CarboxyMethyl Cellulose (Na-CMC) with HYPER clay technology. Permeability tests were performed in order to compare HYPER clay behaviour to the standard sodium activation treatment of calcium bentonite. Increasing concentrations of calcium dichloride, 5 mM – 100 mM – 200 mM, were used as hydrating solutions.

25|$|Differences in {{hydraulic}} head (h) cause water {{to move from}} one place to another; water flows from locations of high h to locations of <b>low</b> h. <b>Hydraulic</b> head is composed of pressure head (ψ) and elevation head (z).

50|$|Porosity can be {{proportional}} to hydraulic conductivity; for two similar sandy aquifers, {{the one with}} a higher porosity will typically have a higher hydraulic conductivity (more open area for the flow of water), {{but there are many}} complications to this relationship. The principal complication is {{that there is not a}} direct proportionality between porosity and hydraulic conductivity but rather an inferred proportionality. There is a clear proportionality between pore throat radii and hydraulic conductivity. Also, there tends to be a proportionality between pore throat radii and pore volume. If the proportionality between pore throat radii and porosity exists then a proportionality between porosity and hydraulic conductivity may exist. However, as grain size or sorting decreases the proportionality between pore throat radii and porosity begins to fail and therefore so does the proportionality between porosity and hydraulic conductivity. For example: clays typically have very <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity (due to their small pore throat radii) but also have very high porosities (due to the structured nature of clay minerals), which means clays can hold a large volume of water per volume of bulk material, but they do not release water rapidly and therefore have <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{savings that}} can be {{achieved}} with ATES are strongly depending on the geology of a site. Mainly, ATES requires the presence of a suitable aquifer that is able to accept and yield water. Therefore, thick (>10 m) sandy aquifers are selected. Natural groundwater flow may transport (part of) the stored energy outside of the capture zone of a well during the storage phase. To reduce advective heat loss, aquifers with a <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> gradient are preferred. In addition, gradients in geochemical composition should be avoided, as mixing of water with different geochemistry can increase clogging, which will reduce the performance of a well and lead to increased maintenance costs.|$|E

The system shows two aquifers with one aquitard (a confining or impermeable layer) between them, surrounded by the bedrock aquiclude, which is in contact with a gaining stream (typical in humid regions). The water table and unsaturated zone are also illustrated. An aquitard is a zone within the earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another. An aquitard can sometimes, if completely impermeable, be called an aquiclude or aquifuge.

30|$|In Peninsular India, all {{the hard}} rock true hydrographs show a {{predominant}} annual cycle {{in response to the}} wet and dry season. With the onset of monsoon, throughout the monsoon the curve form rising limb and once the monsoon retrieve the curve starts forming recession limb, which continue until the next monsoon (annual cycle). Successive annual cycles join together to form long-term hydrograph. With the full knowledge of fluctuation of groundwater level, the hydraulic conductivity/filtration conditions can be calculated by analyzing recession curve of well hydrograph (Ferdowsian et al. 2001; Gailuma and Vitola 2009; Posavec et al. 2006; Sujono et al. 2004). The rapid decline in recession curve corresponds to better filtration conditions (Gailuma and Vitola 2009). Therefore, it can be stated comparatively that the U shape curves correspond to better hydraulic conductivity (k) than the V shape, whereas the S shape curves represents the <b>lowest</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity of the aquifer. So, based on hydraulic conductivity (k) aquifers can be classified as U > V > S type curve. In the Peninsular hard rock V type is more abundant over U type, while S type is the least abundant type since it largely corresponds to aquicludes.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To observe whether {{injection}} of medicine into <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> resistance point along meridian brings about higher medicinal effect {{and to explore}} {{the efficacy of the}} theory that meridians are made up of channels featuring <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> resistance by observing the diuretic effect of injecting furosemide or saline into the <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> resistance point Shuifen (CV 9), vein and Zusanli (St 36) respectively. Methods: Acute edema was induced in pigs by rapid intravenous {{injection of}} 2 000 ml normal saline. The pigs were divided into four groups: Shuifen (CV 9) injection of half dose furosemide group (SFF group), intravenous injection of full dose furosemide group (VF group), Zusanli (St 36) injection of full dose furosemide group (ZSLF group), and Shuifen (CV 9) injection of half dose normal saline group (SFS group). The accumulated urine quantity and the urine quantity generated in every 15 -minute period were measured in each group respectively, every 15 minutes after injection, and the measurement lasted for two hours at one experiment. Each group involved eight times of experiments with one pig used for one experiment, which means the whole observation involved 32 times of experiments. Results: The accumulated urine quantities observed in both SFF group and VF group were higher than those in the ZSLF group and the SFS group all through the measurement, showing significant differences during the period from the 15 th minute to the 45 th minute (P＜ 0. 05). But no significant difference was observed between the SFF group and the VF group during the whole 2 -hour measurement (P＞ 0. 05). Analysis of urine quantity generated in every 15 -minute period showed that diuretic effect climaxed during the 15 th minute to the 30 th minute in both SFF group and VF group. By contrast, ZSLF group reached diuresis climax during the 45 th minute to 60 th minute and no diuresis climax was observed in the SFS group all through the measurement. Conclusion: Injection of medicine into <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> resistance point along meridian generates faster and more powerful medicinal potency, and this is likely to be applied to clinical practice. The theory that meridians are channels featuring <b>low</b> <b>hydraulic</b> resistance is important to the elucidation of meridian...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh-resolution near-wall {{fluorescent}} microparticle image velocimetry (μ-PIV) {{was used}} in mouse cremaster muscle venules in vivo to measure velocity profiles in the red cell-depleted plasma layer near the endothelial lining. μ-PIV data of the instantaneous translational speeds and radial positions of fluorescently labeled microspheres (0. 47 μm) in an optical section through the midsagittal plane of each vessel {{were used to determine}} fluid particle translational speeds. Regression of a linear velocity distribution based on near-wall fluid-particle speeds consistently revealed a negative intercept when extrapolated to the vessel wall.

The extent of plasma flow retardation through the layer required to be consistent with our μ-PIV data results in near complete attenuation of fluid shear stress on the endothelial-cell surface.

40|$|Various {{methods for}} {{predicting}} recharge mounds that form beneath basins during recharge {{and the subsequent}} decay after recharge stops have been developed over the past half a century. In this paper several analytical methods were compared for very rapid, rapid and moderately rapid hydraulic conductivity values. Subsequently, the results were matched with numerical methods. Results obtained indicate minimal deviations among analytical solutions for predicting infiltration mounds at low recharge time (≤ 50 days). In addition, the deviations can be easily amended. Numerical solutions predict higher infiltration mounds (up to 32 % for the results chosen) compared to analytical methods, a variation attributed to the fewer assumptions made when solving governing groundwater equations. Yet at the <b>lowest</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity rate (1. 6 m/day) used in this investigation, numerical solutions are comparable to analytical solutions. Despite general unanimity on the superiority of numerical over analytical solutions for predicting infiltration mounds; the two methods have not been tested with observed field data.

40|$|The first mirror (M 1) as an {{important}} part of the CXRS diagnostic system is responsible for acquisition and transportation of the optical signal of required quality from the ITER plasma to detectors. At the same time, the M 1 is the most vulnerable component of this system working in drastic and severe conditions caused by its location in the direct view of the plasma. To minimize impurities deposition and guarantee the required lifetime for M 1 its temperature shall be maintained within the operational range of 350 +/- 50 degrees C. The computation of M 1 of the reference CXRS design demonstrates that, firstly, helium is the best candidate among the analyzed gases (He, N- 2, Ar) to be used as a coolant to maintain the M 1 temperature in the required operational range of 350 +/- 50 degrees C giving the highest heat transfer coefficient and the <b>lowest</b> <b>hydraulic</b> losses at moderate flow rates (v(gas) = 40 - 60 m/s) and, secondly, optimization of the cooling channels configuration together with an increase in the gas velocity and/or with heat transfer intensifiers makes it possible to provide the required M 1 temperature conditions.
