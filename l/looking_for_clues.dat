5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E

25|$|Israel's {{national}} air carrier, El Al, {{is widely regarded}} as the safest airline in the world, and no flight leaving Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport has ever been hijacked. One exceptional method used in Israeli airport security is that security agents personally converse with each passenger, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> that the person is a terrorist or is being unwittingly used by terrorists. Other measures include reinforced cockpit doors and an air marshal on every flight.|$|E

5000|$|This game {{is made in}} {{the style}} of 10 Gnomes. It {{consists}} of black-and-white photographs of Gdansk, Poland that the player can zoom in on to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues.</b> The player finds that 2011 {{is in the form of}} a gnome.|$|R

500|$|In the episode, VanWinkle draws {{parallels}} between Scully and Tithonus' lover Aurora. In the end, both will [...] "continue [...] ending and invariable office"—in the former's case, investigating crimes, {{and in the}} latter's case, raising the dawn. The themes of immortality and escaping death were later revisited in the eight season episode [...] "The Gift". In the episode, Agent John Doggett, played by Robert Patrick, is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> following Mulder's abduction. Without Scully, he travels to Pennsylvania and seeks out a soul eater: a being that can consume another person's injuries. In the end, Doggett is fatally shot, and the soul eater, wishing to die, consumes Doggett's death. VanWinkle argues that this episode serves as a direct parallel to [...] "Tithonus", although it switches the perspective significantly.|$|E
500|$|Palpatine's {{role in the}} prequel films {{required}} McDiarmid to play {{two dimensions}} of the same character. Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace, McDiarmid stated, [...] "Stepping onto the set of Episode I {{for the first time}} was like going back in time, due to my experience in Jedi. Palpatine's an interesting character; he's conventional on the outside, but demonic on the inside [...] he's on the edge, trying to go beyond what's possible." [...] McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones. He noted, [...] " [...] is a supreme actor. He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a schizophrenic fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional [...] and for those who are <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues,</b> that's almost where you can see them." [...] McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padmé Amidala is almost assassinated: ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Crosetti and Lewis <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> {{in a dark}} alley. Levinson and Attanasio {{specifically}} wanted a dialogue-driven prologue scene that did not immediately clarify {{the fact that the}} two men were detectives or what they were looking for. The dialogue and staging of the scene were imitated in the final scene of the last Homicide episode, [...] "Forgive Us Our Trespasses", which aired on May 21, 1999. In that final scene, Detective Rene Sheppard (played by Michael Michele) says to Lewis, [...] "Life is a mystery, just accept it", a line spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Lewis also said, [...] "That's what's wrong with this job. It ain't got nothin' to do do with life", a line also spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Early scenes in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] also involved Giardello introducing rookie detective Bayliss to the homicide unit. Attanasio sought to use Bayliss' orientation as a way of introducing exposition and background about the show to the viewer as well.|$|E
50|$|For {{a higher}} level of confidence, some feature tests will attempt to invoke the feature then <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> that it behaved properly. For example, a test for support for cookies might attempt to set a value as a cookie and then verify it can be read back.|$|R

50|$|The film jumps ahead six months. Tenchi's {{family and}} friends have been searching in vain for him, and the stress is building. His father Nobuyuki has filed a missing-person report, Mihoshi and Kiyone have {{infiltrated}} the Science Academy to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues,</b> Sasami has returned to Jurai, and Ryoko and Ayeka have moved to Tokyo to continue the search.|$|R
500|$|The {{bodies of}} the three men were cremated in 1930 without further {{examination}} upon being returned to Sweden. The question of what, exactly, caused their deaths has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars. Several medical practitioners and amateur historians have read the extensive diaries with a detective's eye, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> in the diet, for telltale complaints of symptoms, and for suggestive details at the death site. They agree on many particulars. For instance, the explorers {{are known to have}} eaten mainly scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from the balloon stores, plus huge portions of half-cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals. They suffered often from foot pains and diarrhea, and were always tired, cold, and wet. When they moved on to Kvitøya from the ice, they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside the tent, and even down by the water's edge, as if they were too exhausted, indifferent, or ill to carry it further. Strindberg, the youngest, died first and was [...] "buried" [...] (wedged into a cliff aperture) by the others. However, the interpretation of these observations is contested.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of that fellowship in November 2013, Bauer took up the role of Research Astronomer at the AAO. Her area of research investigates the processes by which galaxies form, and particularly why they eventually stop creating new stars. [...] In order to explore how galaxies build into the diverse structures we see today, she analyzes systematic surveys {{of hundreds of thousands}} of galaxies, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> that indicate what physical processes regulate the rates at which new stars are formed in galaxies which are subjected to different conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{headless}} body of {{an unidentified}} male {{was found in}} a boxcar in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on July 1, 1936. Three headless victims were found in boxcars near McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, on May 3, 1940. All bore similar injuries to those inflicted by the Cleveland killer. Dismembered bodies were also found in the swamps near New Castle between the years 1921 and 1934 and between 1939 and 1942. In September 1940 an article in the New Castle News refers to the killer as [...] "The Murder Swamp Killer". The almost identical similarities between the victims in New Castle to those in Cleveland, Ohio, coupled with the similarities between New Castle's Murder Swamp and Cleveland's Kingsbury Run, both of which were directly connected by a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, were enough to convince Cleveland Detective Peter Merylo that the New Castle murders were the work of the [...] "Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run". Merylo was convinced the connection was the railroad that ran twice a day between the two cities; he often rode the rails undercover <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> to the killer's identity.|$|E
50|$|Sticky I was on air for one year(2008) {{where there}} was a small mystery in which two teams {{consisting}} of 2-3 people had to solve.

The woman {{turns out to be}} Sikes' mistress, an affair the FBI knew about.|$|R
50|$|The {{identity}} of the sitter remains uncertain and art historians have <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> in the pattern in her sleeve. Undoubtedly a heraldic design, its three palm leaves, with two dark feathers bound by ribbon, would have represented the coat of arms of her family or her suitor's. Given the finery of her costume and jewels, she was almost certainly a noblewoman.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{they were}} puzzled that {{security}} camera footage {{did not show}} Le exiting the building at Amistad Street, police closed the whole building for investigation. Police also searched through refuse at the Hartford dump, where Yale's garbage is incinerated, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> as to Le's whereabouts. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Haven Police Department and the Connecticut State Police were all involved in the search. On Sunday, September 13, her planned wedding date, authorities discovered Le's body in a cable [...] inside {{the wall of a}} basement laboratory in the Amistad Street building. Bloody clothes had previously been found above a ceiling tile in the same building. The building and the area are monitored by about 75 security cameras and the entrance to the building and the rooms inside the building require Yale ID cards in order to be opened and accessed. The basement where Le's body was found houses animals (mostly mice) that are used for experiments and research. Due to the high security measures in the building, authorities and Yale officials maintained that it would be extremely difficult for someone without a Yale identification card to enter the basement laboratory where Le's body was discovered, leading them to focus their investigation on Yale employees and students.|$|E
2500|$|Callum then {{explains}} {{that he wants to}} find his real mother and tell her that he hates her, which devastates Sonya. She tells her sister that she cannot tell him the truth now as she cannot handle him looking at her, knowing what she did. Callum steps up his investigation into the identity of his mother and is injured in an accident while <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues.</b> At the hospital, he recalls a memory about his mother and realises that she is Sonya. Toadie then [...] "angrily orders" [...] Sonya to leave. Of the revelation, Morey said [...] "For Toadie, it's a betrayal to both him and his son. He's angry, but his initial priority is to make Callum number one." [...] Morey quipped that filming the scenes was [...] "exhausting." [...] The actress also explained that Toadie's reaction to finding out that Sonya is Callum's real mother was one of devastation, he has to question whether Sonya ever loved him or was only with him to get Callum. Morey told a writer for What's on TV that it had been [...] "fun" [...] to see Sonya change when she could finally be a mother to Callum. She added that Sonya would probably struggle with everything that happened with Callum, but she should remember that she has been forgiven.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, Kay was {{watching}} the sixth [...] hour of The Today Show (an apparent jab at NBC's decision to extend it {{at the expense of}} the Passions timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV and she would have to tell her friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to Passions itself. At the beginning of the show's final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if she was sure she wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could [...] "keep up on everything happening in Harmony." [...] And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the [...] "audience" [...] in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, [...] "Audience? What audience?" [...] Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to Passions, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe ("Nope, not even close!"). In May 2008 while Juanita was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of Hidden Passions. In [...] June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of Today being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.|$|E
