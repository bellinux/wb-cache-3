50|$|The Swiss Campaign to Ban <b>Landmines</b> (the Swiss Campaign or SCBL) is {{a member}} of the International Campaign to Ban <b>Landmines</b> (ICBL). It is an {{umbrella}} organisation composed of about 50 Swiss NGOs gathered around the common objective of banning antipersonnel <b>landmines</b> and similar indiscriminate weapons (such as cluster munitions or anti-vehicle <b>landmines).</b> At the national level, the Swiss Campaign to Ban <b>Landmines</b> successfully advocated in favor of a national ban of antipersonnel <b>landmines</b> and of Switzerland’s signature and ratification of the Ottawa Treaty in 1995-1997. Within the ICBL, the Swiss Campaign was a member of the Non State Actors Working Group, which it co-chaired until the end of 2004.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{countries}} affected by <b>landmines</b> which present {{a major threat}} to lives and cause economic problems. <b>Landmines</b> are harmful because of their unknown positions and often difficult to detect. The development of new demining technologies is difficult because of the tremendous diversity of terrains and environmental conditions in which mines are laid and also because of the wide variety of <b>landmines.</b> Currently, detecting and clearing mines demand specific expertise with special equipment. This paper presents different techniques used for <b>landmines</b> detection. It discusses the strategies that can enable the robot to detect mines by means of sensors. This paper deals also with the processing of the fused information from different sensors to guide soldiers when passing <b>landmines.</b> The purpose is to give an overview of the <b>landmines</b> detection techniques by using the autonomous robots which are capable of exploring and detecting buried <b>landmines</b> and marking their locations...|$|R
5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had stumbled into a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a <b>landmine,</b> breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another <b>landmine,</b> Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, a <b>landmine</b> {{exploded}} {{near the}} south {{aisle of the}} cathedral, resulting in {{the roof of the}} nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{has been}} accused by several {{newspapers}} of having embellished her life story. A journalist with the same name, Heather Mills, at that time at The Observer, accused Mills of impersonating her {{for over a year}} in the late 1990s, showing people cuttings of articles the journalist had written, which helped Mills secure a job presenting The General, a BBC TV programme about Southampton General Hospital. There were also doubts about Mills's claim that she had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, because the Heather Mills Health Trust had given away thousands of prosthetic limbs to <b>landmine</b> victims, but the nomination cannot yet be proven because the identities of all nominees remain secret for 50 years.|$|E

The Hero won the 2005 Sundance World Dramatic Cinema Jury Grand Prize. A joint Angolan, Portuguese, and French production, The Hero was filmed entirely in Angola.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few days}} out of the line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a <b>landmine.</b> Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|Broadcasting House {{was first}} used by the BBC on 2 May 1932, and total {{construction}} costs were £350,000. It was too small for all services, and St George's Hall, next to All Souls, was used for variety broadcasts until it was demolished during the Blitz. On 15 October 1940, the building took a direct hit, killing seven people, and later that year a <b>landmine</b> exploded on Portland Place, causing widespread fires in Broadcasting House. Despite the damage, it survived the war {{and became one of}} the best known buildings associated with radio broadcasting. Subsequently, the BBC expanded with additional studios at Maida Vale, followed by the former headquarters of BBC Television, BBC Television Centre at Wood Lane. In the 2000s, Broadcasting House was expanded to include a new wing and modernise the site, replacing earlier extensions. It was designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Originally named the Egton Wing, it was renamed to the John Peel Wing in 2012, in memory of the radio broadcaster.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942, South West Pacific Area, {{became aware}} of the {{resistance}} movements forming in occupied Philippines through attempted radio communications to Allies outside of the Philippines; by late 1942, couriers had made it to Australia confirming the existence of the resistance. By December 1942, SWPA sent Captain Jesús A. Villamor to the Philippines to make contact with guerrilla organizations, eventually developing extensive intelligence networks including contacts within the Second Republic Government. In addition, through the Allied Intelligence Bureau's Philippine Regional Section, SWPA began to send operatives, and equipment, into the Philippines to make contact and supply guerrilla organizations. Unique to other guerrillas in the Philippines were the Wa Chi; a resistance unit composed of Filipino-Chinese and Chinese immigrants. They were established to counter the Japanese suspicion and abuse of the Chinese living in the country, and had over 700 men strong. The movement was aided by the American guerrilla forces and were also supported by anti-Japanese civilians and farmers living in the outskirts. In Nueva Ecija, guerrillas led by Juan Pajota and Eduardo Joson protected the U.S. Army Rangers and Alamo Scouts who were conducting a rescue mission of Allied POWS from a counterattack by Japanese reinforcements. Pajota and the Filipino guerrillas received Bronze Stars for their role in the raid. Among the guerrilla units, the Blue Eagles were a specialized unit established for <b>landmine</b> and sniper detection, as well as in hunting Japanese spies who have blended in with the civilian population.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} demilitarised {{following}} {{the arrival of}} the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to implement the Vance plan and ceasefire to stabilise the areas affected by the fighting until a political settlement was reached. The area adjacent to the Pakrac–Požega road, especially around Kusonje, remained unsafe. There were numerous attacks along the road, resulting in deaths and injuries. These included an attack on a Croatian police patrol on 5 August 1993, which left four policemen dead and another four wounded. In September 1993, Croatian authorities placed a commemorative plaque {{at the site of the}} 1991 ambush and planned a wreath laying ceremony to mark the second anniversary of the event. At 10:20 on 8 September, while the ceremony was in progress, a <b>landmine</b> exploded at the site killing three and injuring eleven. The wounded included one Argentinian member of UNPROFOR. Those killed were members of the ZNG 105th Brigade. The incident, described by the Croatian authorities as an act of terrorism, came on the heels of a series of artillery bombardments and sabotages that resulted in the Croatian government losing its patience with the situation. This contributed to the launching of Operation Medak Pocket the following day.|$|E

40|$|Buried <b>landmines</b> are {{difficult}} to find because they are designed for concealment. These small, low-tech devices appear {{with a wide variety}} of designs and materials of construction, and can barely be differentiated from stones, roots, and scrap material in the ground. Yet, they always contain an explosive—most typically, TNT. The simplicity of <b>landmines</b> is thus the greatest challenge for those researchers attempting to develop new or improved methods for detection. Detection of <b>landmines</b> is, however, only part of the problem. We know that only a small percentage of land typically contains mines. Up to 90 percent of mine-suspected areas could be released and given back to local societies if we knew where the <b>landmines</b> were not buried. The humanitarian demining challenge is therefore twofold: Detect the areas that are free from <b>landmines</b> for immediate release (area reduction). Determine the exact location of <b>landmines,</b> enabling removal or destruction. New or improved technology must also satisfy most or all of the following criteria to improve humanitarian demining: Help accelerate the demining process...|$|R
