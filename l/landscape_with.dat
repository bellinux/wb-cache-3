5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, was totally {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> deeply carved river valleys.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a large bony frill {{and three}} horns on its large four-legged body, and {{possessing}} similarities {{with the modern}} rhinoceros, Triceratops {{is one of the}} most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid.

5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E
5|$|During Ruisdael's last period {{he began}} to depict {{mountain}} scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded <b>Landscape</b> <b>with</b> a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses {{all but two of}} them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Navenby was an {{agricultural}} village {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, but the outbreak of the First World War brought changes for the community. A small airfield, Wellingore Heath, was opened on land bordering Navenby in 1917, to provide a base for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The flat <b>landscape,</b> <b>with</b> its cliff-top situation, proved an ideal situation for flight operations.|$|E

50|$|Jan Tilens was a {{landscape}} specialist. His works are typically rocky <b>landscapes</b> <b>with</b> figures depicting mythological scenes or contemporary travellers. Although he never visited Italy he painted some Italiniate <b>landscapes</b> <b>with</b> antique monuments {{in the style}} of the Flemish painter Paul Bril who was active in Rome.|$|R
5000|$|Adriaen Frans Boudewijns (Brussels, 3 October 1644 [...] - [...] Brussels, 3 December 1719) was a Flemish {{landscape}} painter, draughtsman and etcher. He {{was known}} mainly for his <b>landscapes</b> <b>with</b> trees, Italianate <b>landscapes</b> <b>with</b> architecture and river and village views city, coast and country views and architectural scenes.|$|R
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous <b>Landscape</b> <b>with</b> a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E
5|$|Some Scots {{settled in}} the country's more {{temperate}} regions, where the climate and the forested <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while English and Welsh made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as merchants, tradesmen and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{embedded}} within an ornamental <b>landscape,</b> <b>with</b> two gardens laid {{out at the}} same time as the castle was founded and a third created later. Wressle was intended as a high-status residence rather than a fortress and was never besieged. However, it was held by Parliament during the English Civil War and demolished in 1646–50. Nearly 150 years later, it was further damaged by fire and all that remains above ground of the building is the south range.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was {{bought at the}} Summer Exhibition by the Marquess of Stafford. It was sold in 1908, long after Etty {{had fallen out of}} fashion, for a substantial loss, and sold again in 1937 for a further substantial loss to the Southampton City Art Gallery, where it remains. Another work by Etty, sold as A Bacchanalian Scene in 1830 and later renamed <b>Landscape</b> <b>with</b> Figures, was identified in 1953 as a preliminary oil sketch for The World Before the Flood and purchased by the York Art Gallery. The two paintings were exhibited together as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created by}} Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the most recent, widely accepted one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that it was cut from a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River <b>Landscape</b> <b>with</b> Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{semi-arid}} high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests; {{the region}} has a rolling to flat <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains. Partial plains interrupted by small, sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma; transitional prairie and oak savannahs cover the central portion of the state. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction.|$|E

5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local <b>landscape,</b> <b>with</b> roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XI is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG), and {{differs from}} previous {{titles in the}} series in several ways. Unlike the predefined main characters of previous Final Fantasy titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender, facial style, hair color, body size, job, and nation allegiance. Also diverging from previous games in the series, the game {{takes place in a}} fully three-dimensional <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> enemies freely roaming in it, allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the random encounters used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered Final Fantasy title since.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the <b>landscape,</b> <b>with</b> the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and {{have not been able to}} incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E
5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main {{goals is to}} map the Martian <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E
5|$|Mao {{was born}} on December 26, 1893 in his {{familiar}} home in the rural village of Shaoshanchong in Xiangtan county, Hunan Province, part of south-central China. Typical of many Hunanese villages, Shaoshanchong was situated in a narrow valley surrounded by mountains. Both the village and the nearest town, Shaoshan, were named for the local Shaoshan Mountain ("Music Mountain"), a prominent feature in the local <b>landscape</b> <b>with</b> sacred associations for the region's Buddhists. The village was inhabited by many individuals with the surname of Mao; the Mao clan traced their lineage back to Mao Taihua, a warrior from Jiangxi Province who had moved to Xiangtan county in the mid-fourteenth century after fighting for Zhu Yuanzhang's military campaign to overthrow the Mongol-governed Yuan dynasty.|$|E
