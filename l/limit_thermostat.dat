50|$|Most new {{snowmelt}} systems {{operate in}} conjunction with an automatic activation device that will turn on the system on when it senses precipitation and freezing temperatures and turn off the system when temperatures are above freezing. These types of devices ensure the system is only active during useful periods and reduces energy waste. A high <b>limit</b> <b>thermostat</b> further increases efficiency when installed {{in conjunction with}} the automatic snow melt controller to temporarily disable the system once the slab has reached a sufficient snow melting temperature. Some building codes require the high <b>limit</b> <b>thermostat</b> to prevent energy waste. Though their total environmental impact depends on their energy source. Current systems are more cost effective in the long run than continual salt dumping and removal, and reduce waste by extending the life of the concrete.|$|E

30|$|The control {{algorithm}} also modifies the thermostats’ limits {{to improve performance}} in case of prolonged frequency deviations and contains a temperature feedback loop to achieve robustness {{in the case of}} biased frequency deviations. The <b>thermostat</b> <b>limits</b> are modified by incorporating an additional stochastic layer, to overcome practical limitations in the thermostat resolution [12]. These control actions do not substantially affect the behaviour of the aggregation as far as controllability is concerned, since they act on a much larger time scale. In the following section, we extend the method of [12] to improve the estimations of the locked fractions of the population estimation.|$|R

This dynamics extends the physical Hamiltonian dynamics {{by the addition of}} a ‘thermostat' variable, which is coupled nonlinearly with the physical variables. The accuracy of the method depends on the dynamics being ergodic. Numerical experiments have been published earlier that are consistent with non-ergodicity of the dynamics for some model problems. The authors recently proved the non-ergodicity of the Nosé–Hoover dynamics for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. In this paper, this result is extended to non-harmonic one-dimensional systems.

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats {{have a high}} limit temperature and a low <b>limit.</b> If the <b>thermostat</b> is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the high limit. The high limit exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the low limit, ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The low limit is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water. Many aquastats also have a differential ("diff") control which determines the size of the range around the [...] "low" [...] and/or [...] "high" [...] controls.|$|R
