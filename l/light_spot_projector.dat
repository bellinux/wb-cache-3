Bristol and Capitol), different fungicide treatments, on plants sampled at different dates. Regression analyses {{on data from}} these experiments showed that there were consistently good relationships between % leaves with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> and % plants with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> for plants sampled during the autumn and winter, until the % plants with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> approached 100 %. The slopes and positions of regression lines were sometimes affected by cultivar, fungicide treatment or sampling date, but not by site. The relationship between % leaf area with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> (square root-transformed) and % leaves with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> was less consistent than that between % leaves with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> and % plants with <b>light</b> leaf <b>spot</b> and was sometimes affected by cultivar, fungicide treatment or sampling date but not by site.

40|$|When a <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> is flashed {{repeatedly}} during sac-cade, a {{dotted line}} called a phantom array (PA) is perceived. When <b>light</b> <b>spots</b> {{are placed on}} a vertical line and the flashing pattern is changed quickly during saccade, the flashing pattern is expanded to a spatial pattern by the effect of eye movement, and a two-dimensional image is per-ceived. The authors have proposed a visual information presentation method based on this phenomenon. A crucial issue in information presentation by this method is the time relation between the perceived PA and the eye movement. Consequently, this study examines the time relation be-tween the perception and the eye movement. The time course of perceived position for repeatedly flashing stimu-lus is investigated by presenting <b>light</b> <b>spots</b> in the vertical position. It is found that the locus of the perceived <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> starts to curve {{at the start of}} saccade in the direction oppo-site to the saccade, and returns to the vertical direction when the saccade ends. It differs from the locus of the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> which is expected in accordance with cancellation theory...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{is trying to}} find the influence factors of CFF (Critical Flicker Frequency) from these factors: <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> intensity strength, <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> color, eyesight, gender. By using the factor analysis method of multivariate statistical analysis, this paper analyses the ANOVA and the regression analysis with software SPSS. Results showed that: 1) <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> intensity strength did affect CFF value significantly; 2) color did affect CFF value highly significantly; 3) gender and eyesight did not affect CFF value significantly. Besides, interaction of multi-level factors based on color and <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> intensity strength did affect CFF value highly significantly. Finally, we verified the functional relationship between CFF and light intensity in accordance with laws of Ferry-Porter.

40|$|Behavioral {{tests of}} animals in a {{controlled}} experimental setting provide a valuable tool to advance understanding of genotype-phenotype relations, and to {{study the effects of}} genetic and environmental manipulations. To optimally benefit from the increasing numbers of genetically engineered mice, reliable high-throughput methods for comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice lines have become a necessity. Here, we describe the development and validation of an anxiety test, the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> test, that allows for unsupervised, automated, high-throughput testing of mice in a home-cage system. This automated behavioral test circumvents bias introduced by pretest handling, and enables recording both baseline behavior and the behavioral test response over a prolonged period of time. We demonstrate that the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> test induces a behavioral response in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. This behavior reverts to baseline when the aversive stimulus is switched off, and is blunted by treatment with the anxiolytic drug Diazepam, demonstrating predictive validity of the assay, and indicating that the observed behavioral response has a significant anxiety component. Also, we investigated the effectiveness of the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> test as part of sequential testing for different behavioral aspects in the home-cage. Two learning tests, administered prior to the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> test, affected the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> test parameters. The <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> test is a novel, automated assay for anxiety-related high-throughput testing of mice in an automated home-cage environment, allowing for both comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice, and rapid screening of pharmacological compounds...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{light beam}} is {{simulated}} through nonlinear super-resolution films by the finite element method. The {{results indicate that}} the transmitted beam can be reshaped and the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> can be smaller than the diffraction limit due to the reshaping effect of strong nonlinear saturatable absorption. However, the size of the transmitted <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> cannot be decreased continuously with the increase of the film thickness, and the <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> size then decreases with the increase of the film thickness. The simulated results mean that the carrier-to-noise-ratio first increases, and then decreases with the film thickness, and there is an optimum film thickness for the read-only nonlinear super-resolution optical disks, which is consistent with the reported experimental results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSaccadic eye {{movements}} {{generated in}} response to a gap paradigm in which the fixation <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> was extinguished 200 ms prior to presentation of the target <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> showed appreciably shorter latencies than for the overlap paradigm in which the target <b>light</b> <b>spot</b> was presented 200 ms prior to extinction of the fixation <b>light</b> <b>spot.</b> When there was unpredictability in the direction of target presentation, i. e., to the left or right of the fixation <b>light</b> <b>spot,</b> the gap paradigm evoked mainly fast regular saccades of peak latency of 155 ms with relatively few express saccades which were defined as having latencies of less than 120 ms. By contrast, when the target always appeared to the right, a substantial population of express saccades with peak latency 95 ms was now generated. There was also a change in the relationship between saccadic latency and target angular displacement which covered the range 5 â 35 Â°. With the overlap paradigm and unpredictability of target direction, the latencies of the slow regular saccades increased markedly with target angular displacement. This was not the case with the same target direction when the latency of slow regular, fast regular, and express saccades remained constant with increasing target angular displacement. This indicates for targets appearing in the same hemifield that the ocular motor system operates with shortest latency irrespective of target angular displacement...|$|R
