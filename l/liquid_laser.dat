[...] It also resulted {{in one of the}} earliest lithium batteries, the globally manufactured lithium thionyl chloride battery (1973) used in implanted medical and in defense systems where greater than a 20-year shelf life, high energy density, or operation at any temperature encountered on Earth are required.|$|R
50|$|Optical patternators {{provide the}} {{distribution}} of drop surface areas rather than the mass flux. In many instances, this is advantageous as all local transfer phenomena, such as mass; momentum; energy and species are directly proportional to the surface area density of the droplets in the spray.There are three principal types of optical patternators: (a) those that use laser sheets, (b)those that use planar <b>liquid</b> <b>laser</b> induced fluorescence and (c) those that use laser extinction tomography.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} few years of the program the Photonics Division of General Atomics was the prime contractor. The design {{combined}} the high energy density of a solid-state laser with the thermal management of a <b>liquid</b> <b>laser.</b> Dubbed the [...] "HEL weapon", the initial prototype demonstrated firing a mild one kilowatt (kW) beam. Phase 3 of the program in 2007 demonstrated 15 kW power in a laboratory setting, and at the end of 2008 under the General Atomics bid, Lockheed Martin was selected as the weapon system integrator.|$|E

(However, as long as the heat transfer requirements are met solid state lasers can run continuously.) In the past, both types of lasers were very bulky because of their need for these huge cooling systems. The only aircraft in which they could fit were the size of jumbo jets.|$|R

40|$|A solar pumped <b>liquid</b> <b>laser</b> {{that can}} be scaled up to high power (10 mW CW) for space {{applications}} was developed. Liquid lasers have the advantage over gases in that they provide much higher lasant densities and thus high-power densities. Liquids also have advantages over solids in that they have much higher damage thresholds and are much cheaper to produce for large scale applications. Among the <b>liquid</b> <b>laser</b> media that are potential candidates for solar pumping, the POC 13 : Nd sup 3 +:ZrC 14 liquid was chosen for its high intrinsic efficiency and its relatively good stability against decomposition due to protic contamination.

40|$|The {{development}} of nuclear-pumped, liquid-based lanthanide ion lasers is discussed. Early investigations of lanthanide ion lasers have lead to solid-state and gaseous neodymium lasers, and {{a demonstration of}} lasing in the liquid state. Solvents containing organic chelating agents have been employed in liquid Eu(+ 3) and Tb(+ 3) lasers to extend fluorescence lifetimes, however aprotic solvents {{have been found to}} enable the {{development of}} large-scale <b>liquid</b> <b>lasers.</b> The advantages to be gained from high-power nuclear-pumped lasers based on lanthanide solutions include the high density of fissile materials possible, and a nuclear pumping cell which can operate in either a nuclear or optical pumping mode is being fabricated at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory to investigate the nuclear pumping of <b>liquid</b> lanthanide ion <b>lasers.</b> Areas that need exploration before specific laser design features can be considered include energy channeling within the liquid upon excitation, radiation damage due to solvent dissociation, and reactor technology {{for the development of a}} self-critical liquid reactor...|$|R
