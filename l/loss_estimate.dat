25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice <b>loss</b> <b>estimate</b> is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E

50|$|Probable Maximum Loss (PML) is a {{term used}} in the {{insurance}} industry as well as Commercial Real Estate. Although the definition is not consistent in the insurance industry, it is generally defined as {{the value of the}} largest loss that could result from a disaster, assuming the normal functioning of passive protective features (e.g. firewalls, nonflammable materials, flood defences etc.) and proper functioning of most (perhaps not all) active suppression systems (e.g. sprinklers). This <b>loss</b> <b>estimate</b> is always less than (or in rare cases, equal to) the Maximum Foreseeable Loss, which assumes the failure of all active protective features. Underwriting decisions can be influenced by PML evaluations, and the amount of reinsurance ceded on a risk can be predicated on the PML valuation.|$|E

A parametric study is performed to understand the sensitivity of economic loss and traffic capacity with respect to the demand, resistance, and dispersion of the fragility functions of bridges for the combined hazards. The predicted damage varies substantially based on the selected fragility functions for the bridge structure. Additionally, when ground failure models are considered, there is an overwhelming increase in bridge damage and economic <b>loss</b> <b>estimates,</b> reinforcing the need for more refined ground failure analyses to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The <b>loss</b> <b>estimates</b> are significantly sensitive to fragility parameters, particularly the resistance models, emphasizing the need to develop more specific and systematic fragility functions suitable for an entire bridge inventory.

Sony insiders have projected, along with co-financing, a total loss of about $25 million. Bloomberg News estimated the film lost $58.6 million. By August 2016, sources such as Forbes and The Wall Street Journal had begun calling Ghostbusters a box office bomb.
