5|$|In 1800 or 1799 (sources vary), Karol Kniaziewicz {{organized}} the 6,000-strong Third <b>Legion</b> (the Danube <b>Legion,</b> or the <b>Legion</b> du Rhine) {{to fight against}} the Austrians in Bavaria. The Danube <b>Legion,</b> bolstered by Karwowski's cavalry unit, fought as part of the Army of the Rhine at Berg, Bernheim and Offenburg, garrisoning the fortress of Philippsbourg after the armistice of Parsdorf (15 July). Polish forces also fought in the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800. According to Davies, the Danube <b>Legion</b> would suffer significant casualties in the short period after the battle {{and the end of the}} campaign on 25 December that year.|$|E

25|$|Generals, {{during the}} recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own <b>legions</b> and {{numbered}} them as they wished. During this time, there was {{a high incidence of}} Gemina (twin) <b>legions,</b> where two <b>legions</b> were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a legatus and six duces). At {{the end of the civil}} war against Mark Antony, Augustus was left with around fifty <b>legions,</b> with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of <b>legions</b> to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, in which 3 <b>legions</b> were completely destroyed by the Germanics).|$|R

5|$|Sources {{vary with}} regards to when the {{singular}} Dąbrowski <b>Legion</b> was expanded into multiple Legions. Pivka and Roffe note that in May 1797 the <b>Legion</b> was reorganized into two formations, the first being commanded by Karol Kniaziewicz and the second by Józef Wielhorski, each numbering about 3,750 infantry, not counting artillery support. Davies, however, states that the Second <b>Legion</b> was formed in 1798 under Józef Zajączek. In July 1797 the Legions suppressed another insurrection, this time in Reggio Emilia.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Spanish <b>Legion</b> {{participated in}} the Roman {{invasion}} of Britain, suffering losses under Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the rebellion of Boudica of 61, and setting up a fortress in 71 that later became part of Eburacum. Although some authors have claimed that the 9th <b>Legion</b> disappeared in 117, there are extant records for it later than that year, and it was probably annihilated in {{the east of the}} Roman Empire. For a time it was believed, at least by some British historians, that the <b>legion</b> vanished during its conflicts in present-day Scotland. This idea was used in the novels The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff, <b>Legion</b> From the Shadows by Karl Edward Wagner, Red Shift by Alan Garner, Engine City by Ken MacLeod, Warriors of Alavna by N. M. Browne, and in the feature films The Last <b>Legion,</b> Centurion and The Eagle.|$|E

The rebellion was quickly put down, and the Third <b>Legion</b> disbanded.|$|E

50|$|Afranius, {{with his}} three <b>legions,</b> was in {{possession}} of the passes. Afranius ordered Petreius, in command of two <b>legions</b> in Lusitania, to march for the Pyrenees to combine their forces. Varro was to remain in further Iberia with his two <b>legions.</b> Fabius advanced to the River Segre, where Afranius' force, now joined with Petreius' <b>legions,</b> was encamped. When two of Fabius' <b>legions</b> marched out to protect foragers and crossed the Segre, the bridge gave way, cutting off the small force. Afranius marched out to engage this smaller force, but Lucius Plancus, the Caesarian commander, formed up his <b>legions</b> on a rise with a good defence. Despite the size of Afranius' force, Plancus held. The approach of Caesarian reinforcements commanded by Fabius ended the engagement.|$|R
5|$|The main {{period that}} the Legions were active was between 1797 and 1803. Although some chose {{to remain with}} the French forces, and fought in Italy under the Kingdom of Naples, in 1807 many veteran legionnaires formed a cadre for the new Army of the Duchy of Warsaw. In February 1807, the {{remaining}} infantry and cavalry regiments who had continued in French service in Italy were reorganized in Silesia, near Breslau, into a Polish-Italian <b>Legion</b> (PolaccoItalienne), with two new infantry regiments added from the newly liberated Polish lands. On 21 February 1808, the <b>Legion</b> was relocated to France, reinforced with Poles from other French formations, and incorporated into the French army. On 31 March of that year the <b>legion</b> was officially named the Vistula <b>Legion</b> (<b>Légion</b> de la Vistule, Legia Nadwiślańska). By mid-1808 the Vistula <b>Legion</b> had a strength of 6,000. After the Battle of Wagram (5–6 July 1809) Napoleon attempted to form a second Polish Vistula <b>Legion</b> from Polish prisoners of war, but the new formation could not attract sufficient recruits, and in 1810 it was merged into the original Vistula <b>Legion.</b>|$|E

5|$|Through his {{military}} reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus changed and regularized the <b>legion,</b> {{down to the}} hobnail pattern on the soles of army boots. A <b>legion</b> was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (contubernia); the exact size of the Imperial <b>legion,</b> which {{is most likely to}} have been determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.|$|E

5000|$|By {{virtue of}} his imperium as propraetor, Caesar Octavian assumed command of Hirtius' <b>legions.</b> When the Senate ordered that the <b>legions</b> be handed over to Decimus Brutus, Octavian refused, {{assuming}} permanent command {{on the grounds that}} the established <b>legions</b> would refuse to fight under the command of one of Julius Caesar's assassins. As a result, Octavian came to control eight <b>legions,</b> loyal to himself rather than to the Republic. He refused to co-operate with Decimus Brutus, whose <b>legions</b> at Mutina began deserting him, many going over to Octavian. His position deteriorating by the day, Decimus Brutus abandoned his remaining <b>legions</b> and fled Italy. He attempted to reach Macedonia, where fellow assassins Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus were stationed, but was captured and executed en route by a Gallic chief loyal to Mark Antony.|$|R
50|$|The Roman <b>legions,</b> {{which had}} reached an {{unprecedented}} 50 in number {{because of the}} civil wars, were reduced to 28.

Augustus also created nine special cohorts to maintain peace in Italia, with three, the Praetorian Guard, kept in Rome. Control of the fiscus enabled Augustus to ensure the loyalty of the <b>legions</b> through their pay.|$|R
