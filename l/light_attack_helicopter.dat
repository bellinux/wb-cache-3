50|$|The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (31st MEU) is one {{of seven}} Marine Expeditionary Units in {{existence}} in the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Expeditionary Unit is a Marine Air Ground Task Force with a strength of about 2,200 personnel. The MEU consists of a company-sized command element, a battalion landing team (BLT), (an infantry battalion reinforced with artillery, amphibious vehicle and other attachments), a medium tiltrotor squadron (reinforced), (which includes detachments of VTOL airplanes and heavy, <b>light,</b> and <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters),</b> and a combat logistics battalion. The 31st MEU is based at Camp Hansen, Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler, Okinawa, Japan. This is the only permanently forward-deployed MEU, and is America's expeditionary force-in-readiness in the Asia-Pacific region.|$|R

50|$|Weapons used on <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{can include}} autocannons, machine guns, rockets, and guided {{anti-tank}} missiles {{such as the}} Hellfire. Many <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are also capable of carrying air-to-air missiles, though mostly for purposes of self-defense. Today's <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> has two main roles: first, to provide direct and accurate close air support for ground troops, and the second, in the anti-tank role to destroy enemy armor concentrations. <b>Attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are also used to supplement lighter helicopters in the armed scout role. In combat, an <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> is projected to destroy around 17 times its own production cost before it is destroyed.|$|R
25|$|The {{target market}} is the U.S. Air National Guard and foreign nations that cannot afford the F-35, but want an {{aircraft}} to perform ISR and <b>light</b> <b>attack</b> missions better than turboprop planes. Buying and sustaining the Scorpion would cost less than A-10 or F-16 upgrades. For air patrol, the Scorpion requires radar and the capability of supersonic flight, similar to the unsuccessful 1980s-era Northrop F-20 Tigershark. The market for <b>light</b> fixed-wing <b>attack</b> jets had declined in the 1980s as richer countries opted for more capable aircraft and poorer countries pursued turboprops and <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters.</b> It is uncertain if the Scorpion will be cheaper or outperform turboprops or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in terms of range, endurance, low-altitude performance, and sensors.|$|R
