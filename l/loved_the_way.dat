500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men laugh with his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops seemed to find the speeches very funny. In particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Blogcritics, Barbara Bennett praised {{the changes in}} the storyline and unique twists in this episode and the {{upcoming}} season: [...] "I have to say, I really <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> series creators Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis have merged bits of Arthurian legend into the Once Upon a Time landscape. From the Sword in the Stone to the introduction of Arthur and Lancelot, I think this just might work–and be far more integrated into the series narrative than Frozen had been. And for that I cheer!!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Yorke told The Guardian that Michael Stipe of R.E.M. is his {{favourite}} lyricist, saying [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{he would}} take an emotion and then {{take a step back}} from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful." [...] The chorus lyric of [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] from Kid A was inspired by Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: [...] "I'm not here, this isn't happening." [...] Yorke credited Neil Young as another major lyrical influence.|$|E

2500|$|Gresham {{really liked}} the {{tradition}} of tight ends at Miami (Bubba Franks, Jeremy Shockey and Kellen Winslow Jr.), {{as well as the}} camaraderie and closeness of the players there, but in the end it came down to being close to family and friends. His mother, Walletta, would have a hard enough time getting to Norman to see him play. [...] He also <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> his Oklahoma recruiters, Kevin Sumlin and Jackie Shipp, interacted with their own families.

2500|$|The host of The Colbert Report is Stephen Colbert, a [...] "self-important right-wing commentator", {{portrayed by}} his real-life namesake. The {{character}} incorporates aspects of Colbert's real life, but {{is primarily a}} parody of cable news pundits, particularly Bill O'Reilly of Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, whom {{he refers to as}} [...] "Papa Bear". To this end, the character even incorporates O'Reilly's mannerisms, described as his [...] "pen-wielding, hand-stabbing gestures." [...] O'Reilly's use of [...] "talking points" [...] — illustrated onscreen graphics reflecting the host's opinions — are parodied on The Colbert Report with the segment [...] "The Word". [...] He initially incorporated long-winded, verbose metaphors to parody CNN correspondent Aaron Brown. In addition, the character was also heavily inspired by Stone Phillips, Bill Kurtis and [...] "especially" [...] Geraldo Rivera. [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Geraldo made reporting a story seem like an act of courage," [...] Colbert told a reporter in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kurt Cobain's biographer Christopher Sandford, Nirvana singer gave [...] "specific references" [...] when {{recording}} {{their first}} album Bleach: [...] "the guitar part in [...] "Love Buzz" [...] was lifted from Sparks’ Kimono My House". Björk talked about Kimono my House {{as one of}} the records that changed her life. [...] " [...] were exotic , [...] were the most refreshing thing in my life" [...] when she was eight. [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: [...] "I saw Sparks play on American Banstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, [...] "why I love the Sparks". He said about their music: [...] "It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then your really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them"." [...] Sparks were also namechecked by the likes of Def Leppard, Ween, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, Mark Burgess of the Chameleons, Cait Brennan, and Justice.|$|E

2500|$|Monáe later {{appeared}} on OutKast's album Idlewild, {{where she is}} featured on the songs [...] "Call the Law" [...] and [...] "In Your Dreams". Big Boi told his friend Sean Combs about Monáe, whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe's MySpace page and according to a HitQuarters interview with Bad Boy Records A person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it straight away: [...] " [...] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh." [...] Monáe signed to Bad Boy in 2006. The label's chief role was in facilitating her exposure on a much broader scale rather than developing the artist and her music, because {{in the words of}} Mitchell, [...] "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." [...] Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out [...] "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment".|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Clacton {{was in his}} glory. The {{machinery}} {{which he}} had perfected and controlled was now about to turn out its bi-monthly product, a committee meeting; and his pride in the perfect structure of these assemblies was great. He loved the jargon of committee-rooms; he <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which the door kept opening as the clock struck the hour, in obedience to a few strokes of his pen {{on a piece of}} paper; and when it had opened sufficiently often, he loved to issue from his inner chamber with documents in his hands, visibly important, with a preoccupied expression on his face that might have suited a Prime Minister advancing to meet his Cabinet. By his orders the table had been decorated beforehand with six sheets of blotting-paper, with six pens, six ink-pots, a tumbler and a jug of water, a bell, and, in deference to the taste of the lady members, a vase of hardy chrysanthemums. He had already surreptitiously straightened the sheets of blotting-paper in relation to the ink-pots, and now {{stood in front of the}} fire engaged in conversation with Miss Markham. But his eye was on the door, and when Mary and Mrs. Seal entered, he gave a little laugh and observed to the assembly which was scattered about the room: ...|$|E
