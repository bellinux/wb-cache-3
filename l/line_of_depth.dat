40|$|We {{compute the}} {{regression}} depth of a k-flat {{in a set}} of n points in R d, in time O(n d- 2 + n log n) for 1 # k # d - 2. This contrasts with a bound of O(n d- 1 + n log n) when k = 0 or k = d - 1. 1 Introduction Regression depth was introduced by Hubert and Rousseeuw [7] as a distance-free quality measure for linear regression. The depth of a hyperplane is the minimum number of points crossed in any continuous motion taking the hyperplane to a vertical hyperplane (a "nonfit"). The deepest hyperplane provides a good fit even in the presence of skewed or data-dependent errors, and is robust against a constant fraction of arbitrary outliers. Due to its combinatorial nature, regression depth leads to many interesting geometric and algorithmic problems. A simple construction called the catline provides a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> #n/ 3 # for n points in the plane [3]. The catline's depth bound is best possible, and more generally in R d the best depth bound is #n/(d + 1) # [1, 5]. On [...] ...|$|E

Such lines were used to describe a land surface (contour lines) in a map of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio by Domenico Vandelli in 1746, and they were studied theoretically by Ducarla in 1771, and Charles Hutton used them in the Schiehallion experiment. In 1791, a map of France by J. L. Dupain-Triel used contour lines at 20-metre intervals, hachures, spot-heights and a vertical section.

The V and I pass bands photometric data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE III) catalogue are used. The mean dereddened I_ 0 magnitude and the dispersion in the I_ 0 magnitudes are used to estimate the relative positions of different regions in the SMC and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight (LOS) <b>depth</b> across the SMC respectively. From the analysis of both the populations {{we found that the}} north eastern part of the SMC is closer to us and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight <b>depth</b> across the SMC is large. The radial density profile of the RC stars suggest that {{they are more likely to}} be distributed in a nearly spheroidal system. An elongation along the NE-SW direction is seen in the distribution of the RC stars. Based on these results the observed SMC is approximated as a triaxial ellipsoidal galaxy. The parameters of the ellipsoid obtained using both the populations are found to be similar. The above estimated parameters depend on the data coverage of the SMC. Using the RRLS with equal coverage in all the three axes (data within 3 degrees in X, Y and Z axes), we estimated an axes ratio of 1 : 1. 33 : 1. 61 with an inclination, i = 2. 6 deg and position angle of the projection of the ellipsoid, ϕ = 70. 2 deg.

The VCS relates the statistics of fluctuations along the velocity coordinate to the statistics of turbulence, thus it does not require spatial coverage by sampling directions in the plane of the sky. We consider lines with different degree of absorption and show that for <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> optical <b>depth</b> less than one, our earlier treatment of the VCS developed for spectral emission lines is applicable, if the optical depth is used instead of intensity. This amounts to correlating the logarithms of absorbed intensities. For larger optical depths and saturated absorption lines, we show, that the amount of information that one can use is, inevitably, limited by noise. In practical terms, this means that only wings <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> are available for the analysis. In terms of the VCS formalism, this results in introducing an additional window, which size decreases with the increase <b>of</b> the optical <b>depth.</b> As a result, strongly saturated absorption lines carry the information only about the small scale turbulence. Nevertheless, the contrast of the fluctuations corresponding to the small scale turbulence increases with the increase <b>of</b> the optical <b>depth,</b> which provides advantages for studying turbulence combining lines with different optical depths.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} procedure as how {{to record}} the spatial distribution of residual strain and stress respectively, in semiconductor single crystal wafers by Scanning Infrared Polariscopy (SIRP) and High Resolution X-ray Diffraction (HRXD) is demonstrated. The SIRP based on the strain-induced birefringence is the most sophosticated method for the fast lateral mapping of combinations of the in-plane strain tensor components determined in transmission of the whole wafer. The HRXD adds the subsurface profile of the single tensor components of strain and stress in selected points of the wafer by analysing sets <b>of</b> diffraction <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> different penetration <b>depths</b> calculated according to the dynamic theory of X-ray scattering. The averaged strain and stress values extrapolated from the HRXD subsurface data correlate with the corresponding results of SIRP. The more general application of residual strain characterisation demonstrated on InP to other wafer materials is recommended...|$|R
