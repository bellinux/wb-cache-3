2500|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} theories on lexical access for bilinguals, Language Selective Access and Language Non-Selective Access, {{attempt to explain}} the process and stages of lexical activation and selection. These hypotheses focus on determining whether lexical candidates from different languages that share similar lexical features are activated when a word is presented. For instance, when the Dutch word vork is activated, is the English word pork also activated? If the answer is [...] "no", it might suggest that <b>language</b> <b>selection</b> happens before the recognition of a word and only the lexical information of the target language is selectively activated, in which case lexical access is language selective. If the answer is [...] "yes", it might suggest the other possibility that the recognition of a word is processed in parallel for both languages and the lexical information of both languages are activated, in which case lexical access is language non-selective. Research pertaining to lexical access has indicated {{that it is not}} achievable to completely suppress a known language.|$|E

Benefits of using Ninite rather than the individual applications' installers themselves include: toolbar/adware free installations, the ability to update multiple applications at once, automatic selection of architecture (64-bit vs 32-bit), <b>language</b> <b>selection</b> based on operating system's language, and error reporting, should one of the installations fail.|$|E
