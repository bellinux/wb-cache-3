2500|$|In popular (non-technical) {{usage of}} the term [...] "Coriolis effect", the {{rotating}} reference frame implied is almost always the Earth. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need {{to account for the}} Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects. [...] The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects {{on the surface of the}} Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles, since the effective rotation rate about a <b>local</b> <b>vertical</b> axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the equator. Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see Coriolis effects in meteorology).|$|E

40|$|This thesis used {{virtual reality}} {{techniques}} to investigate how differences in visual vertical direction of two docked spacecraft affect {{the ability of}} a person in one module to mentally visualize the relative orientation of the other module, and spatial relationships of surfaces in it. Spacecraft and space station modules are typically connected differently in space from the way they would be in training simulators on Earth. The <b>local</b> visual <b>vertical</b> is the direction that appears to be "up" as defined by panel and rack orientation, labeling, and placement. In space, the <b>local</b> visual <b>verticals</b> of adjacent modules are not always consistently aligned and astronauts say they find it hard to orient themselves within those configurations. We investigated how relative module orientation determines performance in a spatial memory and visualization task. An experiment compared six different attachment configurations of two modules. Subjects (n = 20) wearing a color stereo head mounted display first learned the interiors of two modules separately. They then learned six flight configurations sequentially. In each configuration, subjects located in the first module were shown one "cue" wall in that module, so they could determine their orientation, and were then asked to visualize, place and orient a "target" wall within a wireframe view of the adjacent second module. (cont.) The total time to respond to each trial was recorded, along with the percentage of correct responses, and the subject's head orientation. The analysis of time to respond and percentage of correct responses showed that certain configurations were statistically significantly different. As expected, the easiest configurations were "terrestrial like" where the visual verticals of the two modules were co-aligned. Including a 180 deg pitch between the modules made the task harder. The hardest were those that included a 90 deg pitch - in which the <b>local</b> visual <b>verticals</b> of the two modules were orthogonal. Comparing the easiest (terrestrial like) configurations with hardest, subjects needed 3 seconds more to orient and accomplish the task. This represents a significant amount of time given that we perform this task without much thinking about it and almost instantaneously on Earth. Subjects relied heavily on the visual verticals, and often tilted their heads toward alignment with the <b>local</b> visual <b>vertical.</b> Performance could be predicted, {{based on the number of}} pitches and yaws relating the two modules in the configurations tested.

40|$|Existing {{techniques}} of quality control of radar reflectivity data rely on <b>local</b> texture and <b>vertical</b> profiles {{to discriminate between}} precipitating echoes and non-precipitating echoes. Non-precipitating echoes {{may be due to}} artifacts such as anamalous propagation, ground clutter, electronic interference, sun strobe, and biological contaminants (i. e., birds, bats and insects). The local texture of reflectivity fields suffices to remove most artifacts, except for biological echoes. Biological echoes, also called ”bloom ” echoes because of their circular shape and expanding size during the night time, have proven difficult to remove, especially in peak migration seasons of various biological species, because they can have <b>local</b> and <b>vertical</b> characteristics similar to that of stratiform rain or snow. In this paper, we describe a technique that identifies candidate bloom echoes based on the range-variance of reflectivity in areas of bloom, and uses the global, rather than local, characteristic of the echo to discriminate between bloom and rain. Every range gate is assigned a probability that it corresponds to bloom using morphological (shape-based) operations and a neural network is trained using this probability as one of the input features. We demonstrate that this technique is capable of identifying and removing echoes due to biological targets and other types of artifacts while retaining echoes that correspond to precipitation...|$|R

Besides, by additional simulations, prior boundary uncertainties are recovered. Therefore, according to the required accuracy of the model and acceptable tolerance, number of simulations is determined. As a result, this method can be more efficiently applied in a multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations. This conclusion is demonstrated by comparing of results with the Classical Monte Carlo (CMC), dynamic bounds (DB), and improved dynamic bounds (IDB) for a model of impact water waves as an example. 1 Nomenclature xi A random variable ¯x A vector of random variables G(¯x) Limit state function xij A realization from xi LSF Limit State Function sut Set of upper thresholds slt Set of lower thresholds ξ Horizontal <b>local</b> axes η <b>Vertical</b> <b>local</b> axes I...|$|R
