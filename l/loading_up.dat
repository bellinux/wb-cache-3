For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball flying through the air during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 Great Britain was {{converted}} into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal. She made her final voyage in 1886, after <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> with coal and leaving Penarth Dock for Panama on 8 February. After a fire on board en-route she was found on arrival at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to be damaged beyond economic repair. She was sold to the Falkland Islands Company and used, afloat, as a storage hulk (coal bunker) until 1937, when she was towed to Sparrow Cove, 3.5miles from Port Stanley, scuttled and abandoned. As a bunker, she coaled the South Atlantic fleet that defeated Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's fleet in the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Second World War, some of her iron was scavenged to repair , one of the Royal Navy ships that fought the Graf Spee and was badly damaged during the Battle of the River Plate.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{definite}} {{record as}} to who gave the order to begin shelling the Four Courts. Historians have only presumed that it was Collins. There is only anecdotal evidence as to how and when the ultimatum was served on the anti-Treaty garrison, whether adequate time was allowed the Four Courts men to surrender, or whether shelling began precipitately while the garrison was <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> their arms to leave the building. Further study {{remains to be done}} on this most critical event of 1922, which actually started the Civil War in earnest.|$|E
25|$|General {{interest}} magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, {{short stories}} and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One {{of them was the}} historically significant Collier's (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor William Chenery in 1925. Martin drew many of its covers during the Roaring Twenties, including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923–27). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities. This included the following: catching a baseball, <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> on desserts (pictured below), playing the flute, wearing a straw hat, shooting marbles, shoveling snow, carrying schoolbooks on head, riding a sled, winding up a toy, eating turkey at Christmas, bobbing for apples, playing football (pictured), happily swimming, getting a shaved haircut, saying grace, working as a messenger, daydreaming at school about fishing and going down a water slide. He seldom veered from this subject matter.|$|E

2500|$|Instead, Stevens {{was offered}} {{a job with the}} Fairbanks, Alaska, law firm of Emil Usibelli's Alaska attorney, Charles Clasby, whose firm—Collins and Clasby—had just lost one of its attorneys. Stevens and his wife had met and liked both Usibelli and Clasby, and decided to make the move. <b>Loading</b> <b>up</b> their 1947 Buick and {{traveling}} on a $600 loan from Clasby, they drove across country from Washington, D.C., and up the Alaska Highway in the dead of winter, arriving in Fairbanks in February 1953. Stevens later recalled kidding Gov. Walter Hickel about the loan. [...] "He likes to say that he came to Alaska with 38 cents in his pocket," [...] he said of Hickel. [...] "I came $600 in debt." [...] Ann Stevens recalled in 1968 that they made the move to Alaska [...] "on a six-month trial basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the fall}} of 1887, after {{traveling}} through the White Pass to Lake Bennett, Moore somehow knew that gold would soon be discovered in the Yukon and {{wasted no time in}} preparing for the day his prediction would come to pass. With his son, Ben, Moore struck out for Juneau, Alaska by canoe. When they passed what would later be named Skagway, Moore noted {{that it would be a}} good place for a wharf. <b>Loading</b> <b>up</b> with supplies in Juneau, they swiftly returned through the Lynn Canal to Skagway Bay where Moore preempted [...] at the mouth of the Skagway River at a place the Indians called Skagua, and named it Mooresville. He built a log cabin, a sawmill, and began the construction of a wharf in anticipation of the ships that would land there, offloading thousands of eager gold-seekers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next major}} change came in 1907 when the Fe team began <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> with black American stars, such as Rube Foster, Home Run Johnson, Pete Hill, and Bill Monroe. [...] Soon {{the other teams}} were also {{bringing}} in the Negro League stars, culminating in the 1912 Habana, which easily took the title with a team featuring Hall-of-Famers Joe Williams, John Henry Lloyd, and Pete Hill, as well as Home Run Johnson and Cuban stars Julián Castillo, Carlos Morán, and Luis Padrón. [...] According to González Echevarría, [...] "These teams were clearly of major-league quality, combining the cream of Negro baseball with the best Cuba had to offer, and a few white major leaguers to boot." [...] Only Almendares was able to remain competitive for a while without American reinforcements, relying on its strong core of Cuban-born pitchers including Hall-of-Famer José Méndez, Eustaquio Pedroso, and José Muñoz.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupe—named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> to 85 cubic feet.|$|E
2500|$|In Cairo Maclean dined with Alexander Cadogan, his FO superior, and {{the next}} day {{reported}} to Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary. [...] He stated his conclusions straightforwardly: that the Partisans were important militarily and politically and would influence the future of Yugoslavia whether the Allies helped them or not; their impact on the Germans could be greatly increased by Allied support; they were Communist and oriented towards the USSR. He says that his report created [...] "something of a stir". [...] He was sent back to collect two Yugoslav liasison officers who had not been allowed to come out with him on the first Navy pick-up. [...] From Bari on the Italian Adriatic coast, now a centre of operations for the Tactical Air Force, he saw that this would prove difficult, as the German offensive had captured the whole Dalmatian coast. Fortunately, he had asked Air Marshal Sholto Douglas to assign him a liaison officer, and Wing Commander John Selby proved a godsend. [...] Together they obtained the use of a Baltimore bomber and an escort of Lightnings. Twice they set out from Italy on a sunny day and twice the clouds blocked them from the Bosnian hills. On the third day the fighters were unavailable so the bomber set out alone, but again the weather made it impossible to land. [...] On their return to Italy, they received a signal that the Partisans had captured a small German plane that they proposed to use. [...] As they were <b>loading</b> <b>up</b> the plane, an enemy aircraft, alerted by a traitor, bombed the landing strip at Glamoc, killing Whetherly, Knight, and Ribar, and wounding Milojevic. This event, at the end of November, proved a spur to getting the mission higher priority, and soon Maclean got a large Dakota and half a squadron of Lightnings to complete the landing operation. [...] Milojevic and Velebit accompanied Maclean to Alexandria, where the Yugoslavs decompressed for a few days, while Maclean sought out the prime minister.|$|E
