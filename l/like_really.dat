That's the only reason why I didn't like the album. The songs were great but it didn't make me happy."

500|$|Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, [...] "Most of {{the kids}} who come to my shows seem <b>like</b> <b>really</b> imaginative kids with a lot of {{creative}} energy they don't know what to do with" [...] and that metal is [...] "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place". Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as [...] "poseurs" [...] "who pretended {{to be part of the}} subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".|$|E
500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just <b>like</b> <b>really</b> aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] was filmed in New York City by director, Isaac Ravishankara. The song's music video is {{relative}} to the song's theme: kissing. Foreman explained, [...] " [...] the video is a play on kissing in general, and lips, and getting close up {{to a bunch of}} lips, and people coming out of mouths and just, <b>like,</b> <b>really</b> cool transitions." [...] The video follows a similar theme that is {{relative to the}} song's title, [...] "My First Kiss". It features a lot of people (punks, teachers, sailors, soldiers, lesbians, nerds, an elderly couple and hirsute rockers) [...] "smooching, kissing, and making out." [...] The video is made up of different scenes all using multi-colored backdrops as the video's dominant backing. The main scenes present are of [...] "3OH!3 bouncing around and throw punches at the camera" [...] while singing their versus and occasional close-ups of different pairs of lips that are mouthing different lyrics of the song. Kesha is also present throughout the video, mainly on her verses where she is seen in close-ups of her lips and dancing around the screen on the chorus.|$|E

[...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out and I have no idea where these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random.

But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, <b>like,</b> <b>really</b> mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is.

She started {{dressing}} like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] "My Immortal", a piano rock ballad written by Moody with a bridge by Lee, {{is based on a}} short story Moody wrote; in the album booklet he dedicates the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. [...] "Haunted" [...] is also based on a Moody short story which was posted on the Evanescence fan forum, EvBoard.com. [...] "Tourniquet" [...] was originally written for Christian death metal band Soul Embraced, which included future Evanescence member Rocky Gray. [...] "Imaginary", a song from Evanescence's 1998 self-titled EP, was originally intended as Fallen fourth single. The midtempo [...] "Taking Over Mes lyrics are about Lee being consumed by another person's obsession with her. [...] "Hello" [...] remembers one of Lee's sisters, who died of an illness in 1987 at age three. The lyrics of [...] "My Last Breath" [...] explore emotional survival, with the lack of air a metaphor.

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but <b>like</b> <b>really</b> fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E

[...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part.
