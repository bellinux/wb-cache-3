Replaces {{existing}} {{income taxes}} {{with a flat}} tax on personal and business income at a single percentage rate set by Legislature. Prohibits other taxes except property tax, gross premiums tax, unemployment insurance tax, inheritance tax, and excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and tobacco products and horse racing. Limits local taxes to property tax and surtax on state flat tax. Authorizes limited deductions from income subject to flat taxes. Two-thirds of Legislature may adjust flat tax rate. Requires approval of <b>local</b> <b>surtax</b> by 2 / 3 of governing agency and 2 / 3 of voters. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The overall impact could be ongoing losses of several billion dollars to state and/or local governments, {{largely due to the}} measure 2 ̆ 7 s elimination of many taxes. However, the actual impact would depend on actions taken by the Legislature and the voters to offset these losses, principally the level of new flax tax and surtax rates...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} Regions and Municipalities in Italy have been {{assigned}} the power to apply <b>local</b> <b>surtaxes</b> on the personal income tax levied at national level. The aim {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, from a positive perspective, we measure the redistributive effects produced by the adoption of these <b>local</b> <b>surtaxes.</b> By using a sample of tax returns representative on a regional basis, we find that the redistributive effects are slightly enhanced by the introduction of <b>local</b> <b>surtaxes</b> {{as a result of an}} increase in tax incidence, given that the introduction of <b>local</b> <b>surtaxes</b> is not offset by a corresponding reduction of national taxation, and a relatively smaller reduction in tax progressivity. Vertical redistribution and horizontal inequity are also distinctly considered. It turns out that at both national and regional level <b>local</b> <b>surtaxes</b> slightly increase these two components, roughly in the same proportion, whereas variations are relatively differentiated at the regional level. Secondly, from a normative perspective, we design a possible welfare-improving tax reform in which the simplification of the personal income tax is combined with its partial decentralization. When the redistributive impact of this reform is assessed, the new tax structure welfare-dominates the current centralized tax both at the national level and within any single Region. decentralizaton, personal income tax, redistributive effects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} some {{open issues}} concerning {{the role of}} the personal income tax in regional and local finance. It compares different technical instruments to share the personal income tax among levels of government, analyzing particularly the differential effects of the two main forms of overlapping taxation, the surtax and the surcharge. It is proved that both instruments increase the redistributional impact of personal income taxation, the surcharge to a larger extent than the surtax. The second part of the paper describes the present framework of the sharing of income tax in Italy, based upon regional and <b>local</b> <b>surtaxes,</b> and the new perspectives opened by the reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations recently approved by Parliament...|$|R

50|$|Mainville {{was elected}} to the Ville-Marie borough council in the 2005 Montreal {{municipal}} election {{as a member of the}} Vision Montreal party. Montreal mayor Gérald Tremblay's Montreal Island Citizens' Union (MICU) won four of the five borough seats in this election, and Mainville was initially the only member of the opposition. He was the sole councillor to vote against a <b>local</b> $15 million <b>surtax</b> for new recreational and cultural services in 2006, arguing that the funds should have come from the entire city. The following year, he was the only councillor to vote against the introduction of harsh financial penalties for littering and graffiti. He argued that the law would be difficult to enforce and would result in arbitrary and unfair penalties. He also criticized a requirement that local merchants clean up vandalism outside their shops, arguing that this shifted responsibility away from the offenders.|$|R
