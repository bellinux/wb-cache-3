40|$|The Internet {{can provide}} a {{powerful}} and yet economical network environment for information sharing and collaborative computation. Its unpredictable nature, however, has deterred its massive use as the platform for serious timely applications. Meanwhile its potential and possible exploitation have attracted tremendous international effort, which includes various approaches that address the issues of fault tolerance and better timely service response. The computation objectives of Internet based applications are normally accomplished through collaborative objects or agents, mobile or static, interacting in a client/server relationship. The dynamic conditions of loading at nodes and logical communication channels, if not managed properly, would easily lead to reception buffer overflow. This overflow phenomenon occurs in Internet operation {{in the form of}} random loss/drop. The consequence includes widespread message retransmissions, long service response time and poor system timeliness. The general desire to reduce the ill effect of random loss has prompted the proposal of different overflow control algorithms, which, from accumulated user experience, fail easily with perturbations. These extant algorithms are mainly exploratory and based on control by rate/gradient of change in the queue length (i. e. dQ /dt) and by the current ratio of queue <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>length</b> (RQL). The ease of failure of these algorithms is due to impractical design expectations, which assume that the static values chosen for the control parameters would always meet the requirements for different dynamic situations. The reality is that the Internet is a dynamic entity and therefore it is only natural for the buffer overflow control mechanism to be fully adaptive. The control process or controller should adapt the parameter selectively and proactively to deal with unpredictable situations. The novel adaptive overflow controller, namely, the NNC (Neural Network Controller) is proposed in this paper to achieve this goal. It eliminates buffer overflow by maintaining the given buffer safety margin Delta of the objective function {Delta, 0 } 2. The Delta is the predefined difference allowed between the current values of the buffer length and the queue length. At runtime the buffer length is elongated or shortened in a proactive manner depending on the instantaneous system loading condition. The dynamic buffer length shortening process recycles excess memory to better system performance, by avoiding job suspensions in the system due to temporarily short of memory...|$|R

50|$|In {{comparison}} with the existing state railway wagons, the cradle wagon (Drehschemelwagen), Class A5, had a longer wheelbase of 4,500 mm and was a new design. These wagons, used for the transport of timber, had eight stanchions and a rotating cradle that pivoted on a flat steel ring in {{the floor of the}} flat bed. All wagons built between 1913 and 1925 had a loading length of 8,000 mm, a loading width of 2,500 mm, a payload of 15 tonnes and a pointed underframe.

50|$|These lidded wagons were longer (<b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> with/without hand brake: 9,100mm / 9,800 mm) and had {{a greater}} axle base (4,000 mm) than their forebears {{designed}} {{on the basis of}} technical drawing A7. The side walls were now divided into two panels by a vertical brace either side of the door. With the renaming of the recently formed town of Barmen-Elberfeld to Wuppertal in 1930 the designation of this class also changed.|$|E
50|$|About 3,900 Class A3 rail wagons (Schienenwagen or Plattformwagen) {{were built}} from 1913 to 1925. These were a special type of flat wagon {{based on their}} Prussian forebears, based on Sheet IId7. They were only built with brakeman's cabs and had a <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 15,800 mm, a loading length of 15,060 mm and a loading width of 2,750 mm.

5000|$|Each had a MTU-built (then Maybach) 16-cylinder {{engine of}} the type 16V652 TB10 {{producing}} [...] which was entirely used for traction. Since in the mid-1960s a more powerful engine was not available, the electrical supply was powered by an auxiliary diesel engine. The inclusion of two engines in turn meant that the overall length of the machine was increased by 0.4 m {{in comparison to the}} V 160, making a total <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 16.4 meters.|$|E
50|$|Later batches (from 1887) had a steam dome, and the {{admission}} pipes {{were located in}} the smokebox. Due to {{the addition of the}} steam dome, the location of the sand box and sanders were changed. In addition the quantities of water and coal that could be carried were increased. The back wall of the cab was now straight and the lower section no longer sloped. The <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> increased from 8,300 mm to 8,591 mm, the axle load rose to 11 t (see second photo).|$|E
50|$|This wagon {{class was}} only built without a brakeman's cab. It had a <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 14,400 mm and a {{wheelbase}} of 8,000 mm. It had end walls over 400 mm high, 12 removable steel stakes or stanchions and loading sleepers {{across the bed}} of the wagon. The truck was reinforced by an iron bar underframe, which enabled it to support a payload of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 17.5 tonnes. Its loading length was 1,300 mm and its loading width 2,750 mm.|$|E

5000|$|The A8s {{built for}} the Prussian state {{railways}} had no hand brakes, but were fitted with a compressed air brake line (index letter [...] "n") for insertion in passenger trains. They were given the designation [...] "Venmz", and later grouped by the DR into the [...] "V Altona" [...] class. These wagons had a <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 8,250 mm, a payload of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 15.75 tonnes. Their wheelbase was also 4,000 mm and they had ten-leaved, 1,100-mm-long suspension springs.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the {{disadvantages}} of lidded wagons, in 1940 a new design was ordered, but only eight trial wagons were produced. They had a <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 9,800 mm and had a hand brake, a loading volumen of 28.6 m³, a payload of 20 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 21 tonnes. Their most striking external features were the wheelbase of 6,000 mm, the external longitudinal beams and the brakeman's cab of steel with a semicircular roof. All the wagons were fitted with a Hikg brake and had eight roof hatches.|$|E
50|$|These twin-axle wagons had at a loading {{volume of}} 45.7 m³, a payload of 15 tonnes and a {{carrying}} capacity of 15.75 tonnes. The wheelbase was uniformly 4,500 mm, the <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> was 9,600 mm, it had pressed steel axle boxes and DWV wheelsets. The van had eleven-leaf, 1,100 mm long suspension springs. At {{one point of}} the wagon a Kunze-Knorr goods train brake was retrofitted from the mid-1920s.

5000|$|To meet {{demands for}} a faster part-load goods service, the {{high-speed}} [...] "Gs Oppeln" [...] class vans were built from 1937 in series. By designing it with a wheelbase of 6,000 mm, outer longitudinal beams and 7 leaf, 1,400-mm-long suspension springs the van {{was able to be}} rated for a top speed of 90 km/h. The wagons had no handbrake, a <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 9,100 mm, a loading volume of 45 m³, a payload of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 17.5 tonnes. They had a pointed underframe (spitz zulaufendes Sprengwerk) and were fitted with a Hildebrandt-Knorr air brake.|$|E
50|$|The {{open wagon}} with {{drop-down}} sides of Class A1 {{were based on}} the Prussian truck, built to Sheet II d3. Just under 50,000 A1s were built from 1910, both with and without brakeman's cabs. They had a loading capacity of 18.4 m³, a maximum load of 15 tonnes and a carrying capacity of 17.5 tonnes. The wooden walls of the tiltable wagon were 1,000 mm high, the door width was 1,500 mm, the loading length 6,720 mm and the loading width 2,734 mm. The wheelbase for vehicles, with and without hand brakes was uniformly 4,000 mm, with a <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 8,800 mm.|$|E
5000|$|After these {{experiences}} {{a completely new}} goods wagon was developed and built from 1934. It was produced only with a hand brake, and had a 7,000 mm axle base and overall <b>length</b> <b>over</b> <b>buffers</b> of 10,800 mm. It had, like the Gl Dresden with a 7,700 mm axle base, a trapezoidal strut frame and very good riding qualities {{as a result of}} its short overhang.
