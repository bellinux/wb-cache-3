5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E

"Oh, well, I keep meeting Syd and Polly {{circulating}} {{in the same}} directions; she <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had found something uncommonly nice, and he <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all creation was getting Pollyfied pretty rapidly. Wonder you have n't observed it." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted {{over the top and}} one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

25|$|To {{add more}} realism, {{the locker room}} scenes were improvised for Rourke and others to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were {{actually}} socializing. Some of the deli scenes were improvised because Aronofsky was filming Rourke actually working there.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November Childers was {{executed}} by firing squad. Childers was the Republican head of propaganda {{and it was}} widely speculated that seven low-ranking Republicans were shot before Childers {{so that it would}} not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had been singled out to be executed.|$|E
25|$|Artists such as Roland Penrose (author of the Home Guard Manual of Camouflage), Stanley William Hayter, Julian Trevelyan {{and many}} others were {{employed}} to conceal defences. In built-up areas pillboxes were disguised {{to look like a}} part of an adjacent building, carefully matched and provided with a roof to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had always been there. In extreme cases, they were built inside existing buildings.|$|E

25|$|On March 5, 1986, Sellers {{killed his}} mother, Vonda Bellofatto, and his stepfather, Lee Bellofatto, {{while they were}} asleep in the bedroom of their Oklahoma City home. Wearing only {{underwear}} to limit blood spatter on himself, he first shot his step-father. The shot awoke his mother, who he shot in the face. Sellers tried to disguise his guilt by arranging the crime scene to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> an intruder had committed the killings.|$|E
25|$|Chidambaram and Tung {{found that}} group size mattered immensely in a group’s performance. The smaller the group, {{the more likely}} each member was to participate, {{regardless}} of range (dispersed or collocated). The main difference stated between distributed and collocated groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in collocated groups. When others are present, people {{feel the need to}} <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are working hard, while those who are not in the presence of others do not.|$|E
25|$|Concretions {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} rocks, but are {{particularly}} common in shales, siltstones, and sandstones. They often outwardly resemble fossils or rocks that <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they do not belong to the stratum in which they were found. Occasionally, concretions contain a fossil, either as its nucleus or as a component that was incorporated during its growth but concretions are not fossils themselves. They appear in nodular patches, concentrated along bedding planes, protruding from weathered cliffsides, randomly distributed over mudhills or perched on soft pedestals.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Ó Sé's side would {{dominate}} football for the foreseeable future. In 2001 he guided Kerry to another Munster title and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a second consecutive All-Ireland title was on the cards. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final {{proved to be a}} reality check as Meath trounced the Kingdom by 2-14 to 0-5.|$|R

25|$|Keith Harrison and Mary Chapman {{described}} {{strong evidence}} for a lake {{in the eastern part}} of Valles Marineris, especially in Coprates Chasma. It would have had an average depth of only 842m—much shallower than the 5–10km depth of parts of Valles Marineris. Still, its volume of 110,000km3 would be comparable to Earth's Caspian Sea. The main evidence for such a lake is the presence of benches at the level that models show is where the lake level should be. Also, the low point in Eos Chasma where water would be expected to overflow is marked by fluvial features. The features <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the flow came together in a small area and caused significant erosion.|$|E
25|$|Two black-figure vase {{painters}} {{are considered}} to be mannerists (540-520 BC). The painter Elbows Out decorated primarily Little Masters cups. The extended elbows of his figures are conspicuous, a characteristic responsible for his pragmatic name. He only seldom depicted mythological scenes; erotic scenes are much more common. He also decorated a rare vase form known as a lydion. The most important of the two painters was The Affecter, whose name comes from the exaggeratedly artificial impression made by his figures. These small-headed figures {{do not seem to be}} acting as much as posing. His early work shows scenes of daily life; later he turned to decorative scenes in which figures and attributes are recognizable, but hardly actions. If his figures are clothed they <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were padded; if they are naked they are very angular. The Affecter was both potter and painter; over 130 of his vases have survived.|$|E
25|$|Montoto {{went on to}} be the {{president}} of Metropolitano, a railway consortium. During Montoto's tenure in this position, the General Audit Office and ARI both issued reports stating that the awarding of this concession to him had led to deterioration in the railway service. Montoto's partnership in this and other early ventures with Sergio Tasselli, a leading K-businessman, also raised questions at the time. In 2003, La Nación said that Tasselli, whose businesses, according to the newspaper, are always under “a pall of suspicion,” was “quietly building an economic empire” that was growing “in the shadows,” and that his “associates generally do not come from the world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.” Instead of improving the train service provided by Metropolitano, Montoto reportedly directed Alejandra Rafuls to film train operations and to edit the film {{in such a way as}} to make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> customers were themselves responsible for the service problems.|$|E

25|$|Fairy Rosebud {{enters the}} Abode of Demon Alcohol, who {{complains}} bitterly {{about the law}} that requires demons to speak in verse; and indeed he is very bad at it. Rosebud is depressed because the Fairy Queen has {{told her that her}} incompetence can no longer be tolerated; unless she becomes more attentive to her duties of protecting mortals from demons, she will be sent to the back row of the ballet chorus. She had decided to protect and assist Aloysius Parfitt, a clergyman, and Jane Collins, a nurse. Jane has attracted the attention of Sir Trevor Mauleverer, a colonel in the Life Guards, who Rosebud believes to be a wicked baronet. Rosebud asks the demon to carry Jane off to Sir Trevor's apartment (making it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Sir Trevor has had her carried off) so that Rosebud can then rescue Jane and restore her to Aloysius. The demon is attracted to Rosebud and agrees. However, Jane is really Lady Angela Wealdstone, a lady of fashion, in disguise, and Sir Trevor is really an honourable man. Nevertheless, Lady Angela has run away from home to avoid being forced by her father into an arranged marriage with Sir Trevor.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft—a midwing monoplane {{of mostly}} wooden construction dubbed the Stipa-Caproni or Caproni Stipa—was strikingly ungainly in appearance. The fuselage was a barrel-like tube, short and fat, open {{at both ends}} to form the tapered duct, with twin open cockpits in tandem mounted in a hump on top of it. The wings were elliptical and passed through the duct and the engine nacelle inside it. The duct itself had a profile {{similar to that of}} the airfoils, and a fairly small rudder and elevators were mounted on the trailing edge of the duct, allowing the ducted propeller wash to flow directly over them as it exited the fuselage to improve handling. The propeller was mounted inside the fuselage tube, flush with the leading edge of the fuselage, and the 120-horsepower de Havilland Gipsy III engine that powered it was mounted within the duct behind it at the midpoint of the fuselage. The aircraft had low, fixed, spatted main landing gear and a tailwheel, making it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was squatting when on the ground. It was painted in a blue-and-cream scheme of the type used on racing aircraft of the day, and its rudder bore the colors of the Italian flag.|$|E
25|$|The Classical Revival {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Nathan C. Wyeth, an architect {{in private practice in}} the city, and Major Max C. Tyler, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers. The legislation authorizing the bridge's construction required that the United States Department of War consult with the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) {{in the design of the}} bridge. Subsequently, the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers asked the CFA for a list of architects whom the CFA believed would be competent to design an aesthetically pleasing bridge. The CFA swiftly provided a list, and in July 1916 Tyler met with the CFA to discuss a short list of potential architects. The CFA and Tyler also conferred on the bridge's orientation, design, and approaches. Tyler selected Wyeth. The plans were nearly complete by September. Wyeth and Tyler's initial design for the bridge was a double-deck structure with a single, high span. But with World War I erupting in Europe, inflation made this structure too costly. Wyeth then submitted a design for a single-deck, single-span bridge on January 12, 1917. The CFA asked Wyeth to design a multi-span bridge, or, failing that, to construct non-structural decorative elements that would make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the bridge had multiple spans. Wyeth agreed, and the CFA approved the bridge design.|$|E
