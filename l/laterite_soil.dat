5|$|In December 1895, {{two months}} after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular {{resistance}} to French rule emerged {{in the form of the}} menalamba ("red shawl") rebellion. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity and political corruption quickly spread throughout the island and was principally conducted by peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red <b>laterite</b> <b>soil</b> of the highlands. The resistance movement gained ground until it was effectively put down by the French military at the end of 1897. Members of Ranavalona's court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen's uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her minister of war, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen's aunt, was exiled to Réunion, as the French were reluctant to execute a woman.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, <b>laterite</b> <b>soil</b> and sandy soil and they knew what crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Soil erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environment}} degradation problems. However reliable measurement of soil erosion remains limited and estimates of soil productivity are even rare. Identification and assessment of erosion problems play an important role in influencing better land use and conservation practices. Rainfall simulators are considered as an effective tool in soil conservation research. Simulators make it possible to produce predetermined storms at any desired instant and location. <b>Laterite</b> <b>soils</b> are by far the most important soil group occurring in Kerala. The present study was undertaken to estimate the erodibility and runoff potential of the three well-defined series of <b>laterite</b> <b>soils,</b> viz. Mannamkulam series, Naduvattom series and Vellanikkara series under various simulated rainfall intensities and land slopes. The results of the study showed that soil loss and runoff increased with increased rainfall intensity for all the slopes in all the selected soil types. A general trend of increase in soil loss and runoff with slope was also observed in all the three series of soils studied.

2500|$|After {{about a month}} passed, {{the food}} in the {{fortress}} began to run low and the defenders {{were on the verge}} of starvation. Sang Rajuna Tapa was then asked to distribute whatever grain left to the people from the royal store. Seeing this opportunity for revenge, the minister lied to the King, saying the stores were empty. The grains were not distributed and the people eventually starved. The final assault came when the gates were finally opened under the order of the treacherous minister. The Majapahit soldiers rushed into the fortress and a terrible massacre ensues.

2500|$|Agriculture was {{the main}} {{occupation}} of the ancient Tamils and the most respected. Farmers were aware of different soil types, the best crops to grow and the various irrigation systems suitable for any given region. In the five geographical divisions of the Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. Land was classified, according to its fertility, as Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land), Vanpulam (hardland) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Menpulam yielded rich produce {{on a variety of}} crops, but [...] Pinpulam was cultivated only with dry crops due to limited irrigation facilities. The yield from Vanpulam was limited, while Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation.

25|$|<b>Laterite</b> <b>soils</b> {{have a high}} clay content, which {{mean they}} have higher Cation Exchange Capacity and water-holding {{capacity}} than sandy soils. However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded <b>laterite</b> <b>soils</b> in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} {{published}} version. It was first published by IISTE at [URL] ambiguity {{of the use of}} the term ‘laterite’ to generally classify tropical soils especially for engineering purposes needed to be addressed. An attempt was made to analyze the silica-sesquioxide ratio of some Niger Delta soils to establish whether these soils which are formed in the tropic are indeed laterites. This ratio is used because it is generally accepted as a parameter in the classification and specification of laterites and can be measured with some degree of accuracy in the laboratory. This study revealed that these soils (except the ferralsols) which were soft when wet and significantly hard when air-dried could not be called <b>laterite</b> <b>soils</b> because of the high silica-sesquioxide ratios. It is envisaged that this study would help the engineers in the region to have a better understanding of the soils which are erroneously acclaimed and handled as <b>laterite</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
