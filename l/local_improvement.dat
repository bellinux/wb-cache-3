The station of Fountain was on the rail line and Provincial Highway 14 in 1907. Lanigan received steel in 1907.

On April 30, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced the approval of $75 million in federal funding for the Eastside streetcar project, the full amount that had been requested by Portland. This allocation, secured in large part through the efforts of Oregon Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Peter DeFazio, was both the largest and the final component of the financing plan, and consequently the announcement meant the project could proceed to construction as soon as the city council had approved construction contracts. Twenty million dollars in state funds, $15.5 million from a <b>Local</b> <b>Improvement</b> District and a combination of various other local or regional sources complete the funding plan. Construction began in August 2009.|$|E

500|$|With the {{establishment}} of settlements and population came the attendant need for education, health, fire and police protection and an urgent need to improve methods of travel. The North-West Territories established departments, which did not last long, and were soon replaced by a rural administrative system called <b>local</b> <b>improvement</b> districts (LID). <b>Local</b> <b>improvement</b> districts were very large, and with the early dirt trails for roads, and {{a limited number of}} automobiles, the area was found much too large to administer. The LID soon gave way to the rural municipality (RM) system of rural civic administration and encompassed on average nine townships, three by three in area, which were each [...] square, and with some modifications is still the rural administration in use today. This civic government with its elected officials attended to the maintenance and construction of the early pioneer road.|$|E

The main result {{of this paper is}} that any given segment triangulation can be transformed by a finite sequence of <b>local</b> <b>improvements</b> in a segment triangulation that has the same topological structure as the segment Delaunay triangulation.
