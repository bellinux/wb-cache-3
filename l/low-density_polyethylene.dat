Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (<b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylene)</b> is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet.

500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. They can be protected by antiozonants. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the tensile strain in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in <b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylene.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{landmark in}} the commercial production of polyethylene began {{with the development of}} catalyst that promoted the polymerization at mild temperatures and pressures. The first of these was a chromium trioxide–based catalyst discovered in 1951 by Robert Banks and J. Paul Hogan at Phillips Petroleum. In 1953 the German chemist Karl Ziegler developed a catalytic system based on titanium halides and organoaluminium compounds that worked at even milder conditions than the Phillips catalyst. The Phillips catalyst is less expensive and easier to work with, however, and both methods are heavily used industrially. By the end of the 1950s both the Phillips- and Ziegler-type catalysts were being used for HDPE production. In the 1970s, the Ziegler system was improved by the incorporation of magnesium chloride. [...] Catalytic systems based on soluble catalysts, the metallocenes, were reported in 1976 by Walter Kaminsky and Hansjörg Sinn. The Ziegler- and metallocene-based catalysts families have proven to be very flexible at copolymerizing ethylene with other olefins and have become the basis for the wide range of polyethylene resins available today, including very low density polyethylene and linear <b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylene.</b> Such resins, in the form of UHMWPE fibers, have (as of 2005) begun to replace aramids in many high-strength applications.|$|E
2500|$|Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first {{manufacturing}} site in Canada, {{located in the}} Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as [...] "The Blob", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected {{nearly half of the}} site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. [...] The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The <b>Low-Density</b> <b>Polyethylene</b> and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit on April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the vacant site, which was sold to TransAlta. The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the numerical prediction of the extrudate swell behaviour of branched polymer melts in a planar configuration. The multi-mode extended pom-pom (XPP) model is used to describe the polymer dynamics. A second-order operator-integration-factor splitting scheme is used for the temporal discretisation of the problem, whilst a spectral element scheme is used in space. The free surface is evolved in a Lagrangian manner using the third-order conditionally stable Adams–Bashforth method. A thorough mesh convergence study is performed with respect to the temporal and spatial discretisation parameters. The influence {{of the nature of the}} discrete relaxation spectrum on the swelling ratio and as an indicator of polydispersity is investigated. The predictions of numerical simulations are also compared with a selection of experimental results from the literature. The parameters in the XPP model are determined from rheological data.

40|$|Micromorphology is an {{important}} factor in determining polymer properties and uses. Here, steady-state and dynamic fluorescence from covalently attached 1 -alkylpyrenyl groups are used to investigate the micromorphology of several random ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers with defined compositions of vinyl acetate monomer. The results are compared with those from homopolymers of high- and <b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> and poly(vinyl acetate). Selective attachment of pyren- 1 -yl groups to polymer chains was accomplished by irradiation of pyren- 1 -yldiazomethane sorbed into polymer films. Steady-state fluorescence spectra and fluorescence decay rates of attached pyrenyl groups in films of the polymers have been compared with those from films with sorbed pyrene. I 1 /I 3 intensity ratios from vibrational bands in the fluorescence spectra and the fluorescence decay rates of attached 1 -alkylpyrenyl groups are much less sensitive to changes in the copolymer composition than are those of pyrene. These observations suggest that attachment occurs selectively to the olefinic segments (rather than to the acetate-rich regions) of polymer chains of EVA copolymers.

The crystallization and melting behavior of these blends were examined by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The blends of metallocene-catalyzed VLDPE 1 and LDPEs showed a smooth change in both crystallization and melting peak temperatures, indicating that there was co-crystallization and, hence, partial miscibility at all compositions.

It is concluded that either complete or partial miscibility has occurred between the two polyethylenes {{in each of the}} blends with VLDPE 2. Nevertheless, VLDPE 2 did not cause a significant change in the morphology of VLDPE 1, perhaps because of the reduced number of long branches present in VLDPE 2 compared with LDPEs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An ethylene-hexene copolymer, {{representative}} of many heterogeneous linear <b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (LLDPEs), {{has been shown}} to contain a dispersed minority phase (volume fraction 10 - 2), which was manifested by departures from a Q- 2 variation of the neutron scattering cross section at low Q values. After xylene extraction, which removes the highly branched amorphous material, the dispersed phase is removed to a good approximation. In contrast, a metallocene-based LLDPE, which has a more homogeneous distribution of branch contents, does not exhibit an upturn in the cross section in the limit of low momentum transfer (Q < 10 - 2 Å- 1), indicating that the LLDPE forms only a single phase in the melt. The composition variance is calculated from the comonomer composition distribution obtained by temperature-rising elution fractionation (TREF) and used to estimate proximity of the melts to the spinodal condition. These findings support previous conclusions for compositionally polydisperse LLDPEs, whereby the highly branched molecules in the distribution may phase segregate, even if the overall branch content is low. When this component is not present, as in metallocene-based LLDPEs, the system forms a single phase in the melt...|$|R
40|$|Various {{rheological}} properties {{have been studied}} for two kinds of <b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (LDPEs) : One is produced by tubular process (tubular LDPE) and the other by vessel process (vessel LDPE). The latter shows smaller g’-parameter, the ratio of intrinsic viscosity to that of linear polyethylene. It was found that both LDPEs exhibit marked strain hardening behavior, i. e., upturn departure from the low strain rate asymptote, in both uniaxial and biaxial elongational viscosities, with stronger strain hardening in uniaxial elongation. Further, the vessel LDPE exhibits larger upturn behavior than the tubular LDPE. In the stress relaxation measurement, the vessel LDPE shows larger damping function, while the tubular LDPE shows similar values to those predicted by the Doi-Edwards theory. Furthermore, {{there is a significant}} difference in the effect of the shear history on the melt strength. The melt strength of the vessel LDPE decreases more rapidly with the shear history than that of the tubular LDPE. All these differences between the two types of LDPEs are due to the difference in the branch structure. The complex, multi-branched structure of the vessel LDPE gives much more prominent elastic features. Figure 1 - 10 are not included in this manuscript...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of molten}} polymeric materials {{is known to}} be less sensitive to shear than to extensional deformations.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of the composition of mixed plastic wastes on the thermoplastic properties of coal, the generation of coking pressure {{and the quality of the}} resulting cokes in a movable wall oven at semipilot scale. The mixed plastic wastes were selected to cover a wide spectrum in the relative proportions of high- and <b>low-density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (HDPE and LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). From the results it was deduced that the reduction in Gieseler fluidity in the coal blend is linked to the total amount of polyolefins in the waste. It was also found that these thermoplastics increase the pressure exerted against the wall in the course of the coking process and that coke quality is maintained or even improved. However, when the level of aromatic polymers such PS and PET are increased at the expense of polyolefins, the coking pressure decreases. Thus, the amount of aromatic polymers such as PS and PET in the waste is critical, not only for controlling Gieseler fluidity and coking pressure, but also for avoiding deterioration in coke quality (reactivity towards CO CRI and mechanical strength of the partially-gasified coke CSR). An amount of polyolefins in the waste lower than 65 wt. % for a secure coking pressure is established. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|R
