40|$|In the {{framework}} of the HERA Luminosity Upgrade Project it is foreseen to move the final focus quadrupole magnets of the proton machine 16 m closer to the interac-tion region. As the electrons must not be affected by these magnets, the beam pipes for electrons and protons have to be well separated at these magnets. This implies rather sharp bends with bending radii down to 360 m for the elec-tron orbit in the interaction region. At an electron energy of 30 GeV and a beam current of 58 mA these bends cause a high level of synchrotron radiation. The synchrotron radia-tion will be guided through the interaction region and will be absorbed far downstream at low <b>power</b> <b>densities.</b> How-ever, it is unavoidable to stop parts of the synchrotron radi-ation beam at high <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> of up to 2 kW/cm rather close to the interaction point where the electron and proton vacuum systems are separated. In order to protect the proton final focus magnet and the septum beam pipe from this synchrotron radiation, a high power synchrotron radiation absorber was designed. This absorber not only has to withstand the heat load of the synchrotron radiation, but it also has to be designed to minimize the backward scattering of the radiation, because these scattered photons might hit sensitive detector components in the interaction region. This paper will first give an overview of the geometry of the interaction region with special emphasis on the syn-chrotron radiation. Then the geometrical and thermal re-quirements for the high power absorber will be described and finally the layout of the absorber will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The fuel used in {{commercial}} nuclear power reactors is uranium, generally {{in the form}} of an oxide. The gas-cooled reactors developed in England use metallic uranium enclosed in a thin layer of Magnox. Since this fuel must be processed into a more stable form before disposal, we will not consider the characteristics of the Magnox spent fuel. The vast majority of the remaining power reactors in the world use uranium dioxide pellets in Zircaloy cladding as the fuel material. Reactors that are fueled with uranium dioxide generally use water as the moderator. If ordinary water is used, the reactors are called Light Water Reactors (LWR), while if water enriched in the deuterium isotope of hydrogen is used, the reactors are called Heavy Water reactors. The LWRs can be either pressurized reactors (PWR) or boiling water reactors (BWR). Both of these reactor types use uranium that has been enriched in the 235 isotope to about 3. 5 to 4 % total abundance. There may be minor differences in the details of the spent fuel characteristics for PWRs and BWRs, but for simplicity we will not consider these second-order effects. The Canadian designed reactor (CANDU) that is moderated by heavy water uses natural uranium without enrichment of the 235 isotope as the fuel. These reactors run at higher <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> than LWRs and produce spent fuel with lower total burn-up than LWRs.

The {{results show that the}} intensity of the subcooled boiling-induced vibration (SBIV) was influenced strongly by the conditions of the subcooling temperature, <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> and flow velocity. Implosive bubble formation and collapse are the main nature of subcooled boiling, and their behaviors are the only sources to originate from SBIV. Therefore, in order to explain the phenomenon of SBIV, it is essential to obtain reliable information about bubble behavior in subcooled boiling conditions. This was investigated at different conditions of coolant subcooling temperatures of 25 to 75 °C, coolant flow velocities of 0. 16 to 0. 53 m/s, and linear power densities of 100 to 600 W/cm. High speed photography at 13, 500 frames per second was performed at these conditions. The results show that even at the highest subcooling condition, the absolute majority of bubbles collapse very close to the surface after detaching from the heating surface. Based on these observations, a simple model of surface tension and momentum change is introduced to offer a rough quantitative estimate of the force exerted on the heating surface during the bubble ebullition. The formation of a typical bubble in subcooled boiling is predicted to exert an excitation force in the order of 10 - 4 N.

40|$|A BWR-based SMR {{called the}} Novel Modular Reactor (NMR- 50) is being {{developed}} at Purdue University. NMR- 50 takes {{the advantages of the}} two-phase flow driving head, which allows a much smaller and simpler reactor pressure vessel compared to the integral PWRs. The NMR- 50 has a long-life core design and a net electrical power output of 50 MWe. In this work, optimum core design options pertaining to the application of a long-life small modular BWR are studied. The primary core design objective is to meet a 10 -year cycle length with a minimum fuel cost while satisfying safety related criteria. The lattice code CASMO- 4, the whole core analysis code PARCS and the thermal-hydraulics code RELAP 5 were used to perform calculations from pin cell level up to whole core depletion calculations. ^ The first core design option for the NMR- 50 that was analyzed and optimized was based on the existing industry standards and constraints in order to promote near-term deployment. Through a systematic step-wise optimization approach including a simulated annealing based optimization method, an optimum core design that meets the core design objective was derived and analyzed. The optimized NMR- 50 foundational core design is able to achieve a 10. 2 year cycle length with an average fuel enrichment of 4. 61 wt% of 235 U in a 10 x 10 lattice fuel assembly. The minimum critical power ratio (MCPR) and the maximum fuel <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> (MFLPD) during the cycle are 1. 99 and 18. 25 kW/m, respectively, providing large margins to thermal design constraints. The NMR- 50 control system design is able to provide a sufficient cold shutdown margin of 1. 7 %. With its small reactor core size, large negative void coefficient, and low operating thermal neutron flux, an enhanced xenon stability characteristic is possible. Peak fast neutron fluence of 8. 8 x 1021 n/cm 2 was below the industry standard limit, which from extensive plant data records, should not be a major concern to channel distortions from a radiation damage point of view. ^ An evolutionary fuel assembly design concept based on partial segregation of fertile material was developed as a mean of extending fuel cycle length. The additional degree of freedom in the heterogeneous fuel assembly design was thoroughly analyzed through the utilization of the fissile material and the conversion efficiency of the fertile material. Two different designs for a heterogeneous fertile material loading (HFL) within an assembly, one based on the ThO 2 and UO 2 once-through fuel cycle and the other based solely on existing UO 2 once-through fuel cycle were assessed. The HFL-thorium/ uranium based and the HFL-uranium based assembly design options resulted in a 20 % and an 18 % increase in cycle length when compared to the foundational NMR- 50 design option. The reactivity feedback coefficients were almost maintained at the same level at {{the beginning and the end}} of cycle for all design options. The MFLPD of the HFL-Th/DU and the HFL-DU were 35 kW/m and 31 kW/m, respectively, indicating a significant margin to the imposed thermal design limit of 45 kW/m. The MCPR for the HFL-Th/DU and the HFL-DU were 1. 95 and 1. 98, respectively, for the most limiting conditions, indicating sufficient margin to the critical power ratio limit of 1. 3. The core-average plutonium production rate was reduced by 20 % and its content was degraded in the HFL design. Importantly, the levelized fuel cycle unit cost was reduced by approximately 20 % in the HFL assembly options when compared to its reference NMR- 50 design counterpart. ...|$|E

The first constructs an estimate of the velocity field derived from the galaxy over-density δg and the second makes use of the matter <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> <b>power</b> spectrum Pk. Through the use of N-body simulations we demonstrate that, with mea-surements with a suitably high signal-to-noise, we can successfully reconstruct the velocity and gravitational potential field out to z. 0. 3. This will prove useful for future tests of gravity, as these relatively deep maps are complementary to weak lensing maps at the same redshift.
