50|$|The Republic of Kosovo is a {{democracy}} {{working under the}} Rule of <b>Law,</b> <b>respect</b> for its Constitution and laws, and the recognition of international law. The production of laws has grown considerably, and basic laws essential to {{the operation of the}} justice system have been adopted. As provided in the Law on Legislative Initiatives, laws in Kosovo are initiated either by the President, the Government, members of the Assembly or initiatives of 10, 000 citizens. The vast majority of laws originate with the Executive Branch of the Government, where Ministries are responsible for proposing legislation as well as overseeing drafts and amendments of primary and secondary laws. Members of the Assembly can propose amendments to legislation by submitting a motion to the Assembly Table and the government for its opinion. Ministry drafts are sent to the Office of Legal Support Services (OLSS) within the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). The laws undergo a second tier of review at the Government level, from the OLSS, Ministry of Finance (MoF)and Agency for European Integration (AEI). After their review and approval the law is sent to the Coordinating Group of the Government and finally proceeds to the Assembly for review and adoption.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{addresses}} a significant gapin the conceptualization fbusiness ethics within different cultural influences. Though theoretical models of business ethics have recognized th. e importance {{of culture in}} ethical deci-sion-making, few have examined how this influences ethical decision-making. Therefore, this paper develops proposi-tions concerning the influence of various cultural dimen-sions on ethical decision-making using Hofstede's typology. Over the last decade, the topic of social responsibility and ethics in business has been of significant interest to scholars. However, {{few studies have been}} cross-cultural in content, even though existing theoretical models recognize the importance of this factor (e. g., Ferrell and Gresham, 1985; Hunt and Vitell, 1986 and 1992). Barrels (1967) {{was one of the first}} to note the importance of the role of culture in ethics decision-making identifying cultural factors such as values and customs, religion, <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> for indi-viduality, national identity and loyalty (or patri-otism), and rights of property as influencing ethics, Scot @ VitelI is Associate Professor of Marketing and holder of th...|$|E
40|$|The Namibian Constitution grounds {{the legal}} system in values such as the rule of law, democracy, equality, respect for human dignity, freedom etc. My aim was to {{approach}} the Constitution as a transformative document. This is mainly because the Constitution aims to transform the Namibian society from one characterized by injustice and inequality for example, to a society where the principle of equality reigns supreme, and where the rule of <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> for human dignity etc. are the distinguishing characteristics of the legal order. However, the study noted the Constitution’s failure to entrench socioeconomic rights as justiciable rights and the question was raised whether this necessarily undermines the Constitution’s transformative goals. Overall, my aim was to consider {{to what extent the}} approach of Dworkin could address this failure. This study was undertaken out of two concerns; firstly, the Namibian Constitution can be termed a ‘classical liberal’ document which emphasizes civil and political rights at the expense of socio-economic rights; and secondly, the Supreme Court of Namibia’s current approach to constitutional interpretation is inadequate to realize the transformative aims of the Constitution. Whereas Namibia’s Supreme Court has over the past 23 twenty-three years underlined the need to construe the Constitution broadly, liberally, and purposively, it has failed to do so consistently, thus casting doubt on the objectivity of constitutional values. For example, the Court’s decision in S v Mushwena & Others is one that hardly resonates with constitutional values of respect for the rule of <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> for human dignity, and the right to fair trial. Nonetheless, I argued that Dworkin’s approach of constructive interpretation and law as integrity could address both the Constitution’s failure to entrench socio-economic rights and also the Supreme Court’s incoherent approach to constitutional interpretation. To this end, the study recommends a moral reading of the Namibian Constitution, one based on Dworkin’s theory of constructive interpretation and law as integrity. This moral reading of the Constitution is not only to be limited to civil and political rights, but also to socio-economic rights implied in the principles of state policy.

40|$|Indonesia is {{the country}} founded on law and not only power. Hence, the {{tackling}} of terrorism as a criminal offense must also be founded on <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> and protection of human rights of the suspect, defendant, and convict. Human rights are guaranteed by the positive law in Indonesia. The party alleged as the terrorist can be arrested for two years without a trial, is not {{in accordance with the}} law founded on Pancasila which requires a guarantee for a just and civilized humanity to create justice for all Indonesian people based on the supreme of law.   Any violation of law by anyone including the law enforcer cannot be justified.   Consequently, a criminal policy is necessary by using penal and non-penal tools so that the law can be enforced effectively without endangering the value of legal basis in the forms of legal certainty, justice, and expediency. The law enforcement must also be accompanied by faith to avoid violation of law. Thus, the tackling of crime related to terrorism really characterizes human rights enforcement founded on the value of legal basis. </p...|$|E

A country is considered to be democratic if it offers equal opportunities for progress for everyone, provided progress is based on just and defined criteria that are strictly applied and not on grounds of somebody’s power in society or support by certain person or group. If progress is not based on rules, but rather on affiliation to certain power centres, the percentage of exclusion of others who lack access to such opportunities would be very high. Accordingly, the rule of law would be replaced with the rule of somebody’s will.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the European Union {{programme}} devoted to the eastern neighboring states. Through its European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU works with its southern and eastern neighbours to achieve the closest possible political association and the greatest possible degree of economic integration. This goal builds on common interests and values — democracy, the rule of <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> for human rights, and social cohesion. The EU is concerned that, despite sufficient funding and support from the EU, the targeted states did not raise to the EU targets for the programme {{or at least to}} a relevant one. We assume that such fact happened mostly because, although having very diverse economic and reform pasts emerged from the post-soviet period, they were considered and approached as a single group. The main hypothesis: has the umbrella of the EU funds in terms of the EaP provided for the six targeted states to intensify the growth of regional interdependencies as well as political cooperation and progressive economic integration? The main goal of the paper is to assess, by means of the statistical and comparison approach, the development and the economic sustainability of six tar...|$|E
40|$|Legitimacy regards evaluative {{criteria}} for the obligation to obey the law. Besides the concept of legality (law should be created by authoritative bodies), we need the concept of legitimacy to explain the authority of law and the citizens' duty of obedience to the <b>law.</b> <b>Respect</b> for legal principles reinforce the law's claim to legitimacy, for legal principles serve the law's aim of justice. They are expressions of the values the law serves and {{can be seen as}} a bridge to the norms and values of a society. As such, they are evaluative {{criteria for}} the law and, therefore, for the law's claim to legitimacy. Thus, legal principles function as essential criteria of evaluation for law-making by the judiciary, and its legitimacy. The judiciary is bound by legal principles. Subsequently, in this report, some topics in legal theory regarding the role of principles in judicial decision-making were analysed, e. g., the determination of the aim of ambiguous law, the standards of rationality in the implementation of principles, and the relationship between principles, rules, and the facts of the case. Finally, some aspects of judicial practice and the contribution of judicial communication and of symbolic judicial decisions to judicial legitimacy were discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Following the {{successful}} membership to NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007, Romania witnessed a serious democratic setback. As {{in other countries}} in the region, the backsliding is due to the lifting of the external conditionality and monitoring. This is the moment when political elites in power got rid of previous constraints and refused to respect the minimum consensus set up previously in order to reach the external membership targets, namely to obey to the rule of <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> the constitutional stability and work for the good governance. The new context, labeled by some scholars as post-accession hooliganism, is thus marked by the extended use of the executive power, the revival of political arbitrary, partisanship, pervasive corruption and abuse. In Romania, post-accession hooliganism developed under the populist banner of state reinvigoration, modernization and constitutional reform, with brutal attacks against politically neutral institutions and all intermediate liberal democratic institutions that mediate representation, and more specially against parliament. This is a recent feature in Romanian politics that raises much concern about the full consolidation of democracy in the context of persistent economic crisis. With the democratic institutions severely weakened, the ground might be prepared for much more radical political action, which {{can be seen as a}} serious threat for an unconsolidated democracy...|$|E

In managing our resources, we {{need to realize that}} they are limited and need to be managed more sustainably, responsibly, and accountably. Sustainable management of the resources is only possible if we practice good governance, which calls for respect for the rule of <b>law,</b> <b>respect</b> for human rights, a willingness to give space and a voice to the weak and the more vulnerable in our societies; that we respect the voice of the minority, even while accepting the decision of the majority, and respect diversity.
