5|$|Northerners {{assumed that}} Fillmore, hailing from a free state, was an {{opponent}} of the spread of slavery. Southerners {{accused him of being}} an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely published letter that slavery was an evil, but one that the federal government had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis over the South Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket <b>looked</b> <b>good,</b> especially in the Northeast.|$|E
5|$|Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Caroline Wozniacki in {{the first}} of the quarterfinals. Kuznetsova <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> to win the match in {{straight}} sets after building a big lead, however Wozniacki fought back to win the second set on a tiebreak. Kuznetsova ultimately won. Victoria Azarenka defeated Samantha Stosur in the second quarterfinal. Williams sisters Serena and Venus set up the second semifinal after defeating Li Na and Iveta Benešová respectively. The Williams sisters had met 19 times before their semifinal meeting, Venus leading the head-to-head tally 10–9. Serena won this time in a closely fought match. Azarenka came on top in the second semifinal defeating Kuznetsova.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

5|$|Type-0 had {{a highly}} {{positive}} reception in Japan, with it garnering near-perfect scores in Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. Import reviews were also fairly positive, sharing many points of praise with the Japanese reviews. Type-0 HD {{also received a}} positive reception in the west, with main praise going to the story, characters and action-based gameplay. Other aspects came in for criticism, such as elements of the graphics upgrade, the real-time strategy segments, and the localization. Western previews of Agito have also been positive, with critics agreeing that it <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> on the platform and worked well from a gameplay standpoint. Final Fantasy XV was positively received by many journalists; praise went to aspects of the story, the main characters, battle system and graphics, while the overarching plot, supporting cast and other technical elements such as the camera and late-game changes in gameplay were criticized.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E

25|$|Race three {{initially}} <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> for Oracle as Spithill luffed Team New Zealand at {{the reach}} mark to successfully draw a penalty. Oracle held the lead {{for the first}} downwind leg, and were 18 seconds to the good heading into the upwind third leg. The pivotal moment of the race occurred when Barker brought the New Zealand boat back on port tack within three boat lengths of the boundary. Oracle was forced to tack away due to the boundary rights, {{even though they were}} on starboard which would have otherwise have had right of way. The 29 second lead at the top mark was held by the Kiwis {{all the way to the}} finish, crossing 28 seconds ahead of the Americans to go 0–3 up.|$|E
25|$|Surrey Lions {{recorded}} {{their second}} win from two matches in Twenty20 Cup cricket this season, ironic given their {{position at the}} very bottom of the 45-over National League. Ali Brown made 64 and David Thornely 67 not out as Middlesex Crusaders conceded too many runs at the fine batting track at Lord's, Surrey making 200 for 3. Owais Shah notched up his second score in the 70s in two days, taking 78 from 44 balls, and things <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> despite Shah leaving at 148 for 2. But Tim Murtagh changed all that. In four overs, he took six for 24, {{and with the help of}} David Thornely (three for 22) he ensured that Middlesex had seven batsmen out in single figures. They were bowled out for 177, with three balls remaining in the innings.|$|E

25|$|Gibbons made 51 out of Bermuda's 217 {{against the}} Netherlands, {{who lost their}} last four wickets for 12 runs to lose by 30 runs (Lightbourne 4-44). Canada's openers Dipchand (105) and Prashad (129) shared an opening {{partnership}} of 233 as their country made 356/2; Fiji made 109 to lose by a mammoth 247 runs. Israel made a highly respectable 262 against Gibraltar, with Z Moshe making 77, Perlman 69 and S Nemblette 63, but P White's 5-48 for the Gibraltarians proved important; they won by three wickets with eight balls to spare thanks to five scores of between 35 and 49. Hong Kong's 257/8 (Brian Catton 63, Ray Brewster) against Papua New Guinea <b>looked</b> <b>good,</b> but 55 from Vai and 50 from Maha was enough to get PNG home by two wickets with two overs in hand.|$|E
25|$|The second Test at Adelaide started {{much more}} {{positively}} for England, {{who had made}} several changes to their side, bringing in spinner Richard Dawson, Steve Harmison and Robert Key for the injured Ashley Giles, Simon Jones and John Crawley. Nasser Hussain won the toss and this time decided to bat, a decision that <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> as England advanced to 295 for 4 {{by the end of}} the day. However, this confident score was largely built around a massive 177 from Michael Vaughan, who was finally out to the last ball of the day, edging Andy Bichel to slip. No other England batsmen passed fifty, and Vaughan himself was lucky to escape dismissal on just 19 when he seemed to have been caught off Bichel by Justin Langer – TV replays proved inconclusive. Key looked unimpressive, making just 1 run off 22 balls, and was soon put out of his misery by Shane Warne.|$|E
25|$|Yadav (0) {{was caught}} behind early on Day 4 and Shami (12) was out shortly after as India were bowled out for 465. David Warner started quickly as Australia's lead raced to 100 {{before he was}} adgudged lbw off Ashwin (40). Shane Watson (15*) and Chris Rogers (33*) {{continued}} until lunch with the score at 1/90, a lead of 155. Rain delayed the middle session {{for an hour and}} shortly after the interval, Watson (17) was caught behind off the bowling of Sharma. Steve Smith <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> at the crease as Rogers brought up his 4th consecutive fifty, until Smith was caught at leg slip for 14. Shaun Marsh and Rogers put on a good 33-run stand before Rogers (69) once again didn't go on with his fifty and make a big score when he played on off Ashwin. Joe Burns and Marsh lasted until tea at 4/174, leading by 239 runs. Marsh and Burns started slowly after tea and Burns was caught behind (9). Brad Haddin (13) was also caught behind not long after. Mitchell Johnson started slowly and threw away his wicket when he was caught at mid-wicket (15) as Marsh brought up a half-century. Ryan Harris (8*) and Marsh (62*) guided Australia to 7/261 at stumps, a lead of 326 runs.|$|E

25|$|In Qualifier 1, Mumbai won the toss {{and chose}} to bat first. Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma said the track <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> to bat first and get runs on board, while Dhoni said {{he wished to}} bowl first and {{believed}} his team could chase down totals. Mumbai's innings began steady with a 90-run opening partnership between Patel and Simmons which ended when Patel was dismissed for 35. After Simmons fell for a 51-ball 65 in the 14th over, Pollard arrived at the crease with the score reading 113 for 2. Even as wickets were falling at the other end, Pollard struck one four and five sixes in his innings of 41 which came off just 17 balls. Mumbai posted a total of 187 for 6 in their 20 overs. Chennai's run-chase started with Smith being dismissed for a duck by Malinga in the first over. They lost the wicket of Michael Hussey in the sixth over and the score read 46/2. Raina and Faf du Plessis then steadied the innings taking Chennai past 80 in the tenth over. In the 11th over, Harbhajan Singh dismissed Raina and Dhoni off consecutive balls. Following this, Chennai started losing wickets at regular intervals and were eventually bowled out for 162.|$|E
25|$|Feyenoord again {{participated in}} the Champions League in 2001–02, {{finishing}} third in a group containing Bayern Munich, Sparta Prague and Spartak Moscow. This meant Feyenoord continued their European season in the 2001–02 UEFA Cup instead of the second Champions League group stage. The disappointment of failing to reach the second group stage eventually resulted in optimism and celebration. By defeating SC Freiburg and Rangers, Feyenoord faced fellow Dutch club PSV in the quarter-finals. Both matches ended in 1–1 draws, and the clash went into extra time and a penalty shoot-out. Pierre van Hooijdonk, who had a superb season by scoring many free-kicks goals, secured Feyenoord's win by scoring a 90th minute equalizer before finishing PSV off by scoring the last goal in the penalty shoot-out. A 1–0 win in Milan against Internazionale and a 2–2 return match in Rotterdam then earned Feyenoord {{a spot in the}} final, against Borussia Dortmund. Coincidentally, the final was held at De Kuip, and as a result, most spectators inside the stadium were Feyenoord fans. Feyenoord took a 2–0 lead thanks to another free-kick goal and a penalty by Van Hooijdonk. Early in the second half, Márcio Amoroso scored a goal to make it 2–1. Jon Dahl Tomasson then made it 3–1 and things <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> for Feyenoord. Dortmund only managed to score one more goal and the cup was won by Bert van Marwijk's Feyenoord.|$|E

25|$|Ray Lindwall {{returned}} to Test bowling by dismissing Len Hutton {{with a beautiful}} swinging ball which moved from middle stump to flick {{the edge of his}} bat and was caught by Colin McCool at first slip. Bill Edrich joined Cyril Washbrook and together they took the score to 147/1 {{by the end of the}} second day, Edrich hit 10 fours in his 85 while Washbrook struck only 1 four in his 54. Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised £1 a run if he made a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> for a big score. When he {{returned to}} the England dressing room he complained that he had hit the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Jack Ikin (48) and Norman Yardley (61) dug in for two over hours and restored the innings with a stand of 113 until McCool (2/53) bowled the vice-captain and Dooland (4/69) removed Ikin and Voce with successive balls. With England 298/8 there was still a chance that they could overtake Australia for the first time in the series. Godfrey Evans made 17 and added 26 with Alec Bedser who swung the bat for 27 not out making 27 runs for the last wicket with Wright until the spinner was bowled by Johnson and England were out for 351, 14 runs behind.|$|E
