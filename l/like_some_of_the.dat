5|$|Hydrogen, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above {{room temperature}}, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but {{can be made to}} react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
5|$|The NSWRL were {{reluctant}} to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of {{that they could be}} competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not have a home ground, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other teams, and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.|$|E

Cocea, with Arghezi, Demetrius and Galaction, stood out for marrying this political ideal with the artistic credo of Symbolism. This unusual vision was preserved in the magazine the three published together during 1904, Linia Dreaptă ("The Straight Line"). In 1905, Arghezi left for Switzerland and entrusted Cocea with his collection of rare books. Cocea {{is said to have}} lost it, an event which marked the first of several disagreements between them.|$|E
25|$|During the 1942–43 timeframe, the {{formerly}} all-black night fighter camouflage used by Luftwaffe night fighters had yielded to a light-color camouflage scheme that {{took advantage of}} the skyglow over German cities at night — this generally comprised the use of the Luftwaffe's usual Hellblau light blue undersurface color for diurnal-flown aircraft, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. The light gray base color usually had irregular patterns of darker gray splotches or irregular wavy lines spread over the light gray areas to increase the camouflage effect. Later in WW II, Luftwaffe night fighters, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kampfgeschwader-flown He 177A heavy bombers being used at night, switched back to a black coloration for the undersurfaces and vertical sides of the airframe, while retaining the light gray with dark gray-color disruptive patterns established in the mid-war period.|$|E
500|$|In the 20th century, Katherine Mansfield, Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, H.D., Vita Sackville-West, Virginia Woolf, and Gale Wilhelm wrote popular {{works that}} had {{same-sex}} relationships as themes.

All three were involved in same-sex relationships, but their primary friendships were with gay men. Foster further asserts 1928 was a [...] "peak year" [...] for lesbian-themed literature; in addition to The Well of Loneliness, three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England: Elizabeth Bowen's The Hotel, Woolf's , and Compton Mackenzie's satirical novel Extraordinary Women.

500|$|The reforms often brought {{relief for}} a {{significant}} part of the population. After the Second World War many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, a latent popular discontent remained present. Many Poles adopted an attitude that might be called [...] "resigned cooperation". Others, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remnants of the Home Army, the Freedom and Independence organization that originated from it and especially the National Armed Forces, actively opposed the communists, hoping for a World War III that would liberate Poland. Those who took up arms against the communist regime are collectively known as the cursed soldiers.

In the past we were always very aware of who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then go on the road and play them for a year.

500|$|Susan Hill herself did not <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{changes that}} Kneale {{had made to}} The Woman in Black. It has been {{observed}} that Kneale on some occasions operated a double-standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to The Woman in Black adaptation, the writer and critic Kim Newman noted that: [...] "He was very offended {{at the notion of}} Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of The Woman in Black, and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!" [...] However, Kneale's adaptations were by no means always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a four-part version he wrote of Kingsley Amis's novel Stanley and the Women, met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.|$|E

500|$|Weber saw {{religion}} {{as one of}} the core forces in society. His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, although without judging or valuing them, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation. In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that Calvinist (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the social innovation and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise. In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in magic, or what he referred to as [...] "disenchantment of the world".|$|E

500|$|Gideon Haigh {{suggests}} that Hobbs was a [...] "spontaneous and original", trend-setting batsman {{who was not}} afraid to depart from orthodoxy. Gerald Howat notes that, aside from his batting achievements, [...] "Hobbs's biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note. He {{was a man of}} moral probity, religious conviction, and personal commitment. And he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent, which he put into its proper perspective. It was an attitude of mind which tempered the sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes." [...] Among his contemporaries, Hobbs was regarded as modest and kind, and never criticised other players. He avoided confrontation, although he was [...] "quietly determined", according to Wisden, and tried to avoid publicity. According to Fender, Hobbs [...] "gave stature" [...] to the profession of cricket. Modern critics have expressed some reservations: some have pointed out that his batting average, although high, has been surpassed by others, and that among his many centuries, few were as large as other players managed. However, others contend that his impact on the game, his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs, and his kindness place him among the top cricketers of all time. Wisden described him in 2000: [...] "More than anyone else, he lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer." [...] In summing up his place in history, it said: [...] "He was not an artist, like some of his predecessors, nor yet a scientist, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moderns; he was perhaps the supreme craftsman." ...|$|E
