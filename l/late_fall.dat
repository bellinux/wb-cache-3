5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival {{season has}} {{expanded}} throughout the <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> and winter: {{balls in the}} city may be scheduled as early as November, with the parades beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6. Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras, a moveable feast related to the timing of Lent and Easter. The next day is Ash Wednesday {{and the beginning of}} Lent, the 40-day penitential season before Easter.|$|E
5|$|An {{interchange}} between 36th Street and I-96 {{was built}} starting in 2005 and {{was completed in}} 2006. The project aimed to improve access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport southeast of Grand Rapids. The reconstruction of the Wixom Road interchange near Novi as a SPUI was completed in <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> of 2008. Another interchange at Latson Road in Howell was approved for construction on July 19, 2012. This interchange was designed to bring improved access to the eastern Howell area, which prior to construction of the Latson Road exit was only accessible from westbound I-96. The project was completed on December 2, 2013. Also in 2013, the two interchanges near Nunica serving M-104 and B-31 were reconstructed, with two ramps removed from the former and two added to the latter; a new partial interchange was also built in preparation of M-231.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By <b>late</b> <b>fall,</b> an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to <b>late</b> <b>fall,</b> primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E

5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> or early winter.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September, {{however, the}} Indonesians {{proposed}} a way out: an alternative route through the Lombok Strait. The British took {{them up on}} this offer, to the relief of both parties, and the Victorious made a peaceful return through Indonesian territory. War was averted, and the climax of tensions during the Confrontation had been passed. Never again was the threat of all-out war a realistic possibility, despite some large land battles in northern Borneo the following spring, and the Confrontation wound down by <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> of 1965. It had never escalated into a major conflict, and a peace deal was signed the following year.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi is a {{saprobic}} species, and derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down the complex insoluble polysaccharides found in woody material, such as cellulose and lignin. Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups, and are attached to buried or partially buried sticks in forests. Basswood has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species. Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring, but may occasionally also in <b>late</b> <b>fall.</b> Although the distribution appears to be largely restricted to the eastern United States, it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994, representing the first European collection.|$|E

5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in <b>late</b> <b>fall,</b> early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to the}} lake effect.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E
5|$|In <b>late</b> <b>fall,</b> Empress Anna twice sent {{embassies}} to Dušan {{trying to}} convince him to surrender Kantakouzenos, but the Serbian ruler, seeking to extract more profit from their alliance, refused. Kantakouzenos' fortunes began to improve when a delegation of the nobles of Thessaly reached him and offered to accept his authority. Kantakouzenos appointed his relative John Angelos as the province's governor. Although in effect a semi-independent ruler, Angelos was both loyal and effective. He soon brought Epirus—which he had governed in Andronikos II's name in 1340—into the Kantakouzenist camp, and even made gains in Thessaly {{at the expense of}} the Catalans of Athens. Another effort by Kantakouzenos to break from Serbia into Macedonia failed before Serres. In the meantime, Kantakouzenos' wife Irene called upon the aid of the Bulgarians to help relieve the blockade of Demotika by the regency's army. Ivan Alexander dispatched troops, but although they clashed with the regency's forces, they made no effort in assisting the city, instead pillaging the countryside.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to his seat in Congress in the <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> of 1812. Based on his experience, he proposed a plan to defeat the mobile, guerrilla warfare of the Indians. American troops moved slowly, dependent on a supply line. Indians would evade battle and raid supplies until the American forces withdrew or were overrun. Mounted riflemen could move quickly, carry their own supplies, and live off the woods. If they attacked Indian villages in winter, the Indians would be compelled to stand and fight for the supplies they used to wage war, and could be decisively defeated. Johnson submitted this plan to President James Madison and Secretary of War John Armstrong, who approved it in principle. They referred the plan to Harrison, who found winter operations impracticable. Johnson was permitted to try the tactics {{in the summer of}} 1813; later the US conducted Indian wars in winter with his strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in <b>late</b> <b>fall</b> after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
