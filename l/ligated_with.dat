Compared with the peak emission cross section σem = 7.9 × 10 − 21 cm 2 of Er 3 + in conventional silica, the above results have 27.5 and 29.3 % increase, respectively. This is attributed to the low-vibration environment created by PMS or efficient sensitization of Yb 3 + to Er 3 +. The effective separation of Er 3 + ions, obtained from the walls and cages of mesopores, and the <b>ligating</b> <b>with</b> PMS or codoped Yb 3 + ions, makes the upconversion effect relatively weak. Although Er(PMS)x-SBA- 15 does not have extremely attractive bandwidth for the amplifier application in optical communications, Yb-Er-SBA- 15 has 88 nm broad “effective bandwidth”.

The mechanism by which underlying integrin <b>ligates</b> <b>with</b> functionalized biomaterials to induce cell proliferation is still not completely understood. In this study, poly-l-lactide (PL) scaffold surfaces were functionalized using layers of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs), which have recently attracted attention for use in therapeutic application due to their catalytic ability of Ce 4 + and Ce 3 + sites. To isolate the influence of Ce valance states of CNPs on cell proliferation, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and osteoblast-like cells (MG 63) were cultured on the PL/CNP surfaces with dominant Ce 4 + and Ce 3 + regions. Despite cell type (hMSCs and MG 63 cells), different surface features of Ce 4 + and Ce 3 + regions clearly promoted and inhibited cell spreading, migration and adhesion behavior, resulting in rapid and slow cell proliferation, respectively. Cell proliferation results of various modified CNPs with different surface charge and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, indicate that Ce valence states closely correlated with the specific cell morphologies and cell-material interactions that trigger cell proliferation. This finding suggests that the cell-material interactions, which influence cell proliferation, may be controlled by introduction of metal elements with different valence states onto the biomaterial surface. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Methods The panel included chromium, cobalt, and palladium, {{all of which are}} known to be frequent clinical sensitizers. MoDC activation was monitored by assessment of release of the pro-inflammatory mediator interleukin (IL) - 8, a major downstream result of TLR ligation. Results The data obtained in the present study show that cobalt and palladium also have potent MoDC-activating capacities, whereas copper and zinc, but not iron and chromium, have low but distinct MoDC-activating potential. Involvement of endotoxin contamination in MoDC activation was excluded by Limulus assays and consistent stimulation in the presence of polymyxin B. The critical role of TLR 4 in nickel-induced, cobalt-induced and palladium-induced activation was confirmed by essentially similar stimulatory patterns obtained in an HEK 293 TLR 4 /MD 2 transfectant cell line. Conclusions Given the adjuvant role of costimulatory danger signals, the development of contact allergies to the stimulatory metals may be facilitated by signals from direct TLR 4 ligation, whereas other metal sensitizers, such as chromium, may rather depend on microbial or tissue-derived cofactors to induce clinical sensitization...|$|R
