40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>bending</b> of veneers {{mean that}} dried, thin veneers or thin wood sheets are glued {{together}} {{under influence of}} pressure and eventually increased temperature. At {{the same time the}} product is given its desired shape, most often curved. This thermo hydro mechanical process offers several benefits. For example thick bends of small radiuses of any species of wood may be formed and poor quality wood containing knots, splits and other defects may be utilised. <b>Laminated</b> <b>bends</b> can usually be set more readily and made to conform better to the shape of the form than similar bends of solid wood. Further no softening treatment is generally required before the pieces are bent. However, there are also disadvantages e. g. more technical skill and better equipment are usually required than for solid wood bending. The presence of glue may be somewhat detrimental to the machines used for the final cleaning up of the bent pieces. Further the glue lines which are usually visible on the sides may be an aesthetical unappreciated effect [1],[2]. The quality of the <b>laminated</b> <b>bended</b> veneer products are obtained as an interaction between the process, the veneers and the glue [3]. In industries designing and producing these products it is of interest to obtain better understanding of how processing- and material parameters affect the product quality. With an improved understanding of the material and processing parameters {{it may be possible to}} increase the efficiency of wood utilisation and promote the development of new processes and products that manipulate the viscoelastic nature of wood. In particular the possibilities to obtain narrower radius of curvature and better possibilities of bending in more than one plane would be advantageous. This study has focused on the moisture content (MC) and the grain angle orientation in the veneers. These two specific aspects were assumed to have a great influence on spring-back and distortions of the <b>laminated</b> <b>bended</b> veneer products. Spring-back and distortions were therefore studied in separate tests where MC and the grain angle orientation was varied separately in manufactured <b>laminated</b> <b>bended</b> wood products. After manufacturing the products were exposed to variations in humidity and temperature whereupon the spring-back and distortions were measuredThree tests were performed. For the first and the second test a seat shell was selected as test product, figure 1 a. To the third test another product was selected, figure 1 b. This product was a small bookshelf. The company producing this shelf had experienced large problems considering distortions of this product. Further the product was very simple in shape with only one bend and therefore suitable for measurements. In the first test the influence of MC of the veneers was investigated. In the second and third test the influence of grain angle of the veneers was studied. For the study veneers of birch and beech were selected in the production. For the first and third study only birch veneers were used. The veneers were initially conditioned to equilibrium moisture contents (EMC) according to setups in different test groups. For the first study a test group was also built up from veneers taken directly out of production to study the industrial conditions. The seat shells in this test group contained veneers conditioned to EMC 4 %, except for the surface veneers that had been stored in the production hall. The humidity and temperature conditions in this room corresponded to MC 7 %. The manufacturing of the products were performed in industrial conditions. In the tests the products were built up from a number of veneers and the studied factors were varied between the veneers in a controlled manner. The results from the first test showed that the MC of the veneers influenced the spring-back and the distortions. A large moisture gradient between veneers and especially unsymmetrical placements of these in the construction were especially critical. The results from the second and third tests showed that grain angle deviation has large effect on the distortions of the products. Even a small grain angle deviation as in study two (5 °) resulted in large problems with distortions. The study also showed that when crossing two or more veneers with deviating grain angles there were cases when these faults interacted and multiplied the distortions. In production grain angle deviations can be a result of inaccurate placement of the veneers during pressing, incorrect cutting of the veneers, inherent from the growth of the tree or a combination of these factors. Deviations of the grain angle were, however, shown to have only small effects on spring-back. Upprättat; 2011; 20130911 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|A {{shortcoming}} of the <b>laminated</b> <b>bending</b> {{process is}} that the products may become distorted after moulding and during use. Annually, significant financial losses have incurred in the furniture and interior design industries {{as a result of}} distorted products. In this study, we have examined the influence of deviation of fibre orientation of individual veneers on distortion of a moulded shell to find ways to improve shape stability of laminated veneer products. Ninety cross-laminated shells, consisting of 7 veneers of Birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) with a total thickness of 3. 6 mm, were studied. The in-plane dimensions of the veneer were 400 x 660 mm. All the veneers were straight-grained, but to simulate deviation in fibre orientation some of the individual veneers were oriented 7 degrees relative to the main orientation of the other veneers in the laminate. Distortion was determined directly after moulding and after storage in a changing relative humidity. The results show the well-known fact that deviation of fibre orientation of the veneers in the laminate influences the shape stability of the product. The results from this study, however, also show how the placement of the abnormal veneers in the laminated veneer products influences the degree of distortions. From this basic knowledge some improvements for production of laminated veneer products were suggested. Godkänd; 2013; 20130910 (ysko...|$|R

Significant improvement in Mode I and II interlaminar toughness have been observed previously. In this work, several substructural in-plane strength tests relevant to aerostructures were undertaken: bolt/tension-bearing, open hole compression, and L-shape <b>laminate</b> <b>bending.</b> Improvements are observed for the nanostitched samples: critical bearing strength by 30 %, open-hole compression ultimate strength by 10 %, and L-shape laminate energy (via increased deflection) of 40 %. The mechanism of reinforcement is not compliant interlayer creation, but rather is a fiberstitching mechanism, as no increase in interlayer thickness occurs with the nanostitches. Unlike traditional (large-fiber/tow/pin) stitching or z-pinning techniques that damage inplane fibers and reduce laminate in-plane strengths, the nano-scale CNT-based ‘stitches’ improve in-plane strength, demonstrating the potential of such an architecture for aerospace structural applications.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the response to repeated impacts of a non-symmetric glass fibre reinforced laminate. The laminate is intended for a nautical application and the manufacturing technique is vacuum infusion. In a first part of the work, four impact velocities (1. 566 m/s, 2. 215 m/s, 3. 132 m/s and 3. 836 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to forty repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the damage degree (ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy). In a second part of the work, additional single impact tests were performed at 4. 429 m/s and 6. 264 m/s to investigate the laminate strain-rate sensitivity. Repeated impact tests pointed out that the delamination area grows very rapidly in the first few impacts to then level off, following closely the behaviour of the bending stiffness against the number of impacts. The value of the peak force increases in the first few impacts due to compaction and strain-hardening of the resin with a related decrease of the damage degree.

An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the behavior of an edge chamfer on the resulting crushing response of flat laminated composite strips. The effects of variables such as chamfer angle, stacking sequence and material system were addressed. In the present study the material systems used was Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. Chamfer angles of 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° {{were used in the}} present study to simulate the trigger mechanism. Laminate stacking sequences of [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N (N= 4, 8 and 12), were studied using Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. In addition Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy specimens were fabricated with a [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S stacking sequence and tested. Monotonic and cyclic load-unload tests were conducted on an MTS electromechanical machine at a quasi-static stroke rate of 10 - 3 in/s. Monotonic tests were also conducted at stroke rates of 10 - 1 in/s, but restricted to the specimens with 45 ° chamfer specimen. Failure modes observed in [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S specimens included delamination induced lamina/ sub-laminate bending mode, <b>laminate</b> <b>bending</b> mode, brittle fracture mode, catastrophic failure mode, and mixed mode failures. Lamina/sub-laminate bending mode and brittle fracture mode were observed to be the most dominant failure modes, with corresponding high energy absorption. The amount of energy absorption through delamination in cyclic load-unload test was investigated using image analysis and geometry calculations. With an increase in chamfer angle, the peak load, in the load-displacement curve, increased for the 12 and 8 ply laminates, while no significant differences were observed in the 4 viii ply laminates. The load eccentricity due to chamfering forced a global bending dominated failure mode in 4 ply laminates, which resulted in the observed apparent insensitivity to chamfer angle. Due to the 0 ° fiber orientation in [0 º]N stacking sequence, a higher load carrying capacity was observed in comparison to [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S. However, the energy absorption in [± 45 º]N was higher owing to the crushing mode of failure rather than the delamination induced splaying/bending mode observed in [0 º]N laminates. Results from the load-displacement curve showed that the Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy had a higher load carrying capacity than carbon-fiber/epoxy, and this was attributed to the crushing mode being dominant in the fiberglass/epoxy specimens. Although, both fiberglass and carbon-fiber are brittle by nature, there was a shift in the initial load response from linear to non-linear behavior in the load-displacement curve of the [± 45 º]N stacking sequence. The sustained crush region of the load-displacement curves for the [0 º]N laminates exhibited high serrations typically associated with load oscillations in brittle failure. Cyclic load tests revealed the sequence of failure mechanisms in chamfered laminates. While delamination was observed to be the primary driving mechanism, the estimation of energy dissipated due to the same was observed to be small in comparison to the overall energy absorbed...|$|E

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} {{composite materials}} have gained widespread acceptance for {{a multitude of}} applications in the aerospace, automotive, maritime and wind-energy industries. Automated fiber placement technologies have developed rapidly {{over the past two}} decades, driven primarily by a need to reduce manufacturing costs and improve product consistency and quality. The introduction of new technologies often stimulates novel means of exploiting them, such as using the built-in fiber steering capabilities to manufactured composite laminates with continuously varying fiber orientation angles, yielding a so called variable stiffness laminate. These laminates allow the full potential of composite materials to be harnessed by enlarging the design space to create substantially more efficient structural designs, which has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally in the recent past. Despite the apparent potential, the design tools currently available to engineers do not exploit the steering capabilities of automated fiber placement machines to obtain more efficient structural solutions. The design of composite structures {{is by no means a}} trivial task. Composite structures are inherently difficult to optimize due to a combination of discrete and continuous design variables as well as generally non-convex design problems with multiple solutions. Variable stiffness laminates are even more complex to design, as the optimization problem is no longer limited to a single or several laminate designs, but consists essentially of obtaining an optimal layup at every point in the structure. Ensuring fiber continuity and laminate manufacturability complicates the design problem even further. The large number of design variables and constraints associated with variable stiffness design problems make them unusually challenging problems to solve. The substantial increase in structural efficiency possible when using variable stiffness laminates and the lack of available design tools motivated the development of computationally tractable design optimization routine for variable stiffness composite structures. The complexity of the design problem necessitated the development of a multi-step approach. Separating structural performance related design drivers and manufacturing related design drivers allows the most suitable optimization algorithms to be used where necessary. In a first step, the optimal laminate stiffness distribution is obtained for the considered structural performance metric and constraints. Using lamination parameters to parameterize the structural stiffness allows the optimization problem to be solved efficiently, as will be discussed later. Design drivers such as maximum in-plane stiffness, strength, natural frequency and buckling can be included at this stage of the optimization. The obtained optimum solution provides the designer with a conceptual stiffness distribution best satisfying the desired structural performance requirements. In a second step, the fiber angle distribution, essentially representing point-wise laminate stacking sequence, required to match the obtained optimum stiffness distribution is determined. Manufacturing constraints, such as minimum curvature, thickness buildup, or permeability, can be incorporated at this stage. In a final step, the obtained fiber angle distributions are converted to continuous fiber paths for manufacturing. The responses of variable stiffness composite structures, required at the various steps of the design process, are typically evaluated using a finite element method by assigning different stiffness properties to each element in the model. In structural optimization, approximations of the structural response are often developed to minimize the number of computationally expensive finite element analyses needed during the design process. In order to develop a computationally tractable design framework it was essential to develop an effective approach to approximate the response of variable stiffness structures. The development of a generic conservative convex separable approximation specifically for composite structures and its implementation within a design framework using lamination parameters is presented in this thesis. The developed convex conservative separable approximation, following Svanberg (2002), has two parts, the first part is to ensure that the function value and the gradient of the approximation meet those of the original function, while the second term is used to control the overall approximation conservativeness and convexity by appropriately scaling this term after each successive design iteration. The approximation is expressed directly in terms of the laminate stiffness matrices, known from classical lamination theory, and is therefore independent of the chosen laminate parameterization scheme. A function approximation is generated by expanding the function linearly and/or reciprocally with respect to the laminate stiffness matrices, similar to the traditionally used conservative approximation. Instead of using derivative information to determine which terms are expanded linearly and which terms are expanded reciprocally, physical insight into the response being approximated is used to guarantee convexity by expanding the non-convex terms linearly. Using lamination parameters to parametrize the laminate stiffness matrices allows the convex nature of the approximation to be retained. Additionally, lamination parameters allow the laminate stiffness matrices to be expressed using a minimum number of continuous design variables, allowing efficient gradient based optimization algorithms to be used. An efficient design optimization framework, based on the aforementioned conservative convex separable approximations, is developed and enables the solution of variable stiffness design optimization problems with several thousand design variables. The optimizer consists of three loops, one, a convergence control loop, two, a global optimization loop, and three, a local optimization loop, where the latter two loops correspond to the optimization problems that result when using the dual method. The convergence control loop is used to dynamically control the degree of conservativeness of the considered approximations and to decide if the optimal solution of the approximate subproblem is accepted for the following iteration. The global optimization loop consists of solving for the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints. The local loop is used to solve the local separable approximations iteratively in terms of lamination parameters to obtain the optimum stiffness distribution. The separable nature of the response approximations allows the local optimization problems to be solved in parallel, further reducing computation time on multi-processor computer systems. Typically, less than thirty finite element analyses are required to converge to the optimal solution of a problem with several thousand design variables and several hundred constraints, while roughly 80 - 90 % of the performance gains are typically achieved within the first 3 - 5 design iterations. One of the limitations, and perhaps objections to using lamination parameters for composite design, has been the difficulty of incorporating strength constraints into the optimization process. In order to facilitate the acceptance of the approach, a method of including the Tsai-Wu strength criteria in the most general setting is developed. Analytical expressions for conservative failure envelopes in terms of two strain invariants are derived that are no longer an explicit function of the laminate stacking sequence. The derived envelope is shown to accurately represent the factor of safety for practical laminates under in-plane loading, however, for bending dominated problems it may be too conservative. A failure index is subsequently defined and used to formulate an optimization problem to design laminates for maximum strength under combined axial and shear loads. The designs are subsequently compared to the equivalent maximum stiffness designs. Strength-optimal and stiffness-optimal designs for various materials and load conditions are obtained and are found to be similar for a large range of problems. However, differences were also found, particularly for compression-shear loaded panels. Laminate strength is found to be significantly more sensitive to the final laminate design than laminate stiffness, which implies that design for maximum strength will result in near-optimal laminate stiffness, however, the opposite is not necessarily true. Approximations for several specific design optimization problems related to buckling are developed. Initial work is focused on developing convex separable approximations of the buckling load of plates. It is shown, using the eigenvalue problem used to solve for linear buckling, that a homogenous convex approximation for the inverse buckling load factor is obtained when expanding the geometric stiffness matrix linearly in terms of the laminate in-plane stiffness while expanding the material stiffness matrix reciprocally in terms of <b>laminate</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness. A convex approximation to maximize laminate stiffness is also developed. A trade-off study between maximum laminate stiffness and maximum laminate buckling load of a plate under uniaxial compression is conducted. Numerical results demonstrate that significant improvements in structural performance are possible and that a variable stiffness laminate with overall stiffness equivalent to a quasi-isotropic laminate can be designed to have twice the buckling load. In-plane load redistribution is found to be the primary mechanism resulting in improved buckling load and post-buckling analysis demonstrated that variable stiffness laminate designs have similar or superior post-buckling stiffness when compared to the equivalent constant stiffness solutions. A simplified method of including thermals stresses during the buckling design optimization process is also developed, since the pre-buckling stress state significantly influences a panels buckling behavior. For the plate buckling problem under consideration, residual thermal stresses are shown to beneficially influence the compressive load carrying capacity of a plate if the temperature difference between curing temperature and operating temperature are not excessive. The range of operating temperatures over which a panel exhibits good buckling behavior increases significantly when including thermal effects in the design process. Later, the approximation of the inverse buckling load factor is extended to include laminate thickness as a design variable, which requires additional linearization of the terms linear in the laminate stiffness matrices. Compared to the optimal variable stiffness design with constant thickness further improvements in the buckling load, 30 - 100 % depending on the minimum bound thickness, are obtained. When thickness variation is included in the variable stiffness design routine for maximum laminate buckling load, both load redistribution and increased <b>laminate</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness are found to play a role in the improved structural performance. Using the insight gained from studying variable stiffness plates, a convex approximation of the inverse buckling load for general structures is derived. Convexity of the approximation is guaranteed by expanding the terms associated with the geometric stiffness matrix linearly with respect to the laminate stiffness matrices and expanding the terms associated with the material stiffness matrix reciprocally. An example problem, a curved panel subject to a uniform pressure load, is presented to demonstrated the applicability of the derived approximation. Two practical design applications are studied with several industrial partners to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed design approach. A first problem considers the design of a simplified window belt section for maximum tensile strength. Numerical results highlight that variable stiffness laminates, including manufacturing constraints, can be found that have a 50 % higher failure load compared to the best constant stiffness design. A second design problem focuses on the design of an aircraft wing rib to meet a range of imposed design requirements with buckling as a primary design driver. Other than demonstrating the benefit of using stiffness variation for more practical structures, the analysis for this design problem is conducted entirely using an external commercial finite element solver. Also for this more practical design problem the optimizer was found to perform satisfactorily. Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics GroupAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced {{composites}} in {{aerospace structures}} {{has increased dramatically}} over the past decades. The high specific strength and stiffness, the tailorability, and the possibilities to integrate parts and {{reduce the number of}} fasteners give composites an advantage over metals. Automation of the production process enables large-scale production of composites in a repeatable, reliable fashion. Fiber-reinforced composite laminates are traditionally made of 0 ?, 90 ? and ± 45 ? plies. Automated manufacturing techniques, such as advanced fiber placement, allow for fiber orientations other than 0 ?, 90 ? and ± 45 ?, and for the placement of curved fibers such that the fiber orientation within a ply is continuously varied. Laminates that contain plies with spatially varying fiber orientations have a spatially varying stiffness and are called variable-stiffness composites. Tailoring the stiffness variation can be used to improve the structural efficiency of a composite. Analytical and experimental work on flat variable-stiffness composite panels with and without central holes has shown that large improvements in structural efficiency are feasible, such as increasing the panel strength or buckling load while maintaining the same overall weight. The research presented in this dissertation expands the work on variable-stiffness composite laminates from flat panels to conical and cylindrical shells. Variable-stiffness plies with either an axial or a circumferential stiffness variation are defined based on the shifted course principle, where a full ply is formed by shifting identical courses in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the fiber angle is varied. Four different types of fiber paths are discussed: i) geodesic paths, ii) constant angle paths, iii) paths with a linearly varying fiber angle, and iv) paths with a constant curvature. General mathematical descriptions to define the coordinates of these paths on a conical or cylindrical shell and expressions for the in-plane curvature are derived. The in-plane curvature is limited to a maximum value to ensure a good laminate quality, assuming the variable-stiffness laminate is manufactured using advanced fiber placement. A procedure to determine the exact stacking sequence for a given location within a laminate is given. Structural analyses were carried out using the finite element rogram ABAQUS. The stiffness variation was implemented in the finite element shell model as a user-written FORTRAN subroutine, such that each element was uniquely defined. Two design studies were carried out, using the ABAQUS models to evaluate the structural performance of variable-stiffness composite laminates. The first design study was the optimization of conical and cylindrical shells with different dimensions for maximum fundamental frequency. The 8 -ply laminates had a [± 45 ±?(x) ]s layup, where ?(x) denotes a ply with an axially varying fiber angle, and the laminate thickness was assumed to be constant. Manufacturability of the variable-stiffness plies was judged based on the maximum in-plane path steering allowed by the fiber placement process. Numerical examples showed that manufacturability can have a large influence on the value of the maximum fundamental frequency of conical and cylindrical composite shells with an axial stiffness variation, and {{that it is necessary to}} take the manufacturing constraints into account in the design phase of a variable-stiffness laminate. It was shown that the fundamental frequency of conical and cylindrical shells can be improved up to 30 percent by using variable-stiffness laminates, especially for larger cones. The second design study covered the maximization of the buckling load of a variable-stiffness composite cylinder loaded in bending. It was shown that the use of variable-stiffness constant-thickness laminates may improve the buckling load of a cylinder under pure bending because it allows the redistribution of in-plane loads between the compression and tension parts around the circumference by tailoring the circumferential in-plane stiffness distribution in the cylinder skin. The compressive loads were reduced and spread out over a larger part of the cylinder circumference thus increasing the buckling load and changing the buckling mode shape. Loading was also shifted from buckling-critical compression loads into buckling-noncritical tension loads. The redistributed loads caused the first buckling mode to change such that a larger part of the cylinder participated in the buckling deformations. Introduction of curvature, strength and stiffness constraints caused a small reduction in buckling load carrying capability of the variable-stiffness designs. These manufacturable and more practical laminates showed improvements of up to 18 percent compared to the optimized baseline consisting of 0 ?, 90 ? and ± 45 ? plies. The buckling load carrying capability of variable-stiffness designs that included overlapping fiber courses was optimized by increasing the laminate thickness on the compression side of the cylinder. The larger laminate thickness, which is coupled to the fiber angle variation, was achieved by having a small fiber orientation on the compression side of the cylinder and a large fiber orientation near the neutral axis. The increased laminate thickness and the small fiber orientation caused high axial stiffness, resulting in high axial loads on the compression side of the cylinder. The <b>laminate</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness on the compression side increased more than the in-plane laminate stiffness, however, such that it compensated for the higher axial loads and dominated the response. Including the curvature and strength constraints had a higher impact on the variable-stiffness designs with overlap than on the ones with a constant thickness. The amount of thickness buildup on the compression side was limited, because the shift of the neutral axis associated with the high axial laminate stiffness on the compression side caused failure on the tension side of the cylinder. The laminate stiffness and thickness on the tension side became similar to those on the compression side. One constant-thickness, variable-stiffness specimen and two baseline specimens were manufactured using advanced fiber placement technology. Both designs were optimized for maximum buckling load carrying capability under bending. The small dimensions of the cylinder required a small turning radius, causing puckers to form during lay-down which were not visible in the end product. The amount of small triangular gaps and overlaps within the constant-thickness laminate was minimized by using a 50 percent coverage parameter, while long gaps between parallel courses were avoided by adjusting the shift between courses. The minimum cut length requirement was taken into account during the design, preventing any deficiencies in placing tows on the surface. Cutting tows on the outside of a steered course caused the tows to straighten, because the outer tows were not restrained and thus followed a geodesic path. Adjustments are needed in future variable-stiffness designs to avoid fiber straightening. A modal test was carried out on the variable-stiffness and on one of the baseline fiber-reinforced composite cylinders that were optimized for bending. An ABAQUS finite element model was used to predict the modal behavior of the cylinders. The analytically predicted mode shapes and modal frequencies showed a good agreement with the experimental results, both for the baseline and for the variable-stiffness cylinder. The modal frequencies of the variable-stiffness cylinder were lower than those of the baseline cylinder due to the lower <b>laminate</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness in the circumferential direction, which plays an important role in the formation of waves in the circumferential direction. The larger axial stiffness of the variable-stiffness cylinder became apparent for modes with an increasing number of axial half waves and the modal frequency of the variable-stiffness cylinder approached or even exceeded the modal frequency of the baseline cylinder. The modal response simulations executed in ABAQUS matched the experimental results both for location and amplitude of the response. Although only 2 cylinders were tested, the presented results indicated that the finite element model for the variable-stiffness cylinder provides a good representation of the cylinder in terms of mass and stiffness distributions. A fixture was designed to test the baseline and the variable-stiffness cylinders in pure bending. Strains and displacements were measured using strain gauges, digital image correlation, LVDT’s and lasers. Three carbon fiber-reinforced cylinders were tested: two with a baseline laminate and one with circumferentially varying laminate stiffness. The variable-stiffness cylinder was tested in two configurations: i) it was tested in the orientation for which it was optimized, called the preferred configuration, and ii) it was tested while rotated 180 ? about the longitudinal axis, such that the loading on the cylinder was reversed, this was called the reversed configuration. This resulted in three test configurations: the baseline, the variable-stiffness in the preferred orientation and the variable-stiffness in the reversed orientation. A comparison of the experimental response of the two baseline cylinders with the finite element predictions revealed that the experimental boundary conditions were more flexible than originally modeled in the finite element model. The introduction of flexible boundary conditions in the finite element model resulted in good agreement between the experimental and the analytical results. A final improvement of the finite element predictions was achieved by including geometric imperfections in the model and by performing a Riks analysis. The latter model was used to make a prediction for the variable-stiffness test results. A comparison of the experimental results with the finite element predictions of the Riks analysis in general showed a good agreement for all three configurations. The match of the end rotations and strains was equally good for the variable-stiffness cylinder and the baseline cylinder. The variable-stiffness cylinder was stiffer than the baseline cylinder when comparing the global behavior in terms of end rotations, which was to be expected because of the larger laminate stiffness of the variable-stiffness cylinder. The variable-stiffness cylinder response was stiffer in the reversed orientation than in the preferred orientation due to the boundary condition effects. The most important observation resulted from the strain distribution with the vertical coordinate of the cylinder: at equal load level the maximum compressive strains of the variable-stiffness cylinder in the preferred orientation were about 10 percent lower than those of the baseline cylinder; the tensile strains were 35 percent smaller. This difference in extreme strain values is a large improvement in performance when strain-based strength criteria are applied. In addition, the circumferential stiffness variation resulted in a redistribution of the loads, such that the tension side was more effective in carrying loads, the compressive loads were carried by a larger part of the cylinder and the compressive load peak at ? = 180 ? was reduced by 25 percent compared to the baseline cylinder. The adjusted finite element model predicted an increase in buckling load of 18 percent compared to the baseline cylinder as a result of this load redistribution.

40|$|To ensure {{success in}} the {{production}} of laminated veneer products, it is necessary to acquire a sound basic understanding of the behaviour of the wood, and to understand the inherent reactions of wood to adhesive, heat, moisture, strain and stress. This can ensure an efficient wood utilization and promote the development of new processes and products that take advantage of the visco-elastic nature of wood. A shortcoming of the <b>laminated</b> <b>bending</b> process is that the products may become distorted after moulding and during use. In this study, we have examined how the performance of laminated veneer products can be improved through the implementation of basic knowledge of wood in the design and production process. The results show that the material and process parameters and storage in a changing relative humidity have a clear impact on distortion. Fibre orientation of the veneers in the moulded assembly was the most critical parameter to control. Fibre deviations mainly resulted in twist of the product. A moisture content in one veneer deviating from that {{of the rest of the}} veneers in the assembly before moulding resulted in distortion of the laminated veneer products both after moulding and during use. To decrease the negative effect of fibre orientation and moisture content on shape stability, the veneer should be straight-grained and well-conditioned to a moisture level adapted to the use of the final product. Special care should also be taken to orientate the veneers during assembly before moulding. Godkänd; 2014; 20131112 (ysko); Konferensartikel i tidskrif...|$|R

40|$|Steady state creep of {{a hybrid}} metal-composite <b>laminated</b> <b>bending</b> beams of {{irregular}} patterns is considered. Beams consist of walls and load-bearing layers, attached {{at the top}} and bottom (shelves). The shelves are reinforced with fibers in the longitudinal direction, and the walls are reinforced either longitudinally or cross in the plane. Under the hypotheses of the Timoshenko theory the boundary value problem is formulated for the calculation of the considered beams, which allows taking into account the weakened resistance of the walls of the transverse shifts. The simple iteration method based on the idea of the secant modulus method is applied for linearization of the problem. The mechanical behavior of reinforced and unreinforced double seat beams and cantilevers in conditions of steady creep under the action of uniformly distributed transverse load is investigated. Cross sections of beams are I-shaped. It is shown that for homogeneous I-beams, the classical Bernoulli theory does not guarantee the calculated results in compliance within 20 % accuracy, which is considered to be acceptable if the width of the shelf is comparable with the height of cross sections of beams. In the cases of metal-composite beams, the classical theory becomes generally unacceptable, because it lowers by several orders of magnitude the compliance of such structures in conditions of steady creep. It is demonstrated that the rate of shear strain, actively developing in their walls, must be considered. The consideration of these strain rates {{within the framework of the}} Timoshenko theory led to the discovery of new mechanisms of deformation of laminated beams which the classical theory does not find.
