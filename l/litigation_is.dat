25|$|In the United States, in 2000 {{the cost}} of obtaining a patent (patent prosecution) was {{estimated}} to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent. When patent <b>litigation</b> <b>is</b> involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year), costs increase significantly: although 95% of patent litigation cases are settled out of court, those that reach the courts have legal costs on the order of a million dollars per case, not including associated business costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} goal {{of civil}} trials is to solve disputes over private rights {{so as to}} protect these rights. Civil <b>litigation</b> <b>is</b> based on the adversary system. A presiding judge directs the proceedings and exercises the right of elucidation to allow the parties concerned to make proper and sufficient debates. Furthermore, the judge examines evidence in detail and makes fair decisions. Meanwhile, the court shall try, by all possible means, to expand the function of compromises and reconciliation to reduce the sources of litigation.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the {{university}} pondered options for reinstating the tradition. [...] Bowen formed a task force, which proposed a new design. [...] The task force recommended that students be allowed to participate in building the Bonfire {{as long as they}} were monitored by professional construction experts. [...] Current and former students debated whether the proposed division of labor could be considered a student project. [...] The debate was rendered moot when the university discovered liability insurance for the revamped project would cost more than $2 million per year. [...] In 2002, Bowen announced that Bonfire was officially cancelled. Bowen's successor Robert Gates upheld this decision, stating that a [...] "change in the status quo regarding the future of Bonfire would be inappropriate while <b>litigation</b> <b>is</b> still on-going".|$|E

60|$|If {{this body}} of private claims of debt, real or devised, were a question, as it is falsely pretended, between the Nabob of Arcot, as debtor, and Paul Benfield and his associates, as creditors, I am sure I should give myself but little trouble about it. If the hoards of oppression were the fund for {{satisfying}} the claims of bribery and peculation, who would wish to interfere between such litigants? If the demands were confined to what might {{be drawn from the}} treasures which the Company's records uniformly assert that the Nabob is in possession of, or if he had mines of gold or silver or diamonds, (as we know that he has none,) these gentlemen might break open his hoards or dig in his mines without any disturbance from me. But the gentlemen {{on the other side of}} the House know as well as I do, and they dare not contradict me, that the Nabob of Arcot and his creditors are not adversaries, but collusive parties, and that the whole transaction is under a false color and false names. The <b>litigation</b> <b>is</b> not, nor ever has been, between their rapacity and his hoarded riches. No: it is between him and them combining and confederating, on one side, and the public revenues, and the miserable inhabitants of a ruined country, on the other. These are the real plaintiffs and the real defendants in the suit. Refusing a shilling from his hoards for the satisfaction of any demand, the Nabob of Arcot is always ready, nay, he earnestly, and with eagerness and passion, contends for delivering up to these pretended creditors his territory and his subjects. It is, therefore, not from treasuries and mines, but from the food of your unpaid armies, from the blood withheld from the veins and whipped out of the backs of the most miserable of men, that we are to pamper extortion, usury, and peculation, under the false names of debtors and creditors of state.|$|E
