We claim that the changing role of credit intermediaries due to securitisation has also modified the effectiveness of the bank lending channel and banks' ability to grant loans. We use a novel database of securitisation activity and a large sample of European banks and find that the use of securitisation shelters banks' loan supply from the effects of monetary policy. Securitisation activity has also strengthened banks' capacity to supply new loans. This capacity, however, depends on business cycle conditions and, notably, on banks' risks positions. The recent credit crisis is instructive in this respect. Asset securitisation Bank lending channel Monetary policy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that credit limit variability {{is a crucial}} aspect of the consumption, savings, and debt decisions of households in the United States. While typical models of intertemporal consumption fix the credit limit, variable credit limits create a reason for households to hold both high interest debts and low interest savings {{at the same time}} since the savings act as insurance. This approach can explain the credit card puzzle: why around a third of households in the U. S. hold both debt and liquid savings at the same time. Unlike other approaches it is consistent with observed changes over time. It also offers an important new channel for financial system uncertainty to affect household decisions. One of the largest "assets" in the portfolio of U. S. households is their ability to borrow. Increased uncertainty about credit limits reduces the value of this asset, and so has effects similar to a decline in wealth. credit, debt, <b>liquidity,</b> <b>credit</b> card puzzle, financial uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The {{volume of}} {{short-term}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>credit</b> ("Kassenkredit") of the German municipalities has increased {{rapidly in the}} last two decades. This development suggests that this debt instrument has been diverted from its original purpose, namely as an instrument of bridging short-run liquidity shortfalls. In this paper we analyze the reasons for this development - from a legal and institutional perspective on the one hand, and from an economic perspective on the other hand. One key result of the analysis is that this development is partly due to the lacking intervention of municipal supervision institutions from the Länder (German Federal States). Obviously, the Länder tolerate the abuse of the Kassenkredit in order to avoid more open types of debt. In addition, we investigate how the introduction of the doubly-entry bookkeeping in the municipalities affects the (improper) use of short-term liquidity credits. Finally, we point to the potential of the municipal Kassenkredit as a loophole in the new German constitutional debt brake.

This profitability remains economically plausible after adjusting for systematic risk, short-sale costs, and transaction costs.

Our cross-country analysis shows that {{the impact of the}} crisis was more pronounced in those EMs that had initial weaker fundamentals and greater financial and trade linkages. This effect is observed along a number of dimensions, such as growth, stock market performance, sovereign spreads, and credit growth. This paper also shows that during this crisis, pre-crisis reserve holdings helped to mitigate the initial growth collapse. This finding contrasts with other studies that fail to find a significant relationship between reserves and the growth decline.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} investigate the bank-specific and macroeconomic factors that determine the profitability of a sample of 73 banks in the United Kingdom {{for the period of}} 2003 - 2010. To evaluate the impact of the recent financial crisis, the testing period splits into the pre-crisis period, 2003 - 2006, and the during-crisis period of 2007 - 2010. The results derived from the Fixed-Effect panel data method indicate banks with a higher cost efficiency and larger size generally have lower profitability. Both credit risk and capitalization are negatively related to the bank profitability while a healthy liquidity generates a positive effect to bank performance. With regard to macroeconomic variables, only economic growth exhibits a significant and positive relationship with bank profitability. According to the results, the late 2007 financial crisis exerts a negative and significant impact on the profitability of UK banks but a more ambiguous and inconsistent picture emerged in the determinants of cost efficiency, bank size and capital strength between pre- and during-crisis periods. Although the signs of <b>liquidity,</b> <b>credit</b> risk and economic growth are constant in all testing periods, none of them generates a significant effect to ROAA from 2003 to 2006.
