5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, <b>lenticularis,</b> and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, <b>lenticularis,</b> castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{aforementioned}} fauna, Dalmanella <b>lenticularis</b> (Vanuxem) {{is confined to}} the Onondaga formation; Cyrtina hamiltonensis Hall occurs in the Onondaga, Hamilton, and Portage formations; Ambocoelia umbonata (Conrad) from the Onondaga to the Chemung inclusive; Styliolina fissurella (Hall) in the southern Onondaga shale, Marcellus, Genesee, and Portage black shales; and Phacops cristata Hall elsewhere in the Onondaga. The Journal of Geology concluded that the Romney shales present at both Hanging Rocks and Mechanicsburg Gap represent the southwestern continuation of the Onondaga limestone, Marcellus shale, and Hamilton formation of New York.|$|E

2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and <b>lenticularis.</b> [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or <b>lenticularis,</b> and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{acceptance}} {{that the}} basal ganglia system constitutes one major cerebral system {{took time to}} arise. [...] The first anatomical identification of distinct subcortical structures was published by Thomas Willis in 1664. For many years, the term corpus striatum was used to describe {{a large group of}} subcortical elements, some of which were later discovered to be functionally unrelated. [...] For many years, the putamen and the caudate nucleus were not associated with each other. Instead, the putamen was associated with the pallidum in what was called the nucleus <b>lenticularis</b> or nucleus lentiformis.|$|E
2500|$|Starting from cercopithecidae, the {{two sources}} from the basal ganglia system medial pallidum and nigra have distinct, {{spatially}} separate, thalamic territories. The pallidal territory arrives in evolution as a lateral {{addition to the}} nigal VA, forming a new nucleus individualized by another name : the nucleus ventralis oralis, VO. On the contrary {{there is no more}} VM (which receices convergent afferences in rodents and carnivora). VO receives its pallidal afferent axons from the medial pallidum. The trajectory of pallidal afferent axons is complex. Axons form first the ansa <b>lenticularis</b> and the fasciculus <b>lenticularis</b> which place the axons on the medial border of the pallidum. From there, the axons cross the internal capsule as the comb system. Axons arrives at the lateral border of the subthalamic nucleus. They pass over it as the H2 field of Forel (1877) then turn down at H and suddenly go up in H1 in direction to the inferior border of the thalamus. The distribution of pallidal axons within the territory is wide with terminal [...] "bunches" [...] (Arrechi-Bouchhioua et al. 1996,1997, Parent and Parent, 2004 [...] ). This offers few chance for a fine somatotopic organization. The territory is stained for calbindin. The mediator of the pallido-thalamic connection is the inhibitor GABA. The thalamocortical neurons send their axons to the supplementary motor area (SMA), preSMA, the premotordorsal and medial {{and to a lesser extent}} to the motor cortex.|$|E
2500|$|Stratocumuliform genus-types (cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus) {{that appear}} in mostly stable air have two species each. [...] The {{stratiformis}} species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity. Clouds of the <b>lenticularis</b> species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends. They are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-wave clouds, but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure. [...] These two species {{can be found in}} the high, middle, or low level of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time.|$|E

5000|$|Cirrocumulus <b>lenticularis</b> {{is a type}} of {{cirrocumulus}} cloud. The name cirrocumulus <b>lenticularis</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "like a lentil". Cirrocumulus <b>lenticularis</b> are smooth clouds that have the appearance of a lens or an almond. They usually form at the crests of atmospheric waves, which would otherwise be invisible. This species of cirrocumulus can often be quite elongated and normally has very distinguished boundaries. Cirrocumulus <b>lenticularis</b> forms when stable air is forced upward; this is usually due to orographic features, but can occur away from mountains as well. Irisation can occasionally occur with these clouds.|$|E
