5|$|During his consulship he {{advocated}} for the accused in court, {{which was a}} popular move, reminiscent of when he formerly used to plea for his defendants directly to Augustus. He also appealed to the people by ministering the Ludi Martiales (games of Mars), where he <b>let</b> <b>loose</b> two hundred lions in the Circus Maximus. Pliny the Elder mentions the games in his Historia Naturalis.|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly <b>let</b> <b>loose</b> a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E

The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather <b>let</b> <b>loose</b> a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the day had}} dawned {{clear and}} fine, as the knights and their entourages {{struggled}} to organise the parade the sky began to darken. Just {{at the moment when}} the parade was finally arranged— just as Lady Somerset, the Queen of Beauty, was heralded by trumpets— there was a flash of lightning, a great crash of thunder, and the black clouds of Ayrshire <b>let</b> <b>loose</b> with a sudden and violent rainstorm.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the mid-80s, several boars {{purchased}} from the San Diego Zoo and Tierpark Berlin were {{released into the}} United States.

Parker never used English with Nolan even though he spoke it well.|$|E

25|$|But for the moment, {{the advance}} of the {{northern}} army was of the highest military importance, for Fairfax was thereby set free from the necessity of undertaking sieges. Moreover, {{the publication of the}} King's papers, taken at Naseby, gave Fairfax's troops, a measure of official and popular support, which a month before, they could not have been said to possess. It was now obvious that they represented the armed force of England against the Irish, Danes, French, Lorrainers, etc., whom Charles had for three years been endeavouring to <b>let</b> <b>loose</b> on English soil. Even the Presbyterians abandoned for the time, any attempt to negotiate with the King, and advocated a vigorous prosecution of the war.|$|E
