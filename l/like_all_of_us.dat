He {{continued to work}} in television; in 1981 he appeared as Lord Marchmain in Brideshead Revisited, winning another Emmy, and the following year he received his tenth and last BAFTA nomination in the television adaptation of John Mortimer's stage play A Voyage Round My Father. In 1983 he played his last Shakespearean role as Lear in King Lear, for Granada Television, earning his fifth Emmy. He thought the role of Lear much less demanding than other tragic Shakespearean heroes: [...] "No, Lear is easy. He's <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> really: he's just a stupid old fart."

2500|$|In 2005, Survival {{published}} the book There You Go! (Oren Ginzburg), which depicted a tribal society being harmed by development. In the book's foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: [...] "The 'development' of tribal peoples against their wishes – really to let others get {{their land and}} resources – is rooted in 19th century colonialism ('We know best') dressed up in 20th century 'political correct' euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> always, are constantly adapting to a changing world. The main difference between tribal peoples and us is that we take their land and resources, and believe the dishonest, even racist, claim that it's for their own good. It's conquest, not development. If {{you really want to}} understand what's going on, read this book." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{completion}} of the series, Rowling began to speak openly about Snape, discussing the contrast between his character arc and that of Albus Dumbledore. Rowling said [...] "the series is built around [...] ", and maintained that she always knew what Snape {{would turn out to be}} at the end and that she carefully plotted his storyline throughout the series. [...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at the point where you see what was really going on, it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you've never seen before." [...] Rowling further said in an interview that she wanted Snape to find redemption and forgiveness: [...] "Snape is a complicated man...he was a flawed human being, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Harry forgives him...Harry really sees the good in Snape ultimately... I wanted there to be redemption." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2009 interview, Monáe {{revealed}} {{the title and}} concept behind her album, The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite – becomes a messianic figure to the android community of Metropolis. Monáe noted that she plans to shoot a video for each song on The ArchAndroid and create a film, graphic novel and a touring Broadway musical based on the album. The Metropolis concept series draws inspiration {{from a wide range}} of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging from Alfred Hitchcock to Debussy to Philip K. Dick. However, the series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent film Metropolis, which Monáe referred to as [...] "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard. Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover for The ArchAndroid is inspired by the iconic poster for Metropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic future scenarios to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. Where Metropolis android Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as [...] "... the Other. And I feel <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> whether in the majority or the minority, felt like the Other at some point." ...|$|E

60|$|About her {{he felt an}} enormous, inexorable, dissatisfaction.

He had been ready for noble deeds and villainies, for achievements and failures, and here as the dominant fact of his personal life was a perplexing riddle.

You, Egbert, by simply setting forth your practice, can do more to enlighten one as to my theory, than I myself can by mere speech. Indeed, it is by you that I myself best understand myself. For to every philosophy are certain rear parts, very important parts, and these, like the rear of one's head, are best seen by reflection. Now, as in a glass, you, Egbert, in your life, reflect to me the more important part of my system. He, who approves you, approves the philosophy of Mark Winsome." ...|$|E

A bright, breezy, and always cheerful lad, very original and <b>liked</b> by <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{he was one of the}} few chaps the mention of whose name provoked smiles <b>of</b> affection in <b>all</b> directions. I would not describe him as a worshipper at the shrine of discipline; in fact, I know that he held somewhat elastic views when he came to interpret rules and regulations. Apart from his likeable disposition, this certainly did contribute something to his popularity. Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> did not have either his initiative or courage in this respect... I gather that he was personally as popular in the Dáil as he was in Mungret years ago. It was with a keen sense of regret that I heard of his death".|$|R

These long, lonely, terrible {{journeys}} taken by him and Wetzel are mostly unnecessary. A sweet wife could soon make him see that.

I'd like to see him married and settled down, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> the rest <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> even Isaac. You know Jack's the last of the Zanes, that is, the old Zanes.

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me to be a sort of a holiday among the young and idle, one sleigh passing us after another, filled with young men and maidens, all {{sparkling}} with the excitement of the moment, and gay with youth and spirits. We passed no less than four of these sleighs on the river, the jingling of the bells, the quick movement, the laughter and gaiety, and the animation of the whole scene, far exceeding anything of the sort I had ever before witnessed. We were nearly across the river, when a sleigh more handsomely equipped than any we had yet seen, dashed down the bank, and came whirling past us like a comet. It was full of ladies, with the exception of one gentleman, who stood erect in front, driving. I recognised Bulstrode, in furs <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> capped and tailed, if not plumed, while among the half-dozen pairs of brilliant eyes that were turned with their owner's smiling faces on us, I saw one which never could be forgotten by me, that belonged to Anneke Mordaunt. I question if we were recognised, for the passage was like that of a meteor; but I could not avoid turning to gaze after the gay party. This change of position enabled me to be a witness of a very amusing consequence of Mr. Worden's experiment. A sleigh was coming in our direction, and the party in it seeing one who was known for a clergyman, walking on the ice, turned aside and approached him on a gallop, in order to offer the courtesy of a seat to a man of his sacred profession. Our divine heard the bells, and fearful of having a sleigh so near him, he commenced a downright flight, pursued by the people in the sleigh, as fast as their horses could follow. Everybody on the ice pulled up to gaze in wonder at this strange spectacle, until the whole party reached the shore, the Rev. Mr. Worden pretty well blown, as the reader may suppose.|$|E
5000|$|The Story of Civilization is also {{noteworthy}} {{because of}} the excellence of its writing style and contains numerous adages worthy of the Roman and Renaissance authors Durant admired.

2500|$|The Chemical Corps, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> {{branches}} <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Army, uses specific insignia {{to indicate}} a soldier's affiliation with the corps. The Chemical Corps branch insignia consists of a cobalt blue, enamel benzene ring superimposed over two crossed gold retorts. The branch insignia, which was adopted in 1918 by the fledgling Chemical Service, measures [...]5inches in height by 1.81inches in width. Crossed shells with a dragon head was also commonly used in France for the Chemical service. The Chemical Warfare Service approved the insignia in 1921 and in 1924 the ring adopted the cobalt blue enamel. When the Chemical Warfare Service changed designations to the Chemical Corps in 1946 the symbol was retained.|$|R

One month later, his debut album was released. The record was composed almost entirely on the piano as opposed to his signature acoustic guitar. In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Uhlmann stated that after a major performance with his band, each member went their own way to work on different projects: [...] "It album would certainly sell better if I could say that there were terrible fights, and then in six years there will be some a reunion special, but it wasn't <b>like</b> that. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had a lot going on in our lives at this time." [...] The album, which also features Casper, was released to critical acclaim and chart success in Germany, peaking at #4 and remaining on the charts for two months. The album achieved minor success in Austria, where it broke the Top 20, but did not manage to chart in Switzerland. Uhlmann toured throughout 2011 to support the album.|$|R
