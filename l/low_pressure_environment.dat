5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment</b> to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Aerated {{chocolate}} {{is a type}} of chocolate which {{has been turned into a}} foam via the addition of gas bubbles. The process for manufacturing it was invented by Rowntree's in 1947. During manufacturing the fluid chocolate mass is foamed with a propellant, and then cooled in a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment.</b> As the bubbles of gas expand they cool and help set the chocolate. This helps to maintain an even bubble distribution within the chocolate. Due to the isolating effect of the bubbles, air chocolate melts differently from compact bar chocolate — the mouthfeel is fragile-short at first, then as the {{chocolate is}} chewed it melts rapidly due to its bigger surface area. This intensifies the perception of taste.|$|E
50|$|Joint {{manipulation}} is characteristically {{associated with}} the production of an audible 'clicking' or 'popping' sound. This sound {{is believed to be}} the result of a phenomenon known as cavitation occurring within the synovial fluid of the joint. When a manipulation is performed, the applied force separates the articular surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint. This deforms the joint capsule and intra-articular tissues, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment,</b> some of the gases that are dissolved in the synovial fluid (which are naturally found in all bodily fluids) leave solution creating a bubble or cavity, which rapidly collapses upon itself, resulting in a 'clicking' sound. The contents of this gas bubble are thought to be mainly carbon dioxide. The effects of this process will remain for a period of time termed the 'refractory period', which can range from a few minutes to more than an hour, while it is slowly reabsorbed back into the synovial fluid. There is some evidence that ligament laxity around the target joint is associated with an increased probability of cavitation.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{modification}} techniques using plasmas {{have historically}} been completed in a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment</b> due to Pd (pressure x gap distance) considerations influencing the behavior of plasma generation. Generally, plasmas produced in a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment</b> are of a non-thermal or cold nature. The basic feature of non-thermal plasmas is the majority of electrical energy used to generate the plasma is primarily used to produce energetic electrons for generating chemical species. Low pressure plasmas serve many purposes for materials processing. Since the plasma environment is contained within a closed vessel, the plasma can be controlled very easily. Low pressure plasmas {{have been used in}} many industries but the complexity associated with the large pumping stations and limitation to batch processing has motivated new work in the area of atmospheric plasmas. Atmospheric plasmas offer both economic and technical justification for use over low pressure plasmas. Since atmospheric plasmas can be operated at ambient conditions, lower costs associated with continuous processing and a decrease in the complexity of equipment validate atmospheric plasma processing as a next generation plasma-aided manufacturing process. In an effort to advance acceptance of atmospheric plasma processing into industry, a proces...|$|E

This device operates by generating a plasma (ionized gas) a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment</b> in an enclosed <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environment</b> using argon gas. A small (2 cm) spiral antenna is embedded in a thin piece (2 mm) of Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC).

A radio-frequency (RF) wave is applied to the spiral antenna to generate a plasma in the argon gas. The RF frequency is 800 - 1000 MHz. When the bias voltage on the source electrode is raised to a high enough value (30 V), a DC glow discharge occurs within the slit and between the source and the RF plasma. The goal of the project is to observe the nature of the plasma when the voltage from the drain is swept up and down between 0 and 60 volts by measuring the current from both the source and drain and also watching for {{the point at which the}} drain voltage dominates the DC discharge instead of the source...|$|E

40|$|The mean annual surface {{pressure}} and temperature on present day Mars {{do not allow}} {{for the long term}} stability of liquid water on the surface. However, theoretical arguments have been advanced that suggest liquid water could form in transient events even though it would not be in equilibrium with the environment. Using a Mars General Circulation Model, we calculate where and for how long the {{surface pressure}} and surface temperature meet the minimum requirements for this metastability of liquid water. These requirements are that the pressure and temperature must be above the triple point of water, but below its boiling point. We find that there are five regions on Mars where these requirements are periodically satisfied: in the near equatorial regions of Amazonis, Arabia, and Elysium, and in the Hellas and Argyre impact basins. Whether liquid water ever forms in these regions depends on the availability of ice and heat, and on the evaporation rate. The latter is poorly understood for <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> CO 2 <b>environments,</b> but is likely to be so high that melting occurs rarely, if at all. However, in the relatively recent past, surface pressures may have been higher than they are today perhaps by as much as a factor of 2 or 3.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{increase in}} star formation efficiency with average cloud density, from several percent in whole giant molecular clouds to ~ 30 {{or more in}} cluster-forming cores, {{can be understood as}} the result of hierarchical cloud structure if there is a characteristic density as which individual stars become well defined. Also in this case, the efficiency of star formation increases with the dispersion of the density probability distribution function (pdf). Models with log-normal pdf's illustrate these effects. The difference between star formation in bound clusters and star formation in loose groupings is attributed to a difference in cloud pressure, with higher pressures forming more tightly bound clusters. This correlation accounts for the observed increase in clustering fraction with star formation rate and with the observation of Scaled OB Associations in <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>environments.</b> ``Faint fuzzie'' star clusters, which are bound but have low densities, can form in regions with high Mach numbers and low background tidal forces.
