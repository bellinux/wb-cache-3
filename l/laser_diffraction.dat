Results can easily be manipulated because the data is on a digital surface.

5000|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> {{analysis}} is accomplished via a red He-Ne laser, a commonly used gas laser for physics experiments {{that is made}} up of a laser tube, a high-voltage power supply, and structural packaging. [...] Alternatively, blue laser diodes or LEDs of shorter wavelength may be used. Angling of the light energy produced by the laser is detected by having a beam of light go through a suspension and then onto a sensor. A lens is placed between the object being analyzed and the detector's focal point, causing only the surrounding <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> to appear. The sizes the laser can analyze depend on the lens' focal length, the distance from the lens to its point of focus. As the focal length increases, the area the laser can detect increases as well, displaying a proportional relationship. A computer can then be used to detect the object's particle sizes from the light energy produced and its layout, which the computer derives from the data collected on the particle frequencies and wavelengths.|$|E

50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>diffraction,</b> {{a spatial}} {{sampling}} method, {{relies on the}} principle of Fraunhofer diffraction, which is caused by the light interacting with the drops in the spray. The scattering angle of the diffraction pattern is inversely related {{to the size of the}} drop. This nonintrusive method utilizes a long cylindrical optical probe volume. The scattered light passes through a special transforming lens system and is collected on a number of concentric photodiode rings. The signal from the photodiodes is used to back-calculate a drop size distribution. A number of lenses allow measurements from 1.2 to 1800 µm.|$|E

5000|$|Ektacytometry {{based on}} <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> {{analysis}} is a commonly preferred (and a fairly direct) method for measuring deformability. [...] Another direct metric is optical tweezers, which targets individual cells. Deformability can in effect be measured indirectly, such as {{by how much}} pressure and/or time it takes cells pass through pores of a filter (i.e., filterability or filtration) or perfuse through capillaries (perfusion), in vitro or in vivo, having smaller diameters than the cells'. Some deformability tests may be more physiologically-relevant than others for given applications. For example, perfusion is more sensitive to relatively small changes in deformability (compared to filterability), thus making it preferable for assessing RBC deformability in contexts where microcirculatory implications are of particular interest. Moreover, some tests may track how deformability itself changes as conditions change and/or as deformation is repeated.|$|E
50|$|In vitro {{compartmentalization}} {{method was}} first developed by Tawfik et al. Based {{on the idea}} that Darwinian evolution relies on the linkage of genotype to phenotype, Tawfik et al. designed aqueous compartments of water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions to mimic cellular compartments that can link genotype and phenotype. Emulsions of cell-like compartments were formed by adding in vitro transcription/translation reaction mixture to stirred mineral oil containing surfactants. The mean droplet diameter was measured to be 2.6 um by <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction.</b> As a proof of concept, Tawfik el al. designed an experiment that would transcribe and translate M. HaeIII gene in the presence of 107-fold excess of genes encoding another enzyme folA. 3’ of each gene is purposely designed to contain HaeIII R/M sequences, and when HaeIII methyltransferase was expressed from a M.HaeIII gene, it would methylate HaeIII R/M sequence and cause the gene to be resistant to restriction enzyme digestion. By selecting for DNA sequences that survive the endonuclease digestion, Tawfik el al. found there was enrichment for the M.HaeIII genes, i.e. 1000 fold {{in the first round of}} selection.|$|E
5000|$|Sprays are {{typically}} characterized by statistical quantities obtained from size and velocity measurements over many individual droplets. The {{most widely used}} quantities are size and velocity probability density distributions as well as fluxes, e.g., number, mass, momentum etc. Through a given plane, some instruments infer such statistical quantities from individual measurements, e.g., number density from light extinction, but very few instruments are capable of making direct size and velocity measurements of individual droplets in a spray( [...] Kalantari and Tropea, 2007). The three most widely used methods of drop size measurements are <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction,</b> optical imaging, and phase Doppler. All of these optical methods are non-intrusive. If all the drops had the same velocity, the measurements of drop size would be the identical for all methods. However, {{there is a significant}} difference between the velocity of larger and smaller drops. These optical methods are classified as either spatial or flux based. A spatial sampling method measures the drops in a finite measurement volume. The residence time of drops in the measurement volume affects the results. The flux-based methods sample continually over a measurement cross-section.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{directly}} follow and time resolve the rearrangement of the nuclei within molecules is a frontier of science that requires atomic spatial and few-femtosecond temporal resolutions. While <b>laser</b> induced electron <b>diffraction</b> can meet these requirements, it was recently concluded that molecules with particular orbital symmetries (such as πg) cannot be imaged using purely backscattering electron wave packets without molecular alignment. Here, we demonstrate, in direct contradiction to these findings, that the orientation {{and shape of}} molecular orbitals presents no impediment for retrieving molecular structure with adequate sampling of the momentum transfer space. We overcome previous issues by showcasing retrieval {{of the structure of}} randomly oriented O 2 and C 2 H 2 molecules, with πg and πu symmetries, respectively, and where their ionisation probabilities do not maximise along their molecular axes. While this removes a serious bottleneck for <b>laser</b> induced <b>diffraction</b> imaging, we find unexpectedly strong back scattering contributions from low-Z atoms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore the possibility of employing PAT for particle sizing during spray drying with the use of an in-line and at-line <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> system. Microspheres were made using maltodextrin and modified starch as wall material and size results obtained using PAT compared with those determined with off-line <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> and light microscopy. Median particle size results were highest for in-line <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction,</b> followed by at-line and off-line <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> and finally light microscopy. This was due to the presence of agglomerates which were measured as discrete microspheres in the in-line set-up. At-line and off-line <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> gave results more closely correlated with individual microsphere sizes due to agglomerate breakdown during the measurement process. Light microscopy allowed direct observation of the particle morphology, however, its use for particle sizing was tedious and sample size was much smaller compared to <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction.</b> Although PAT was found to be an efficient and convenient tool, careful data interpretation was needed taking into account the cohesiveness of the material measured. The at-line set-up appeared to be more suitable in this particular application...|$|E

40|$|Sedimentation {{has been}} a {{standard}} methodology for particle size analysis since the early 1900 s. In recent years <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> is beginning to replace sedimentation as the prefered technique in some industries, such as marine sediment analysis. However, for the particle size analysis of soils, which have a diverse range of both particle size and shape, <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> still requires evaluation of its reliability. In this study, the sedimentation based sieve plummet balance method and the <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> method were {{used to measure the}} particle size distribution of 22 soil samples representing four contrasting Australian Soil Orders. Initially, a precise wet riffling methodology was developed capable of obtaining representative samples within the recommended obscuration range for <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction.</b> It was found that repeatable results were obtained even if measurements were made at the extreme ends of the manufacturer's recommended obscuration range. Results from statistical analysis suggested that the use of sample pretreatment to remove soil organic carbon (and possible traces of calcium-carbonate content) made minor differences to the <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> particle size distributions compared to no pretreatment. These differences were found to be marginally statistically significant in the Podosol topsoil and Vertosol subsoil. There are well known reasons why sedimentation methods may be considered to 'overestimate' plate-like clay particles, while <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> will 'underestimate' the proportion of clay particles. In this study we used Lin's concordance correlation coefficient to determine the equivalence of <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> and sieve plummet balance results. The results suggested that the <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> equivalent thresholds corresponding to the sieve plummet balance cumulative particle sizes of < 2 μm, < 20 μm, and < 200 μm, were < 9 μm, < 26 μm, < 275 μm respectively. The many advantages of <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> for soil particle size analysis, and the empirical results of this study, suggest that deployment of <b>laser</b> <b>diffraction</b> as a standard test procedure can provide reliable results, provided consistent sample preparation is used...|$|E
