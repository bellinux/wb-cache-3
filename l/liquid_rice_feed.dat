40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify changes in rice {{planting}} and regional features of <b>rice</b> for <b>feed</b> production in Hokkaido. The study approach employed two analyses. First, by using statistical data, the changes in crop acreage of paddy rice were determined. Second, surveys of rice farmers showed details of the planting practices for <b>rice</b> for <b>feed</b> production. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) There are increasing regional disparities in the “production control policy” and <b>rice</b> for <b>feed</b> production. (2) Expansion of production of <b>rice</b> for <b>feed</b> is affected by local agriculture promotion policies. It is concluded that production of <b>rice</b> for <b>feed</b> contributes to maintenance of the rice acreage...|$|R
