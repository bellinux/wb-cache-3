40|$|AbstractProton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is a {{promising}} power generating device with high efficiency, zero emissions and working at atmospheric temperature and pressure. The {{performance of the}} fuel cell is highly influenced by the operating parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity and mass flow rates of reactant gases; and the design parameters like flow channel designs and dimensions, rib size, channel length, thickness and porosity of GDL, membrane type etc. In this paper, the effects of different Landing to Channel (LxC) width of flow channel were studied numerically. The full three-dimensional models of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell have been developed with a constant channel length of 20 mm and with different <b>Landing</b> to Channel <b>width</b> (LxC) in mm of 0. 5 x 0. 5, 1 x 1, 1. 5 x 1. 5, 2 x 2.

From the results, {{it was found that}} the PEMFC with <b>landing</b> to channel <b>width</b> of 0. 5 x 0. 5 mm has generated a high current density and high power density compared to other three designs.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This study {{concentrates}} on analysis of LongEZ aircraft data taken offshore of the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Due {{to the land}} structure of the region, {{it was possible to}} isolate the effect of narrow land on air as it flows offshore. The narrow land (Outer Banks) separates inland water from the sea. With greater land fetch, the internal boundary layer (IBL) over land grows deeper and the eddies presumably grow larger. Larger eddies typically decay more slowly than smaller eddies, and so the turbulence advected from land with a larger land fetch should survive longer over the sea and be greater in magnitude than that with smaller land fetch. The turbulence is studied using aircraft eddy correlation data as the flow is advected over the water. As expected, greater and longer-lasting turbulence is present downstream from greater <b>land</b> <b>widths.</b> Aircraft data taken over the Gulf Stream (GS) boundary are analyzed to study the effects of the sea surface temperature (SST) front on downstream boundary layer structure. Unstable and stable flows are studied in this region. The stable flow case is found to have an upside-down structure, with greater turbulence aloft causing stress convergence at the surface, which acts to accelerate the flow. The local thermally generated pressure gradient is important in the momentum budget across the GS front in both flow cases. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is analyzed qualitatively in the region between the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Stream front for intercomparison of data and to examine the influences of varying static stabilities and surface conditions upon the backscatter shown in satellite images. The growth rates of the internal boundary layer due to flow over a heterogeneous surface including flow from land over the water and flow between cooler water and warmer water are calculated. These results are compared to similar calculations of growth rates from previous experiments. It is found that the growth rate of an internal boundary layer is dependent on surface roughness, despite the inclusion of σ[subscript w] in the normalization of the growth rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is based on the}} post tsunami survey {{conducted}} in January 2005 along the southwest coast of India. Although tsunami affected the whole coastline of Kerala, it devastated the low- lying coastal areas of Kollam, Alleppey and Ernakulam districts leading to the loss of life and property. This paper illustrates the variation of tsunami intensity along the coasts of these districts and the consequent morphological changes occurred in the coastal area during tsunami. Topographic survey data showed that the coastal inundation was rampant along the worst affected regions where the coastal areas are like a narrow strip of <b>land</b> of <b>width</b> 100 - 400 m, lying between the Arabian Sea and the backwaters and the down slope of the coastal area increases towards the backwater side.

Post tsunami beach profiles showed erosion of the foreshore and backshore and landward transport of beach material during the run-up of waves at Puthu- Vypeen. The erosion of the backshore (berm) in several places along the coast was quite evident in the study.

50|$|The footage {{which can}} be built-upon is {{regulated}} according to a system involving two figures: building coverage ratio (kenpeiritsu) and floor area ratio (yōsekiritsu). Building coverage ratio is {{the ratio of the}} building footprint compared to the total area of the land. These two figures are often listed in advertisements for plots of land such as 70:400 (where 70 means the building coverage ratio is 70% and 400 is the floor area ratio or 400%). This would mean that a 4 story home could be built using 70% of the land. Thus, for a maximum allowable coverage ratio of 50%, the greatest building footprint allowed for a lot of 100m2 would be 50m2. Floor area ratio is the total floor area of the house (excluding the roof and basement) as compared to the area of land the house is built upon; for a maximum FAR of 150%, the greatest possible total floor area for a house built on a 100m2 lot would be 150m2. Both maximum values vary according to the location of the <b>land</b> and <b>width</b> of facing roadway, with more built-up areas with wider roads generally allowing greater maximum floorspace, and building coverage dictated by factors such as frontage, nearby roads, and construction materials. Additionally, the number of floors in a structure may be restricted, in order to avoid excessive blockage of light to neighboring properties.|$|R
