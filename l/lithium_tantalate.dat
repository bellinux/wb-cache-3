The appropriate phosphor material should have good adsorption and emission properties, good thermal and chemical stability, minimal thermal quenching, high quantum yield, and is preferably inexpensive and easy to fabricate. Tantalates possess many of these criteria, and <b>lithium</b> lanthanum <b>tantalate</b> materials warrant thorough investigation. In this study, we investigated red luminescence of two <b>lithium</b> lanthanum <b>tantalates</b> via three mechanisms: (1) Eu-doping, (2) Mn-doping and (3) self-activation of the tantalum polyhedra. Of these three mechanisms, Mn-doping proved to be the most promising.

40|$|International audienceThe {{demand for}} highly coupled high quality {{acoustic}} wave devices for radio-frequency (RF) signal processing based on passive devices has generated a strong innovative activity, yielding {{the investigation of}} new excitation principles and waveguide structures. Periodically poled transducers (PPTs) have been recently investigated [E. Courjon et al., J. Appl. Phys. 102, 114107 (2007) ], {{as an alternative to}} classical interdigital transducers (IDTs) for the excitation and detection of guided acoustic waves. PPTs have two principal advantages compared to IDTs: the robustness of the excitation versus defects or surface contamination and the possibility to excite waves exhibiting a wavelength equal to the poling period. Here a new acoustic resonator concept is suggested, allowing high frequency operation with a simplified package. The idea consists of using a waveguide based on a PPT fabricated on a ferroelectric single-crystal substrate such as <b>lithium</b> niobate or <b>tantalate</b> inserted between two single-crystal substrates allowing the guidance of elastic waves without losses.

50|$|Mid-IR spectrometers {{commonly}} use pyroelectric detectors that {{respond to}} changes in temperature as the intensity of IR radiation falling on them varies.

These detectors operate at ambient temperatures and provide adequate sensitivity for most routine applications. To achieve the best sensitivity {{the time for a}} scan is typically a few seconds. Cooled photoelectric detectors are employed for situations requiring higher sensitivity or faster response. Liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detectors are the most widely used in the mid-IR. With these detectors an interferogram can be measured in as little as 10 milliseconds. Uncooled indium gallium arsenide photodiodes or DTGS are the usual choices in near-IR systems. Very sensitive liquid-helium-cooled silicon or germanium bolometers are used in the far-IR where both sources and beamsplitters are inefficient.|$|E
50|$|Femtosecond laser {{micromachining}} is {{used for}} device fabrication by milling 'air' holes and/or troughs into ferroelectric crystals by directing them through the focus region of a femtosecond laser beam. This is the first demonstration of convenient, controllable, and rapid large scale damage induced in lithium niobate and <b>lithium</b> <b>tantalate.</b> The advantages of femtosecond laser micromachining {{for a wide range}} of materials have been well documented. In brief, free electrons are created within the beam focus through multiphoton excitation. Because the peak intensity of a femtosecond laser pulse is many orders of magnitude higher than that from longer pulse or continuous wave lasers, the electrons are rapidly accelerated and heated to form a plasma. The electrostatic instability, produced by the plasma, of the remaining lattice ions results in ejection of these ions and hence ablation of the material, leaving a material void in the laser focus region. Since multiphoton excited free electrons are always available at the beam focus, highly uniform and repeatable damage confined to the laser focus region results. Also, since the pulse duration and ablation time scales are much faster than the thermalization time, femtosecond laser micromachining does not suffer from the adverse effects of a heat-affected-zone, like cracking and melting in regions neighboring the intended damage region.|$|E
