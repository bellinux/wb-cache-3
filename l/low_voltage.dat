5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E

5|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have <b>Low</b> <b>voltage</b> ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} electro-reflectance {{measurements}} to study charge-density-wave (CDW) polarization dynamics at voltages near the CDW depinning onset (Von) in the quasi-one-dimensional conductor K 0. 3 MoO 3 ("blue bronze"). For <b>low</b> <b>voltages,</b> where the phase-slip rate is low, {{it is expected}} that the polarization relaxation time should be inversely proportional to the CDW diffusion constant, which is expected to diverge at Von. At T= 78 K, we observe saturation of the relaxation time at <b>low</b> <b>voltages,</b> suggesting {{that we are in the}} low phase-slip limit and allowing us to estimate the non-critical value of the CDW diffusion constant D= 0. 02 cm 2 /s, consistent with the measured phason velocity. At other temperatures, the relaxation time increases with decreasing volage even at the <b>lowest</b> <b>voltages</b> we could measure. In no case do we observe the expected "critical speeding up", setting an upper limit on the critical region of (V/Von - 1) crit < 0. 06.

25|$|The DDR3L (DDR3 <b>Low</b> <b>Voltage)</b> {{standard}} is an addendum to the JESD79-3 DDR3 Memory Device Standard specifying <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> devices.

The DDR3L and DDR3U specifications are compatible with the original DDR3 standard and can run at either the lower voltage or at 1.50 V. However, newer DDR3L-capable devices, which only operate at 1.35V, such as systems using fourth-generation Intel Core processors, are not compatible with DDR3 SDRAM since DDR3 SDRAM operates only at 1.50V.|$|E
