5|$|On Election Day, Claire and Frank {{learn that}} they may lose because of <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b> They exploit a {{possible}} terrorist threat to close down multiple polling centers in key states, such as Ohio. This leading to numerous states filing lawsuits and refusing honoring the election results.|$|E
5|$|By October 1988, the {{campaign}} had secured ballot access in 46 {{states and the}} District of Columbia, and newspapers across the nation began running editorials and letters supporting Paul's run, and criticizing the low volume of media coverage. The New York Times chronicled Paul's campaign in late October. Paul's 25-year-old son, Rand Paul {{who served as the}} aide-de-camp, was interviewed and explained that Paul had raised $2 million, $500,000 of which was spent on ballot access. Paul had spent $40,000 a month on traveling expenses. Just prior to Election Day, Paul predicted a <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b> Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|The EU's {{institutional}} set up is also {{somewhat similar}} {{to the government of}} Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} EU's Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout,</b> in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.|$|E
25|$|In {{this second}} presidential election, Karzai was {{announced}} {{to have received}} over 50% of the votes. The election was tainted by lack of security, <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.|$|E
25|$|The figures alleged by the EU {{deputy chief}} {{observer}} represented approximately 36%, 19%, and 18% {{of the votes}} counted for Karzai, Abdullah, and Bashardost, respectively. Invalidating the 1.5 million ballots would reduce the already <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> figure to under 27%.|$|E

50|$|In general {{elections}} turnout has ranged from 87.9% in 1910 to 41.7% in 2001. In its 1999 by-election the constituency experienced the <b>lowest</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> post-war of 19.6%.|$|R
25|$|The 2004 Afghan presidential {{election}} was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai {{won in the}} first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the 2009 {{presidential election}} was characterized by lack of security, <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout,</b> and widespread electoral fraud. The vote, along with elections for 420 provincial council seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{was characterized by}} lack of security, <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> and low awareness of the people about the election and election process and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud. A second round run-off vote, announced under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, was originally scheduled for 7 November 2009, but it was cancelled after Abdullah refused to participate, and Hamid Karzai was declared President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term.|$|E
25|$|Conservative {{support is}} strongest in Calgary Heritage (formerly Calgary Southwest, the riding of Stephen Harper) and Calgary Midnapore (formerly Calgary Southeast), {{two of the}} most {{affluent}} and ethnically homogeneous Calgary ridings where Conservative support routinely tops 70%. The visible minority communities in Calgary are clustered in the ridings of Calgary Skyview (formerly Calgary Northeast) and Calgary Forest Lawn (formerly Calgary East), however these two ridings routinely suffer from abysmally <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> levels (among the lowest in urban Canada).|$|E

50|$|A {{by-election}} for the Prague 10 Senate {{seat was}} held in the Czech Republic on 19-20 September 2014 and 26-27 September 2014. The election was held after incumbent Jaromír Štětina got elected member of European Parliament. <b>Voter</b> <b>turnout</b> was 15.8% for first round and 8.75% for second round. It was the <b>lowest</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> for any Senate election so far.|$|R
25|$|Republican Greg Ballard {{chose not}} to run for a third term in the 2015 mayoral election. Republican Chuck Brewer and Democrat Joe Hogsett were the {{candidates}} to replace him. Each had similar plans for addressing the city's issues, and the commonality between them contributed to a very <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b> Hogsett previously held public office as Indiana Secretary of State, and had served in government for over 30 years, giving him greater name recognition than Brewer, a local restaurateur. Hogsett was elected with 63% of the vote, officially taking office on January 1, 2016.|$|E
25|$|On 8 January 1977 a {{large number}} of {{opposition}} political parties grouped to form the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA). Bhutto called fresh elections, and PNA participated fully in those elections. They managed to contest the elections jointly even though there were grave splits on opinions and views within the party. The PNA faced defeat but did not accept the results, alleging that the election was rigged. They proceeded to boycott the provincial elections. Despite this, there was a high voter turnout in the national elections; however, as provincial elections were held amidst <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> and an opposition boycott, the PNA declared the newly elected Bhutto government as illegitimate.|$|E
25|$|February 8, 2007 was a {{very cold}} day, and {{that may have been}} a {{contributing}} factor in the <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b> When the polling stations closed at 8:00p.m., it took two hours to count the ballots and declare Ferreira the winner. At his victory party, Donald C. MacDonald (the former Ontario CCF/NDP leader from the 1953 to 1970 and local area MPP for almost thirty years), joined Ferreira onstage in a symbolic passing of the generational torch ceremony. One of the coincidences of this NDP election victory was, that it came almost exactly 65 years to the day, when the CCF first won York South, in the February 9, 1942 by-election. In that election Joseph Noseworthy won a surprise victory, similar to Ferreira's.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{justification for}} compulsory voting {{at the federal}} level was the <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> (59.38%) at the 1922 federal election, down from 71.59% at the 1919 federal election. Compulsory voting was not on the platform of either the Stanley Bruce-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the Matthew Charlton-led Labor opposition. The actual initiative for change was made by Herbert Payne, a backbench Tasmanian Nationalists senator who on 16 July 1924 introduced a private member's bill in the Senate. Payne's bill was passed with little debate (the House of Representatives agreeing to it in less than an hour), and in neither house was a division required, hence no votes were recorded against the bill. It received Royal Assent on 31 July 1924 as the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1924. The 1925 federal election was the first to be conducted under compulsory voting, which saw the turnout figure rise to 91.4%. The turnout increased to about 95% within a couple of elections and has stayed at about that level since. Compulsory voting at referendums was considered when a referendum was proposed in 1915, but, as the referendum was never held, the idea was put on hold.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} election, Wilkinson {{defeated}} Harper {{by a vote}} of 504,674 to 273,141. By capturing 65% of the vote, he broke Julian Carroll's record of 62.8%. <b>Low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> prohibited him from setting the record for most votes received by a candidate in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and he received several thousand fewer votes than Brereton Jones, the victorious Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. He carried 115 of Kentucky's 120 counties [...] besting Carroll's old record of 99 [...] but lost in Fayette, his county of residence. A poll conducted by a Louisville television station after the election showed that 76% of voters wished they had another candidate to vote for.|$|E
25|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} November 7. This election had the <b>lowest</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> for a presidential election since 1948, with only 55 {{percent of the electorate}} voting. Part of the steep drop from the previous elections {{can be explained by the}} ratification of the 26th Amendment which expanded the franchise to 18-year-olds.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 New Orleans mayoral {{election}} {{occurred on}} the day before Super Bowl XLIV, the first (and only) Super Bowl for which the New Orleans Saints have ever competed. The year's highly successful football season brought about an unprecedented amount of local support for the team and resulted in relatively <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnouts</b> due to preoccupation with citywide celebrations.|$|R

It also saw the <b>lowest</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> of 45.5%, the second time it had fallen below 50%.|$|R
500|$|She {{continued}} to be active in the independence cause and participated in the protests against the United States Navy's presence in Vieques. Lebrón appeared as a witness at the [...] "International Tribunal on Violations of Human Rights in Puerto Rico and Vieques" [...] held on November 17–21, 2000, {{on the island of}} Vieques. According to the local newspaper El Vocero, her audience applauded when Lebrón said {{at the end of her}} deposition [...] "I had the honor of leading the act against the U.S. Congress on March 1, 1954, when we demanded freedom for Puerto Rico and we told the world that we are an invaded nation, occupied and abused by the United States of America. I feel very proud of having performed that day, of having answered the call of the motherland". On June 26, 2001, Lebrón was among a group of protesters that were arrested for trespassing in the restricted area in Vieques. On July 19, 2001, she was sentenced to 60 days of prison on the charge that she was trespassing on Navy property. Lebrón had already served 23 days in jail since her June arrest, leaving her to serve 37 additional days. Less than two years after Lebron's Vieques protest, on May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy left Vieques and turned over its facilities to the government of Puerto Rico. Following this, she continued her participation in other pro independence activities. Lebrón was among the political leaders that opposed the Democratic Party's primary that took place on June 1, 2008. The group anticipated a <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> in the event, while declaring that Puerto Rico [...] "deserves sovereignty". On June 10, 2008, Lebrón suffered a fracture in her hip and a wrist after accidentally falling in her house. She underwent corrective surgery at a San Juan hospital. A film inspired by Lebrón's life is currently in the works, with actress Eva Longoria being involved.|$|E

Officials, witnesses, and journalists at several polling stations reported low participation numbers. Afghan journalist and research analyst, Abdulhadi Hairan, observed that the <b>low</b> <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> in Kabul resulted in reporters and cameramen having to wait nearly to midday before having enough voter interviews to send back to their news organizations.

50|$|Without competition, {{the public}} at large can lose {{interest}} in the processes of elections.
