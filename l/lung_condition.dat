50|$|SP-B is encoded by SFTPB, a single, 11425 {{nucleotide}} long gene on chromosome 2. Mutations in {{this gene}} {{are the basis}} for several of the <b>lung</b> <b>conditions</b> mentioned above.

Many SNP's have been identified in relation to <b>lung</b> <b>conditions.</b> They have been correlated to severe influenza, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation necessity, and more.|$|R

[...] Sally Wentworth, another Spiritualist, offered Eddy $300-worth of bed and board in Stoughton if Eddy would treat her daughter's <b>lung</b> <b>condition</b> and teach Wentworth the healing method. Eddy stayed there for two years, from 1868 to 1870, teaching Wentworth with Quimby's unpublished essay, [...] "Questions and Answers."

2500|$|Abe {{returned}} to Japan briefly in April 1940 {{to study at}} Seijo High School, but a <b>lung</b> <b>condition</b> forced his return to Mukden, where he read Jaspers, Heidegger, Dostoyevsky, and Edmund Husserl. Abe began his studies at Tokyo Imperial University in 1943 to study medicine, partially {{out of respect for}} his father, but also because [...] "hose students who specialized in medicine were exempted from becoming soldiers. My friends who chose the humanities were killed in the war." [...] He {{returned to}} Manchuria around the end of World War II. Specifically, Abe left the Tokyo University Medical School in October 1944, returning to his father's clinic in Mukden. That winter, his father died of eruptive typhus. Returning to Tokyo with his father's ashes, Abe reentered the medical school. Abe started writing novellas and short stories during his last year in university. He graduated in 1948 with a medical degree, joking once that he was allowed to graduate only on the condition that he would not practice.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the attacks, media reports suggested that tens of thousands might have been killed in the attacks, as over 50,000 people could be inside the World Trade Center, although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that approximately 17,400 occupants were in the towers at the time of the attacks. Ultimately, 2,753 death certificates (excluding those for hijackers) were filed relating to the 9/11 attacks in New York City, including one filed for Felicia Dunn-Jones, who was added to the official death toll in Dunn-Jones died five months later from a <b>lung</b> <b>condition</b> linked to exposure to dust during the collapse of the World Trade Center.
