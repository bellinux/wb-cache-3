5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was not so <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
25|$|There, Leo is {{revealed}} as {{a son of}} Hephaestus, Piper as a daughter of Aphrodite and Jason as a son of Jupiter, though Hera tells him he is her champion. In the Aphrodite cabin, Piper is horrified {{to discover that the}} head councilor, Drew, is abusing her position as well as the rare gift of charmspeaking (which Piper also possesses) {{to take advantage of the}} other Aphrodite campers. In the Hephaestus cabin, it {{is revealed}} that Leo has the rare ability to conjure fire (a power that has not been seen for centuries), but does not use nor tell anyone about it out of guilt about his mother's death seven years prior. Meanwhile, Jason finds out about his sister Thalia Grace, a demigod daughter of Zeus and a Hunter of Artemis. Shortly thereafter, the three are given a quest to rescue Hera from danger. In the woods, Leo discovers a mechanical bronze dragon (made by the Hephaestus campers <b>long</b> <b>ago)</b> <b>that</b> he names Festus (Happy) and starts to repair him. After encountering Boreas, Piper, Jason, and Leo soon discover that their enemies are working under orders from Gaea, the Greek primordial goddess of the Earth, to overthrow the gods. Throughout their journey, they run into three Cyclopes, Medea, Midas, and Lycaon and eventually manage to save Coach Hedge. Thalia and Jason meet each other for the first time since Jason was captured by Hera when he was an infant.|$|E

2500|$|Strabo {{uses the}} astronomical cubit (pēchus, {{the length of}} the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger) as a measure of the {{elevation}} of the sun. The term [...] "cubit" [...] in this context is obscure; {{it has nothing to do}} with distance along either a straight line or an arc, does not apply to celestial distances, and has nothing to do with the gnōmōn. Hipparchus borrowed this term from Babylonia, where it meant 2°. They in turn took it from ancient Sumer so <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>that</b> if the connection between cubits and degrees was known in either Babylonia or Ionia it did not survive. Strabo states degrees in either cubits or as a proportion of a great circle. The Greeks also used the length of day at the summer solstice as a measure of latitude. It is stated in equinoctial hours (hōrai isēmerinai), one being 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset on an equinox.|$|E
