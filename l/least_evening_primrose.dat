50|$|The <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> was {{introduced}} to Europe in the early 17th century as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens.

Today, the <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> is mainly known as garden plant and as medicinal plant in specialized sectors.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} gamma-linolenic acid (an omega- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) {{in the form of}} <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil on calcium oxalate urinary stone risk factors in 2 ethnic groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight black and 8 white healthy male subjects ingested 1, 000 mg <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil (Natrodale, Kuils River, South Africa) daily for 20 days while following a free diet. Arachidonic acid content was determined by a dietary questionnaire. On days 0, 10 and 20, and 4 days after protocol 24 -hour urine samples were collected. Samples were analyzed using routine assays. RESULTS: Citraturia increased significantly in each group. Urinary oxalate showed a tendency to decrease in black subjects. Calciuria and the Tiselius risk index decreased significantly in each group. Carryover effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge increased citraturia has not been previously reported for any essential fatty acid. We hypothesize that <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil inhibits lipogenesis, thereby decreasing citrate consumption. For the decrease in oxaluria we suggest that <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil alters membrane fatty acid composition, thereby inhibiting the modulation of protein kinases that lead to hyperoxaluria. In regard to decreased calciuria we suggest that <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil modulates delta- 5 and/or delta- 6 -desaturase, thereby inhibiting the production of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E 2, which influence calciuria. The different response in the 2 groups with respect to oxaluria confirms previously reported differences in sensitivity toward supplemental ingestion. Data suggest that <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil supplementation should be investigated as a possible conservative treatment for calcium oxalate urolithiasis...|$|R
