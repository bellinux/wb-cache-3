In 1955 Casals married as {{his second wife}} long-time associate Francesca Vidal de Capdevila, who died that same year. In 1957, at age 80, Casals married 20-year-old Marta Montañez y Martinez. He {{is said to have}} dismissed concerns that marriage to someone 60 years his junior might be hazardous by saying, [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: if she dies, she dies." [...] Pablo and Marta made their permanent residence in the town of Ceiba, and lived in a house called [...] "El Pessebre" [...] (The Manger). He made an impact in the Puerto Rican music scene, by founding the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra in 1958, and the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|In Russia, Savchenko {{is portrayed}} {{extremely}} negatively in the media; according to BBC News [...] "Crude, {{and at times}} sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko {{is known as a}} [...] "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her [...] "Satan's daughter". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that [...] "not even in my worst nightmare could I have imagined that I would have to ask you not to kill a woman." [...] In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, [...] "However you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> doesn't benefit Russia". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko [...] "a trophy prisoner" [...] had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an [...] "obvious stitch-up" [...] you could [...] "see the threads".|$|E
2500|$|For {{years during}} Gwynn's career, media preseason {{predictions}} declared that [...] "this season" [...] {{he would become}} {{the first player to}} hit [...]400 since Williams in 1941. Relatively healthy in 1994, Gwynn batted [...]394, his career-high and the highest in the National League since Bill Terry hit [...]401 in 1930; he also had a league-leading [...]454 OBP. From April 22 through the 24 against Philadelphia, he had eight consecutive hits and reached base nine straight times, tying Padres records held by Winfield and Bip Roberts, respectively. Gwynn was batting [...]383 at the All-Star break; however, talk of a strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) was looming, and he wanted to get to [...]400 before that date. He hit [...]423 over 28 games in the second half, and heated up to [...]475 though 10 games in August, when the season ended prematurely on August 11 due to the baseball strike. He was 6-for-9 in the last two games and 3-for-5 in the eventual finale, falling short of batting [...]400 by three hits. Fans were awaiting an end to the strike and for Gwynn to resume his quest for [...]400, but hopes of the season restarting were dashed when the World Series was canceled. He later commented, [...] "I'm not unhappy or bitter that the strike came. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: I would have sooner fell short due to the strike than if I would have hit [...]400 and then the strike came. Then people would have thought I would have collapsed down the stretch, instead of being at [...]390 when the strike came and being so close." [...] That year, Gwynn pulled the ball with greater regularity. He was 10th in the league with a slugging percentage of [...]568, which was also his career-high. His 12homers in 419at-bats was a higher rate than in 1986, when he hit a then-career high 14homers in 642at-bats. He won another batting title (.368) in 1995. For the second straight year, he did not go longer than two games without a hit. He led the NL in batting {{with runners in scoring position}} (.394), and he had a then-career high 90 RBI. Gwynn hit in 15 straight games in July, his longest hitting streak since his 18-game run in 1988. He hit 28-for-65 (.431) with 15 RBI during the streak. Although he missed batting [...]400 in 1994, he batted [...]403 during a 179-game stretch between July 3, 1993 and May 9, 1995.|$|E

60|$|The {{notion of}} the {{subjective}} is not contained in the {{notion of the}} objective. On the contrary they mutually exclude each other. The subjective therefore must supervene to the objective. The conception of nature does not apparently involve the co-presence of an intelligence making an ideal duplicate of it, that is, representing it. This desk for instance would (according to our natural notions) be, though there should exist no sentient being to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> then is the problem of natural philosophy. It assumes the objective or unconscious nature as the first, and as therefore to explain how intelligence can supervene to it, or how itself can grow into intelligence. If it should appear, that all enlightened naturalists, without having distinctly proposed the problem to themselves, have yet constantly moved in the line of its solution, it must afford a strong presumption that the problem itself is founded in nature. For if all knowledge has, as it were, two poles reciprocally required and presupposed, all sciences must proceed from the one or the other, and must tend toward the opposite as far as the equatorial point in which both are reconciled and become identical. The necessary tendency therefore of all natural philosophy is from nature to intelligence; and this, and no other is the true ground and occasion of the instinctive striving to introduce theory into our views of natural phaenomena. The highest perfection of natural philosophy would consist in the perfect spiritualization of all the laws of nature into laws of intuition and intellect. The phaenomena (the material) most wholly disappear, and the laws alone (the formal) must remain. Thence it comes, that in nature itself the more the principle of law breaks forth, the more does the husk drop off, the phaenomena themselves become more spiritual and at length cease altogether in our consciousness. The optical phaenomena are but a geometry, the lines of which are drawn by light, and the materiality of this light itself has already become matter of doubt. In the appearances of magnetism all trace of matter is lost, and of the phaenomena of gravitation, which not a few among the most illustrious Newtonians have declared no otherwise comprehensible than as an immediate spiritual influence, there remains nothing but its law, the execution of which on a vast scale is the mechanism of the heavenly motions. The theory of natural philosophy would then be completed, when all nature was demonstrated to be identical in essence with that, which in its highest known power exists in man as intelligence and self-consciousness; when the heavens and the earth shall declare not only the power of their maker, but the glory and the presence of their God, even as he appeared to the great prophet during the vision of the mount in the skirts of his divinity.|$|E
