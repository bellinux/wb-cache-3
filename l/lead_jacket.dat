50|$|Cables for industrial, {{commercial}} and apartment buildings may contain many insulated conductors in an overall jacket, with helical tape steel or aluminium armour, or steel wire armour, and perhaps as well an overall PVC or <b>lead</b> <b>jacket</b> {{for protection from}} moisture and physical damage. Cables intended for very flexible service or in marine applications may be protected by woven bronze wires. Power or communications cables (e.g., computer networking) that are routed in or through air-handling spaces (plenums) of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in metal conduit, or rated for low flame and smoke production.|$|E
50|$|Most {{high-voltage}} cables {{for power}} transmission {{that are currently}} sold on the market are insulated by a sheath of XLPE. Some cables may have a lead or aluminium jacket in conjunction with XLPE insulation to allow for fiber optics. Before 1960, underground power cables were insulated with oil and paper and ran in a rigid steel pipe, or a semi-rigid aluminium or <b>lead</b> <b>jacket</b> or sheath. The oil was kept under pressure to prevent formation of voids that would allow partial discharges within the cable insulation. There are still many of these oil-and-paper insulated cables in use worldwide. Between 1960 and 1990, polymers became more widely used at distribution voltages, mostly EPDM (ethylene propylene diene M-class); however, their relative unreliability, particularly early XLPE, resulted in a slow uptake at transmission voltages. While cables of 330 kV are commonly constructed using XLPE, this has occurred only in recent decades.|$|E

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the correlation between}} radiation doses absorbed by health care workers and dose area product meter (DAP) measurements at Universitas Hospital, Bloemfontein. The DAP is an instrument which accurately measures the radiation emitted from the source. The study included the interventional radiologists, radiographers and nurses associated with radiological intervention procedures during the period 1 August 2003 - 31 August 2003. The amount of radiation produced during every procedure was measured by a dose area product meter (DAP) and routinely recorded. The absorbed doses received by health care workers were measured using a thermoluminescent dose meter (TLD). The TLDs were analysed and recorded {{at the end of}} each week. Health care workers wore TLDs on the following areas: forehead, thyroid (attached under thyroid guard), and abdomen (worn under <b>lead</b> <b>jacket).</b> A strong positive correlation (r = 0. 9, p = 0. 0374) was found between the radiographers’ head TLD and DAP meter readings. All other correlations between TLD and DAP readings were not statistically significant. Strong positive correlations were found between the TLD readings of the radiologists’ and nurses’ bodies, the nurses’ and radiographers’ bodies and the radiologists’ and the radiographers’ bodies, all of which were statistically significant...|$|E
