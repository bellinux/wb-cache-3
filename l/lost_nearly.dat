5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in September 1945, Lieutenant-Colonel G. Archey of the British Military Administration {{took over}} Directorship of the Library and museum on 6 September. The Library only suffered minimal losses and damages {{during the three}} and a half years of Japanese Occupation, as the Japanese preserved the Library well due to its respected reputation in academia.

5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> US$1billion.|$|E

The youth classification was won by Kevin Seeldraeyers, who remained consistent after Thomas Lövkvist <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> 25 minutes on stage 16. Lövkvist had, for one day earlier in the race, led not just the youth but also the general classification.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Hürtgen Forest {{began on}} 19 September, with the assault of the 3rd Armored and 9th Infantry Divisions. The battle quickly turned {{into one of}} attrition; by mid-October the two Allied {{divisions}} had <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> 80% of their total combat strength, or roughly 4,500 men, while the Germans had lost close to 3,300. On 2 November the U.S. 28th Infantry Division entered the fight, but {{was not able to}} make headway and was forced to defend itself against German counterattacks between 5–7 November. The 28th Infantry Division lost over 6,100 combat casualties in Hürtgen.|$|E
5|$|The Germans also {{suffered}} heavily; the 47th Panzer Corps had committed its last reserves into the battle and could hardly afford {{to maintain its}} defensive line, while the 47th Volksgrenadier Division had suffered over 4,300 casualties during the fighting and the 340th Division had <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> 2,000 soldiers. This latter division {{was replaced by the}} 363rd Volksgrenadier and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, as the 340th was pulled out in order to be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> everything in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century, the {{institutions}} of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came {{to rest in the}} Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. Disaster struck {{in the form of the}} Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> a third of its population. London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} Burgoyne's {{campaign}} was significant. Not only had he <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> 1,000 men, of which half were regulars, {{but he also}} lost the crucial Indian support. In a council following the battle, many of the Indians (who had traveled with him from Quebec) decided to go home. This loss severely hampered Burgoyne's reconnaissance efforts {{in the days to}} come. The failure to bring in nearby supplies meant that he had to rely on supply lines that were already dangerously long, and that he eventually broke in September. The shortage of supplies was a significant factor in his decision to surrender at Saratoga, following which France entered the war.|$|E

5|$|Upon its {{establishment}} in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths {{existed in the}} state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> all of its Jewish minority during the Holocaust. Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of Evangelical Protestants and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons not}} entirely clear, on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg {{to take his}} {{division}} of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Günzburg to Wertingen {{in preparation for the}} main Austrian advance out of Ulm. Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions– Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Nicolas Oudinot's grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner. The Battle of Wertingen had been an easy French victory.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed {{caught up}} with the Donners and went on ahead with one of his teamsters, Walter Herron. The two shared a horse, {{and they were able to}} cover 25–40 miles (40–64km) per day. The rest of the party rejoined the Donners, but their bad luck continued. Native Americans chased away all of Graves' horses, and another wagon was left behind. With grass in short supply, the cattle spread out more, which allowed the Paiutes to steal 18 more during one evening; and several mornings later, the Paiutes shot another 21. So far, the company had <b>lost</b> <b>nearly</b> 100 oxen and cattle, and their rations were almost {{completely}} depleted. One more stretch of desert lay ahead. The Eddys' oxen had been killed by Native Americans and they were forced to abandon their wagon. The family had eaten all their stores, but the other families refused to assist their children. The Eddys were forced to walk, carrying their children and miserable with thirst. Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon. But the desert soon came to an end, and the party found the Truckee River in beautiful lush country.|$|E
