5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I <b>Live</b> <b>My</b> Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to <b>live.</b> <b>My</b> back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could <b>live</b> <b>my</b> life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] a fantastic and dramatic song. Similarly, Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua wrote, [...] "There's a great melodramatic kick to this song, which comes across like a quiet storm slow jam spiced up with modern drum programming. 'I'd rather not live at all than <b>live</b> <b>my</b> life without you' is an unusually self-pitying lyric for Beyoncé, but she sells it well regardless."

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] {{talks about}} the {{inability}} to fight what the heart wants, {{even if it is}} wrong. Beyoncé prostrates herself at the mercy of an indifferent love interest, telling him that she would rather die young than to live her life without him. Beyoncé also sings about leaving a legacy as she shows her [...] "epic" [...] neediness to her love interest, as stated by Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club. The music stays soft in the first verse, where Beyoncé likens her romantic interest to American actor James Dean, [...] "You're my James Dean / you make me feel like I'm seventeen". She also relates about how good girls often fall for bad boys; she affirms that [...] "bad boy" [...] she loves, [...] "drive too fast" [...] and [...] "smoke too much". During the chorus, Beyoncé projects the image of a woman, who wants to love and be loved regardless of what others may say, [...] "I'd rather die young / Than <b>live</b> <b>my</b> life without you / Rather not live at all". As the song progresses, Beyoncé references [...] "some deeper emotional fires burning" [...] as she sings, [...] "Nobody understands what we've been through".|$|E
500|$|On his {{spectrum}} of theistic probability, which has seven levels between 1 (100% {{belief in a}} God) and 7 (100% belief that gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he's a 6.9, which represents a [...] "de facto atheist" [...] who thinks [...] "I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I <b>live</b> <b>my</b> life {{on the assumption that}} he is not there." [...] When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, [...] "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies {{at the bottom of the}} garden." [...] In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion. In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to <b>live</b> <b>my</b> life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me." [...] In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on {{their view of the}} film—some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial—but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted [...] "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn." [...] A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was [...] "the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary". Koi...
