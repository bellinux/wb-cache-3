500|$|The {{film was}} criticised {{for the use}} of some [...] "sexist dialogues" [...] in the first half which were playing to a certain [...] "new generation" [...] audience. Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film, [...] "it is such banter, which we often dismiss with a <b>laugh,</b> <b>that</b> helps {{perpetuate}} rape culture." [...] When asked about this, the director replied, [...] "I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives. I don't want to elaborate, but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences. Yes, frankly, I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes. But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval." ...|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} early stages of her presidential {{campaign}} for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled [...] "Love Her", [...] "Hate Her", while Mother Jones titled its profile of her [...] "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates, while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled [...] "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate". By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's <b>laugh,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle." [...] The [...] "bitch" [...] epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics, flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well. Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] and related incidents {{in the run-up to the}} January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events [...] "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Laffing Sal {{is one of}} {{the several}} {{automated}} characters that were used to attract carnival and amusement park patrons to funhouses and dark rides throughout the United States.

2500|$|While Niven was co-hosting the 46th Annual Oscars ceremony, a {{naked man}} {{appeared}} behind him, [...] "streaking" [...] across the stage.

60|$|Hester's breast heaved {{and from}} her black eyes there shot a {{magnificent}} look of defiance. He <b>laughed.</b> <b>That</b> was the white blood.|$|R

2500|$|In [...] "The Pez Dispenser" [...] George dates a pianist, Noelle {{who wishes}} to break up with George after Elaine laughs during a recital. George has a phone {{communication}} with Noelle and feels like she wishes to break up, so he breaks up with her first. Later at an intervention for {{an old friend of}} Jerry and Elaine's, Elaine laughs the <b>laugh</b> <b>that</b> Noelle will never forget and it's revealed she's the one that shattered Noelle's confidence during the recital.|$|E
2500|$|After a brief concert career, Fancourt {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, where he starred {{in more than}} 10,000 {{performances}} over a 33-year period until his death. [...] He regularly played about ten different roles for the company over these years, including the Pirate King in The Pirates of Penzance, Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore, and the title character in The Mikado, which he played more than 3,000 times. [...] Fancourt was famous for his melodramatic style, creating the controversial Mikado <b>laugh</b> <b>that</b> was later adopted by some of his successors. [...] His performances are preserved in nineteen of the company's recordings made between 1923 and 1950.|$|E
2500|$|..... {{they had}} come to a point where they had the line, [...] "Your money or your life." [...] And that stopped them... Milt is pacing up and down, trying to get a follow... And he gets a little peeved at Tack, and he says, [...] "For God's sakes, Tack, say something." [...] Tack, maybe he was half asleep—in defense of himself, says, [...] "I'm {{thinking}} it over." [...] And Milt says, [...] "Wait a minute. That's it." [...] And that's the line that went in the script... By the way, that was not the biggest <b>laugh</b> <b>that</b> Jack ever got. It has the reputation of getting the biggest laugh. But that's not true.|$|E

2500|$|One of Neo-Venezia's Three Water Fairies, {{known by}} the title [...] for her {{beautiful}} singing voice. She is Alice's mentor at Orange Planet. She is quiet {{most of the time}} and often appears to be an [...] who does not pay attention to her surroundings (in the anime, she is shown more than once forgetting to duck while rowing under a bridge), but she genuinely cares about Alice. Athena has a strange <b>laugh</b> <b>that</b> comes out sounding as though she is angry. She was a trainee undine with Alicia and Akira, and joined them in joint practice sessions much like Akari, Aika, and Alice do now. At the conclusion of the series, Athena semi-retires from being an undine in order to debut as an opera singer.|$|E
2500|$|Summoned by the Fairy Queen ("Iolanthe! From thy dark exile {{thou art}} summoned"), Iolanthe {{rises from the}} frog-infested stream that has been her home in exile. The Queen, unable to bear {{punishing}} her any longer, pardons Iolanthe, who is warmly greeted by the other fairies. Iolanthe tells her sisters {{that she has a}} son, Strephon, noting that he's a fairy down to the waist, but his legs are mortal. The fairies <b>laugh</b> <b>that</b> Iolanthe appears too young to have a grown son, as {{one of the advantages of}} a fairy's immortality is that they never grow old. Strephon, a handsome Arcadian shepherd, arrives and meets his aunts ("Good-morrow, good mother"). He tells Iolanthe of his love for the Lord Chancellor's ward of court, the beautiful Phyllis, who does not know of Strephon's mixed origin. Strephon is despondent, however, as the Lord Chancellor has forbidden them to marry, partly because he feels that a shepherd is unsuitable for Phyllis, but partly because the Lord Chancellor wishes to marry Phyllis himself. In fact, so do half the members of Britain's House of Lords. The Fairy Queen promises her assistance ("Fare thee well, attractive stranger"). Soon Phyllis arrives, and she and Strephon share a moment of tenderness as they plan their future and possible elopement ("Good-morrow, good lover"; [...] "None shall part us from each other").|$|E
