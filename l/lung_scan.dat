40|$|ABSTRACT: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), a rare form of {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} (PAH), requires histological proof for definitive diagnosis; however, lung biopsy is not recommended in PAH. Recent conjoint European Respiratory Society/European Society of Cardiology guidelines suggest that nonmatched perfusion defects on ventilation/perfusion (V 9 /Q 9) <b>lung</b> <b>scanning</b> in PAH patients may suggest PVOD. The aim of our study was to evaluate V 9 /Q 9 <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> in a large cohort of PVOD and idiopathic or heritable PAH patients. V 9 /Q 9 <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> from 70 patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 56 patients with confirmed or highly probable PVOD were reviewed in a double-blind manner. The vast majority of V 9 /Q 9 <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> were normal or without significant abnormalities in both groups. No differences in ventilation or perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> were observed between PAH and PVOD patients (all p. 0. 05). Furthermore, no differences were observed between confirmed (n 531) or highly probable PVOD (n 525). Nonmatched perfusion defects were found in seven (10 %) idiopathic PAH patients and four (7. 1 %) PVOD patients (p. 0. 05). Nonmatched perfusion defects were rarely seen in a large cohort of idiopathic or heritable PAH and PVOD patients.

Of 89 outpatients and 116 inpatients, 97 % of patients underwent lung scintigraphy. <b>Lung</b> <b>scan</b> results were normal in 51 % of outpatients and 20 % of directly admitted patients; high probability in 10 % and 22 % and non-diagnostic in 39 % and 58 %, respectively. Twenty-two outpatients were subsequently admitted (1 normal, 9 high-probability and 12 non-high-probability lung scans). Pulmonary angiography and tests for deep vein thrombosis were performed in 7 (10 %) and 21 (29 %) of admitted patients with a non-diagnostic <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> outcome, respectively. Of 138 admitted patients, 75 (54 %) received heparin for 5 or more days.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{management of}} pulmonary embolism and {{deep venous thrombosis}} of the legs are similar and requires prolonged anticoagulation therapy. The standard diagnostic approach in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism is ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and compression ultrasonography to detect deep venous thrombosis. This retrospective study analyzed the role of V/Q <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and compression ultrasonography in detection of thromboembolic disease. One hundred-twenty consecutive patients (65 female, 55 male) age range 18 - 95 (Mean age 60. 7) suspected for pulmonary embolism underwent concomitant V/Q <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities.

Of patients with non-diagnostic (Low or intermediate probability) lung scans, 15. 4 % (14 / 91) received anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism.

At admission, blood gas analysis, chest radiography and pulmonary <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> were obtained in each patient; in {{a subset of}} patients pulmonary angiography was also performed to make the definitive diagnosis. Patients were treated with heparin and, later, with oral anticoagulants. Blood gas analysis, chest radiograph and perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> were repeated 7, 30, 180 and 365 days after the diagnosis to evaluate the usefulness of these techniques in the follow-up of PE. Arterial hypoxemia and perfusion impairment recovered in parallel, both in the acute phase after embolism (7 days) and later up to 1 year. The great majority of recovery occurred within the first month after embolization. Radiographic signs compatible with PE tended to decrease early and disappeared almost completely after 30 days. Arterial blood gas analysis and perfusion scintigraphy detected 8 recurrences of PE that would be missed by chest radiograph. Arterial hypoxemia and the enlargement of descending pulmonary artery were positively correlated {{with the number of}} unperfused lung segments and, thus, may help predicting the severity of perfusion impairment in the acute stage. In conclusion, blood gas analysis and chest radiograph may be employed with or without perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> to follow patients with PE up to 1 month after embolization; after that, only blood gas analysis and perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> may give useful information about recovery from or recurrence of PE...|$|E

We studied the clinical utility of incorporating the SimpliRED D-dimer test result and clinical probability in the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism. In a prospective management study 245 consecutive patients, hospitalised as well as outpatients, were included. A SimpliRED D-dimer test and perfusion/(ventilation) scintigraphy were obtained in all patients, whereas clinical probability was determined in the subgroup of patients with a non-diagnostic scan and normal D-dimer result. A diagnostic algorithm determined the necessity for further testing and decisions about treatment. All patients were followed up for 3 months. In 54 patients (22 %) with a normal <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and 50 patients (21 %) with a high probability <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> antithrombotic therapy was withheld or started respectively, irrespective of the D-dimer result. A non-diagnostic <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> was found in 137 (56 %) patients, of whom 70 patients had an abnormal D-dimer test, in whom further testing was ordered. Of the remaining 67 patients with a non-diagnostic <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and normal D-dimer test 8 patients had a high clinical probability, and the subsequent ultrasonography and pulmonary angiography yielded pulmonary emboli in 1 patient.

During follow-up of these patients only one patient experienced a possible venous thromboembolic event (failure rate 1, 5 %; 95 % CI 0 - 8 %). The SimpliRED D-dimer was normal in 6 of 61 patients with proven pulmonary embolism (sensitivity 90 %; 95 % CI 80 - 96 %).

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} a consecutive series of patients with intermediate probability (IP) ventilation/perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> was performed to evaluate: the frequency of documented thromboem-bolic (TE) disease, either pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep-venous thrombosis (DVT), at time of presentation; the prevalence of new diagnoses of TE disease during 6 -mo follow-up; and occurrence of mortality during the same follow-up interval. Methods: Radiologie and clinical records for all patients who had ventilation/perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> reported as IP or indeterminate during a 7 -yr period were reviewed. TE disease at presentation or during follow-up was identified from results of pulmonary angiography, chest CT, lower extremity Doppler ultrasound and venography, and repeat <b>lung</b> <b>scans.</b> Occurrence of mortality and cause of death were determined by medical record review. Results: Of 164 patients studied, 36 (22 %) had TE disease confirmed at initial presentation (PE = 19; DVT only = 17), and four others (2 %) developed evidence of TE disease during follow-up, two with PE and two with DVT. Prevalence of TE disease was significantly greater in patients with matching perfusion/chest radiographie abnormalities and ventilation/perfu sion mismatches (0. 5 - 1. 5 segmental equivalents) than in those with various patterns of matching ventilation/perfusion defects (31 % versus 14 %, p < 0. 01). Twenty-eight patients (18 %) died during follow-up, but recurrent PE was implicated in only one death in a patient with angiographically-confirmed PE at initial presentation.

The neural network was trained using the Hybrid Monte Carlo method, resulting in a committee of 250 neural networks and good results are obtained. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} <b>lung</b> <b>scanning</b> detects defects of pulmonary artery perfusion. False positive results occur because regions of hypoventilation, such as {{are present in}} obstructive airways disease, also cause defects of perfusion. The converse is not true, however, as defects of perfusion continue to be ventilated. Thus in pulmonary embolism ventilation-perfusion discrepancy (normal ventilation and impaired perfusion) occurs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{approach}} to the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is under constant revision with advances in technology, noninvasive approaches, and increasing awareness of the risks of ionizing radiation. Optimal approaches in some categories of patients are controversial. Data are insufficient for evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, this survey of investigators in the field was undertaken. Even among experts there were marked differences of opinion regarding the {{approach to}} the diagnosis of acute PE. Although CT pulmonary angiography was usually the imaging test of choice, the respondents were {{keenly aware of the}} dangers of ionizing radiation. In view of advances in scintigraphic diagnosis since the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) trial, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> or perfusion scans alone and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) V/Q <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> are often recommended. The choice depends on the patient's age, gender, and complexity of the findings on the plain chest radiograph...|$|R
