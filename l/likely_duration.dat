40|$|At {{intervals}} {{as short}} as ten thousand years, each white dwarf (WD) passes within a solar radius of a planetoid, i. e., a comet, asteroid, or planet. Gravitational tidal forces tear the planetoid apart; its metal-rich debris falls onto the WD, enriching the atmosphere. A third of WDs exhibit atmospheric "pollution". For roughly every hundred planetoid disruptions, a planetoid collides with a WD. We simulate {{a small number of}} collisions, in which "death-by-dynamics" refers to the fate of the planetoid. We also compute the energies and <b>likely</b> <b>durations</b> of a broad sample of collision events, and identify detection strategies at optical and X-ray wavelengths. Collisions with the most massive planetoids can be detected in external galaxies. Some may trigger nuclear burning. If one in ∼ 10 ^ 7 - 10 ^ 8 of WD-planetoid collisions creates the conditions needed for a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), "death-by-dynamics" would also refer to the fate of the WD, and could provide a novel channel for the production of SN Ia. We consider the circumstances under which the rate of SNe Ia can be increased by interactions with planetoids. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|Pipe-racks {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{structures}} in oil, gas and petrochemical plants supporting pipes and cables that connect different process units to each other. Since the construction of pipe-racks is amongst the critical activities starting early at site, timely completion of their construction is utmost importance. For this reason, accurate and realistic estimation of pipe-rack construction duration plays a critical role in planning of project construction. Authors in this paper are presenting a developed integrated simulation application that interacts with commercially used drafting software (AutoCAD) to simulate pipe-rack construction. The simulation tool imports the design information from AutoCAD drawing by using Visual Basic of Applications (VBA). The application performs the simulation for construction and erection of the pipe-rack using the imported design information and along with other input data and assumptions. The outputs of the model are <b>likely</b> <b>durations</b> of the pipe-rack construction with their respective probability of occurrence. The results can be drawn in a graph that assists project managers and planners in better estimating of pipe-rack construction duration in an uncertain environment.

As agents observe more and more deviations, they become increasingly pessimistic about a prompt return to the Virtuous regime and ination starts drifting in response to a 8 ̆ 5 scal imbalance.

When ranked by diminishing size, the largest and most devastating volcanic eruptions in terms of volume, or consequent fatalities, can be described by power-law functions. In turn, this approach permits projection of, for example, (1) the likely size of the next volcanic eruption larger than the A. D. 1815 eruption of Tambora (∼ 90 km 3 of magma); (2) the size of the next eruption of the Taupo volcano, New Zealand, that is larger than the eruption of A.

This pattern of repulsion following adaptation {{is similar to that}} observed for other visual properties, such as orientation, and is considered evidence for the involvement of duration-selective mechanisms in duration encoding. Here, we investigated whether the encoding of duration - by duration-selective mechanisms - occurs early on in the visual processing hierarchy. To this end, we investigated the spatial specificity of {{the duration}} after-effect in two experiments. We measured the duration after-effect at adapter-test distances ranging between 0 and 15 ° of visual angle and for within- and between- hemifield presentations. We replicated the duration after-effect: the test stimulus was perceived to have a longer duration following adaptation to a shorter duration, and a shorter duration following adaptation to a longer duration. Importantly, this duration after-effect occurred at all measured distances, with no evidence for a decrease in the magnitude of the after-effect at larger distances or across hemifields. This shows that adaptation to duration does not result from adaptation occurring early on in the visual processing hierarchy. Instead, it seems <b>likely</b> that <b>duration</b> information is a high-level stimulus property that is encoded later on in the visual processing hierarchy...|$|R

40|$|Summary The work aims to {{estimate}} the <b>likely</b> <b>duration</b> of monitoring which {{will be required to}} allow reasonably accurate field measurement of the fabric heat loss and effective solar aperture of low-energy and passive solar houses, using the co-heating method. Everett et al have shown that field measurement using this technique requires measurement of the auxiliary energy consumption of the house over a period {{with a wide range of}} daily mean insolation. The duration of monitoring necessary to meet this type of criterion has been calculated for monitoring periods starting at various times of the year, using between 6 and 18 years of radiation data for seven UK sites. The results of this project confirm and extend Everett’s original results. They show for example that ’rapid thermal calibration projects’, which aim to provide reliable characterisation of house performance from a few weeks of intensive monitoring, should ideally be scheduled to start in late winter or in late summer and autumn. These conclusions are not strongly dependent on the precise insolation criteria or on geographic location. 1 Thermal calibration of houses The co-heating method involves using a responsive heatin...|$|E
40|$|A {{key problem}} in the {{efficient}} use of higher (Ka- and V-band) frequencies lies in the mitigation of propagation impairments caused by meteorological phenomena. The traditional approach to this problem is based upon a relatively simplistic statistical model {{in the form of}} a fade margin. At higher frequencies this traditional approach becomes inefficient due to the large margin required. This inefficiency has lead to the introduction of dynamic fade mitigation techniques (FMTs). We present a method of generating attenuation time series that can be used for the development and evaluation of FMTs. The method we propose is based on the use of proven numerical weather prediction models in conjunction with a propagation model. This approach has two unique aspects. First, the spatial correlation and dynamic behavior of the attenuation fields are inherited from the meteorological environment. Second, the model can provide forecasts of attenuation. It is foreseen that this a priori knowledge of the occurrence of fades, their likely depth and <b>likely</b> <b>duration</b> can be exploited to manage the resource control of entire networks. This paper presents a description of the method and demonstrates the ability to generate attenuation time series.

This sting injects significant quantities of gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and complementary agonists taurine and beta-alanine.

Individually, all of these substances induce short-term paralysis of the cockroach. When they are injected together in a ratio of 1:0.7:0.4, the effect was longer lasting. GABA activates ligand-gated chloride channels by binding to GABA receptors.

Louder signals create a greater 'push' on the Basilar membrane and thus stimulate more nerves, creating a stronger loudness signal. A more complex signal also creates more nerve firings and so sounds louder (for the same wave amplitude) than a simpler sound, such as a sine wave.|$|R
