[...] Like any magnet, the amount of this torque is proportional both to the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. [...] Since the neutron has spin angular momentum, this torque will cause the neutron to precess with a well-defined frequency, called the <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequency.</b> It is this phenomenon that enables the measurement of nuclear properties through nuclear magnetic resonance.

2500|$|A {{magnetic}} resonance imaging instrument (MRI scanner), or [...] "nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) imaging" [...] scanner as it was originally known, uses powerful magnets to polarize and excite hydrogen nuclei (i.e., single protons) of water molecules in human tissue, producing a detectable signal which is spatially encoded, resulting in images of the body. The MRI machine emits a radio frequency (RF) pulse at the resonant frequency of the hydrogen atoms on water molecules. Radio frequency antennas ("RF coils") send the pulse {{to the area of}} the body to be examined. The RF pulse is absorbed by protons, causing their direction with respect to the primary magnetic field to change. When the RF pulse is turned off, the protons [...] "relax" [...] back to alignment with the primary magnet and emit radio-waves in the process. This radio-frequency emission from the hydrogen-atoms on water is what is detected and reconstructed into an image. The resonant frequency of a spinning magnetic dipole (of which protons are one example) is called the <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequency</b> and is determined by the strength of the main magnetic field and the chemical environment of the nuclei of interest. MRI uses three electromagnetic fields: a very strong (typically 1.5 to 3 teslas) static magnetic field to polarize the hydrogen nuclei, called the primary field; gradient fields that can be modified to vary in space and time (on the order of 1kHz) for spatial encoding, often simply called gradients; and a spatially homogeneous radio-frequency (RF) field for manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei to produce measurable signals, collected through an RF antenna.|$|E

A tridiagonal matrix representation of the XY Hamiltonian with nearest neighbor interactions relevant to the quantum state transfer is exactly diagonalized for a combination of the above two methods.

5000|$|The cross effect {{requires}} two unpaired electrons as {{the source}} of high polarization. Without special condition, such a three spins system can only generate a solid effect type of polarization. However, when the resonance frequency of each electron is separated by the nuclear <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequency,</b> and when the two electrons are dipolar coupled, an other mechanism occurs: the cross-effect. In that case, the DNP process is the result of irradiation of an allowed transition (called single quantum) as a result the strength of microwave irradiation is less demanded than that in the solid effect. In practice, the correct EPR frequency separation is accomplished through random orientation of paramagnetic species with g-anisotropy. Since the [...] "frequency" [...] distance between the two electrons should be equal to the <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequency</b> of the targeted nucleus, Cross-Effect can only occur if the inhomogeneously broadened EPR lineshape has a linewidth broader than the nuclear <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequency.</b> Therefore, as this linewidth is proportional to external magnetic field B0, the overall DNP efficiency (or the enhancement of nuclear polarization) scales as B0−1. This remains true as long as the relaxation times remain constant. Usually going to higher field leads to longer nuclear relaxation times and this may partially compensate for the line broadening reduction.In practice, in a glassy sample, the probability of having two dipolarly coupled electrons separated by the <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequency</b> is very scarce. Nonetheless this mechanism is so efficient that it can be experimentally observed alone or in addition to the Solid-Effect.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Knowledge of {{dielectric}} properties of malignant human tissues {{is necessary for}} the recently developed magnetic resonance (MR) technique called MR electrical property tomography. This technique may be used in early tumor detection based on the obvious differentiation of the {{dielectric properties}} between normal and malignant tissues. However, the dielectric properties of malignant human tissues in the scale of the <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequencies</b> are not completely available in the literature. In this study, the authors focused only on the dielectric properties of colorectal tumor tissue. Methods: The dielectric properties of 504 colorectal malignant samples excised from 85 patients in the scale of the <b>Larmor</b> <b>frequencies</b> were measured using the precision open-ended coaxial probe method. The obtained complex-permittivity data were fitted to the single-pole ColeCole model.

Significant differences between normal and malignant tissues were found for the dielectric properties (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Experimental results indicated that the dielectric properties were significantly different between normal and malignant tissues for colorectal tissue.
