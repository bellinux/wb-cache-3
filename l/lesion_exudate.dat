For early diagnosis, molecular biomarkers contained in samples collected non-invasively and directly from at-risk oral premalignant lesions (OPMLs) would be ideal. Methods In this pilot study we evaluated {{the potential of}} a novel method using commercial PerioPaper absorbent strips for non-invasive collection of oral <b>lesion</b> <b>exudate</b> material coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics for oral cancer biomarker discovery. Results Our evaluation focused on three core issues. First, using an "on-strip" processing method, we found that protein can be isolated from exudate samples in amounts compatible with large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Second, {{we found that the}} OPML exudate proteome was distinct from that of whole saliva, while being similar to the OPML epithelial cell proteome, demonstrating the fidelity of our exudate collection method. Third, in a proof-of-principle study, we identified numerous, inflammation-associated proteins showing an expected increase in abundance in OPML exudates compared to healthy oral tissue exudates. These results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying differentially abundant proteins from exudate samples, which is essential for biomarker discovery studies. Conclusions Collectively, our findings demonstrate that our exudate collection method coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics has great potential for transforming OSCC biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostics assay development. </p...|$|E

Advisor: Timothy Griffin. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 94 p. + 3 supplementary spreadsheet files. Oral {{cancer is the}} sixth most common cancer worldwide ahead of Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, brain, stomach, or ovarian cancers, with about 41, 000 Americans being diagnosed annually. More than 90 % of oral cancers are oral Squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). While the overall 5 -year survival rate is about 60 %, the survival rate when diagnosed early is higher than 80 %. Currently the standard for diagnosis of OSCC is early visual detection of a suspicious oral lesion followed by scalpel biopsy with histology. However, the invasiveness, expense, and required expertise involved prevents consistent application on at risk individuals. Chapter 1 discusses the methods that are being investigated for sampling and discovering biomarkers of OSCC that address some of these limitations. Protein biomarkers contained in samples collected non-invasively and directly from at-risk oral premalignant lesions (OPML) would address current needs in a uniquely targeted fashion. Chapter 2 of this thesis describes work evaluating the potential of a novel method using commercial PerioPaper absorbent strips for the collection of oral <b>lesion</b> <b>exudate</b> fluid coupled with mass spectrometry based proteomics for OSCC biomarker discovery. This research focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of using oral lesion exudates in proteomic research, exploring the proteome of exudate samples, discriminating between exudates collected from clinically different sources, with supplemental table 1 showing which proteins distinguish healthy and OPML sources. Furthermore, {{to ensure that the}} best possible marker candidates are selected given clinical sample availability, multiple methods were explored enable and improve quantitative proteomic analysis of exudates in chapter 3 (Identified proteins in supplemental files 2 and 3). Our label-free quantitative proteomics strategy analyzed paired control and OPML exudates (figure 8), identifying differentially abundant proteins between sample types. Next, we selected several [exudate] differentially abundant proteins for testing in while saliva, comparing their relative abundance levels in healthy, OPML and oral Squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) subjects. Two proteins, CK 10 and A 1 AT, showed differences in saliva. Our results provide a demonstration of the value of tissue exudate analysis for guiding salivary biomarker discovery in oral cancer, as well as providing promising biomarker candidates for future evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Automated {{quantification}} {{of blood}} vessels in human retina is the fundamental step in designing any computer-aided diagnosis system for ophthalmic disorders. Detection and analysis of variations in blood vessels {{can be used to}} diagnose several ocular diseases like diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic Retinopathy is a progressive vascular disorder caused due to variations in blood vessels of retina. These variations bring different abnormalities like <b>lesions,</b> <b>exudates,</b> and hemorrhages in human retina which make the vessel detection problematic. Therefore, automated retinal analysis is required to cater the effect of lesions while segmenting blood vessels. The proposed framework presents two improved approaches to carry out vessel segmentation in the presence of lesions. The paper mainly aims to extract true vessels by reducing the effect of abnormal structures significantly. First method is a supervised approach which extracts true vessels by performing region based analysis of retinal image, while second method intends to remove lesions before extracting blood vessels by using an inpainting technique.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of early syphilis currently requires dark-field microscopic or serologic demonstration of Treponema pallidum infection. Dark-field microscopy is not widely available and {{is complicated by}} the numerous saprophytic spirochetes which are present at oral and rectal mucosal surfaces. Serologic tests are positive in only 70 to 90 % of patients with primary syphilis, and several days may be required for results to become available. We used a pathogen-specific, fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody to examine <b>lesion</b> <b>exudates</b> from 61 patients for the presence of T. pallidum and compared the data with results of dark-field microscopy and serologic testing. The direct fluorescent-antibody technique revealed the presence of T. pallidum in 30 of 30 patients with early syphilis, and dark-field microscopy was positive for 29. Serologic tests were reactive for 27 of 30 patients with syphilis; in the 3 patients with nonreactive serologic tests, chancres had been present for 4, 6, and 21 days. Although 7 of 31 patients without syphilis had spiral organisms seen on dark-field microscopy, the direct fluorescent-antibody test was negative for all 31. The presence of nonpathogenic spirochetes was subsequently verified in 5 of 7 patients by using a second monoclonal antibody which reacts with nonpathogenic, as well as pathogenic, treponemes and related spirochetes. The demonstration of T. pallidum by using fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies is intrinsically specific and is as sensitive as dark-field microscopy for the {{diagnosis of}} early syphilis.

40|$|Pythiosis, {{caused by}} Pythium insidiosum, occurs in {{humans and animals}} and is {{acquired}} from aquatic environments that harbor the emerging pathogen. Diagnosis is difficult because clinical and histopathologic features are not pathognomonic. We report the first human case of pythiosis from Brazil, diagnosed by using culture and rDNA sequencing. Pythiosis is a cutaneous-subcutaneous disease of human and animals that occurs primarily in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It {{is caused by the}} aquatic funguslike organism Pythium insidiosum (kingdom Straminipila, phylum Oomycota, class Oomycetes) (1). Although pythiosis is not caused by a true fungus, the pathogen has some morphologic characteristics in common with fungal members of the order Zygomycetes, mainly in histopathologic sections. This disease is a common cutaneous and intestinal disorder in horses, cattle, dogs, and cats (2, 3). Human pythiosis may appear in a cutaneous-subcutaneous form with lesions on the limbs, periorbital and facial areas, and corneal ulcers. Pythiosis can also be a systemic disease involving the vascular system, which usually causes arterial occlusion. The systemic form has been documented in numerous patients, most from Thailand, with thalassemia. The remaining cases have been from Australia (2 patients), United States (2 patients), and 1 each from Haiti, Malaysia, and New Zealand (4, 5).

All monoclonal antibodies assayed were capable of detecting ca. 1. 0 X 10 (3) to 2. 5 X 10 (3) treponemes. Of 13 monoclonal antibodies examined, 3 were able to detect 10 (3) virulent treponemes, and 1 of these antibodies was able to reveal the presence of as few as 500 organisms. Western blot analyses showed that all anti-T. pallidum monoclonal antibodies exhibiting high sensitivities for the detection of T. pallidum cells were directed against an abundant, 47, 000 -dalton surface-exposed antigen of the organism (S. A. Jones, K. S. Marchitto, J. N. Miller, and M. V. Norgard, Abstr. Annu. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1984, B 173, p. 46; K. S. Marchitto, S. A. Jones, and M. V. Norgard, Abstr. Annu. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1984, B 182, p. 48). Differences in binding properties of the various monoclonal antibodies were most likely a reflection of differential binding affinities or their specificities for different epitopes on the 47, 000 -dalton surface antigen. With two possible exceptions, the monoclonal antibodies tested reacted specifically with T. pallidum, either purified or found within a high-contaminating tissue background, and not with Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter, Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex virus type 2, or normal rabbit testicular tissue.

30|$|The {{proposed}} system implements {{a combination}} of fuzzy techniques for the image preprocessing part, such as fuzzy filtering and fuzzy histogram equalisation. In addition, the proposed system implements the localisation and the detection of four retinal structures, which are the optic disc, the blood vessels, the macula and the fovea, which are important {{in the identification of}} the maculopathy. Furthermore, the system detects the diabetic retinopathy <b>lesions,</b> the <b>exudates,</b> which are vital in order to detect the exudative maculopathy. Several features extracted from the <b>exudates</b> <b>lesions</b> and the maculopathy are used for the classification. The system is evaluated with the combination of normal and diabetic retinopathy images, including the maculopathy fundus images from a novel dataset developed as mentioned above in the Sect.  3.2. The proposed system builds on the systems proposed in [7] and [8]. The previous system in [7] implements the use of fuzzy techniques for the image processing stage, including the fuzzy histogram equalisation, fuzzy median filter and fuzzy edge detection, for the purpose of one of the important lesion detection in diabetic retinopathy screening—microaneurysms. However, the fuzzy techniques are implemented individually in different variants of the system. On the other hand, the system in [8] proposed the implementation of the combination of several fuzzy image preprocessing techniques for the detection of the maculopathy without the retinal structures localisation. Three features, which are the area of on pixels, the mean and the standard deviation of the white pixels area, are extracted from the output image for the classification stage, which classifies into two main categories with the aid of several machine learning classifiers. Due to the promising results of both systems reported in [7] and [8], especially on the fuzzy techniques ability, we continued our developments with the proposed system to investigate the capability of the combination of the fuzzy image processing techniques, together with retinal structures detection approach and by using more extracted features, in order to produce a more reliable system for the detection of diabetic maculopathy.|$|R

DR is mainly characterized by small red spots, namely microaneurysms and bright <b>lesions,</b> specifically <b>exudates.</b> However, ARMD is mainly identified by tiny yellow or white deposits called drusen. Since exudates {{might be the only}} visible signs of the early diabetic retinopathy, there is an increase demand for automatic diagnosis of retinopathy. Exudates and drusen may share similar appearances; as a result discriminating between them {{plays a key role in}} improving screening performance. In this research, we investigative the role of bag of words approach in the automatic diagnosis of retinopathy diabetes. Initially, the color retinal images are preprocessed in order to reduce the intra and inter patient variability. Subsequently, SURF (Speeded up Robust Features), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and LBP (Local Binary Patterns) descriptors are extracted. We proposed to use single-based and multiple-based methods to construct the visual dictionary by combining the histogram of word occurrences from each dictionary and building a single histogram. Finally, this histogram representation is fed into a support vector machine with linear kernel for classification. The introduced approach is evaluated for automatic diagnosis of normal and abnormal color retinal images with bright lesions such as drusen and exudates. This approach has been implemented on 430 color retinal images, including six publicly available datasets, in addition to one local dataset. The mean accuracies achieved are 97. 2 % and 99. 77 % for single-based and multiple-based dictionaries respectively...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advances}} in the computer field, methods and techniques in automatic image processing and analysis provide the opportunity to detect automatically the change and degeneration in retinal images. Localization of the optic disc is extremely important for determining the hard <b>exudate</b> <b>lesions</b> or neovascularization, which is the later phase of diabetic retinopathy, in computer aided eye disease diagnosis systems. Whereas optic disc detection is fairly an easy process in normal retinal images, detecting this region in the retinal image which is diabetic retinopathy disease may be difficult. Sometimes information related to optic disc and hard exudate information may be the same in terms of machine learning. We presented a novel approach for efficient and accurate localization of optic disc in retinal images having noise and other lesions. This approach is comprised of five main steps which are image processing, keypoint extraction, texture analysis, visual dictionary, and classifier techniques. We tested our proposed technique on 3 public datasets and obtained quantitative results. Experimental results show that an average optic disc detection accuracy of 94. 38 %, 95. 00 %, and 90. 00 % is achieved, respectively, on the following public datasets: DIARETDB 1, DRIVE, and ROC...|$|R
40|$|With the aim {{to study}} the histologic lesions caused by Psoroptes cuniculi, the ears of 15 adult goats were {{collected}} in a slaughter house {{in the city of}} Patos, state of Paraíba, in the Brazilian semiarid region. Five goats had crusts and exudates in the external ears and were infested by 21 to 189 mites in each ear. Another 10 goats were asymptomatic, five of which had 14 to 39 mites and five of which were non-infested. From the five goats with clinical signs, three presented moderate macroscopic lesions with cerumen and dry crusts in both ears, affecting the pinna and ear canal. Two other goats presented mild <b>lesions,</b> characterized by <b>exudates</b> in the pinna without crust formation. The histologic lesions included varying degrees of parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, hypergranulosis, spongiosis, and dermatitis, with rare eosinophils. P. cuniculi were observed in the ear canal, occasionally in contact with the stratum corneum, but without causing traumatic lesions in the epithelium, which suggests that the lesions occur through a mechanical effect due to the presence of the mites together with the exudates, cerumen, and keratin residues. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Retinal hemangioblastomas are {{the most}} common manifestation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease [1 - 3]. While {{peripheral}} retinal hemangioblastomas may be treated by thermal laser treatment or cryotherapy, optic nerve and macular lesions are more difficult to treat [4, 5]. Based on the theoretical benefit of administering anti-VEGF treatment, intra-vitreally administered bevacizumab (Avastin, a general pan-VEGF inhibitor) is attractive [6, 7]. Several short-term case series using ranibizumab (Lucentis, mAb fragment of bevacizumab with stronger affinity for VEGF-A) have shown it has promising but minimal success on most VHL-related hemangioblastomas [8, 9]. A comprehensive study by Wong et al. examined 5 patients over a period up to 61 weeks (47 ± 14 weeks) while Michels et al. examined one patient over a period of 4 months. Due to the short-term nature of these studies, we attempted long-term bevacizumab treatment over 60 months in a monocular subject with progressive visual loss due to a VHL associated macular and optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Over the treatment regimen of 15 injections, visual acuity improved 25 letters, OCT thickness improved from 646 um to 424 um, and structural <b>lesions</b> stabilized while <b>exudates</b> and edema resolved...|$|R

Bacteriol. 83 : 871 – 878. 1962. —Respiratory {{exposure}} to arthrospores from the submerged growth of Coccidioides immitis, strain Cash, in liquid medium resulted in similar pathogenesis in monkeys {{to that of}} strain Silveira arthrospores harvested from solid medium. Infectivity of 100 % was noted with doses of 50 to 10, 000 arthrospores. The disease was characterized by loss of appetite and weight, malaise, and extreme respiratory distress accompanied by coughing, with the immediate cause of death being acute coccidioidal pneumonia. The pathological picture was one of extensive, progressive, destructive pulmonary disease in the higher dose levels and few, small, self-contained, fibrous lesions, with little destruction of lung tissue, in the low doses. This was correlated in general {{with the findings of}} serial X rays and serological tests. The presence of the parasitic phase (spherule and endospore) of the organism was noted in large numbers within the pulmonary <b>lesions</b> and bronchial <b>exudates</b> and was substantiated by cultural methods. Occasionally, hyphal elements of the saprophytic growth phase were noted around the periphery of residual cavitated areas of the lungs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{the most}} frequent microvascular complication of diabetes {{and can lead to}} several retinal abnormalities including microaneurysms, exudates, dot and blot hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots. Automated early detection of these abnormalities could limit the severity of the disease and assist ophthalmologists in investigating and treating the disease more efficiently. Segmentation of retinal image features provides the basis for automated assessment. In this study, <b>exudates</b> <b>lesion</b> on retinopathy retinal images was segmented by different image processing techniques. The objective of this study is detection of the exudates regions on retinal images of retinopathy patients by different image processing techniques. Methods: A total of 30 color images from retinopathy patients were selected for this study. The images were taken by Topcon TRC- 50 IX mydriatic camera and saves with TIFF format with a resolution of 500 × 752 pixels. The morphological function was applied on intensity components of hue saturation intensity (HSI) space. To detect the exudates regions, thresholding was performed on all images and the exudates region was segmented. To optimize the detection efficiency, the binary morphological functions were applied. Finally, the exudates regions were quantified and evaluated for further statistical purposes. Results: The average of sensitivity of 76 %, specificity of 98 %, and accuracy of 97 % was obtained. Conclusion: The results showed that our approach can identify the exudate regions in retinopathy images...|$|R
