40|$|Aim of this Master´s {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} and compare most common <b>types</b> of optical <b>amplifiers</b> used in today’s networks. The first section focuses on problematic of optical transmissions and phenomenon which cause degradation of transmitted signal. It is also explained in this section why {{there is a need}} to deploy optical amplifiers. Next section describes basic principles, structure and properties of individual <b>types</b> of optical <b>amplifiers.</b> Following section describes simulations which were made to compare the performance of transmission systems with each individual <b>type</b> of optical <b>amplifier.</b> The last section contains a design of optical metropolitan network with wavelength multiplex. Based on simulations from preceding part best <b>amplifier</b> <b>type</b> and optimal <b>amplifier</b> placement was selected.

5000|$|For amplifiers, PS audio {{offered the}} HCA-2 [...] "digital" [...] amplifier. This was a {{switching}} amplifier (many would {{call this a}} Class D Amplifier) that provide about 150 watts per channel. A more conventional amplifier, the Classic 250, provided 250 Watts per channel. These amplifiers were discontinued and the follow-on amplifiers were all [...] "digital" [...] <b>type</b> <b>amplifiers</b> from the GCA line, which had flexibility {{in the number of}} channels or number of watts per channel desired.|$|R

25|$|Electronic {{amplifiers}} use {{current or}} voltage as input and output, so four <b>types</b> of <b>amplifier</b> are possible (any of two possible inputs {{with any of}} two possible outputs). See classification of amplifiers. The objective for the feedback amplifier may be {{any one of the}} four <b>types</b> of <b>amplifier</b> and is not necessarily the same type as the open-loop amplifier, which itself may be any one of these types. So, for example, an op amp (voltage amplifier) can be arranged to make a current amplifier instead.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Whatever their {{original}} motivation, Ada's <b>limited</b> <b>types</b> have been extensively {{used to protect}} the integrity of various resources, e. g., the processor resources of tasks, the secondary storage resources of files, the storage resources of heap-allocated lists, the resources protected by "passwords" or unique "handles", the monetary resources of financial accounts. In other words, designers of private types {{are drawn to the}} use of a <b>limited</b> <b>type</b> when the a resource has a unique integrity that would be violated if the object were copied through the use of an assignment operation. The lack of the assignment operation for a <b>limited</b> <b>type</b> allows the designer of the type to completely control any copying operations, and therefore preserve the uniqueness of the protected resource's "object identity". Unfortunately, while the designer of a <b>limited</b> <b>type</b> can deny...|$|R
40|$|Active {{integrated}} antennas {{receive a}} great deal of attention because they can reduce the size, weight, cost of the transceiver system and minimizes the connection losses. Due to the mature technology of microwave integrated circuit (MIC) and monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), the active integrated antennas become an area of growing interest in recent years. Active integrated antennas have many potential applications in wireless communications such as low cost and compact transceivers, detectors and sensors. Various antennas have been integrated into active devices that can be classified into oscillator <b>type,</b> <b>amplifier</b> <b>type</b> and frequency conversion type. In this chapter, the author discusses different type of configuration for active log periodic antenna. The amplifier is incorporated with the antenna at the inset feed, the centre of log periodic antenna and each individual antenna...|$|R

The circuit is analyzed by using the equivalent circuit method, in which the characteristics of magnetic cores and of rectifiers are represented by an appropriate approximation. The relation between the gate circuit resistance of the first stage magnetic amplifier and the coupling resistance is verified by the analysis. 　As a result, {{it can be said}} that the fluctuation of the load current of SCR amplifier is only 0. 5 % for a supply voltage variation of ± 20 % by the experiments...|$|R

2500|$|Another way to {{classify}} amplifiers {{is by the}} phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. [...] An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or {{mirror image of the}} input as seen on an oscilloscope). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An emitter follower is a <b>type</b> of non-inverting <b>amplifier,</b> indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. Voltage follower is also non inverting <b>type</b> of <b>amplifier</b> having unity gain.|$|R
