In 1720, Frederick IV ordered the {{rebuilding}} of Odense Palace, partly on {{the foundations of the}} 13th century St. Hans’s Monastery, and the construction of St Hans’s Church by the Knights Hospitallers. An 8 kilometre (5.0mi) long, 7.5 metre (25ft) deep canal from Odense Harbour to Odense Fjord was built between 1796 and 1806 to facilitate the growth of Odense as a port city, radically increasing its <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and population. Founded in 1796, Odense Teater is the first provincial theatre in Denmark and the country's second oldest. Odense Central Library was established in 1924 and removed to Odense station in 1995. The Odense Music Library contains Denmark's largest collection of phonograms.|$|E

25|$|The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> and the relationship, Zhongshan {{had with}} other states can be roughly ascertained from {{the amount of}} a {{currency}} {{was found in the}} ruins of Lingshou: the yan knife coins from Yan were plentiful, with some 374 being found, whereas the gandan, baihua, and lin coins of Zhao are rare, with only 100 of them, combined, found. This reflects the hostile relations Zhao had with Zhongshan, and the good relations Yan had with Zhongshan. Indeed, even the similarities of the yan and chengbo knife coins seems to suggest their friendly relationship, as they were of similar size and of equal weight, with both weighing fifteen grams, meaning that they would be interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} the 1600s, all of these areas have been {{connected}} politically, reaching a height in 1801 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. About five-sixths of the island of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom in 1921 as the Irish Free State. Historically, relations between the two states have been influenced heavily by issues arising from their shared (and frequently troubled) history, the independence of the Irish Free State and the governance of Northern Ireland. These include the partition of Ireland and the terms of Ireland's secession, its constitutional relationship with and obligations to the UK after independence, and the outbreak of political violence in Northern Ireland. Additionally, the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> between the two states, their proximate geographic location, their common status as islands in the European Union, common language and close cultural and personal links mean political developments in both states often closely follow each other.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the times}} {{covered by the}} Chronicles of Narnia, Calormen and Narnia {{maintain}} an uneasy, albeit generally peaceable, coexistence. The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle contain plot lines that focus on Calormen, {{while some of the}} other books have peripheral references. In The Horse and His Boy the main characters (one a young member of the Calormene nobility) escape from Calormen to Archenland and Narnia whilst the Calormene cavalry under Prince Rabadash attempts to invade Narnia and capture the Narnian Queen Susan for his bride. The rather small (200 horse) Calormene invasion force is rebuffed at the gates of the Kingdom of Archenland. In The Last Battle, there is a reference to King Erlian having fought a war with the Calormenes. King Tirian is - until the events narrated in the book - at peace with them, and some <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and travel exist between Narnia and Calormen. The Narnian King does but maintain a supply of Calormene armour and weapons for the purpose of conducting undercover operations in their country - suggesting a kind of cold war.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse how trade {{liberalisation}} affects location decisions of firms in vertically linked industries with different factor intensities. Firms can choose to locate either in a low wage, labour abundant, country or a low rental, capital abundant, country. We derive a number of results. At high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> costs upstream and downstream firms locate in both countries. At low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> costs location is according to comparative cost, with labour intensive firms locating in the low wage country and capital intensive firms in the low rental country. For some intermediate <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> costs there may be an agglomeration of upstream and downstream firms in one country. Whether the industries agglomerate in the low wage or the low rental country is likely to depend on the relative differences in factor prices.

Unskilled labour mobility increases the agglomeration incentive of skilled labour and influences the pattern of agglomeration. At high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> costs, skilled and unskilled labour migration reinforce each other leading to agglomeration of both types of labour in the same region. For lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> costs, unskilled labour remigrates, whereas skilled labour remains concentrated. Copyright (c) 2010 the author(s).

2500|$|Trade {{unionism}} in the United Kingdom was a {{major factor}} in some of the economic crises during the 1960's and the 1970's, culminating in the [...] "Winter of Discontent" [...] of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike. By this stage, some 12,000,000 workers in the United Kingdom were trade union members. However, the election of the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher at the general election in May 1979, at the expense of Labour's James Callaghan, saw substantial trade union reform which saw the level of strikes fall. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> union membership also fell sharply in the 1980's, and continued falling for most of the 1990's. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strong– e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docks– was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.|$|E
2500|$|Relations between Canada and the United States of America {{historically}} have been extensive, given a shared border and ever-increasing close cultural, economical ties and similarities.

The British ceased aiding First Nation attacks on American territory, and the United States never again attempted to invade Canada. [...] Apart from minor raids, it has remained peaceful.|$|E

He said that his taste made him take exercise; that he walked from the City to West Kensington every day, to beat the covers of the book-stalls, while other men {{travelled}} in the expensive cab or the unwholesome Metropolitan Railway. We are all apt to hold favourable views of our own amusements, and, for my own part, I believe that trout and salmon are incapable of feeling pain. But the flimsiness of Blinton's theories must be apparent to every unbiassed moralist.

40|$|Promoting {{trade is}} a key aspect of Jordan’s {{development}} policy. As a developing country, increasing exports and maintaining a healthy balance <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> with its trading partners are amongst the government’s most important goals. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with the United States in 2000 is a cornerstone of Jordan’s foreign economic policy and a key test case for its broader policy <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> liberalisation. Yet while {{there is some evidence}} for a positive relationship between trade liberalisation, and increased bilateral trade and economic growth, this approach to development is also criticised for opening up developing markets to competition from their more advanced counterparts. This investigation argues that FTAs do facilitate bilateral trade but that states with large and advanced economies benefit more than small developing states and markets.

Yoon claim, {{contrary}} to liberal theory and extensive evidencefrom pooled time-series analyses, that neither joint democracy noreconomic interdependence significantly reduces the frequency ofmilitarized interstate disputes when dyadic fixed effects are taken intoaccount. Similarly, their fixed-effects analyses contradict theory andprevious evidence that democracies have higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> with oneanother than do other types of states. Our reexamination, however,refutes both claims and reinforces previous findings. Theirxed-effects analysis of disputes produces distorted results because theyconsider {{a relatively short period}} of time, 1951 92, in which variationis limited in the binary dependent variable and in the key independentvariables.
