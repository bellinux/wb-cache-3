40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test the {{bactericidal}} effect of virkon on native species of bacteria seen in Iran by selecting a suitable concentration of virkon which would effectively reduce the level of environmental bacterial contamination including contamination of platelets components while following the exact instruction of the use of the disinfectant. Methods: This was an interferal -applied study. 160 samples were taken from <b>laboratory</b> <b>benches,</b> instruments and outer surface of blood component bags. The growing organisms were identified by using the McFarland constant standard protocols and the CFU/ml of bacteria was determined. Later all the <b>laboratory</b> <b>benches</b> and instruments involved in the preparation of platelet components were disinfected using (1 %) virkon solution. 101 samples were taken from disinfected areas and swabs were plated on to standard bacteriological media and plates were read. In addition, 1100 segments from platelet bags were separated and the platelet contents were plated and any bacterial growths were assessed using quality control department guidelines. Results: Out of 169 samples which were plated before disinfection by virkon following organisms were separated 56 / 8 % gram positive b. (spore forming and without spores) 96 samples, 59 / 8 % gram positive cocci (staph. &strept.) 101 samples, 94 / 8 % gram negative b. 159 samples, 82 / 2 % gram negative cocci 139 samples. Post disinfection by virkon solution, out of 101 samples following organisms was separated: 24 / 8 % gram positive b. 25 samples, 16 / 8 % gram positive cocci 17 samples, 0 % gram negative b. 5 / 9 % gram negativ 6 samples, out of 1100 segment separated from platelets bags 4 samples (segments) had bacterial growth (0036 %) 2 samples had gram positive b. growth and 2 samples had staph. Conclusion: By using correct concentration of virkon solution and following the exact manufactures instruction for use we were able to observe log reduction in bacterial contamination of the areas that blood components were made hence strong bactericidal action of specific concentration of virkon solution (1 %) was present...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} {{way to improve}} the satellite is to create more precise, easy, reliable and durable satellite attitude determination and control systems (ADCS). This is provided by a sustained progress, currently, observed {{in the area of}} the sensors and executive bodies. Thus, improving the reliability and quality of the newly created satellite ADCS, requires repeated debugging and testing work. To provide this work it is necessary to create <b>laboratory</b> <b>benches</b> and complexes using HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) simulation methods. The basic principle of such <b>laboratory</b> <b>benches</b> and systems is to simulate the input action on ADCS sensor in accordance with the calculated values, similar to the angular motion of the satellite. Thus, an efficiency of using such stands and complexes, while testing the satellite ADCS, depends directly on the environmental fidelity of its functioning, which, in turn, requires high fidelity of environment action on the ADCS sensing elements in accordance with the calculated values, similar to the angular motion of the real satellite. To date, to conduct ground tests of the satellite ADCS there is a complex modeling stand in JSC "ISS". It comprises a variety of test equipment, including a stand to simulate the angular motion of the satellite, i. e. a three-axis simulator of motion, built on the three-gimbal suspension with integrating rotary drives. The article consists of two sections. The first section presents in detail the requirements for control of a three-axis motion simulator to carry out dynamic tests of the satellite ADCS on the complex modeling stand. The second one gives quite detailed description of the synthesis strategy of a positional control of the tri-axial motion simulator based on the system invariance as related to the reference variable. The article shows main advantages of the proposed algorithm of control. In conclusion, the article shows that, when using a control algorithm of developed tri-axial motion simulator based on the invariance, the total error of the simulating limit performance of the satellite ADCS reference variable does not exceed the requirements-specified error. The feature of the given algorithm is that it is easy implemented, as well as is capable to vary the control parameters both gain and discreteness on time, without disturbing the invariance conditions. </p...|$|R
