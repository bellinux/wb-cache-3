I {{call these}} <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> because, though {{the bulk of}} the mass may be {{continually}} increasing or diminishing, the line of the profile does not change, being fixed at a certain angle {{by the nature of the}} earth. It is usually stated carelessly as an angle of about 45 degrees, but it never really reaches such a slope. I measured carefully the angles of a very large number of slopes of mountain in various parts of the Mont Blanc district. The few examples given in the note below are enough to exhibit the general fact that loose débris lies at various angles up to about 30° or 32°; débris protected by grass or pines may reach 35°, and rocky slopes 40° or 41°, but in continuous <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> I never found a steeper angle.[98] ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 32. The {{straight}} slopes {{with which}} these curves unite themselves below, in Plate +33+ (f g in reference figure), are those spoken {{of in the}} outset as <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest.</b> But I defer to the next chapter the examination of these, which are a separate family of lines (not curves at all), in order to reassemble the conclusions we have now obtained respecting curvature in mountains, and apply them to questions of art.|$|E
6000|$|... § 18. Generally speaking, {{the curved}} lines of convex, fall belong to {{mountains}} of hard rock, over whose surfaces the fragments {{bound to the}} valley, and which are worn by wrath of avalanches and wildness of torrents, {{like that of the}} Cascade des Pélerins, described in the note above. Generally speaking, the straight <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> belong to softer mountains, or softer surfaces and places of mountains, which, exposed to no violent wearing from external force, nevertheless keep slipping and mouldering down spontaneously or receiving gradual accession of material from incoherent masses above them.|$|E

During {{the time}} that the needle {{completed}} its vibration in the first direction and returned, the machine was worked, and the battery recharged; and when the needle in vibrating resumed its first direction, the discharge was again made through the galvanometer.

6000|$|... § 16. I {{speak of}} some rocky slopes as <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> because, {{whenever}} a mountain side {{is composed of}} soft stone which splits and decomposes fast, it {{has a tendency to}} choke itself up with the ruins, and gradually to get abraded or ground down towards the débris slope; so that vast masses of the sides of Alpine valleys are formed by ascents of nearly uniform inclination, partly loose, partly of jagged rocks, which break, but do not materially alter the general line of ground. In such cases the fragments usually have accumulated without disturbance {{at the foot of the}} slope, and the pine forests fasten the soil and prevent it from being carried down in large masses. But numerous instances occur in which the mountain is consumed away gradually by its own torrents, not having strength enough to form clefts or precipices, but falling on each side of the ravines into even banks, which slide down from above as they are wasted below.|$|E

It is roughly carved in stone, projecting at its base grotesquely from the roof, and covered at the top. The pointed arch, by which its character is given, prevents it from breaking in upon the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the building, and, therefore, in reality renders it less conspicuous than it would otherwise have been. We should never have noticed its existence, had we not been looking out for chimneys.|$|R

40|$|Members of the {{conspicuous}} bone-eating genus, Osedax, {{are widely}} distributed on whale {{falls in the}} Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These gutless annelids contain endosymbiotic heterotrophic bacteria in a branching root system embedded in the bones of vertebrates, whereas a trunk and anterior palps extend into the surrounding water. The unique life style within a bone environment is challenged by the high bacterial activity on, and within, the bone matrix possibly causing O 2 depletion, and build-up of potentially toxic sulphide. We measured the O 2 distribution around embedded Osedax and showed that the bone microenvironment is anoxic. Morphological studies showed that ventilation mechanisms in Osedax are restricted to the anterior palps, which are optimized for high O 2 uptake by possessing a large surface area, large surface to volume ratio, and short diffusion distances. The blood vascular system comprises large vessels in the trunk, which facilitate an ample supply of oxygenated blood from the anterior crown to a highly vascularised root structure. Respirometry studies of O. mucofloris showed a high O 2 consumption that exceeded the average O 2 consumption <b>of</b> a broad <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> annelids without endosymbionts. We regard this combination of features of the respiratory system of O. mucofloris as an adaptation to their unique nutrition strategy with roots embedded in anoxic bones and elevated O 2 demand due to aerobic heterotrophic endosymbionts...|$|R
