5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric <b>lavage.</b> However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric <b>lavage</b> or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric <b>lavage</b> has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E

Nine consecutive bronchoalveolar <b>lavages</b> were done in every rat and the number of bronchoalveolar cells/mL in <b>lavages</b> 1 - 3 (L 1), 4 - 6 (L 2) and 7 - 9 (L 3) were determined by hemocytometer and electronic cell counts (Coulter Counter). The sex or age of the rats did not show a significant effect (p > 0. 05) in the number of bronchoalveolar cells recovered from the lungs; however, {{there was a significant difference}} (p L 3). A discrepancy of. apprx. 8 % in the counts of bronchoalveolar cells was found between the hemocytometer and the Coulter Counter; however, these two methods of cell quantitation showed a significant (p 0. 05) differences were found in the percentage of fluid recovery (overall mean = 94. 5 %) among <b>lavages</b> L 1, L 2 and L 3.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} the atomized nasal douche in the restoration of physiological nasal functions in patients affected by acute viral rhinosinusitis, when compared with nasal <b>lavages</b> with isotonic sodium chloride solution. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: The ENT Department at the University of Siena Medical School. Patients: Two hundred patients affected by acute viral rhinosinusitis were included in the study. Interventions: Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group 1 patients received an atomized nasal douche, and group 2 patients received nasal <b>lavages</b> with isotonic sodium chloride solution. Patients underwent treatments 4 times per day for 15 days in our institution under our direct control. Results: Atomized nasal douches significantly improved inspiratory and expiratory rhinomanometric resistance (P <. 01) and nasal volumes measured by acoustic rhinometry (P <. 001). Nasal <b>lavages</b> were unable to modify these variables significantly (P <. 3). Only atomized nasal douches were able to normalize mucociliary transport time to a physiological level (P <. 001). Conclusions: The atomized nasal douche demonstrated a better efficacy than traditional nasal <b>lavages</b> with isotonic sodium chloride solution in restoring all the physiological nasal functions. For this reason, and considering ease of use, painlessness, cheapness, and manageability of the instrument, we suggest the use of the compressor-micronizer chamber system (Rinoflow Nasal Wash & Sinus System) as a routine adjuvant to every treatment of acute rhinopathies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Clinical presentation, diagnosis, {{management}} and outcome of molecularly defined congenital {{pulmonary alveolar proteinosis}} (PAP) due to mutations in the GM-CSF receptor are not well known. Case presentation A 2 1 / 2 years old girl was diagnosed as having alveolar proteinosis. Whole lung <b>lavages</b> were performed with a new catheter balloon technique, feasible in small sized airways. Because of some interstitial inflammation in the lung biopsy and to further improve the condition, empirical therapy with systemic steroids and azathioprin, and inhaled and subcutaneous GMCSF, were used. Based on clinical measures, total protein and lipid recovered by whole lung <b>lavages,</b> all these treatments were without benefit. Conversely, severe respiratory viral infections and an invasive aspergillosis with aspergilloma formation occurred. Recently the novel homozygous stop mutation p. Ser 25 X of the GMCSF receptor alpha chain was identified in the patient. This mutation leads {{to a lack of}} functional GMCSF receptor and a reduced response to GMCSF stimulation of CD 11 b expression of mononuclear cells of the patient. Subsequently a very intense treatment with monthly <b>lavages</b> was initiated, resulting {{for the first time in}} complete resolution of partial respiratory insufficiency and a significant improvement of the overall somato-psychosocial condition of the child. Conclusions The long term management from early childhood into young adolescence of severe alveolar proteinosis due to GMCSF receptor deficiency requires a dedicated specialized team to perform technically demanding whole lung <b>lavages</b> and cope with complications. </p...|$|R

Nasal challenge with house dust mite extract caused immediate nasal symptoms and increased levels of interleukin- 5. Between 3. 5 and 8. 5 h after the challenge symptoms recurred and interleukin- 5 levels increased, reflecting a late phase reaction. Eosinophil cationic protein, a marker of activated eosinophils, was released between 6. 5 and 9. 5 h after challenge. Treatment with fluticasone propionate (as an aqueous nasal spray) significantly decreased the evoked interleukin- 5 and ECP levels in the late phase reaction.
