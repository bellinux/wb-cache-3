50|$|Equilibrium {{segregation}} {{is associated}} with the <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder</b> at interfaces, where there are sites of energy different from those within the lattice at which the solute atoms can deposit themselves. The equilibrium segregation is so termed because the solute atoms segregate themselves to the interface or surface in accordance with the statistics of thermodynamics in order to minimize the overall free energy of the system. This sort of partitioning of solute atoms between the grain boundary and the lattice was predicted by McLean in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The spin ice {{model is}} only one {{subdivision}} of frustrated systems. The word frustration was initially introduced to describe a system’s inability to simultaneously minimize the competing interaction energy between its components. In general frustration is caused either by competing interactions due to site disorder (see also the Villain model or by lattice structure {{such as in the}} triangular, face-centered cubic (fcc), hexagonal-close-packed, tetrahedron, pyrochlore and kagome lattices with antiferromagnetic interaction. So frustration is divided into two categories: the first corresponds to the spin glass, which has both disorder in structure and frustration in spin; the second is the geometrical frustration with an ordered lattice structure and frustration of spin. The frustration of a spin glass is understood {{within the framework of the}} RKKY model, in which the interaction property, either ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic, is dependent on the distance of the two magnetic ions. Due to the <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder</b> in the spin glass, one spin of interest and its nearest neighbors could be at different distances and have a different interaction property, which thus leads to different preferred alignment of the spin.|$|E

A strong in situ dynamic annealing {{has been found in}} the RT implanted GaAs, and the LT implanted GaAs exhibits heterogeneous (at the end-of-range of the ions) and homogeneous (at the subsurface region) c-a phase transitions. In InP crystals, in situ annealing is much less pronounced in RT implantation, and dose-dependent damage nucleation and layer-by-layer amorphization take place.

40|$|We {{report the}} effect of substrate-induced <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder</b> on the balance between the coexisting antiferromagnetic/charge-ordered {{insulating}} (AFM/COI) and ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) phases and {{the dynamics of the}} phase transition in the strongly phase-separated single-crystalline La 1 -x-yPryCaxMnO 3 (x approximate to 0. 42, y approximate to 0. 40) thin films. At lower degree of disorder, the delicate balance between AFM/COI and FMM phases gives rise to a magnetically disordered/non-equilibrium magnetic liquid, which shows a strong supercooling behaviour and colossal thermal hysteresis in temperature dependence of magnetization (M-T) and resistivity (rho-T). At lower temperatures, the disordered liquid freezes to yield a randomly frozen glassy state. The enhanced <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder</b> quenches the non-FM phases and promotes AFM/COI-FMM phase transition, which in turn reduces the magnetic frustration and lowers the degree of supercooling. The enhanced FMM fraction also unblocks the blocked magnetic states and results in the vanishing of the pronounced minimum in the rho-T curve observed well above the glass transition.

40|$|We {{report a}} study of {{photonic}} crystal nanocavities {{as a function of}} <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder,</b> which is implemented by deliberate radius variations of the holes forming the photonic crystal. Using cross-polarized laser light scattering, we demonstrate that <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder</b> affects the cavity mode symmetry, as is crucially evidenced by measuring scattering resonances for different sample orientations and explained by group-theoretical analysis together with calculations of the mode profile. We also quantify how the increase of <b>lattice</b> <b>disorder</b> leads to a reduction of the cavity Q factors and to a spread of both Q factors and resonance wavelengths. The trends as a function of disorder and for different radii distributions are well reproduced by theoretical calculations when both intentional (deliberate) and intrinsic (residual) disorder are taken into account. The results shed light on the effects of disorder on cavity resonances and on the interplay between intentional and intrinsic disorder, yielding reliable estimations of residual disorder (which ultimately affects technology limits) from optical measurements. Interestingly, the disorder values derived from the variation of the Q factor are lower than those derived from the wavelength spread: this suggests the occurrence of subtle interhole correlation effects that turn out to be beneficial for cavity Q factors.

40|$|Quantum walk (QW) in {{presence}} of <b>lattice</b> <b>disorders</b> {{leads to a}} multitude of interesting phenomena, such as Anderson localization. While QW has been realized in various optical and atomic systems, its implementation with superconducting qubits still remains pending. The major challenge in simulating QW with superconducting qubits emerges {{from the fact that}} on-chip superconducting qubits cannot hop between two adjacent lattice sites. Here we overcome this barrier and develop a scheme to realize the discrete time QW by placing a pair of superconducting qubits on each site of a 1 D lattice and treating an excitation as a walker. It is also shown that <b>lattice</b> <b>disorders</b> can be introduced and fully controlled within this scheme by tuning the qubit parameters. We observe a distinct signature of transition from the ballistic regime to a localized QW with an increasing strength of disorder.
