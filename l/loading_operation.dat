50|$|The {{route of}} the steamboats began in the Colorado River Delta, where there was at first just an {{anchorage}} near Robinson's Landing in Baja California, 10 miles above the river mouth and 140 miles below Fort Yuma. Here they picked up their cargoes from ships in the river, to avoid paying Mexican customs duties for landing their cargo. The extreme tides and its tidal bore in the estuary above the river mouth made this <b>loading</b> <b>operation</b> difficult and sometimes dangerous for the vessels engaging in it. Some 20 miles above that anchorage the first steamboats were assembled until the later 1860s. There the tidal conditions were not so violent but the tide could aid in launching the craft.|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engines in}} {{generator}} configuration are normally optimized for operations at medium to high engine loads. It is suspected that <b>operations</b> at low <b>loads</b> may increase operational problems {{and thus the}} damage frequency. It is also suspected that negative effects off low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> are aggravated by recent exhaust emission regulations issued by IMO. This thesis describes {{an investigation of the}} impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> on modern four-stroke diesel engines in generator configuration. The problem has been approached by reviewing existing literature, studying damage cases, analysis of existing finding data and by assessing engine manufacturers experiences with low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> of diesel engines are defined as engine operations below 40 % of maximum continuous rating. Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> are typical for, but not limited to, offshore vessels with dynamic positioning systems. Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> of diesel engines cause lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperature. Low temperature can lead to ignition problems and poor combustion which causes increased soot formation and aggregation of unburned fuel in the cylinder. Low cylinder pressure, soot and unburned fuel deteriorate the piston ring sealing efficiency allowing hot combustion gases, soot particles and unburned fuel to leak past the piston rings. This results in increased lubricating oil consumption and dilution. Fuel dilution of the lubricating oil reduces the viscosity which can collapse critical oil film thicknesses. This can cause premature wear of pistons, rings, liners and crank case bearings. The mechanisms of low load lead to a cycle of degradation which means that diesel engines that run at low loads {{for longer periods of time}} can become irreversibly damaged. This is illustrated in this paper by an engine damage case. The damage case presents an engine crankcase breakage initially caused by piston scuffing from lubrication oil breakdown after excessive low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Most modern diesel engines operate at lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperatures to comply with stringent IMO NOX emission requirements. The IMO Tier I and II standards are met by primary measures which aim at reducing the amount of NOX formed during combustion by optimizing certain engine parameters. Modern NOX optimized engines are more exposed to low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> than their predecessors due to initially lower cylinder pressures and temperatures. However, recent developments such as common rail, variable injection timing and variable valve control permit engine <b>operations</b> at lower <b>loads</b> than earlier. Existing finding data from DNV GL s database have been analysed to determine whether one can substantiate the impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> quantitatively. The finding data have been analysed by simple frequency measurements. The results show higher finding frequencies for DP-vessels than non-DP vessels, which could indicate that low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> may have a negative impact on the operational problems and thus the damage frequency. The finding data have also been evaluated with respect to time to determine whether NOX optimization aggravates the negative impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> The result showed generally higher finding frequencies for engines installed after 2000 than the ones installed prior to 2000. This could indicate that the introduction of Tier I compliant engines have increased operational problems. However, it could not be determined whether NOX optimized engines have aggravated the negative impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Engine manufacturers that have been interviewed agree that low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> affect the engine operation negatively, but they do not want confirm that low <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> increases the engine damage frequency. It is consensus among the engine manufacturers that the engines must be loaded to at least 50 % of rated power regularly during low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> to prevent operational problems. The time interval and load requirements can vary from one engine to another and depending on the engine design...|$|R

5000|$|The {{blowback}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as [...] "simple", [...] "straight" [...] or [...] "pure" [...] blowback) system represents the most basic auto <b>loading</b> <b>operation</b> type. In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against {{the rear of the}} barrel, but is not locked in place. At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel {{while at the same time}} pushing the case rearward against the bolt. The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring. The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber. The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear. The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon fires from an open bolt). A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.|$|E

The Regiment was involved in security operations: blocking routes, protecting bridges, ferries and water filtration plants against attack, and supporting internal security measures like fencing and minefields, all {{in addition to a}} comprehensive training programme. From July 1952 to June 1954 37 Field Squadron was located at Gothic Camp, El Ballah on detachment to 32 Guards Brigade (1st Scots Gds, 3rd Coldsteam Gds and 1st Beds & Herts). This period of 'freedom' from the regiment was much enjoyed and it was during this time that the Squadron was handed over to the 2iC Capt B.G. Griffiths in February 1953, who picked up his majority one month later. Under his command the Squadron took part in Op RODEO FLAIL, a tank <b>loading</b> <b>operation</b> at Port Said, pontoon building, constructing several semi-permanent Bailey bridges over the Sweetwater Canal (one of which at El Firdan - a 30EWBB - was 82m/270ft long over two piers x 17m/55ft high), exercises TRIANGLE and LONGBOW and several long-range desert patrols in GMC armoured trucks (typically well beyond the official limits of the Canal Zone!). 2iC to Maj Griffiths in mid 1953 was 2/Lt D.

40|$|According to {{the type}} of {{ancillary}} service provisioned, operation mode of a power plant may change to part <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> In this contribution, part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> is understood as delivering a lower power output than possible at given ambient temperature because of gas turbine power output control. If it is economically justified, a power plant may operate in the part load mode for longer time. Part load performance of a newly built 80 Â MW combined cycle in Slovakia was studied in order to assess the possibilities for fuel savings. Based on online monitoring data three possibilities were identified: condensate preheating by activation of the currently idle hot water section; change in steam condensing pressure regulation strategy; and the most important gas turbine inlet air preheating. It may seem to be in contradiction with the well proven concept of gas turbine inlet air cooling, which has however been developed for boosting the gas turbine cycles in full <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> On the contrary, in a combined cycle in the part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> mode, elevated inlet air temperature does not affect the part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> of gas turbines but it causes more high pressure steam to be raised in HRSG, which leads to higher steam turbine power output. As a result, less fuel needs to be combusted in gas turbines in order to achieve the requested combined cycle's power output. By simultaneous application of all three proposals, more than a 2 % decrease in the power plant's natural gas consumption can be achieved with only minor capital expenses needed.
