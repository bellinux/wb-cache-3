40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the potential for post-extraction algal residue (PEAR) to be incorporated as a protein source in the grazing sector of the beef cattle industry. In Experiment 1, blends <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> and conventional protein supplements (dried distillers? grains, DDG; cottonseed meal, CSM) were offered to steers consuming Bermudagrass to evaluate palatability <b>of</b> <b>PEAR.</b> Supplement completion, time required for consumption, and amount of supplement consumed were recorded. In Experiment 2, isonitrogenous amounts <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> and CSM (100 mg N/kg BW) were supplemented to steers consuming low-quality forage to compare effects on nutrient utilization. Experiment 3 evaluated the optimal inclusion rate <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> to steers consuming low-quality forage. Treatments included no supplemental protein, 3 levels <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> (50, 100, and 150 mg N/kg BW) and 1 level of CSM (100 mg N/kg BW). In Experiment 4, the effects of upstream operations on the nutritive value <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> were quantified. Observations indicate PEAR may be blended with existing protein sources in the beef industry without negatively affecting palatability, {{but there may be}} palatability concerns when PEAR is offered alone. Provision of 100 mg N/kg BW <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> or CSM stimulated forage intake (P ? 0. 05) and increased N retention (P = 0. 02) relative to unsupplemented animals. Imbalances in mineral intakes (Ca:P ratio of 8 : 1) were observed when PEAR was supplemented, but not CSM. Total digestible OM intake (TDOMI) responded quadratically (P = 0. 01) to increasing provision <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> with maximization occurring when PEAR was provided at 100 mg N/kg BW. There was not a difference in TDOMI (P = 0. 13) at isonitrogenous levels <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> and CSM, indicating forage utilization was stimulated to a similar extent. Excess mineral levels and imbalances in PEAR were largely a result of cultivation, harvesting, and extraction procedures which could be controlled. Thus, there is potential to alter production streams to optimize oil yield and co-product value. Overall, our results indicate PEAR can be incorporated as a protein source in the beef cattle industry, thus increasing economic viability of biofuel production from algal biomass...|$|R

Endothelial dysfunction is an important hallmark of both the early and the late stages of cardiovascular disease.

PEAR 1 was identified in 2005, but it’s role in endothelial and platelet biology was yet unknown 4.

The expression <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> 1 in endothelial cells has already been confirmed in the host laboratory. Using endothelial cell cultures and cell perfusion studies, the role <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> 1 in endothelial cells will be investigated. Does PEAR 1 play a role in the regulation of the inflammatory responses or the haemostatic and anticoagulant function of the endothelium? Does PEAR 1 contribute to plateletleukocyte- endothelium interactions? What is the effect of eliminating the expression <b>of</b> <b>PEAR</b> 1 ?

Ethylene influences interactions between the gray mold pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, and its hosts. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of ethylene on gray mold susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>pear</b> fruits. B. cinerea induced ethylene emission from infected pear fruits. As expected, ethylene production and softening <b>of</b> <b>pear</b> fruits were accelerated by propylene and inhibited by 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), but these chemical treatments had a relatively small effect on the rate of lesion expansion after wound inoculation with B. cinerea. Cotreatment <b>of</b> <b>pear</b> fruits with 1 -MCP and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) delayed the onset of ethylene emission well beyond the onset of lesion expansion. The trace amount of ethylene produced after inhibition with AVG and 1 -MCP was at least partially produced via 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid. Gray mold susceptibility was cultivar-dependent; d'Anjou pears were more susceptible than Bartlett fruits. Storage enhanced the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>pear</b> fruits. Virulence <b>of</b> the B. cinerea strain B 05. 10 on pear fruits was dependent on the polygalacturonase gene Bcpg 1, but not on the pectin methylesterase gene Bcpme 1.
