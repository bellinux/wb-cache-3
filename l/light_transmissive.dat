40|$|The inner {{structures}} {{of an object}} can be measured by capturing transmissive images. However, the recorded im-ages of a translucent object tend to be unclear due to strong scattering of light inside the object. In this paper, we propose a descattering approach based on Parallel High-frequency Illumination. We show in this paper that the orig-inal high-frequency illumination method and the various ex-tended techniques can be uniformly defined as a separation of overlapped and non-overlapped light rays. Also, we show that <b>transmissive</b> <b>light</b> rays do not overlap each other by constructing a parallel projection/measurement system for performing both illumination and observation.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{innovative}} approach for the fabrication of highly <b>light</b> <b>transmissive,</b> antireflective optical interfaces. This is possible {{due to the}} discovery that metallic nanoparticles {{may be used as}} a lithographic mask to etch nonstraightforward structures into fused silica, which results in a quasihexagonal pattern of hollow, pillar-like protuberances.

40|$|Where {{rocks are}} {{composed}} of translucent minerals, light penetrates the rock and, in so doing, impacts on the thermal conditions. Where minerals are not translucent all the heat transformation must be at the rock surface, and steep thermal gradients can occur. Where light does penetrate, {{a component of the}} incoming radiation is transformed to heat at differing depths within the rock, thereby decreasing the thermal gradient. Equally, <b>light</b> <b>transmissive</b> minerals facilitate endolithic communities, which can also play a role in rock weathering. The attribute of light transmission within rock and the impact this has on the resulting thermal conditions has not been considered within rock weathering studies. An attempt was made to monitor the amount of light penetrating the outer 2 mm of coarse granite under Antarctic summer conditions and to evaluate the thermal impact of this. It was found that the amount of light penetration at this site exceeded modeled or postulated values from biological studies and that it could significantly impact the thermal conditions within the outer shell of the rock. Although the resulting data highlighted a number of flaws in the experimental procedure, sufficient information was generated to provide the first assessment of the range of thermal responses due to <b>light</b> <b>transmissive</b> minerals in rock...|$|E

Interaction of the light with the smooth or rough interface is treated in the facet approximation. The theory for <b>transmissive</b> <b>light</b> scattering by a rough interface in the facet approximation is presented. To treat volume scattering under a rough interface, a Monte Carlo approach is used, where light is allowed {{to interact with the}} surface twice, once upon entering the material and once upon exiting. We compare the polarization and intensity predicted by the models with experimental data from glossy and matte paint samples. The results indicate that the new models are an improvement over the Maxwell-Beard model...|$|R

To access the final edited and published work see: [URL] chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) {{was used for the}} first time in the preparation of thin-film electrochromic nickel(II) oxide (NiO). The asdeposited films were cubic NiO, with an octahedral-like grain structure, and an optical band gap that decreased from 3. 61 to 3. 48 eV on increase in film thickness (in the range 500 − 1000 nm). On oxidative voltammetric cycling in aqueous KOH (0. 1 mol dm− 3) electrolyte, the morphology gradually changed to an open porous NiO structure. The electrochromic properties of the films were investigated as a function of film thickness, following 50, 100, and 500 conditioning oxidative voltammetric cycles in aqueous KOH (0. 1 mol dm− 3). Light modulation of the films increased with the number of conditioning cycles. The maximum coloration efficiency (CE) for the NiO (<b>transmissive</b> <b>light</b> green, the “bleached” state) to NiOOH (deep brown, the colored state) electrochromic process was found to be 56. 3 cm 2 C− 1 (at 450 nm) for films prepared by AACVD for 15 min followed by 100 “bleached”-to-colored conditioning oxidative voltammetric cycles. Electrochromic response times were < 10 s and generally longer for the coloration than the bleaching process. The films showed good stability when tested for up to 10 000 color/bleach cycles. Using the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) system of colorimetry the color stimuli of the electrochromic NiO films and the changes that take place on reversibly oxidatively switching to the NiOOH form were calculated from in situ visible spectra recorded under electrochemical control. Reversible changes in the hue and saturation occur on oxidation of the NiO (<b>transmissive</b> <b>light</b> green) form to the NiOOH (deep brown) form, as shown by the track of the CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. As the NiO film is oxidized, a sharp decrease in luminance was observed. CIELAB L*a*b* coordinates were also used to quantify the electrochromic color states. A combination of a low L* and positive a* and b* values quantified the perceived deep brown colored state...|$|R
40|$|Static {{recording}} characteristic of super-resolution near-field structure with antimony (Sb) is investigated in this paper. The recording marks are observed by a {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), a high-resolution optical microscopy with a CCD camera and an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The super-resolution mechanism is also analyzed based on these static recording marks. Results show that the light reaching on recording layer is composed of two parts, one is the linear <b>transmissive</b> <b>light</b> (propagating field) {{and the other is}} the nonlinear evanescent light in the optical near field. The evanescent light may be greatly enhanced {{in the center of the}} spot because Sb will transit from a semiconductor to a metal when it is melted under the high laser power irradiation. This local melted area in the spot center may be like a metal tip in the optical near field that can collect and enhance the information that is far beyond the diffraction limit, which leads to the super-resolution recording and readout.

This paper describes the relevant principles and methods, the basic structure–property relationships in terms of mesogenic properties of the monomers, and the mechanical and optical properties of the polymers.

The versatility of the process is demonstrated by two examples of films with a patterned molecular order.

The coatings were deposited on the substrates from water dispersions made of Ni 1 -xO pigment synthesized via the peroxo route by reaction of a H 2 O 2 /urea mixture with Ni-acetate precursor. The bunsenite Ni 1 -xO pigment was obtained after thermal treatment of xerogels at 400 degrees C for 24 h. Processing common for paint manufacturing {{was applied for}} the preparation of water dispersions of the Ni 1 -xO pigment, i. e., intensive milling of the pigment with dispersant. Dispersant (NiOxHy) was prepared by colloidal precipitation technique from Ni-sulfate precipitated with sodium hypochlorite.

30|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} (AuNPs) {{have been}} successfully used to enable photothermal therapy (PTT) {{for the treatment of}} cancer in small animal studies [1 – 5], and has recently moved towards clinical application [6]. A variety of AuNPs have been examined for PTT, including silica-gold nanoshells [2], gold nanorods [7], gold nanocages [8], gold-gold sulfide nanoparticles [9], and hollow gold nanoshells [3]. These particles can be engineered to absorb light in the near infrared (NIR) range, where <b>light</b> is maximally <b>transmissive</b> and minimally absorbed by tissue. AuNP delivery can be accomplished by systemic administration (intravenous injection). The nanoparticles, depending on their shape, hydrodynamic size, and surface charge, will accumulate within the tumor via its irregular vasculature; this passive accumulation is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [10, 11]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 60 nm have demonstrated the most efficient delivery to the tumor using the EPR effect [11], and more recently, the use of smaller hollow gold [3] and gold-gold sulfide nanoshells [12] (20 - 40 nm diameter) has further improved nanoparticle half-life in the blood. However, even with these smaller particles, the percentage of the injected dose (ID) delivered to the tumor is low [13, 14], and accumulation in non-target sites such as the liver and spleen is comparatively high [13, 15]. Thus, new methods aimed at improving tumor delivery and specificity may increase the tumor concentration of gold nanoparticles and ultimately the efficacy of anti-tumor PTT and enhance nanoparticle mediated imaging techniques.|$|R
