50|$|In English law, {{manslaughter}} is a {{less serious}} offence than murder. In England and Wales, the usual practice is to prefer a charge of murder, with the judge or defence able to introduce manslaughter as an option (see <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> <b>offence).</b> The jury then decides whether the defendant is {{guilty or not guilty}} of either murder or manslaughter. Manslaughter may be either voluntary or involuntary, depending on whether the accused has the required mens rea for murder.|$|E
5000|$|His {{tenure as}} Lord Chancellor {{was marked by}} controversy, {{as a result of}} the bitter feud between the Butler and Talbot factions, which {{dominated}} Irish politics for more than two decades: almost all senior Irish officials of the Crown were forced to declare an allegiance to one or other side, and Wogan chose the Talbot faction, headed by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. He was accused of treason, and of a number of <b>lesser</b> <b>offences</b> <b>including</b> hiding the Great Seal of Ireland, failing to enroll Acts of the Privy Council of Ireland and ignoring a summons to appear before the Council. These charges were levelled principally by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, head of the Butler faction. Wogan went to England to plead in his own defence. He argued that the charge of treason meant only that he had attempted to carry out the King's commands, but that none of the King's other officers dared to support him against the Butlers. His defence was accepted, and he twice received a royal pardon for all alleged transgressions committed while in Ireland. He evidently wished to continue in office as long as possible, but, not surprisingly, asked that a Deputy might be appointed to act for him as [...] "I cannot bear Ormonde's heavy lordship".|$|R

5000|$|In the English law of homicide, {{manslaughter}} is a {{less serious}} offence than murder, the differential being between levels of fault based on the mens rea (Latin for [...] "guilty mind"). In England and Wales, the usual practice is to prefer a charge of murder, with the judge or defence able to introduce manslaughter as an option (see <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> <b>offence).</b> The jury then decides whether the defendant is {{guilty or not guilty}} of either murder or manslaughter. On conviction for manslaughter, sentencing is at the judge's discretion, whereas a sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory on conviction for murder. Manslaughter may be either voluntary or involuntary, depending on whether the accused has the required mens rea for murder.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{the common}} law crime of larceny {{requires}} the taking and carrying away of tangible property from another person, {{with the intent to}} permanently deprive the owner of that property. Robbery, under {{the common law}}, requires all of the same elements, plus the use of force or intimidation to accomplish the taking. Therefore, larceny is a <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offense in the offense of robbery, as every robbery includes a larceny as part of the crime. Assault is also a <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offense of robbery, just as false imprisonment is usually a <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offense to kidnapping. However, an offense will not be a <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offense if it carries a maximum penalty greater than that carried by for the charged offense.|$|R

40|$|Whether or not {{the judge}} in a {{criminal}} trial is required to charge the jury on a <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offense is of utmost importance to a criminal defendant, his counsel and the court. Failure to instruct on <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offenses when required {{will result in a}} new trial for defendant. From the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s standpoint, failure to request such a charge may reveal inadequate representation of his client. The courts have a stake in insuring that required <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offenses are addressed at the trial level because failure to do so results in renewed litigation and further expense to both the state and the defendant. The determinative factor for charging on a <b>lesser</b> <b>included</b> offense is the presence of evidence offered at trial from which a jury could find that such a crime of a lesser degree was committed. Where a state presents evidence tending to show the crime charged and where neither party presents conflicting evidence on any of the elements, a court is not required to instruct on the lesser offense. The North Carolina Supreme Court addressed the sufficiency of conflicting evidence relating to use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon in an armed robbery charge. Without specifically defining conflicting evidence, the Court unequivocably stated what evidence is not sufficiently conflicting to require an instruction for common law robbery...|$|R
