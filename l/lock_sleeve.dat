40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a locking device for a plug-in connection, whereby one connection part is allocated a rotary sleeve with an inner thread {{and the other}} connection part is allocated a corresponding outer thread. The inner thread of the <b>locking</b> <b>sleeve</b> is divided into threaded segments which are interrupted by non-threaded surfaces. The threaded segments are each attached to the inner side of the <b>locking</b> <b>sleeve</b> on flexible springs. In a second version, the <b>locking</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{is divided into two}} sleeve parts which are rotatable in relation to one another. As a result of the shape of the threads of the inner thread of the <b>locking</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the outer thread of the second connection part, the plug-in connection can be joined by means of a linear movement and, with a suitable design of the outer thread of the second connection part, can be disconnected by means of a linear movement...|$|R
40|$|Wedge joint links {{structural}} members in manual, remote, or automated assemblies. Joint is simple {{enough to be}} assembled by undersea divers, workers in nuclear reactors, and other wearing gloves or bulky clothing. Combination of wedging angles on parts overcomes structural misalinements and forces assembly into true position as <b>locking</b> <b>sleeve</b> moves into place. Joint transmits tension, compression, bending moments and torsion and is inherently insensitive to thermal excursions, vibration, and machining tolerance buildup...|$|R
30|$|As {{the plate}} is pre-contoured, {{it does not}} seat equally well in all {{patients}} and bending the plate can potentially damage the locking hole screw threads and can also change the screw direction to a certain extent. Improperly locked screws can compromise {{the stability of the}} construct, and the change in screw direction can pose a problem in the distal screws which are directed into the capitellum and trochlea. To circumvent this problem, plate bending should be done after blocking the screw holes with <b>locking</b> <b>sleeves</b> and bending the plate only in between the screw holes.|$|R
25|$|The Bronze Age, {{which in}} Ireland is dated from 2200–600 BC, also left its {{mark on the}} Dublin region. A variety of bronze and gold {{artifacts}} which have been discovered {{in the vicinity of}} the modern city – among them cauldrons, side-blown horns, <b>lock</b> rings, <b>sleeve</b> fasteners, striated rings, hair rings and penannular bracelets – indicate a continuous or intermittent settlement of the area.|$|R
5000|$|Incorporation of wrist {{bearings}} and ring <b>locks</b> on the <b>sleeves</b> starting with Grissom's MR-4 suit. Alan Shepard's MR-3 suit had gloves that were zippered onto the suit itself, preventing the astronaut from easily rotating his wrists {{to control the}} spacecraft's controllers.|$|R
6000|$|The old man {{opened the}} door, and {{thrusting}} in his meagre face, thatched with thin grey <b>locks,</b> and one <b>sleeve</b> {{of his white}} coat, said in a subdued and mysterious tone of voice, [...] "I was wanting to speak to you, sir." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carabiners {{are also}} made {{specially}} for via ferratas, their design typically allowing a larger-than-normal opening {{and having a}} spring locking mechanism that can be opened with one hand. They are also strong enough to withstand high fall factors. Such carabiners are marked with a K in a circle, the K standing for Klettersteig, the German term for via ferrata. These are the only types of carabiner that should be used {{on the end of}} the safety lines. A typical design uses a spring-loaded sleeve on the carabiner gate. While the gate is closed, the sleeve is held in place over the gate opening by its spring; to unlock and open the gate, the sleeve slides directly down the gate shaft away from the opening. The ease of opening these devices makes them suitable for via ferrata climbing, with its constant clipping and unclipping, but not for applications where more secure locking mechanisms (automatic or manual) are called for. However, <b>locking</b> <b>sleeves</b> on via ferrata carabiners have been known to hang up in the gate opening and prevent the gate from closing properly. Care must be taken to maintain (clean and lubricate) and/or replace the carabiners as needed to avoid this potentially unsafe situation. Also, these carabiners are not true [...] "locking carabiners", as employed in roped climbing and caving systems, and should not be used as such.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{houses the}} firing pin {{mechanism}} that gets cocked when the bolt is opened and the cocking piece protrudes visually and tactilely {{from the rear of}} the bolt to indicate the action is cocked. This bolt <b>sleeve</b> <b>lock</b> was not present on previous Mauser bolt action designs and reduced firing pin travel and lock time.|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the <b>locking</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
5000|$|Össur {{manufactures}} prosthetic {{limbs and}} joints, liners, sockets, <b>locks</b> and <b>sleeves.</b> Its products include Flex-Foot, a prosthetic foot made from carbon fiber, a material {{used in the}} aerospace industry for its strength and flexibility. The Flex-Foot Cheetah developed by medical engineer Van Phillips and worn by Alan Oliveira and other amputee athletes is a derivative of this product line. Össur also produces the Total Knee prosthetic, which possesses a [...] "locking moment" [...] which keeps the knee from collapsing when it is in full extension, Mauch Knee, which has a hydraulic system for fluid and natural gait, and Iceross silicone prosthetic liners, which provide an interface between the skin and the socket.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} investigation {{towards the}} redesign {{of the base}} and the tilting module of the Solitary Lift prototype improved the machine with a weight reduction of 5. 731 bs. Besides lighter weight, the other criteria used to measure improvement were speed, ease of use, and durability. In these areas this iteration of the prototype increased the speed to raise the tilter by 25 seconds, replaced a complicated locking mechanism with a familiar <b>sleeve</b> <b>lock</b> found on folding tables, and considered the substitution of plastic materials for aluminum in the structure. by Elliot B.
