50|$|Osmoderma eremita, the {{hermit beetle}} or Russian <b>leather</b> <b>beetle,</b> is {{a species of}} European beetle in the Scarabaeidae family. Adults reach between 28 and 32 mm in length.|$|E
50|$|Dermestes maculatus, {{known as}} the hide beetle, <b>leather</b> <b>beetle,</b> or skin beetle, feeds on raw skins and hides like the larder beetle. This species is similar in {{appearance}} to the larder beetle, with short and long reddish brown or black setae, but its two spine-like posterior appendages curve forward. Also, the forewings are dark brown and the sternum is mostly white with some black. Its life cycle is 60 to 70 days and the female can lay up to 800 eggs.|$|E
40|$|A kHz optical {{remote sensing}} system is {{implemented}} to determine insect melanization features. This is done by measuring the backscatter signal in the visible and near-infrared (VISNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) in situ. It is shown that backscatter cross section in the SWIR is insensitive to melanization and absolute melanization {{can be derived from}} the ratio of backscatter cross section of different bands (SWIR/VIS-NIR). We have shown that reflectance from insect is stronger in the SWIR as compared to NIR and VIS. This reveals that melanization plays a big role to determine backscatter cross section. One can use this feature as a tool to improve insect species and age classification. To support the findings, we illustrated melanization feature using three different insects [dead, dried specimens of snow white moth (Spilosoma genus), fox moth (Macrothylacia), and <b>leather</b> <b>beetle</b> (Odontotaenius genus) ]. It is shown that reflectance from the <b>leather</b> <b>beetle</b> in the VIS and NIR is more affected by melanization as compared with snow white moth...|$|E
50|$|Dermestidae are {{a family}} of Coleoptera that are {{commonly}} referred to as skin beetles. Other common names include larder <b>beetle,</b> hide or <b>leather</b> <b>beetles,</b> carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. The (usually) clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are scarabaeiform and also have setae.|$|R

30|$|Insects {{have long}} been a problem because of the damage they can cause. In {{classical}} times there was discussion of the damage to clothes by moths, and of potential solutions to this nuisance. Insect pests attack furniture and textiles {{as well as the}} structure of wooden buildings, which is of great concern in historic properties. Properties that are no longer occupied offer insects an opportunity to occupy quiet habitats. Especially damaging to historic materials, are the larval stages of carpet beetle (Anthrenus spp.) and clothes moths (Lepidoptera: Tineidae), which feed on textiles, fur and <b>leather,</b> <b>beetles</b> that attack wood and furniture, and silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) and woodlice (Porcellio spp.) that damage books and wallpaper [1].|$|R
40|$|Idealized edged and non-edged indenters, {{mimicking}} canine teeth, {{were used}} to puncture thin materials and thick materials. Less force was needed for the edged (triangular in cross section) indenter to penetrate thin Mylar, paper, <b>leather,</b> <b>beetle</b> elytra and turkey skin than the non-edged (circular in cross-section) indenter. Oak, grass and magnolia leaves responded equally to both indenters. In thick materials, the edged indenter punctured beetles, shrimp, bananas, and chicken flesh more easily than the non-edged indenter. Apple, tomato and avocado were punctured equally well. The edged indenter directs cracks at the corners so that the material can fold away {{in the direction of}} puncture, whereas cracks form unpredictably with the non-edged indenter. Edged indenters have the advantage in many of the materials tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{performance of}} four indigenous plant materials, namely: pepper fruit, Dennettia tripetala Baker, clove, Eugenia aromatica Hook, black pepper, Piper guineense (Schum and Thonn) and African nut-meg, Monodora myristica (Dunal) {{on the main}} developmental stages of two main pests, namely: the <b>leather</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dermestes maculatus Degeer and the copra beetle, Necrobia rufipes Degeer on smoked African mudfish, Clarias gariepinus Burchell was investigated under laboratory conditions. The plant materials were pulverized into powders and also processed into extracts and were applied at 2. 50, 5. 00, 7. 50 and 10. 00 g per 100 g fish and 5 mL of 2. 50, 5. 00, 7. 50 and 10. 00 % per 100 g fish respectively. Each of the powdered smoked fish significantly (p 99. 77 and > 99. 55 % respectively. In another study {{to determine the effect}} of each plant dosage on the palatability and aesthetic acceptance of protected smoked fish, the treated fish was organoleptically rated excellent...|$|E
