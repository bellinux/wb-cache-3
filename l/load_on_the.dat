5|$|Reviewers {{appreciated}} the PS2 version for including the asked-for save feature, but complained the ported game retained the AI and level design {{issues associated with}} the Windows version. IGN remarked that it looked less impressive than the computer versions. The lower resolution, flat textures, washed out colors, and sparser environments made the game average looking. The PS2 version also exhibited clipping issues; character models and projectiles would pass through objects on occasion. The game reviewer, however, praised the console version for presenting a smooth animation, rarely dropping frames. On the contrary, other reviewers stated the frame rate dropped when there are several objects on the screen, presenting a heavy <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> graphics engine. The lack of replay value for the console version after completing the single player mode was a common complaint among the reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting tandem axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E

5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> handling and cabin crew.|$|E

5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, {{and on their}} first play from scrimmage, featured six offensive linemen (albeit unsuccessfully, as Bill Belton rushed for a one-yard loss), before driving down the field on a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with Belton rushing for a five-yard touchdown; he carried the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive, rushing the ball eight times for 36 yards. Penn State would never relinquish that lead. Purdue subsequently went three-and-out, and Penn State responded with another long drive (10 plays, 66 yards) that again culminated with a rushing touchdown, this time from Zach Zwinak on a one-yard run, his tenth touchdown of the season, becoming the 16th Penn State player to eclipse 10, and the first since 2008, when both Evan Royster and Daryll Clark did. Purdue's ensuing drive ended {{in the second quarter}} when quarterback Danny Etling threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Justin Sinz, making the score 14–7 Penn State. Bill Belton lost a fumble on Penn State's next drive, but Purdue turned the ball over right back to Penn State when Jordan Lucas intercepted an Etling pass. Zwinak rushed for his second one-yard touchdown of the game on the ensuing possession. The Nittany Lions scored once more in the first half, via an eight-yard pass from Christian Hackenberg to Adam Breneman, but on the ensuing kickoff, Purdue's Raheem Mostert scored a touchdown on a 100-yard return, thus ending the first half with a score of 28–14, Penn State holding the advantage. Purdue came out of halftime with a vengeance, driving down the field for 84-yards, ultimately pulling within 7 points on an 11-yard rush by Etling. The first field goal of the game occurred on Penn State's subsequent drive, a 29-yarder from Sam Ficken putting the Nittany Lions ahead 31–21. The Boilermakers turned the ball over again on their next drive, and Penn State capitalized when Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game. Purdue turned the ball over on downs their final drive of the third quarter, though Hackenberg threw an interception giving Purdue an opportunity early in the fourth quarter; again, a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition, and Penn State went up 45–21 when Hackenberg rushed for a 4-yard touchdown to culminate an 11-play, 74-yard drive that encapsulated over a third of the fourth quarter, and ended with 4:27 to play. That would be the final scoring drive of the game, which Penn State won by the aforementioned score, 45–21.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{theoretical}} framework and closed-form {{stress intensity factor}} solutions {{in terms of the}} structural stresses for spot welds under various types of loading conditions are presented based on elasticity theories and fracture mechanics. A mechanics description of loading conditions for a finite plate with a rigid inclusion is first presented. The loading conditions of interest are <b>the</b> resultant <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inclusion with respect {{to the center of the}} inclusion in a finite or infinite plate and <b>the</b> surface tractions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral surface of a finite or infinite plate. <b>The</b> surface tractions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral surface of the plate can be decomposed into a load-balanced part and a self-balanced part. The load-balanced part is statically in equilibrium with <b>the</b> resultant <b>loads</b> acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inclusion. The self-balanced part can be represented by <b>the</b> resultant <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral surface of the plate. <b>The</b> resultant <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inclusion and <b>the</b> self-balanced resultant <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral surface are then decomposed into various types of symmetric and anti-symmetric parts. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stress function approach and the Kirchhoff plate theory for linear elastic materials, closed-form in-plane stress, moment and transverse shear force solutions are derived for a plate with a rigid inclusion subjected to various types of resultant <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inclusion and various types of resultant <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plate lateral surface. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> J integral for a strip model, closed-form analytical stress intensity factor solutions for spot welds joining two sheets of equal thickness are derived in terms of the structural stresses around a rigid inclusion in a plate under various types of loading conditions. The closed-form solutions presented in this paper are used as the basis to develop new analytical stress intensity factor solutions for spot welds in various types of specimens presented in a subsequent paper...|$|R
