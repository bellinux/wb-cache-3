40|$|Purpose – Seaborne trade {{accounts}} for 90 per cent of world’s total trade activity. Ship management {{is a highly}} skilled discipline {{with a high degree}} of complexity yet it has failed to follow with the same pace the advancements of performance measurement systems (PMSs) like other industries. Business performance measurement has only recently become a relevant topic in shipping. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the adoption of PMS in the shipping industry. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire was developed based on the performance measurement literature and submitted to 100 shipping companies around the world obtaining 41 usable questionnaires covering 13 countries from Europe, Asia and America. Findings – The adoption of performance measurement differs based on type of business: <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk</b> (<b>tanker)</b> vessels and bulk carriers or containers. Quality and safety management systems have fostered the adoption of performance measurement positively in tankers impacting decision making and the performance of shipping companies using PMS. Research limitations/implications – While the sample is representative of the situation of the industry, it represents the results of one point in time. Practical implications – The use of PMSs can be a tool to achieve superior performance but it may be fostered by, and has to be aligned with the needs of, internal and external stakeholders. Early adopters in the shipping industry are among the leaders in the industry. Originality/value – The paper is a unique contribution to performance measurement since it explores the adoption of PMSs and its impact in performance at industry level in a global industry...|$|E

40|$|Bubble {{entrainment}} in liquids {{represents a}} serious problem in the microgravity environment. Whenever bubbles are entrained in a liquid,they tend to remain stationary in the <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk</b> {{in the absence of}} any external forcing. This is due to the reduction or complete absence of the buoyancy force in the microgravity environment, Thus the buoyancy force can not the be exploited to place the bubbles at the top of the liquid volume as in Ig(sub o) conditions. This situation represents a serious drawback in many space based engineering and scientific applications. We have demonstrated in a series of low gravity experiments conducted during parabolic flight on board aircraft that bubbles can be controlled in such a manner as to increase,the probability of their expulsion from a <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk.</b> In these tests the liquid'bulk was made either to be contained within, or to flow through specially designed containers using capillary force alone. Such containers appear to facilitate bubble removal, from the <b>liquid</b> <b>bulk.</b> Different successful <b>liquid</b> flow configurations will be discussed and the efficacy of the resulting bubble expulsion mechanisms will be demonstrated...|$|R
