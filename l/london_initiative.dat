40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{identify}} {{the nature and}} extent of any vocational training deficit within the <b>London</b> <b>initiative</b> zone and investigate the reasons. DESIGN [...] Collation of statistics and postal questionnaire surveys. SETTING [...] Thames regions inside and outside the <b>London</b> <b>initiative</b> zone. SUBJECTS [...] General practice registrars, trainers, principals from non-training practices, and vocational training course organisers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Trends in numbers of general practice registrars, proportions of trainers, views on current vocational training in inner London. RESULTS [...] Numbers of general practice registrars fell significantly between 1988 and 1993 within the <b>London</b> <b>initiative</b> zone and in England overall. The number of registrars within the zone fell by more than in the rest of the Thames regions, where the decline was not statistically significant. A lower proportion of principals were approved as trainers within the zone than in the rest of the Thames regions and England overall. In their responses to the survey (88 % of inner London registrars responded and 81 % of outer Thames registrars) registrars suggested that improving remuneration and personal safety would make training in London more attractive. Trainers and non-trainers (response rates 89 % and 66 % respectively) also suggested increasing remuneration for trainers together with more protected time for training. CONCLUSIONS [...] Less vocational training takes place within the <b>London</b> <b>initiative</b> zone than in the rest of the Thames regions and England overall, although there are discrepancies in official statistics. As well as specific recommendations for improving recruitment to vocational training in inner London, measures to tackle inner city deprivation should also remain high on the political agenda...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Following the Tomlinson {{report of}} 1992, <b>London</b> <b>Initiative</b> Zone Educational Incentives (LIZEI) funding was {{introduced}} for {{a three-year period}} to improve recruitment, retention, and educational opportunities for general practitioners working within inner London. AIM: To test the hypothesis that general practices that show evidence of good organisation achieved better access to LIZEI funding than less organised practices. METHOD: Observational practice-based study involving all 164 general practices in EAst London and the City Health Authority {{during the first two}} years of the scheme, April 1995 to March 1997. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that higher levels of LIZEI funding were associated with practices where there was evidence of good organisation, including higher targets for cervical cytology screening and immunisation rates for under two-year-olds, better asthma prescribing, and training status. Using ten practice and population explanatory variables, multiple regression models were developed for fundholding and non-fundholding practices. Among non-fundholding practices, the asthma prescribing ratio was the variable with the greatest predictive value, explaining 14. 7 % of the variation in LIZEI funding between practices. Strong positive associations existed between taking further degrees and diplomas, practice size, training, and non-fundholding status. CONCLUSION: Larger practices, training practices, and those that demonstrated aspects of good practice organisation gained more LIZEI funding: an example of the 'inverse funding law'. Practices within a multifund, based in the Newham locality, gained LIZEI funding regardless of practice organisation. Networks of practices, and, potentially, primary care groups, have a role in equalising the opportunities for education and development between practices in east London...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBike sharing systems (BSSs) {{have become}} a means of {{sustainable}} inter-modal transport and are now proposed in many cities worldwide. Most BSSs also provide 1 ￼open access to their data, particularly to real-time status reports on their bike stations. The analysis {{of the mass of}} data generated by such systems is of particular interest to BSS providers to update system structures and policies. This work was motivated by interest in analyzing and comparing several European BSSs to identify common operating patterns in BSSs and to propose practical solutions to avoid potential issues. Our approach relies on the identification of common patterns between and within systems. To this end, a model- based clustering method, called FunFEM, for time series (or more generally functional data) is developed. It is based on a functional mixture model that allows the clustering of the data in a discriminative functional subspace. This model presents the advantage in this context to be parsimonious and to allow the visualization of the clustered systems. Numerical experiments confirm the good behavior of FunFEM, particularly compared to state-of-the-art methods. The application of FunFEM to BSS data from JCDecaux and the Transport for <b>London</b> <b>Initiative</b> allows us to identify 10 general patterns, including pathological ones, and to propose practical improvement strategies based on the system comparison. The visualization of the clustered data within the discriminative subspace turns out to be particularly informative regarding the system efficiency. The proposed methodology is implemented in a package for the R software, named funFEM, which is available on the CRAN. The package also provides a subset of the data analyzed in this work...|$|E
