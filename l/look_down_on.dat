5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, {{and that he could}} not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E

The seventh level, at the mountain's peak, holds “true perfect enlightenment.” Below the mountain is a demi plane of blue skies and clouds, where dead souls, archons, and gods from all of the Good-aligned planes can <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the mortal world.|$|E
25|$|For competition, a blue judogi is worn {{by one of}} the two {{competitors}} {{for ease}} of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the use of blue {{because of the fact that}} judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.|$|E

25|$|The film follows Lăzărescu's {{journey through}} the night, as he is carried from one {{hospital}} to the next. At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine Lăzărescu. Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, each team refuses to admit him and sends him to another hospital. Meanwhile, Lăzărescu's condition deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling, and he slowly loses consciousness. The hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident, but some doctors appear to reject him out of fatigue or {{because they do not}} feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is Mioara, the paramedic who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her.|$|E
25|$|He {{was mostly}} based in Genoa, {{although}} he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed {{for some time}} in Palermo in Sicily. For the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, {{he went back to}} Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of Brussels he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695. He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630 he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large altarpieces, and began his printmaking (see below).|$|E
25|$|On 24 September, Menshikov {{began to}} move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong {{garrison}} (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port's defences. By venturing into {{the interior of the}} Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank. Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. The heat was oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had been a real trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie's Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; {{with the rest of his}} army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British. By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was able to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.|$|E

When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both {{get into a}} fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E
