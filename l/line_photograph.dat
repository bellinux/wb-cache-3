50|$|Motion {{compensation}} photography (also {{known as}} ballistic synchro photography or smear photography when used to image high-speed projectiles) {{is a form}} of streak photography. When the motion of the film is opposite to that of the subject with an inverting (positive) lens, and synchronized appropriately, the images show events as a function of time. Objects remaining motionless show up as streaks. This is the technique used for finish line photographs. At no time is it possible to take a still photograph that duplicates the results of a finish <b>line</b> <b>photograph</b> taken with this method. A still is a photograph in time, a streak/smear photograph is a photograph of time. When used to image high-speed projectiles the use of a slit (as in streak photography) produce very short exposure times ensuring higher image resolution. The use for high-speed projectiles means that one still image is normally produced on one roll of cine film. From this image information such as yaw or pitch can be determined. Because of its measurement of time variations in velocity will also be shown by lateral distortions of the image.|$|E

Of course, {{for this purpose}} we are co-working with the connecting research instituts. Now, Nagasaki prefecture is progressing the developments around the Sasebo Bay. For this reason, the needs of this investigation were requested strongly. Especially, we used three kinds of stream line photographs. The first one is an ordinary stream <b>line</b> <b>photograph</b> by aluminum powders, the second one is a pathlines photograph by specially made tracers and the third one is a dynamic stream <b>line</b> <b>photograph</b> recorded in VTR. We determined the velocities of the bay by these three kinds of photographs. In this paper, we clarified the following items. (a) The general flow patterns of the bay. (b) The bay has several kinds of the vortices. (c) The producing mechanisms of the vortices. (d) The velocity vectors and velocity diagrams in the bay...|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{problem for}} railway {{companies}} {{is to prevent}} damage to the overhead line equipment and to pantographs. Unfortunately high speeds worsen the problem and a monitoring system has {{to be set up}} and tested to plan maintenance activities. Test runs were performed on board of an ETR 500, a high-speed train of Italian Railways, with a double pantograph and an acquisition system on board of a measurement coach, based on a twin phototube sensor. Besides critical points of the overhead line, due to break arcs, it was revealed that the current collection between pantograph and overhead line is of a poor quality {{in the presence of a}} continuous flashing (the electric welding effect).
