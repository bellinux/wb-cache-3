5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with <b>lifestyle</b> <b>changes</b> are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and <b>lifestyle</b> <b>changes</b> are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|Treatment with nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once {{the acute}} attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via <b>lifestyle</b> <b>changes</b> {{and in those}} with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and eating a diet high in low fat dairy products may be preventive.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>lifestyle</b> <b>changes</b> and {{medications}} can decrease {{uric acid}} levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods {{of animal origin}} such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup). Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Healthy lifestyles are an {{important}} facet of cardiovascular risk management. Unfortunately many individuals fail to engage with <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> programmes. There are many factors that patients report as influencing their decisions about initiating <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change.</b> This is challenging for health care professionals who may lack the skills and time to address {{a broad range of}} barriers to lifestyle behaviour. Guidance on which factors to focus on during lifestyle consultations may assist healthcare professionals to hone their skills and knowledge leading to more productive patient interactions with ultimately better uptake of <b>lifestyle</b> behaviour <b>change</b> support. The aim of our study was to clarify which influences reported by patients predict uptake and completion of formal <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> programmes. Methods A systematic narrative review of quantitative observational studies reporting factors (influences) associated with uptake and completion of <b>lifestyle</b> behaviour <b>change</b> programmes. Quantitative observational studies involving patients at high risk of cardiovascular events were identified through electronic searching and screened against pre-defined selection criteria. Factors were extracted and organised into an existing qualitative framework. Results 374 factors were extracted from 32 studies. Factors most consistently associated with uptake of <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> related to support from family and friends, transport and other costs, and beliefs about the causes of illness and <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change.</b> Depression and anxiety also appear to influence uptake as well as completion. Many factors show inconsistent patterns with respect to uptake and completion of <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> programmes. Conclusion There are a small number of factors that consistently appear to influence uptake and completion of cardiovascular <b>lifestyle</b> behaviour <b>change.</b> These factors could be considered during patient consultations to promote a tailored approach to decision making about the most suitable type and level <b>lifestyle</b> behaviour <b>change</b> support. </p...|$|R

These elements were inspired by <b>lifestyle</b> <b>changes</b> (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including <b>lifestyle</b> <b>changes,</b> medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a tailored behavior change program on a composite <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> score. A randomized controlled trial conducted in Belgium in 2007 - 08 with 314 participants allocated to a control and an intervention condition. The intervention was a tailored behavior change program (web-based and individual coaching). The dose of the coaching was chosen by the participants and registered. Outcome measures were weight, saturated fat intake, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking status and a composite <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> score. Mann-Whitney U-tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, t-tests and one-way analyses of variance were used to compare the study conditions and three intervention dose groups (no/low, medium and high intervention dose). There {{were no significant differences between}} the study conditions or between the intervention dose groups for the individual lifestyle factors. The composite <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> score was significantly higher in the high intervention dose group compared with the no/low intervention dose group (P = 0. 009). The composite <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> score was positively related to the intervention dose, while the individual lifestyle factors were not.

40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} a 6 -month <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> {{intervention}} on cardiovascular risk fac-tors in obese, sedentary, postmenopausal women was examined. A secondary aim of this in-vestigation {{was to determine whether}} the addition of self-control skills training to an em-pirically supported <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> intervention would result in greater cardiovascular risk reduction. Methods: Forty-four women were randomly assigned to receive either a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> or a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> with self-control skills intervention. Pretreatment and posttreatment weight loss, body composition, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, diet, blood pressure (BP), blood lipids, and psychosocial functioning were assessed.

40|$|We analyse {{the impacts}} {{of a change in}} consumers¿ {{preference}} for Novel Protein Foods (NPFs), i. e. a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> with respect to meat consumption, and {{the impacts of}} environmental policies e. g. tradable emission permits for greenhouse gases (GHGs) or an EU ammonia (NH 3) emission bound per hectare. For our analysis we use a global applied general equilibrium (AGE) model that includes consumers¿ <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change,</b> different production systems, emissions from agricultural sectors, and an emission permits system. Our study leads to the following conclusions. Firstly, more consumption of NPFs assists in reducing global agricultural emissions of methane (CH 4), nitrous oxides (N 2 O) and NH 3. However, because of international trade, emission reduction does not necessarily occur in the regions where more NPFs are consumed. Secondly, through <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> of the `rich¿, the emission reduction is not substantial because more `intermediate¿ consumers will increase their meat consumption.

40|$|Background: Direct-to-consumer (DTC) {{prescription}} drug advertisements {{are thought to}} induce boomerang effects, meaning they reduce the perceived effectiveness of the alternative option: non-pharmaceutical treatment via <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change.</b> Past research has observed such effects using artificially created, text-only advertisements that may not adequate capture the complex, conflicting portrayal of <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> in real television advertisements. Research in other risk domains has found that individual problem status often moderates boomerang effects, such that subjects who currently engage in the risky behavior exhibit the strongest boomerang effects. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether priming with real direct-to-consumer (DTC) television advertisements elicited boomerang effects on perceptions of <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> and whether these effects, if present, were moderated by individual problem status. Methods: We assembled a sample of real, previously aired DTC television advertisements in order to naturalistically capture the portrayal of <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> in real advertisements. We randomized 819 adults in the United States recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk to view or not view an advertisement for a {{prescription drug}}. We further randomized subjects to judge either <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> or drugs on three measures: general effectiveness, disease severity for a hypothetical patient, and personal intention to use the intervention if diagnosed with the target health condition. Results: Advertisement exposure induced a statistically significant, but weak, boomerang effect on general effectiveness (p = 0. 01, partial R 2 = 0. 007) and did not affect disease severity score (p = 0. 32, partial R 2 = 0. 0009). Advertisement exposure elicited a reverse boomerang effect of similar effect size on personal intentions, such that advertisement-exposed subjects reported comparatively higher intentions to use <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> relative to drugs (p = 0. 006, partial R 2 = 0. 008). Individual problem status did not significantly moderate these effects. Conclusions: In contrast to previous literature finding large boomerang effects using artificial advertisement stimuli, real television advertisements elicited only a weak boomerang effect on perceived effectiveness and elicited an unexpected reverse boomerang effect on personal intentions to use <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> versus drugs. These findings may reflect real advertisements’ induction of descriptive norms and self-efficacy; future research could address such possibilities by systematically manipulating advertisement content...|$|R

40|$|The {{service and}} {{evaluation}} {{is funded by}} the Scottish Government through the Detect Cancer Early Programme. Background: Previous research has shown diagnosis or screening for cancer may be a ‘teachable moment’ for prevention through <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change.</b> Previous trials have been successful, but have been delivered via national programmes targeting patients being screened for colorectal cancer. This manuscript reports the protocol for a proof-of-concept study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> service targeting men suspected or diagnosed with cancer of the prostate in a secondary care cancer service within the UK. Methods: <b>Lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> will be promoted through integration of a <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> service in a Urology department in one NHS Board. The service is delivered by a Health Psychologist and uses Motivational Interviewing and behavioural change techniques to motivate and support patients to consider and address topics such as increasing physical activity and a healthy diet, smoking cessation, alcohol reduction and weight loss. A service evaluation will assess feasibility and acceptability via a patient experience survey, a survey exploring staff knowledge, attitudes and practice, pre- and post-intervention lifestyle behaviour survey, and an audit of routine patient database. Discussion: This pilot will assess the viability of using cancer testing and diagnosis as a ‘teachable moment’ for <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> in a unique population (i. e. men with suspected cancer of the prostate). If successful, this approach offers potential for preventative services to enhance routine and person-centred clinical cancer care provided within secondary care settings.

40|$|Background: People with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) {{experience more}} {{health problems and}} have different <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> needs, compared with the general population. Aims: To improve <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> interventions for people with ID, this review examined how behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were applied in interventions aimed at physical activity, nutrition or physical activity and nutrition, and described their quality. Methods and procedures: After a broad search and detailed selection process, 45 studies {{were included in the}} review. For coding BCTs, the CALO-RE taxonomy was used. To assess the quality of the interventions, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used. Extracted data included general study characteristics and intervention characteristics. Outcomes and results: All interventions used BCTs, although theory-driven BCTs were rarely used. The most frequently used BCTs were ‘provide information on consequences of behaviour in general’ and ‘plan social support/social change’. Most studies were of low quality and a theoretical framework was often missing. Conclusion and implications: This review shows that BCTs are frequently applied in <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> interventions. To further improve effectiveness, these <b>lifestyle</b> <b>change</b> interventions could benefit from using a theoretical framework, a detailed intervention description and an appropriate and reliable intervention design which is tailored to people with ID...|$|R
