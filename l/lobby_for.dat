5|$|Before 1856 {{there was}} minimal {{discussion}} of statehood within Minnesota.

40|$|In this thesis, I take a within-industry view {{on special}} {{interest}} groups and study the impact of corporate <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> subsidies. My thesis {{is a collection of}} three single-authored research papers, studying both theoretically and empirically different facets of the firm-level links between lobbying and subsidies. Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 are theoretical contributions analyzing <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> subsidies in a heterogeneous firms framework. In particular, I study <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> a production subsidy in a closed economy (Chapter 2) and <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> export subsidies in an open economy (Chapter 4). Chapter 3 is an empirical study in which I analyze the link between lobbying and subsidies at the US firm level...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E

5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> influence with their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E
5|$|Since its nomination, {{numerous}} {{changes and}} renovations have occurred. The surrounding area {{has seen the}} construction of condominiums and the large manufacturing building being renovated and re-purposed for loft-style apartments. Renovations on {{the northern end of}} the property would require the demolition of two buildings to construct the Integrated Day Charter School. Completed in 2008, a new two-story addition created an indoor gymnasium, kitchen, offices and a new <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> the school.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} regarding Manahi's VC recommendation {{during the}} Battle of Takrouna still rankled with {{many members of}} the Māori Battalion but while he was alive, Manahi's modesty and unwillingness to bring any attention to himself meant that he was not interested in changing the situation. Following his death, the Manahi VC Committee was established by his former comrades and iwi to <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> an upgrade to his award.|$|E
50|$|In an {{editorial}} column within the Los Angeles Times, critic Dale Van Atta wrote that AARP does unauthorized <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> its membership, and lobbies {{against the best}} interests of its membership.

5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> the position. He also promised Wyatt {{a position as}} his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, {{a member}} of Waco's city council, viewed {{pictures}} of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began to <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> {{a monument to the}} lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but proved unfruitful. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker {{on the site of the}} lynching. Some descendants of Fryer objected to the proposed memorial.|$|E

5|$|Led by incorporator Norma Elizabeth Boyd, the {{sorority}} {{created the}} National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights (NPC) in 1938, later renamed the National Non-Partisan Council on Public Affairs. It {{was the first}} full-time congressional <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> minority group civil rights.

The NPC was dissolved on July 15, 1948, by twelfth Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray-Campbell. A year later, Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to apply for life membership in the NAACP.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Soegijapranata {{was unable}} to prevent Japanese torture of prisoners of war, {{including}} the clergy, but was himself well-treated by the Japanese forces; he was often invited to Japanese ceremonies, but never attended, sending bouquets in his stead. He used this position of respect to <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> fair treatment of those interned. He successfully petitioned the Japanese overlords to exempt nuns from the paramilitary draft {{and allow them to}} work at hospitals. He and the Catholic populace also gathered food and other supplies for interned clergy, and Soegijapranata kept in contact with the prisoners, supplying and receiving news, such as recent deaths, and other information.|$|E

5|$|The Highway70 {{designation}} {{was first}} used along the Heenan Highway, connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link to an area previously accessible only from the United States. In 1922, Kenora MPP Peter Heenan and Dr. McTaggart approached the government to <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> construction of a road between Nestor Falls and Kenora. Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in Mitch Hepburn's cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways held {{a celebration}} in 2009 {{to mark the}} increase in passenger numbers.
