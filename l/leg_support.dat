50|$|Suwari waza {{originated}} in the martial culture of the samurai who were expected to respond to various attackers from the seated position, with the implication that these codified techniques helped in the improvement of body stability, {{the maintenance of the}} Ki (the Japanese equivalent of the Chinese Qi), balance, and strengthening kokyu-ho (breathing power). The practice of techniques in suwari waza deprives the practitioners of the use of their legs while performing the same basic techniques they use while standing. It forces them to learn how to throw and take down an attacker using leverage, proper breathing, and hip action leading to sliding movements that compensate for the lack of <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> and strength. As the practitioner executing the move has to stay upright, suwari waza techniques differ from grappling moves in judo and forms of wrestling.|$|E

5000|$|The Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) was {{installed}} in the HRF-1 during Expedition 11. The SLAMMD measures the on-orbit mass of the crewmembers by applying Newton's second law of motion (force is equal to mass times acceleration). This device can measure a mass between 95 and 240 lb using the force generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer. Each spring {{is attached to a}} cam, which is also attached to a centrally located shaft with a flywheel mounted on top of it. The cam is designed such that, as the springs are stretched over a distance, a constant force is applied to the central shaft. A lanyard wrapped around the large flywheel is fed through a small slit on the SLAMMD front panel. The lanyard is latched onto the SLAMMD guiding arm, where the crewmember sits for a body mass measurement. Attached to the guiding arm is a <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> assembly around which the crew-member wraps his or her legs (as one would for a leg curl machine), a belly pad to help align the stomach, and a headrest.|$|E

INTRODUCTION: Tai Chi Chuan (TTC) is a Chinese traditional exercise form that has been popularly practiced for several centuries by Chinese people and also has been understood and practiced as an exercise form by Western people since last century. The practice of TCC was originally related to concerns about the physical fitness and capacity for self defence. However, over the centuries TCC has become far more focused on th...|$|E

40|$|DOI: [URL]   The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the trunk muscular {{response}} during different variations of some of the most popular stabilization exercises: front-bridge, back-bridge, side-bridge, and bird-dog. Surface electromyography was bilaterally re-corded from rectus abdominis, external and internal oblique and erector spinae during  25 variations of the aforementioned exercises. Compared to the conventional form of the front- and side-bridge, performing these exercises kneeling on a bench or with elbows extended reduced the muscular challenge. Conversely, performing the back-bridge with elbows extended elicited higher muscular activation than the conventional exercise.  While bridge exercises with double <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> produced the highest activation levels in those muscles that counteracted gravity, single <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> while bridging increased the activation of the trunk rotators, especially internal oblique. The highest activation levels were found in three exercises: sagittal walkout in a front-bridge position, rolling from right side-bridge into front-bridge position, and side-bridge with single <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> on a BOSUTMbalance trainer. Although the exercises performed on unstable surfaces usu-ally enhanced the muscle activation, performing the exercises on the BOSUTMbalance trainer did not always increase the trunk muscle activity. Overall, this information may be useful to guide fitness instructors and clinicians when establishing stabilization exercise progressions for the trunk musculature...|$|E
40|$|Background. Spasticity is {{prevalent}} and disabling {{in persons}} with multiple sclerosis (MS), {{and the development}} of the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale- 88 (MSSS- 88) provides an opportunity for examining the perceived impact of spasticity and its association with gait in this population. Purpose. This study examined the association between the perceived impact of spasticity and spatio-temporal parameters of gait in persons with MS. Methods. The sample included 44 adults with MS who completed the MSSS- 88 and 4 walking trials on a 26 -foot GAITRiteTM electronic walkway for measurement of spatio-temporal components of gait including velocity, cadence, base of support, step time, single support, double support, and swing phase. Results. The overall MSSS- 88 score was significantly associated with velocity (r = − 0. 371), cadence (r = − 0. 306), base of support (r = 0. 357), step time (r = 0. 305), single <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> (r = − 0. 388), double <b>leg</b> <b>support</b> (r = 0. 379), and swing phase (r = − 0. 386). Conclusions. The perceived impact of spasticity coincides with alterations of the spatio-temporal parameters of gait in MS. This indicates that subsequent interventions might target a decrease in spasticity or its perceived impact as an approach for improving mobility in MS...|$|E
