40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} dynamic {{stability}} and agility {{study of a}} pendulum-turn vehicle maneuver. Instead of optimizing the con-trolled inputs to mimic expert human driver performance, we focus on understanding the stability and agility performance of the ve-hicle motion using professional racing car driver testing data. We propose to use the rear side slip angle, rather than the vehicle mass center side slip angle, as one state variable to obtain the precise stable region. A hybrid physical/dynamic tire/road friction model is used to capture the dynamic friction force characteristics. We also introduce the use of vehicle <b>lateral</b> <b>jerk</b> and acceleration in-formation as the agility metrics to compare maneuvering perfor-mance under the racing car driver and a typical human driver. The analysis and testing results show that during the pendulum-turn maneuvers, the professional driver operates the vehicle outside the stable regions of the vehicle dynamics to achieve superior agilit...|$|E
40|$|Background: During lateral acceleration, the {{addition}} of an appropriate roll motion can improve comfort, but some combinations of lateral and roll motion increase motion sickness. Objectives: To determine how motion sickness caused by lateral oscillation fully compensated by roll oscillation (so subjects feel no lateral acceleration) depends on the frequency of oscillation and compare sickness with that caused by uncompensated lateral oscillation. Method: A total of 160 subjects (8 groups of 20) were exposed for 30 min to fully roll-compensated sinusoidal lateral oscillation at one of 8 frequencies (0. 05, 0. 08, 0. 125, 0. 16, 0. 20, 0. 315, 0. 5, 0. 8 Hz). A further 60 subjects (3 groups of 20) were exposed to lateral oscillation (at 0. 315, 0. 5, or 0. 8 Hz) to allow comparison of sickness with that caused by uncompensated lateral oscillation at frequencies not previously studied. Subjects rated symptoms at 1 -min intervals. Results: With fully roll-compensated lateral oscillation, illness ratings tended to increase with increasing frequency of oscillation from 0. 05 to 0. 2 Hz (with peak lateral velocity, ± 1. 0 m · s? 1) and tended to decrease from 0. 315 to 0. 8 Hz (with peak <b>lateral</b> <b>jerk,</b> ± 1. 96 m · s? 3). Roll compensation significantly reduced the duration before subjects developed nausea. Conclusions: Motion sickness is increased by roll oscillation used to compensate fully for low-frequency lateral oscillation. In general, when roll oscillation is combined with low-frequency lateral oscillation, motion sickness cannot be predicted from either the roll oscillation or the lateral oscillation alone. The dependence of motion sickness on the frequency of oscillation is broadly similar for pure lateral oscillation and 100 % roll-compensated lateral oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics for {{obstacle}} avoidance in a multi lane traffic environment are discussed. These dynamics {{are applied to}} a satisficing decision theory model to implement a systematic, saisficing decision process for warning, braking and changing lanes to avoid a collision. I. INTRODUCTION In a previous paper (1) we outlined a strategy for {{obstacle avoidance}} which made use of controlled <b>jerk</b> <b>lateral</b> and longitudinal maneuvers to just miss an obstacle. That analysis provided a means for optimally braking and swerving to maintain <b>lateral</b> acceleration and <b>jerk</b> below some preset levels. In a companion paper to this, we illustrate that using these methods, {{it is possible to}} apply higher levels of overall longitudinal acceleration levels with no degradation in user acceptance or perceived ride quality. Unfortunately, this approach is substantially idealized since in mixed traffic one must typically wait for a chance to change lanes. In addition we provided no means for determining what course of ac [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mastication {{has been}} studied by {{cinematography}} with synchronized electromyography (computer quantified and analyzed), while unanesthetized, freely feeding cats (Felis catus) were reducing equivalent-sized chunks of raw and cooked beef and cooked chicken. Cats reduce food on one side at a time, and their chewing cycles show both horizontal and anteroposterior deflections. Food objects are shifted {{from side to side}} by <b>lateral</b> <b>jerks</b> of the head and movements of the tongue. During the opening phase, the lower jaw is rotated relatively straight downward, and the digastric muscles are active in bilateral symmetry. Near the end of opening, the head jerks upward, both zygomaticomandibulares start to fire, and opening acceleration of the mandible decreases. Closing starts with horizontal displacement of the mandibular canines toward the working side, accompanied by asymmetrical activities from the working side deep temporalis and the balancing side medial pterygoid, as well as a downward jerk of the head. As closing proceeds, the mandibular canines remain near the working side and the working side zygomaticomandibularis and deep masseter are very active. Near the end of closing, the mandibular canine on the working side moves toward the midline, and adductors, digastrics, and lateral pterygoids of both sides are active. The adductors of the working side are generally more active than those of the balancing side. During a reduction sequence, the number and shape of the masticatory cycles, as well as movements of the head, during a reduction sequence are affected significantly by food type. As reduction proceeds, the duration of bite and the muscular activity (as characterized by number and amplitude of spikes) change significantly among muscles of the working and balancing sides. The adductors of the working side are generally most active when cats chew raw beef, less for cooked beef, and least for cooked chicken. In general, the adductor activity reflects food consistency, whereas that of the digastrics and lateral pterygoids reflects more the vertical and lateral displacements of the mandible. Statistical analysis documents that the methods of electrode insertion and test give repeatable results for particular sites in different animals. Thus, {{it should be possible to}} compare these results with those produced while other mammalas are masticating...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} work, two ADAS have been proposed, both based on optimal control and manoeuvre jerks as parameters for threat assessment. The first is named “Codriver”, {{and is a}} system for driver warning. The second {{is a sort of}} completion of the first, since it is designed for autonomous vehicle intervention if the driver does not react to the warnings. The Codriver has been developed by the Mechatronics Group of the University of Trento, which the author is part of, in the framework of the European Project “interactIVe”, to warn the driver for all-around threats safety. It has been then implemented on a real vehicle of Centro Ricerche Fiat, which has been widely tested {{at the end of the}} project. On the other hand, for the second system only the main components have been developed by the author during a research period at the University of Tokyo, Japan, and its application is restricted to autonomous obstacle avoidance. In particular, a motion planning algorithm has been used together with a control loop de- signed to execute the planned trajectories. Both systems exploit Optimal Control (OC) for motion planning: the Codriver uses OC to plan real-time ma- noeuvres with humanlike criteria, so that they can be compared to what the driver is doing in order to infer his/her intentions, and warn him if these are not safe; the second system uses OC instead to plan emergency manoeuvres, i. e. neglecting driver actuation limitations and pushing the vehicle towards its physical limits. The initial longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>jerks</b> of the planned manoeuvres are used by both the systems as parameters for risk assessment. Manoeuvre jerks are proportional to pedal and steering wheel velocities, and their initial values thus describe the entity of the correction needed by the driver to achieve a given goal. Since human drivers plan and act with minimum jerk criteria, and are jerk-limited, more and more severe manoeuvres at a given point are not reachable anymore by a human driver, since they require too high initial jerks: initial jerks can be thus considered proportional to the risk level of current situation. For this reason, when the manoeuvres to handle current scenario require jerks beyond a given threshold, the Codriver outputs a warning. This threshold must be lower than driver limits, so that he/she will be able to react to the warning and still have the chance to perform a safe manoeuvre. When the required jerks exceed drivers’ actuation limits, the risk level raises to an upper step, where driver warning would be not effective and autonomous vehicle intervention should be enabled. In obstacle avoidance scenarios, it was demonstrated during driving simulator tests that manoeuvre jerks are more robust parameters for risk assessment than for example time headways, since they are less affected by driver’s age and gender...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are living}} longer but {{morbidity}} has also increased; threatening to create a serious global burden. Our approach is to monitor gait for early warning signs of morbidity. Here we present highlights {{from a series of}} experiments into gait as a potential biomarker for Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD), ageing and fall risk. Using body-worn accelerometers, we developed several novel camera-less methods to analyze head and pelvis movements while walking. Signal processing algorithms were developed to extract gait parameters that represented the principal components of vigor, head <b>jerk,</b> <b>lateral</b> harmonic stability, and oscillation range. The new gait parameters were compared to accidental falls, mental state and co-morbidities. We observed: 1) People with PD had significantly larger and uncontrolled anterioposterior (AP) oscillations of the head; 2) Older people walked with more lateral head jerk; and, 3) the combination of vigorous and harmonically stable gait was demonstrated by non-fallers. Our findings agree with research from other groups; changes in human gait reflect changes to well-being. We observed; different aspects of gait reflected different functional outcomes. The new gait parameters therefore may be complementary to existing methods and may have potential as biomarkers for specific disorders. However, further research is required to validate our observations, and establish clinical utility...|$|R
40|$|The {{major goal}} of this master thesis is to improve truck safety and comfort during lane change manoeuvres. This thesis focuses on the {{scenario}} of the driver doing sports exercises inside the cabin when the vehicle is driving automatically on a highway. This topic {{is one of the}} foci of the international GlobalDrive project from Technical University of Munich, which aims at sports exercises inside highly automated driving truck cabin by 2030. Using a special chair, drivers are able to do different types of exercises in the cabin. However, the acceleration, deceleration and jerk of normal highly automated vehicles can hardly satisfy the safety and comfort requirements for sports exercises, especially during lane changes. It is very difficult for the driver to keep balance when the <b>lateral</b> or longitudinal <b>jerk</b> and acceleration reach a certain level. In order to provide a suitable environment for exercises, a multi-level control architecture has been designed to satisfy the safety and comfort requirements from an ergonomics aspect. The proposed control scheme {{will make it easier for}} the driver to keep balance. Prevention of rollover is included in the architecture, while a Cruise Control (CC) -Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) -Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) strategy is responsible for the longitudinal safety of the truck. Simulations in realistic and safety-critical scenarios show the effectiveness of the approach. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringDelft Center for Systems and Contro...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} is {{a rapidly}} expanding field, and promise {{to play an}} important role in society. In more isolated environments, vehicle automation can bring significant efficiency and production benefits and it eliminates repetitive jobs that can lead to inattention and accidents. The thesis addresses the problem of lateral and longitudinal dynamics control of autonomous ground vehicles with the purpose of accurate and smooth path following. Clothoids are used in the design of optimal predictive controllers aimed at minimizing the <b>lateral</b> forces and <b>jerks</b> in the vehicle. First, a clothoid-based path sparsification algorithm is proposed to efficiently describe the reference path. This approach relies on a sparseness regularization technique such that a minimal number of clothoids is used to describe the reference path. Second, a clothoid-based model predictive controller (MPCC) is proposed. This controller aims at producing a smooth driving by taking advantage of the clothoid properties.   Third, we formulate the problem as an economic model predictive controller (EMPC). In EMPC the objective function contains an economic cost (here represented by comfort or smoothness), which is described by the second and first derivatives of the curvature.   Fourth, the generation of feasible speed profiles, and the longitudinal vehicle control for following these, is studied. The speed profile generation is formulated as an optimization problem with two contradictory objectives: to drive as fast as possible while accelerating as little as possible. The longitudinal controller is formulated in a similar way, but in a receding horizon fashion. The experimental evaluation with the EMPC demonstrates its good performance, since the deviation from the path never exceeds 30 cm and in average is 6 cm. In simulation, the EMPC and the MPCC are compared with a pure-pursuit controller (PPC) and a standard MPC. The EMPC clearly outperforms the PPC in terms of path accuracy and the standard MPC in terms of driving smoothness. QC 20160503 iQMati...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} low-floor trams which {{appeared}} during the recent decades brought up {{a variety of different}} solutions in vehicle design. Usually the operators preferred the 100 % low-floor vehicles, paying particular respect to disabled passengers. These trams have a constant floor height of not more than 350 mm throughout the whole vehicle. An indispensable precondition for this is to abandon the wheelsets and the principle of placing the drive motors between the wheels. Thus all according vehicle designs have independent wheels instead of the previously used conventional wheelsets. Moreover, the 100 % low-floor design reduces drastically the maximal yaw angle of the bogies. In order to allow appropriate yaw movements within the vehicles, the carbodies had to be split into a number of articulated sections, with the motor and trailer bogies nearly fixed to them. In consequence the different drivetrain solutions became numerous. This thesis analyses and compares characteristic designs of multi-articulated trams that have been acquired by a large number of tram operators: the Combino and Variobahn design. In addition the 70 % low-floor, conventional motor bogie-based tram type Cologne is analysed, which has also been acquired in large numbers. The analyses were mainly performed by means of multibody simulation and were focused on• the running behaviour in tangent track,• the permissibility of the current track design regulations with regard to the derailment safety, and• the passenger comfort in curve entry transitions. For the latter analysis a general distinction was made between two design variants: on the one hand the curve entry for tracks within the street, without transition and superelevation ramp, {{and on the other hand}} the curve entry for autonomous tracks with curve transition and superelevation ramp. The results showed that the running behaviour in tangent track is satisfactory for all vehicles, and there is no increase in the derailment risk, either. However, the analyses showed also that each of the vehicles exceeds the jerk limits defined by the according VDV regulation. It could also be shown that there is an inadequacy in the regulation criterion for the comfort in curve transitions. The latest operational and biomechanical experience demonstrates that the main comfort criterion is not the jerk but rather the frequency of the lateral oscillations, the mean lateral acceleration – considered over a period of 2 s – and the product of the lateral acceleration in the curve at the moment of maximal jerk and the reaction time of the passengers. The consequences which are relevant for the running dynamics are:• The current track design regulations can be retained without exceptions, as long as the vehicle concept and the bogie design are appropriate. • The operators’ guidelines concerning door arrangement and vehicle capacity must not have negative influences on the running dynamics, the derailment safety and the comfort of passengers and staff. • When the choice of the curve radius is restricted by existing buildings then the track design parameters must be chosen in a way that the running safety is not endangered in any operational condition. • The definition of limit values for <b>lateral</b> acceleration, <b>jerk</b> and permissible human exposure to mechanical vibrations should be brought to a safe basis by means of multidisciplinary discussions with experts in medicine, biomechanics, physiology and vehicle design...|$|R
