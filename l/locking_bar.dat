50|$|At 11.5 lb, the M192 is 6.5 lb {{lighter than}} its predecessor. Unlike the M122, its rear legs are {{independently}} movable {{and stored in}} a forward position. Because of this design, {{there is no need}} for a <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> connecting the two legs.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before this}} generational change, a <b>Lock</b> <b>Bar</b> Stabilizer (or LBS) {{was added to}} prevent 'hyperextension' of the {{titanium}} <b>lock</b> <b>bar.</b> While this change is {{commonly referred to as}} part of the second generation Umnumzaan, there are a few models made in early-mid 2012 which have both the old pivot brushing and the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> stabilizer, although these are relatively rare.|$|R
25|$|To {{release the}} lock, the user presses the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> {{back toward the}} handle side, at which time the blade is free to close. In the closed {{position}} the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> (leaf spring) rests alongside the handle and the blade.|$|R
50|$|Lock 45 - A {{folding knife}} lock, formed by a <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> with {{recesses}} containing 45 degree angles mating with {{the rear of}} the blade. The <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> / blade interface serves as both the blade stop and the lock mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{lack of a}} <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> on many Weaver-type {{accessories}} also lends {{to another}} alignment issue: Canting. Though this problem is not common {{it can be very}} problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel and to ensure the cross hairs sit exactly where a bullet will go (POI), a small variation of even ¼ of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> holds the mount in a perfect 90 degree to the rail system where as a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. This canting (sometimes called jamming of surfaces) is caused by not matching the clamping surface perfectly to the rail. When tightened down, stress exerted on the base can cause the scope to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100-200 yards and gets progressively worse the farther out the range goes. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount.|$|E
50|$|The Lock Back Safety mechanism, also {{invented by}} Ron Lake, {{is similar in}} {{function}} to the LAWKS mechanism. It is a lockback folder with a switch that can prevent the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> from being depressed. Inside the handle {{there is a small}} rod with a flange near the butt of the handle. The other end is connected to a switch near the pivot end. When the switch is pulled back (away from the pivot) the lock functions as a regular lockback. When the switch is closed the flange on the rod slides under tip of the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> at the butt end. This prevents the depression of the bar and the blade from unlocking. When the knife is closed the system functions the same way to lock it closed or allow it to open.|$|E
50|$|The LINC keyboard, {{manufactured}} by company named Soroban Engineering, had a unique locking solenoid. The internal mechanism of each key had a slot that {{worked with a}} set of bars to encode the character and another slot that caught a <b>locking</b> <b>bar,</b> which locked all the keys in one mechanical movement of the locking solenoid.|$|E
50|$|To {{release the}} lock, the user presses the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> {{back toward the}} handle side, at which time the blade is free to close. In the closed {{position}} the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> (leaf spring) rests alongside the handle and the blade.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic ball {{integrated}} into integral <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> - Also introduced as a {{feature in the}} Umnumzaan, the ceramic ball embedded into {{the end of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>bar,</b> creating the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm surface. The ball doubles to drop into a mating detent on the blade to ensure that the blade does not open accidentally.|$|R
2500|$|Since the 2008 introduction, the Umnumzaan {{has seen}} several {{incremental}} improvements and one generational change. These changes {{have all been}} minor and very few visual changes have occurred since initial introduction. Around 2011, changes to the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> were made to make engaging the lock with one hand easier (through making the bottom portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> slightly more flared, which was a common request voiced by owners on various knife forums).|$|R
5000|$|Sendai Isho-dansu: They {{were used}} {{primarily}} for out-of-season clothing storage. The finest examples had open-grain Keyaki for the face wood with Sugi for the case. They {{are characterized by}} a long top drawer with an elaborated urajyo (double-action lock) or a long vertical <b>locking</b> <b>bar.</b> Chests from Sendai were respected for their finely rendered iron hardware, commissioned from former sword fitting craftsmen.|$|E
50|$|The {{receiver}} {{portion of}} the action features integrally milled bases to facilitate accurate and stable scope mount installation. The streamlined bolt sleeves contain a <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> mechanism to prevent accidental rotation when the bolt {{is removed from the}} receiver. DuBiel rifles were balanced for handling ease - the result of “total concept design”. Distinctive lever latches complement the floor plates (button releases were optional). DuBiel stock designs closely parallel the bore axis to reduce the effect of recoil.|$|E
50|$|The Second Model 26.5 {{differed}} {{in that it}} used a long, thick metal <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> with a turned-down bolt-handle, like the metal bolt on a bolt-action rifle, which locked into a recess machined into the frame. This slid through a round sleeve atop each half of the weapon to secure the two halves. When the bolt was unlatched and pulled to the rear, the back-plate was turned to the operator's right using the rear grip, allowing access to the cylinder. The operator could then pull out the spent shells and reload fresh ones.|$|E

50|$|Patented in 1912, the lockrod {{was first}} used to secure {{railroad}} boxcar doors. Today, sometimes confused with <b>locking</b> <b>bars</b> or <b>bar</b> <b>locks,</b> lockrods have evolved to secure virtually every trailer or container that has a swing door (a door that swings open and closed rather than rolls up). Roll up doors are sometimes used in place of swing doors on some trailers that make shorter haul deliveries.|$|R
5000|$|In 1885 the Victorian Government {{decided to}} change the Melbourne water supply pipes from wrought iron to cast iron. Ferguson won the {{contracts}} to supply the new pipe. To enable this expansion he bought the Glasgow Iron works in West Melbourne. With the Carlton Foundry, Ferguson now employed over 300 people. He soon after established a new foundry in Footscray.Ferguson gained international attention by winning the contract to supply 530 km (360 mi) of 760 mm (30 in) steel main for the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. The pipes used Ferguson's patented rivetless pipe or <b>locking</b> <b>bar,</b> the design of which improved the water flow. A stylised drawing of the design is now used to indicate places of interest along the pipeline.|$|E
5000|$|Three signalmen {{were present}} in the signalbox, the enquiry found that one of them had pulled the wrong lever; he had {{intended}} to set the points for the incoming train but instead set the points ahead of the Scarborough. Locking bars should have prevented these points from being changed as the signal ahead of the Scarborough was set to clear. Unfortunately one of the other signalmen was setting the signals behind the Scarborough train to danger, in contravention of the rules this was done whilst the train was still passing. This therefore disengaged the <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> on the points for a few seconds before the Scarborough train reached it, allowing them to be changed by the application of the wrong lever. A combination of these two failings led to the disaster.|$|E
50|$|Passengers are {{restrained}} by a shoulder harness, {{as well as}} a secondary <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> across their laps. Compressed air is used to actuate the shoulder harness, with a fail-safe mechanism which engages the shoulder harness in the event of power failure. The loss of compressed air also causes the shoulder harnesses to engage. In addition, the gondola's sides and roof are made up of closely spaced metal bars, allowing riders to see the world outside, while preventing anyone from falling out while the ride is in motion. Like most ride safety measures, these are only effective if safety and height restrictions are enforced. To date, the only deaths or severe injuries caused on a kamikaze ride have been caused by a failure to follow the height restrictions, or complacency {{on the part of the}} operator or deck personnel. Most carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks require riders to be at least 48 inches (122 cm) or taller.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{investigation}} and litigation {{established that the}} derailment was caused by an undetected, fractured heel block in a switch. The fracture then propagated through several bolt holes. A contributing factor was a <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> that had been missing for approximately a year.|$|R
50|$|A Tantalus {{is a type}} {{of drinks}} {{decanter}} stand in which the bottle stoppers are clamped down by a <b>locked</b> <b>bar,</b> as a means of preventing servants from stealing the master's liquor. The decanters are clearly visible but the liquor is out of reach.|$|R
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar,</b> milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium <b>lock</b> <b>bar</b> comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|R
50|$|Prior to this hammerless technology, rifles {{were fixed}} with an exposed firing hammer {{and at times}} would be {{dangerous}} to the operator. Rifles without this hammerless technology could be cocked and accidentally discharge while the breech was opened. The fear from gun owners of these accidental discharges were well deserved, and even applied to the earliest models of hammerless weapons. Hammerless weapons were initially accepted with some hesitation, because the hammerless guns were manufactured with a <b>locking</b> <b>bar,</b> which secures the trigger only and not the firing hammer. Hammerless weapons, such as the Climax Safety Hammerless Gun, was manufactured with a locking mechanism that locked the trigger and featured a strong block that would move {{in front of the}} weapon’s firing hammer while being reloaded. The hammerless Repeating Rifle produced by Savage Arms in 1895 was coined the “Model 1895 Rifle” and drastically improved the standard lever-action rifle of the time period. This weapon was similar to the Climax Hammerless Gun in design, but was manufactured in mass quantities for commercialization.|$|E
5000|$|The rifle had {{a simple}} folding {{backsight}} {{with the standard}} large lock mechanism (initially marked 'Tower' and 'G.R.' under a Crown; later ones after the battle of Waterloo had 'Enfield'), with a swan-neck cock as fitted to the 'Brown Bess.' Like the German Jäger rifles, it had a scrolled brass trigger guard to help ensure a firm grip and a raised cheek-piece on the left-hand side of the butt. The stocks were made of walnut and held the barrel with three flat captive wedges. The rifle also had a metal <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> to accommodate a 24-inch sword bayonet, {{similar to that of}} the Jäger rifle. The Baker was 45 inches from muzzle to butt, 12 inches shorter than the Infantry Musket, and weighed almost nine pounds. Although Infantry Muskets were not issued with cleaning kits, the Baker rifle had a cleaning kit, greased linen patches and tools, stored in the 'butt-trap' or patchbox; the lid of this was brass, and hinged at the rear so it could be flipped up. It was needed because, without regular cleaning, gunpowder fouling built up in the rifling grooves, and the weapon became much slower to load and less accurate.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{military}} {{continues to}} use small containers, strongly reminiscent of their Transporter and Conex boxes of the 1950s and 1960s. These either comply with ISO standard dimensions, or are a direct derivative thereof. Current terminology of the United States armed forces calls these small containers Bicon, Tricon and Quadcon, which correspond with ISO 668 standard sizes 1D, 1E and 1F respectively. This {{comes down to}} containers of 8 ft height, and with a footprint size either one half (Bicon), one third (Tricon) or one quarter (Quadcon) {{the size of a}} standard 20-foot, one TEU container.At a nominal length of 10 ft, two Bicons coupled together lengthwise match one 20-foot ISO container, but their height is 6 in shy of the more commonly available 10-foot ISO containers of so-called standard height, which are 8 ft tall. Tricons and Quadcons however have to be coupled transversely — either three or four in a row — to be stackable with twenty foot containers. Their length of 8 ft corresponds to the width of a standard 20-foot container, which is why there are forklift pockets at their ends, {{as well as in the}} sides of these boxes, and the doors only have one <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> each. The smallest of these, the Quadcon, exists in two heights: 96 in or 82 in. Only the first conforms to ISO-668 standard dimensions (size 1F).|$|E
50|$|Levers work points (aka switch) {{by means}} of cast iron rods and signals {{by means of}} metal cables, the frame itself is very {{complicated}} in that it employs a series of horizontal moving <b>locking</b> <b>bars</b> in order to interlock different levers making it impossible to, for instance, signal a train to run over a point set the wrong way.|$|R

50|$|The long {{wheelbase}} {{meant that the}} facing point <b>locking</b> <b>bars</b> on the line had to be lengthened. It went into service in April or May 1907, and the rail motor gradually took {{up the majority of}} the passenger traffic, and by July 1907 was working the ordinary passenger trains four days per week, at a daily saving of £3 6s 6d.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is the shear {{capacity}} of in-situ cast joints between precast concrete panels. Current practice with vertical lowering of the wall panels experiences difficulties in the assembly phase, since the traditional U-bar connection requires an overlap in a horizontal plane to allow for the mounting of a vertical <b>locking</b> <b>bar.</b> Where limited space is available bending and subsequent straightening of the U-bars are required to assemble the adjacent panels, a procedure which imposes substantial ductility requirements on the reinforcement as well as some manual workload. This paper introduces a construction-friendly design with U-bars overlapping in the same plane as the panel itself. The design allows for a trouble-free vertical lowering of the panels without pre or post processing of the preinstalled reinforcement loops. Furthermore, an overall more ductile behavior of the joint is obtained. The solution is tested in a push-off experimental setup and the influence of important geometric parameters of the keyed shear joint is investigated. The first peak load carrying capacity is assessed using plasticity models, and the failure modes are identified by the use of digital image correlation. The upper bound models produce satisfactory results capturing the experimental tendencies and predicting the mode of shear failure in the shear keys...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two {{canisters}} (10 prime and 12 backup candidates) in the K West Basin {{have been}} identified as containing fuel which, when examined, will satisfy the Data Quality Objectives for the first fuel shipment from this basin. These were chosen as meeting criteria such as containing relatively long fuel elements, <b>locking</b> <b>bar</b> integrity, and the availability of gas/liquid interface level measurements for associated canister gas traps. Two canisters were identified as having reported broken fuel on initial loading. Usage and interpretation of canister cesium concentration measurements have also been established and levels of maximum and minimum acceptable cesium concentration (from a data optimization point of view) for decapping have been determined although other operational cesium limits may also apply. Criteria for picking particular elements, once a canister is opened, are reviewed in this document. A pristine, a slightly damaged, and a badly damaged element are desired. The latter includes elements with end caps removed but does not include elements which have large amounts of swelling or split cladding that might interfere with handling tools. Finally, operational scenarios have been suggested to aid in the selections of canisters and elements in a way that utilizes anticipated canister gas sampling and leads to a correct and quick choice of elements which will supply the desired data...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} shield the indoor {{environment}} from the exterior most building components are assembled out of several layers of materials to meet different performance requirements (watertightness, airtightness, thermal resistance, stability etc). In that regard windows and doors are usually the weak spot of the building {{because it is a}} transition from the building component to the glass where all the different materials and functions are literally forced together. On top we want them to open and close, so that interface becomes even more crucial and we need to use somewhat exotic fabrics to rise up to the challenge (the bill will rise accordingly). This research area is much too often left to the industry. Pressure equalisation is the basic principle where windows and doors derive their performance from, but how can this be realised, and what are the main parameters that influence it? As in walls and roofs we can distinguish different elements in the window casement that will fulfil those needs and influence the performance: the section, joggles, gaskets and fittings (handle, gearbox, <b>locking</b> <b>bar,</b> corner pivot, stay, hinges…). Using high frequency measuring equipment the influence of the different elements is examined in both dry as well as rainy conditions during static and dynamic pressure differences. The pressure equalisation in the chamber is depending on the collaboration of the profile and the gaskets, the design of the vents and drainage holes, and the fine-tuning of the fittings...|$|E
