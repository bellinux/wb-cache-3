30|$|Brazil {{provides}} a good case study for better understanding the complex interactions between the gender earnings gap, firm characteristics, and job mobility. The earnings gap in Brazil has narrowed over the past 30 years. This {{is due in part}} to increased access to education for females (Arabsheibani et al. 2003; Garcia et al. 2009) and female entry into traditionally male occupations (Madalozzo 2009). The gap persists, however, with some evidence of continued discrimination against female workers (Loureiro et al. 2004; Arbache and Loureiro 2012). The large <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>females</b> in the informal sector is additionally problematic, as informal workers experience longer spells of poverty, higher structural deprivation, and a higher degree of exposure to shocks (Machado et al. 2007). Related to mobility is the finding that informal female workers face more transitory poverty (Ibid.).|$|R

The goal was to explore the factors that are believed to influence male achievement present at the primary school level. Some of the factors include personal perception, parental involvement, teaching style, the structure of schools, lack of male role models and socio-economic factors. Structured interviewing techniques were used to gather data from a sample of Bahamian males from grades 3, 4 and 5, their parents and teachers. Results indicate male students have {{a positive attitude toward}} school and report encouragement and support from their families. Teachers tended to have a discrepant view of parental involvement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was {{to shed light on}} the {{existing}} gap is scholarly literature, thus exploring the possibility of crime media creating inaccurate and potentially detrimental social constructions of crime, victims, offenders and enforcers. The 2015 - 2016 seasons of popular CBS dramas, CSI and CM, were analysed using a thematic content analysis. This analysis was compared to Canadian and US statistics to determine if television crime media inaccurately portrays crime and if so, to what extent. To provide further insight on the possibility of crime media influencing public perceptions of crime, in person interviews were conducted with attention given to educational background of participants as a possible influence. Findings revealed that CSI and CM do present inaccurate portrayals of crime and when compared to interview responses, likely social constructions and cultural understandings of crime emerged. Inaccurate representations in crime media consisted of: an <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> victims, highly intelligent offenders, superhero enforcers, and <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> violent crime. Interview responses found that: DNA evidence was highly favoured as a form of conviction, participants do not fear crime but assumed violent crime when discussing victimization, and offenders are only successful if intelligent. The answers given between those academically educated in criminology and those who were not were quite similar, thus favouring a media criminology theoretical framework. This study is necessary because if crime media influences public perceptions of crime the impact on the criminal justice system is likely to be immense...|$|R
40|$|The World Health Organisation {{predicts that}} by 2020 {{depression}} {{will be the}} second highest cause of death and disability in the world (World Health Organisation, 2010). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{have been found to}} be the most suitable antidepressant for first-line treatment of a mood disorder (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2004), but less than half of all individuals achieve complete remission after therapy with a single antidepressant. Others display partial or intolerant responses to treatment (Nemeroff & Owens, 2002). This emphasises a need to develop alternative treatment options. There is evidence that micronutrients have fewer side effects than antidepressants (Dalmiya, Darnton-Hill, Schyltink & Shrimpton, 2009). Kaplan, Crawford, Field and Simpson (2007) suggest that errors in metabolism may result in unstable mood, leading to possible mood disorders. Mutation of metabolism is correctable by giving the malnourished individual additional vitamins thereby correcting metabolism and creating a more stable mood. An online survey completed by 661 participants (141 males, 520 females) assessed acceptance levels towards the use of micronutrients as an alternative treatment for mood disorders. As predicted, healthcare and medical professionals scored lower in acceptance (t(659) = 3. 12, p= 0. 002) and people who lead healthy lifestyles scored higher in acceptance (r= 0. 105, n= 658, p < 0. 05). There were no significant effects of gender (t(659) = 1. 74, p= 0. 082), experience with mood disorders (F(3, 657) = 0. 86, p= 0. 46) or low household incomes (r=- 0. 066, n= 661, p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: the {{internet}} provides a research opportunity for psychiatry and psychology. This article presents {{the development and}} preliminary data of a large web-survey created to study how temperament relates to other psychological measures, behavior and psychiatric disorders. Methods: We used the Affective and Emotional Composite Temperament Scale (AFECTS) to evaluate temperament and we selected several self-report instruments to evaluate behavior, psychological constructs and mental disorders. the system provides anonymous psychological (phase 1) and psychiatric (phase 2) feedback and includes questions to assess {{the validity of the}} answers. Each phase has around 450 questions. This system was broadcast utilizing Brazilian media. Results: After the exclusion of 21. 5 % of the volunteers (those who failed the validation questions), 41, 427 participants concluded {{the first part of the}} system (mean age = 31. 2 +/- 10. 5 yrs, 26. 9 % males), and 21, 836 (mean age = 32. 5 +/- 10. 9 yrs, 25. 1 % males) completed phase 2. Around 25 % have received a psychiatric diagnosis from a mental health professional. Demographic and temperament profiles of those who completed either only 80 questions, only phase 1, or the whole system were similar. the rate of non-serious answers (e. g. on bizarre behaviors) was very low and congruency of answers was very high. the internal consistency of classical trait scales (TCI-R and PANAS) was high (Cronbach's alpha > 0. 80) for all dimensions. Limitations: Relatively high dropout rate due to the length of the process and an <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>female,</b> young and well-educated subjects.

We {{have studied the}} magnitude of the sex-bound risk of GCA and whether this risk is an independent risk factor for GCA or whether it is related to the risks that are mediated by age and AG. The observed frequencies <b>of</b> males and <b>females</b> in different age groups, and in presence or absence of AG, among 532 GCA patients (273 cases of intestinal (IGCA) and 259 cases of diffuse (DGCA) type) were compared with the expected frequencies which were calculated by applying the data of age-specific distributions of the sexes and AG in the general population. A significant 1. 6 -fold <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> males and 0. 6 -fold underrepresentation <b>of</b> <b>females</b> were seen in IGCA but not in DGCA. The <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the male sex and the underrepresentation <b>of</b> the <b>female</b> sex in IGCA were independent of age of the patient and location of the tumour in the stomach.

40|$|Background: Improvements in cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) treatment {{over the last}} two decades have brought large increases in life expectancy. As a result, researchers have become more interested in the long-term quality of life and psychological wellbeing of adults with CF. Introduction of segregation policies to prevent cross-infection have added a new dimension to life with CF; patients are discouraged from meeting face-to-face and this impacts on access to peer support. Systematic review: A systematic search of the published literature since 1990 identified 10 journal articles describing research with adolescents and adults with CF, their mental health needs and social support or functioning. Quantitative papers indicated an inverse relationship between mental health and social support or social functioning. Objectives: The internet has become increasingly used for social networking and accessing social support resources. This thesis aimed to explore the psychological wellbeing of adults with CF who make use of online social support and the themes emerging within online discussion forums. Method: Study 1 is a quantitative survey carried out online which assesses the quality of life, mental health and self-esteem of 74 adults with CF. Study 2 uses framework analysis to provide a qualitative exploration of posts made by participants on an online discussion forum. Results: Moderate levels of quality of life and comparably high levels of self-esteem were found. Thirty per cent of the sample population scored above threshold for clinical levels of mental health difficulty. Significant correlations indicated that poorer self-esteem was associated with poorer quality of life and greater mental health difficulty. Six themes emerged from the discussion forum posts including CF treatment, daily living and occupation, health exacerbations, psychosocial processes and issues and the future. Conclusions: Self-esteem and mental health scores were similar to previous research. However, quality of life was noted to be considerably lower when compared to other research samples. This was thought to be influenced by the <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>females</b> in the current sample but may also be reflective of the group of people with CF who make use of online resources. Results are discussed in relation to clinical implications, limitations and directions for future research, including the efficacy of internet groups in improving wellbeing and consideration of possible developments in technology to promote socialisation in the CF population.

40|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) {{is caused}} by antibodies against a "self" protein-platelet factor 4 -bound to heparin. We observed an <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>female</b> gender in 290 patients who developed HIT after cardiac or orthopedic surgery compared with the representation found in national databases (study 1). Therefore, we investigated gender imbalance in HIT by logistic regression analysis of a randomized controlled trial of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (study 2), and we analyzed individual patient data from 7 prospective studies comparing HIT frequency between UFH and LMWH, evaluating effects of gender, heparin (UFH vs LMWH), and patient type (surgical vs medical) (study 3). All 3 studies showed female overrepresentation, which for study 3 was a common odds ratio (OR) of 2. 37 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 37 - 4. 09; P = 3 D. 0015). Study 3 also showed an interaction between gender, heparin, and patient type. Although UFH was more likely than LMWH to cause HIT (P <. 0001), this effect was predominantly seen in women compared with men (common OR, 9. 22 vs 1. 83; P = 3 D. 020) and in surgical patients compared with medical patients (common OR, 13. 93 vs 1. 75; P = 3 D. 005).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:While some {{medicinal}} {{drugs have}} been found to affect driving ability, no study has investigated whether a relationship exists between these medicines and crashes involving pedestrians. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the association between the use of medicinal drugs and the risk of being involved in a road traffic crash as a pedestrian. METHODS AND FINDINGS:Data from 3 French nationwide databases were matched. We used the case-crossover design to control for time-invariant factors by using each case as its own control. To perform multivariable analysis and limit false-positive results, we implemented a bootstrap version of Lasso. To avoid the effect of unmeasured time-varying factors, we varied the length of the washout period from 30 to 119 days before the crash. The matching procedure led to the inclusion of 16, 458 pedestrians involved in an injurious road traffic crash from 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2011. We found 48 medicine classes with a positive association with the risk of crash, with median odds ratios ranging from 1. 12 to 2. 98. Among these, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs, antihistamines, and anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs were among the 10 medicines most consumed by the 16, 458 pedestrians. Study <b>limitations</b> included slight <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> pedestrians injured in more severe crashes, lack of information about self-medication and the use of over-the-counter drugs, and lack of data on amount of walking. CONCLUSIONS:Therapeutic classes already identified as impacting the ability to drive, such as benzodiazepines and antihistamines, are also associated with an increased risk of pedestrians being involved in a road traffic crash.

40|$|Introduction: Substance use is an {{important}} risk factor for HIV, with both concentrated in certain vulnerable and marginalized populations. Although their management differs, there may be opportunities to integrate services for substance use and HIV. In this paper we systematically review evidence from studies that sought to integrate care for people living with HIV and substance use problems. Methods: Studies were included if they evaluated service integration for substance use and HIV. We searched multiple databases from inception until October 2015. Articles were screened independently by two reviewers and assessed for risk of bias. Results and discussion: 11, 057 records were identified, with 7616 after removal of duplicates. After screening titles and abstracts, 51  met the inclusion criteria. Integration models were categorized by location (HIV, substance use and other facilities), level of integration from mirco (integrated care delivered to individuals) to macro (system level integrations) and degree of integration from least (screening and counselling only) to most (care for HIV, substance use and/or other illnesses at the same facility). Most reported descriptive or cohort studies; in four randomized control trials integrated activities improved patient outcomes. There is potential for integrating services at all facility types, including mobile health services. While services offering screening only can achieve synergies, there are benefits from delivering integrated treatment for HIV and substance use, including ease of referral to other mental health and social services. Conclusions: Our review used {{a wide range of}} databases and conference archives to increase representation of papers from low- and middle-income countries. <b>Limitations</b> include the <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> studies from the United States, and the descriptive nature of the majority of papers.

40|$|Background: IBS is {{the most}} common {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorders and affects approximately 10 - 20 % of the general population and is widespread in all societies and socio-economic groups. Although the disorder does not have a life-threatening course, it still seriously affects the patients in their everyday life. Aim: The general aims of this thesis were to estimate the occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome in the general population and to achieve a better understanding of present treatment of this disorder and impact on every-day life in those suffering from IBS. Material and methods: The LIPS study comprises two parts. Part I was a retrospective register study where the data collection was based on computerised medical records at three selected Primary Health Care centres in a defined region. Part II was a population based case-control study. The identified IBS cases from part I constitute the cases, while their control groups were randomly selected from the population census register in the same area as the cases. Data in part II were collected by means of a postal questionnaire to cases and controls. The study was conducted in Linköping, a city located in the south-east of Sweden with 135 000 inhabitants. Results: The female IBS patients reported lower influence on planning their work and working hours as well as fewer opportunities to learn new things at their work compared to their controls, even after adjustments in multiple logistic regressions for potential confounders like; mood, sleeping problems and perceived health. The female IBS patients had considerably lower HRQOL in all dimensions compared to their controls, even when compared to male patients. Younger female IBS cases (18 - 44 years) reported lower mental health on the SF- 36 scale than the older IBS female cases (p= 0. 015). In the multivariate analysis these variables, lack of influence on planning the work, family history of IBS, anxiety and sleeping disturbance displayed an association with being diagnosed with IBS in women. In men, lack of influence on working pace, family history of IBS was associated with an IBS diagnosis. The consultation incidence of IBS in part I was 3. 4 (95 % CI 3. 20 - 3. 70) per 1000 person-years for all IBS cases, among females; the incidence rate was 4. 6 per 1000 person-years (95 % CI 4. 16 - 4. 97) and males; 2. 3 per 1000 person-years (95 % CI 2. 01 - 2. 59). The dominating pharmacological treatment prescribed for abdominal complaints were fibre and bulking laxatives agents as well as acid suppressive drugs. These variables had an independent impact on the probability of a follow-up consultation; diagnosed co-morbidity besides the IBS diagnosis, rectoscopy ordered and laboratory tests ordered. Conclusions: IBS patients identified in primary care are significantly affected in their working-life compared to individuals in the general population. Especially female IBS-patients report lower decision latitude at work and they also appear to have a particularly impaired psychosocial functioning in their every day life and impaired HRQOL. Factors associated with IBS diagnosis among females are anxiety as well as family history of IBS and lack of co-determination at work. The incidence rate of IBS was 3. 4 per 1000 person-years which increased with age and with an <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>females.</b> IBS patients {{did not appear to be}} heavy utilisers of primary care and those who attended were treated by their GP without further consultation.

40|$|Stripe rearing, the {{restriction}} of visual experience to contours {{of only one}} orientation, leads to an <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the experienced orientation among neurons in the visual cortex. It is unclear, however, how these changes are brought about. Are they caused by silencing of neurons tuned to non-experienced orientations, or do some neurons change their preferred orientation? To address this question, we stripe-reared juvenile mice using cylinder lens goggles. Following stripe rearing, the orientation preference of cortical neurons was determined with two-photon calcium imaging. This allowed us to sample all neurons in a given field of view, including the non-responsive ones, thus overcoming a fundamental limitation of extracellular electrophysiological recordings. Stripe rearing for 3 weeks resulted in a clear <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the experienced orientation in cortical layer 2 / 3. Closer inspection revealed that the stripe rearing effect changed with depth in cortex: The fraction of responsive neurons decreased in upper layer 2 / 3, but changed very little deeper in this layer. At the same time, the <b>overrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the experienced orientation was strongest in lower layer 2 / 3. Thus, diverse mechanisms contribute to the overall stripe rearing effect, but for neurons in lower layer 2 / 3 the effect is mediated by an instructive mechanism, which alters the orientation tuning of individual neurons...|$|R
