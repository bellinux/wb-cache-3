Included in the book are such chilling and humorous stories as [...] "The Vanishing Hitchhiker," [...] "The Economical Car," [...] "The Ghost Airliner," [...] The Girl with the Beehive Hairdo," [...] "The Solid Cement Cadillac," [...] and [...] "The Killer in the Back Seat." [...] Brunvand's approach, according to reviewer Janet L.

[...] Some of these stories previously appeared in an article Brunvand wrote for the June 1980 issue of Psychology Today. As with Heard About the Solid Cement Cadillac or the Nude in the Camper?, Brunvand categorizes the different legends included in The Vanishing Hitchhiker into classic urban <b>legend</b> <b>types.</b> For each <b>legend</b> <b>type,</b> Brunvand offers samples that show variations on the legends themselves, historical evidence of how the legend may have originated (often with European or East Asian roots), and an explanation of what the legend might mean in an urban or modern context.|$|R

We analyzed traditional usability metrics and participants’ eye movements to identify the possible reasons behind their success and failure in the experimental tasks. Surprisingly, an overwhelming majority of the participants failed to arrive at the correct responses for two of the four tasks, irrespective of the legend design.

40|$|The study gives {{a survey}} of the history of {{research}} on the <b>legend</b> <b>type</b> mentioned in the title, in Hungary and abroad, and makes the reader acquainted with the newly published Hungarian texts and theories. Towards the end of the 19 th century comparative philology possessed a great number of data about the dualistic legend of the creation of the earth. Dragomanov's monograph (based on Veselovskii's and others thorough exploratory work to some extent, itself a synopsis) appeared and was extended in the other great comprehensive study of the century, Dähnhardt's Natursagen. The problematic issues in the research have been the written sources. The sacred books of the Bogomils do not draw up the dualistic creation legend of the earth in the form it is known from the folklore: the only apocryphal document that actually contains that form is the one titled Svitok božestvennyx knig [Bundle of Divine Books], or O Tiveriadskom more [About the Tiberian Sea] - but it can be found under different titles as well. In the last years a debate about its origin has formed. Likewise, in case of the Hungarian texts we could just ignore the problem of when and where they came from: they simply exist, are rich in variations, beautiful and a part of Hungarian culture. And yet, Hungarian researchers are constantly intrigued by this question; what sort of culture did we have of our own {{at the time of the}} conquest, what is the link that connects us to our relatives? The creation legend of the earth cannot be examined as an independent typological unit. The Slavic apocrypha remain the basis for further research; the texts are supplemented with two important elements. First of all the whale-motive requires further elaboration, then the story of the creation of mankind and the Noah-legends require more comprehensive examinations. All the more so since Hungarian folklore, with the new results of research, presents an unbelievably rich collection of this kind of material. The myth of the creation of the earth is an organically integrated element of the system of dualistic creation-legends in Hungarian folklore. Its variability indicates that, in spite of the individual, fresh borrowings, this system could not have been formed in a matter of seconds. This system goes by the surrounding peoples' culture but retains its local touch that is worth introducing...|$|R

The coins are circular in shape and their fabric is very similar to that of Naga coins which have been discovered in large numbers at Eran, Vdisha region. The name of Ramgupta is clearly written on some of the coins found in excavations at Eran. The symbols - Lion Garuda and Garudadhvaja are also quite distinct. The Brahmi legend on the coins is in early Gupta character. Besides the coins of Ramagupta Eran has also yielded copper coin of chandragupta vikramadiya.34 These are of two types; Chakra and Purnaghata. The excavations at Vidisha have also brought to light copper coins of Ramgupta. In size and fabric they resemble the Eran coin of that ruler. Ramgupta can be called the originator of the copper currency in the imperial Gupta dynasty. His numerous copper coins with certain characteristic features of this dynasty should be taken into consideration in the study the coinage of the imperial guptas, The coins of Ramgupta were minted in eastern Malwa specially in the mints at Eran and Vdisha.|$|R
