50|$|Different salts can elicit {{all five}} basic tastes, e.g., salty (sodium chloride), sweet (<b>lead</b> <b>diacetate,</b> which will cause lead {{poisoning}} if ingested), sour (potassium bitartrate), bitter (magnesium sulfate), and umami or savory (monosodium glutamate).|$|E
50|$|Lead(II) acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2), {{also known}} as lead acetate, <b>lead</b> <b>diacetate,</b> plumbous acetate, sugar of lead, lead sugar, salt of Saturn, or Goulard's powder, is a white {{crystalline}} chemical compound with a sweetish taste. It is made by treating lead(II) oxide with acetic acid. Like other lead compounds, it is toxic. Lead acetate is soluble in water and glycerin. With water it forms the trihydrate, Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, a colourless or white efflorescent monoclinic crystalline substance.|$|E
