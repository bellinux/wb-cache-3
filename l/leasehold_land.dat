25|$|From {{as early}} as 1843 {{shepherding}} had been common around Burra, with pastoral pioneers such as James Stein and William Peter being granted grazing rights for their flocks on unsurveyed land. Over {{the life of the}} Burra Mine, most food was brought in as there was no freehold offered by SAMA on the land and no adjoining hundreds were declared until 1860. Agriculture was delayed by the slow surveying of hundreds, as until these had been done there was no freehold or <b>leasehold</b> <b>land</b> but only grazing rights. As Burra lies almost on Goyder's 1865 line it is rated at the edge of marginal land for farming. After mining the town became a pastoral centre, and South Australia's main sheep trading centre until the mid-20th century. The Baldina Run, a major sheep station of 50 square miles some 10 miles east of Burra, near Kooringa, was established by Henry Ayers in 1851, leased by J and C. B. Fisher until 1862, then taken over by Alfred Barker, son-in-law of James Chambers.|$|E

5000|$|In late 1823, George Lauder, {{described}} as the tenant farmer of Inverleith Mains, agreed with James Rocheid of Inverleith to a reversion of part of his <b>leasehold</b> <b>lands,</b> 11.5 Scots acres, for {{the site of the}} Royal Botanic Garden, which had formerly been located on Leith Walk. Commonly known as [...] "The Botanics", the new site was opened in May 1824, comprising a large and varied set of gardens or parks {{with a wide range of}} plants, from around the world, in the open and in greenhouses. There is a Chinese themed garden, an extensive landscaped rock garden, a large palm house, and since its opening in July 2006, home to an official memorial of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, officially opened by Queen Elizabeth.

[...] This dispute resulted in the case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen, which was decided partly in the High Court in 1982, and partly in the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1988.

In 1910 he was appointed Secretary for Lands in the first state Labor government, but he was removed from the ministry in 1911 after his controversial attempt to prohibit the conversion of <b>leasehold</b> <b>lands</b> to freehold created extensive division in the Labor Party. Unable to regain ministerial office, he resigned his seat in 1913. He spent some time in the United States as a commercial agent of the government, and in 1916 as a conscriptionist left the Labor Party for the Nationalist Party. He was chairman of the Taronga Park Trust from 1927 until his death at Gladesville in 1930.|$|R

50|$|By 1946, the Lands Department had {{received}} applications by private individuals for <b>leasehold</b> title of <b>land</b> on the Spit, {{as well as}} numerous applications for dredging rights for mineral sands. In April 1948 the Land Commissioner reported against the idea of any improvement of the land, believing that there was every chance of further breakthroughs from the ocean to the Broadwater during cyclonic weather. There was however, already some private activity occurring on crown land in the area, with John Humphreys operating several ex-wartime landing barges from moorings in the Basin. The wartime and post-war boom in mineral sands production meant a ready demand for barges carrying dredged sand from South Stradbroke Island to the rutile works in Southport, and Humphreys {{was one of the}} first to capitalise on the need for appropriate transport craft.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a massive {{population}} movement in Northeast China, as ethnic Koreans migrated to South Korea or China's coastal regions for work. As a result, ethnic Korean villages left behind by migrant workers are gradually vanishing, which led to the concentration of small-scale farmland. This paper made a comparative study on the characteristics of land lease situation among different types of ethnic Korean villages. In ethnic Korean villages where Han people accounting for a certain ratio, most of its farmlands left are leased to Han people who choose not to leave. Although <b>leasehold</b> conditions, <b>land</b> lease fees vary depending on different landlord and tenant relationship, usually the scale of tenant farmland is no more than 10 ha, different from state-owned farms. On the other hand, for the villages where all the people are ethnic Koreans, it is difficult to maintain a secure and reliable relationship between landlords and tenants when tenants are from other villages. Thus, farmland adjustment, usually led by village representatives who stay, is necessary. Specifically, after the leasehold fee is decided, farmlands will be adjusted to facilitate large-scale farm households'management. In this way, the scale of tenant's farmland may reach more than 20 ha. This adjustment should be considered as a good policy suggestion for local government to approach large-scale farmland development...|$|R
40|$|Using Hong Kong {{as a case}} study, {{the paper}} explores the {{viability}} of four land-value-capture mechanisms available under public <b>leasehold</b> systems: initial <b>land</b> auctioning; contract modification; lease renewal; and, the collection of land rent. It is found that these mechanisms do not work equally well; instead, their viability depends largely on the context within which the contracting parties practise land leasing. By applying a modified transaction-costs framework to the case, it is shown that the transaction costs of allocating the land value at the initial land auction are the lowest among the four mechanisms. This explains why the Hong Kong government relies on public land auctions to capture land value, The paper concludes {{with a discussion of}} the implications of this finding for Hong Kong and for countries where officials are experimenting with public leasehold systems...|$|R
