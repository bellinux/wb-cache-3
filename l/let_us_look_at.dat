60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this {{question}} rationally and reverently, free from all sentimental and immoral indulgence for sin and wrong.|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> briefly <b>at</b> {{the other}} {{instances}} of protective coloration in nature generally which {{lead up to}} these final bizarre exemplifications of the masquerading tendency.|$|R
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> briefly <b>at</b> the {{succession}} of big animals in the world, {{so far as we}} can follow it from the mutilated and fragmentary record of the geological remains.|$|R
60|$|Before {{considering}} modern theories, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> first <b>at</b> consciousness {{from the}} standpoint of conventional psychology, since this embodies views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject. For this purpose, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> as a preliminary consider different ways of being conscious.|$|R
60|$|Now what {{evidence}} have we that this analogy holds? <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the facts, first as they present themselves subjectively.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} and good {{ways of looking}} at Easter Day. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it in this way for once.|$|E

60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> go and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. To <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{anything}} that is inconstant is charming nowadays.|$|R
6000|$|We {{must change}} the scene now, {{for the men}} of the Red Brigade do not confine their attentions {{exclusively}} to such matters as drilling, fighting, suffering, conquering, and dying. They sometimes marry! <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> in <b>at</b> this little church where, as a passer-by remarks, [...] "something appears to be going on." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> first <b>look</b> <b>at</b> dialectal extremes. There is leísmo (covered under point a above) {{motivated}} by the tendency towards masculine e in uneducated Madrid speech. This actually used to be quite standard, and the Real Academia only stopped endorsing it in the 1850s. We therefore find in old texts: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{instead of}} {{considering}} {{what they have}} been, and speculating on what they may be, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them as they are.|$|E
60|$|Now, how is this? First, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what {{coming to}} shame is; and next, how believing in Christ will {{save us from}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hey?" [...] {{cried the}} blatant Stryver. [...] "Did he though? Is that {{the sort of}} fellow? <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his infamous name. D--n the fellow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> go and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dancing. It is [...] "Voulez-vous danser"--no, [...] it is not,--it is [...] "Enrico"--two ladies {{between two}} gentlemen.|$|R
30|$|Let E be {{a nearly}} spherical set and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> back <b>at</b> the {{estimate}} (3.2) stated in Fuglede’s Theorem  3.1.

3000|$|Having {{shed some}} light on {{continuous}} solutions of the basic difference equation (60), <b>let</b> <b>us</b> now <b>look</b> <b>at</b> restrictions of the continuous solutions to special intervals.

6000|$|The {{entrance}} of Priscilla, bustling forward and saying, [...] "Dear heart alive, child, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this gown," [...] cut off Godfrey's {{hopes of a}} quarrel.|$|E

60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>look</b> first <b>at</b> the Hermits. All {{know what}} an {{important}} part they play in old romances and ballads. All are not aware that they played as important a part in actual history. Scattered through all wildernesses from the cliffs of the Hebrides to the Sclavonian marches, they put forth a power, uniformly, it must be said, for good.|$|R

6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> now {{examine a}} miracle and mystery {{in which the}} Baconians find nothing strange; nothing that is not {{perfectly}} normal.

6000|$|... 'That won't do any good, lad,' {{the sailor}} said. 'Here, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. He has been stabbed, sure enough, Jack. He is just soaking with blood.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so? Well, {{that ought}} to be good enough for anything," [...] Lister said. [...] "It sounds almost miraculous. Now, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your pistols, lad." ...|$|R
