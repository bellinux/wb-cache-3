40|$|AbstractTernary {{complexes}} of Cr(III) with <b>l-histidine</b> <b>monohydrochloride</b> {{and various}} diols {{of the type}} MAB, MA 2 B and MAB 2 were synthesized and characterized in the present study. The structural properties of complexes were derived from the elemental analysis and magnetic characterization. The elemental analysis and magnetic characterization indicated {{that they have the}} octahedral stereochemistry with three unpaired electrons. The values of Dq/B were of greater magnitude for MA 2 B type species as compared to MAB and MAB 2 species. Values of nephelauxetic ratio β 55 (for spin forbidden band) were found to be more than β 35 (for spin allowed transition) ...|$|E
