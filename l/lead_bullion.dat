40|$|This {{project was}} funded through a Pollution Prevention Grant from Minnesota Office of Waste Management. The shop survey, {{conducted}} {{as part of}} this project, indicated a number of industry trends and concerns. Through our work in this project, there is an apparent growth in concern and industry efforts to try to comply with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. Numerous shops continue to inquire about the project's progress and any new developments in a recycling program with Gopher Smelting and Refining Company. Many shops are now properly storing their sludge in hope of a workable disJX>sal/recycling program. When reviewing the results of the chemical analysis of radiator boil-out/ultrasonic sludge, the range of lead in the radiator sludge runs from near 0 to about 20 % on a dry basis. In discussions with shop owners, most commented that they would add their solder droppings to their sludge to raise lead levels, increasing Gopher Smelting and Refining Company's interest in developing a recycling program. Although there is an apparent increasing trend in not using a boil-out or ultrasonic cleaner, owners stated their main reason for shutting off the cleaning devices was concern about sludge disJX>sal. With some type of recycling program, it can be concluded that these shops will be using their machines again. · There is a very strong interest in participating in some type of sludge disposal/recycling program. Two issues need to be addressed before any recycling program can work: 1) the program must be user friendly [...] it must not be difficult to work with; and 2) it must be cost effective for a shop owner to participate. Over the past year, interest in waste reduction/recycling and compliance with the law has increased. If some type of program can be developed and continued, the state will see a definite surge in shop participation, which of course will result in less waste being dumped illegally. In addition to the mail and interview survey, {{there were a number of}} bench-scale studies on various parts of the radiator preparation process and a full-scale factory experiment to smelt and convert a 1, 000 lb. lot of radiator boil-out tank sludge to <b>bullion</b> <b>lead.</b> Most of the benchscale experimentation did not seem adequately effective for adoption by the industry. However, the mist water wash down may be adapted to help minimize drag-out of caustic boil-out solution. There should be an additional benefit to maintain the caustic boil-out tank solution and minimize dilution of boil-out bath. The full-scale factory experiment to smelt down a 1, 000 lb. lot of radiator boil-out sludge went well. The shipment was made by a hazardous material truck and received at the smelter. The material was processed through Gopher Smelting and Refining Company without disrupting operations, and the product lead did not vary from the nonnal analysis range. Based on favorable results of the surveys, sample analyses, and full-scale factory test, the smelter is proceeding with an internal, proprietary detennination of a fee schedule to process the boil-out sludge at various levels of lead content.

50|$|Concentrates {{with higher}} lead {{contents}} can be smelted directly into lead metal {{in a single}} furnace without excess fuming. This was demonstrated on the large scale in 1994, when 4000 t of concentrate containing 67% lead were treated at rates up to 32 t/h with lance air enriched to 27%. During these trials, 50% of {{the lead in the}} concentrate was converted to <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> in the smelting furnace, while most of the rest ended up as lead oxide in the smelting furnace slag.|$|E
50|$|The {{lead from}} the blast furnace, called <b>lead</b> <b>bullion,</b> then {{undergoes}} the drossing process. The bullion is agitated in kettles then cooled to 700-800 degrees. This process results in molten lead and dross. Dross refers to the lead oxides, copper, antimony and other elements that float {{to the top of}} the lead. Dross is usually skimmed off and sent to a dross furnace to recover the non-lead components which are sold to other metal manufacturers. The Parkes process is used to separate silver or gold from lead.|$|E
50|$|The Urquhart Shaft and Headframe were erected during 1930-31 and the ore {{produced}} {{had been}} smelted into <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> for shipment overseas {{by the official}} opening of the Mount Isa Mines complex by the Hon.

It operated for over thirty years until the biggest shaft on the Mount Isa field, then known as the K57 ore shaft, was opened in 1963.|$|E
50|$|The {{two-stage}} {{approach to}} ISASMELT lead smelting was partly {{driven by the}} relatively low lead content of Mount Isa lead concentrates (typically {{in the range of}} 47-52% lead during the lead ISASMELT development period). Trying to produce <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> in a single furnace with such low concentrate grades would result in excessive fuming of lead oxide with a huge amount of material {{that would have to be}} returned to the furnace to recover the lead and, consequently, a higher energy demand as that material had to be reheated to the furnace temperatures.|$|E
50|$|This {{process was}} {{developed}} by the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, England, in order to increase production, increase efficiency, and decrease labour and maintenance costs. L. J. Derham proposed using a spray of molten lead droplets to rapidly chill and absorb the zinc vapour, despite the high concentration of carbon dioxide. The mixture is then cooled, where the zinc separates from the lead. The first plant using this design opened up in 1950. One of the advantages of this process is that it can co-produce <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> and copper dross. In 1990, it accounted for 12% of the world's zinc production.|$|E
5000|$|MIM {{was still}} not in a {{position}} to mine the copper, because it had stockpiles of <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> and zinc concentrate that could not be sold due to the war. However, the Australian government needed copper for its war effort and lent MIM ₤50,000 to allow the mining to proceed. Further drilling expanded the copper reserves and MIM decided to switch from lead to copper production. The lead-zinc concentrator could treat the copper ore with little modification, but the lead smelter required the addition of second-hand equipment lying idle at the Kuridala, Mount Cuthbert and Mount Elliott mines.|$|E
50|$|Exploration {{activities}} between 1952 and 1960 {{expanded the}} Mount Isa ore reserves from 9.9 {{million tons of}} lead-zinc-silver ore to 25.6 million tons, and from 3.8 million tons of copper ore to 24.2 million tons. As {{a consequence of the}} expansion of reserves, MIM decided to expand production. The quantity of copper produced rose from zero in 1952 to 60,000 tons in 1960, while the <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> output increased from about 36,860 t in 1952 to 60,000 t in 1959 and then reduced to 52,000 t in 1960 as a consequence of a decision to reduce output {{in the face of a}} global oversupply of lead metal.|$|E
50|$|Ores mined {{for their}} base metal content often contain {{precious}} metals, usually gold and silver.

50|$|Based on {{the results}} of the pilot plant work, the MIM Holdings Board of Directors {{approved}} the construction of an A$65 million demonstration plant, capable of producing 60,000 t/y of <b>lead</b> <b>bullion.</b> This plant operated from early 1991 until 1995. It was initially designed to treat 20 t/h of lead concentrate using lance air enriched to 27%. However, the oxygen originally designated for its use was diverted to the more profitable copper smelting operations, and the feed rate to the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was severely restricted. When there was sufficient oxygen available in 1993 to increase the enrichment level to 33-35%, treatment rates of up to 36 t/h of concentrate were achieved, with residual lead in the final reduction furnace slag being in the range of 2-5%.|$|E
50|$|The {{work began}} with {{computer}} modelling the equilibrium thermodynamics (1978) and {{was followed by}} laboratory bench-scale test work using large alumina silicate crucibles (1978-1979). The results were sufficiently encouraging that MIM built a 120 kg/h test rig in Mount Isa. It began operation in September 1980. This was used to develop a two-stage process to produce <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> from Mount Isa lead concentrate. The first stage was an oxidation step that removed virtually all the sulfur from the feed, oxidising the contained lead to lead oxide (PbO) that was largely collected in the slag (some was carried out of the furnace as lead oxide fume that was returned for lead recovery). The second stage was a reduction step in which the oxygen {{was removed from the}} lead to form lead metal.|$|E
50|$|The MIM Holdings Board of Directors {{approved}} {{the construction of}} an ISASMELT plant at Britannia Refined Metals, the company’s lead refinery at Northfleet in the United Kingdom, for commercial recovery of lead from battery paste to supplement the existing plant, which used a short rotary furnace to produce 10,000 t/y of lead. The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991. The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55-65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short rotary furnace when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated. The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h. The plant was shut down in 2004 when Xstrata Zinc, which took over the MIM Holdings lead operations, decided to leave the lead recycling business.|$|E
50|$|In July 1930, Kruttschnitt took a {{position}} for ASARCO in Australia {{as general manager}} of Mount Isa Mines Ltd, Queensland.

After an agreement by ASARCO to make a million dollar loan to Mount Isa Mines Ltd, the mine and smelters began producing their first <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> in mid 1931. Under Kruttschnitt's management, it would take six years until the mine cleared a profit in 1937 largely due to worldwide ore prices and the need for better extraction and milling methods, and another ten before dividends were paid to investors. Kruttschnitt was well liked by the mine's employees, as he took an interest in providing better housing for employees and their families and improving community relations, while General Manager. Kruttschnitt was appointed a director of Mount Isa Mines Ltd in 1931. He was later appointed chairman of the board in 1937, remaining in the role until 1953 when he retired as chairman. He continued on the board until 1967.His wife Marie (née Pickering), also had a popular role in the Mt Isa community. She was active in the Country Women's Association, the Australian Inland Mission and, during the start of World War II, in the Australian Comforts Fund. She died on 4 September 1940 from pneumonia; her body was returned to the USA for burial. In March 1941, a women's club which she had a major role in establishing was named the Marie Kruttschnitt Club in her memory. In 1944, he married his secretary Mrs Edna May Roger (née Maxted) in a private ceremony with Presbyterian rites at his home in Mount Isa.

50|$|Sometra {{was founded}} {{as a private}} firm in 1939 {{for the purpose of}} zinc smelting. Initially, it had three {{distillation}} furnaces, with five more added in 1948, the year it was nationalized by the new communist regime. Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of <b>lead</b> <b>bullion</b> per year. The 1967-1970 period saw the introduction of an electrolytic lead refining system (capacity 24,000 tons a year); a unit for extracting metallic bismuth for technical and pharmaceutical use from anode sludge, as well as gold and silver alloys and antimony slag; a unit for zinc sulfate production; a unit for zinc and ammonium chloride production; and an air preheater. Capacity was doubled between 1975 and 1984. A second zinc and lead extraction unit, with annual capacities of 30,000 tons (zinc) and 20,000 tons (lead) went online, as well as two thermal zinc refineries and greater cadmium refining. In 1983, metallic antimony production began by extracting the metal from slag, along with sodium thioantimoniate and stibnite. In 1984, a second blast furnace began operation, so that the old components built from 1939 to 1957 were retired. Between 1985 and 1989, zinc powder production began and a system for collecting residual gases was put in place. In 1988, a 250 m high chimney was built. By 1989, the plant was annually generating 43,490 tons of sulfuric acid (against a projected capacity of 126,000 tons), 23,519 tons of electrolytic lead (below the 38,000 tons projected), 29,840 tons of pure zinc, 2,094 tons of zinc powder, 19 tons of cadmium, 29 tons of bismuth and 195 tons of antimony.|$|E
