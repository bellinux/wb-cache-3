25|$|Before Bank of America's {{acquisition}} of Merrill Lynch, the Global Corporate and Investment Banking (GCIB) business operated as Banc of America Securities LLC. The bank's investment banking activities {{operate under the}} Merrill Lynch subsidiary and provided mergers and acquisitions advisory, underwriting, capital markets, as well as sales & trading in fixed income and equities markets. Its strongest groups include <b>Leveraged</b> <b>Finance,</b> Syndicated Loans, and mortgage-backed securities. It also {{has one of the}} largest research teams on Wall Street. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is headquartered in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Corporate finance is the {{traditional}} aspect of investment banks, which involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers and acquisitions (M); this may involve subscribing investors to a security issuance, coordinating with bidders, or negotiating with a merger target. A pitch book of financial information is generated to market the bank to a potential M client; if the pitch is successful, the bank arranges the deal for the client. The investment banking division (IBD) is generally divided into industry coverage and product coverage groups. Industry coverage groups focus on a specific industry—such as healthcare, public finance (governments), FIG (financial institutions group), industrials, TMT (technology, media, and telecommunications), P (power & energy), consumer/retail, food & beverage, corporate defense and governance—and maintain relationships with corporations within the industry to bring in business for the bank. Product coverage groups focus on financial products—such as mergers and acquisitions, <b>leveraged</b> <b>finance,</b> public finance, asset finance and leasing, structured finance, restructuring, equity, and high-grade debt—and generally work and collaborate with industry groups on the more intricate and specialized needs of a client.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and <b>leveraged</b> <b>finance.</b> Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E

40|$|In early 1980 s, China {{started its}} {{economic}} reform after thirty years isolation from world economy. Along its opening to outside world to encourage {{international trade and}} attract inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) to China, its own enterprises, both state-owned and private-owned also started to embrace the international market by marketing their product globally and expanding its business operations to new territories through outward FDI, mainly in forms of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and joint-venture with foreign partners. In this paper, we discuss the main financial risks that Chinese enterprises encountered in their cross-border M&A deals and the causes of such risks in context of internationalization of companies from emerging economy (EE). Through literature reviews, secondary data analysis and case studies, we have identified the major financial risks in M&A as valuation/pricing risk, financing risk and risk from payment structure. These risks have their unique/specific reflection when faced by Chinese enterprises in their cross-border M&As. The research shows that for Chinese companies‟ cross-border M&As, the valuation risk was mainly caused by information asymmetry, especially lack of labour law and industrial relation knowledge of host countries, which led to underestimated labour-related costs in post acquisition business integration. The pricing risk {{is a result of}} valuation risk and competition for deals. Interestingly, though many M&A practitioner‟s manuals indicated the primary financial risk in M&A is the risk arsing from <b>leverage</b> <b>financing</b> for acquisition, in reality, <b>leverage</b> <b>financing</b> risk itself is insignificant in Chinese companies‟ cross-border M&A deals. However, currency choice of <b>leverage</b> <b>financing</b> is a factor that acquiring company cannot ignore in its assessment on overall financial risks of an M&A deal. In the context of internationalisation of EE MNCs, these identified financial risks were rooted in the special CSAs based growing model of Chinese MNCs. In recent years, the major force of Chinese companies overseas M&A deals are large state-owned enterprises targeting on tangible assets especially natural resources. This trend, on one side, is the reflection of China‟s national energy security strategy in business arena, on another side; it is also the result of several high-profile unsuccessful M&A deals conducted by Chinese companies in IT, manufacturing sectors in the early Years of first decade of 21 st century...|$|R
