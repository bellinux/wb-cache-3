5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms {{could be used in}} bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall {{found that people}} will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

5|$|The {{artillery}} {{guns in the}} Device forts {{were the}} property of the Crown and were centrally managed by the authorities in the Tower of London. The Tower moved them between the various fortifications as they felt necessary, often resulting in complaints from the local captains. Various surviving records record the armaments held by individual forts on particular dates, and between 1547 and 1548 a complete inventory was made of the Crown's possessions, detailing the weapons held by all of the forts. The number of guns varied considerably from site to site; in the late 1540s, heavily armed forts such as Hurst and Calshot held 26 and 36 guns respectively; Portland, however, had only 11 pieces. Some forts had more guns than the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> regular, peace-time garrison; for example, despite only having an establishment of 13 men, Milton Blockhouse had 30 artillery pieces.|$|E

25|$|The {{capabilities}} approach – {{sometimes called}} the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”.

Its goal is to “wid people’s choices and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).|$|E

Another group of 14 infants of same age with no ophthalmic and/or congenital diseases were included as control group with their parents.

A significant elevation in blood galactose, in infants with congenital cataract as compared with control group, while no significant changes in blood galactose <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> parents as compared with parents of control group. Significant elevation of serum sodium in infants with congenital cataract as compared with control group, while no significant change in serum sodium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> parents as compared with parents of control group. Significant decrease of serum potassium in infants with congenital cataract as compared with control group, while no significant change in serum potassium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> parents as compared with parents of control group. Early valuable genetic counseling, with estimation of galactose, sodium and potassium are recommended. Infants with congenital cataract had different etiological causes, so not all cases need restriction of milk and milk products. Parental estimation of galactose, sodium and potassium had no value...|$|R

40|$|Organizations {{are fast}} realizing that work-related {{behaviours}} of leaders {{play a vital}} role in organizational success. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of organizational commitment on job involvement of bank managers in Sri Lanka. Based on the literature a conceptual model was developed. The study adopted research instruments that have already been validated. A total of two hundred commercial bank managers were selected for the study using the convenience sampling technique and one hundred and sixty three usable questionnaires were returned. The model was tested with the measurement model and the structural model analysis by using Partial Least Square technique (PLS). The structural model analysis results provided the support for all hypotheses formulated in this study. Thus, the higher the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> organizational commitment of bank managers, the higher the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> job involvement and their job satisfaction. Further, the higher the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> job satisfaction of bank managers, the higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> job involvement...|$|R

25|$|In 1992, {{the minimum}} wage in New Jersey {{increased}} from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. David Card and Alan Krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania {{in an attempt to}} see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> restaurants both times. Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the increase in {{the minimum wage}} slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, {{possibly}} {{more so than}} any other order of invertebrates. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> intelligence and learning capability are debated, but maze and problem-solving studies show they have both short- and long-term memory. Octopus have a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localized in their brain. Two-thirds of an octopus' neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of their arms. Octopus arms show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organized in their brain using an internal somatotopic map of their body, instead using a non-somatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates. Some octopuses, such as the mimic octopus, move their arms in ways that emulate the shape and movements of other sea creatures.|$|E

The contenders are divided into three classes according to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> disability. Participants in LTA category have functional use of their legs, trunk and arms for paddling, and they can apply force to the footboard to propel the boat. TA class paddlers have functional use of the trunk and arms, but {{they are unable to}} apply continuous and controlled force to the footboard to propel the boat due to the weakened function of their lower limbs. Canoeist who have no trunk function are classified in the A category. At the World Championships 200 metres single events were organized for both genders in both disciplines in every disability class, however, a minimum of six competing national federations for each category were required in order to be a valid championship.|$|E
