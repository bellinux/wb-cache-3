5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Maya {{concept of}} 'deity', or 'divinity' (k'u in Yucatec, ch'u in Ch'ol, and qabuvil in ancient Quiché) is poorly understood, but can {{by no means}} {{be reduced to a}} mere {{personification}} of natural phenomena. The life-cycle of the maize, for instance, {{lies at the heart of}} Maya belief, but the role of the Maya maize god transcends the sphere of agriculture to embrace basic aspects of civilized <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> (such as writing). Deities have all sorts of social functions, related to such human activities as agriculture, midwifery, trade, and warfare. Moreover, they can be the patrons of large kin-based or ethnic segments of society, as shown by the four deities presiding over the four wards of Itzamkanac; the Popol Vuh Triad (including Tohil); and possibly also by the Palenque Triad (G I, II, and III) and its Classic Period analogues elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The responsa of the epoch {{came from}} various countries, and from schools having {{different}} tendencies, thus showing {{the position and}} the type of spiritual <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> and of Talmudic learning in particular, since all these factors prevailed in the different countries at the time. Especially noteworthy is the divergence between the French and the Spanish school in the twelfth century, the second half of this period. For the most part the rulings of this period receive their basis or their confirmation from a passage in the Talmud, and in this motivation the difference between the French and the Spanish exegesis of the Talmud is clearly shown. The Spanish school was the more logical, and strove for brevity and lucidity in the deduction of its rulings from the Talmud, while the French school was more dialectic, and frequently gave full play to casuistry at the expense of clearness.|$|E

25|$|While life on Earth is {{regarded}} to have spawned relatively {{early in the}} planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years. Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative {{to the age of}} the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a tiny age span, an age span in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes or large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> For example, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in {{an area the size of}} Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 Ma ago. About 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub impact at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (~65.5 Ma) on the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.|$|E
25|$|Christianity is the {{predominant}} religion of French Canadians, with Roman Catholicism the chief denomination. The kingdom of France forbade non-Catholic settlement in New France from 1629 onward and thus, almost all French settlers of Canada were Catholic. In the United States, some families of French-Canadian origin have converted to Protestantism. Until the 1960s, religion {{was a central}} component of French-Canadian national identity. The Church parish was {{the focal point of}} civic life in French-Canadian society, and religious orders ran French-Canadian schools, hospitals and orphanages and were very influential in everyday <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, however, the practice of Catholicism dropped drastically. Church attendance in Quebec currently remains low. Rates of religious observance among French Canadians outside Quebec tend to vary by region, and by age. In general, however, those in Quebec are the least observant, while those in the United States of America and other places away from Quebec tend to be the most observant.|$|E
25|$|The Kamdesh {{village and}} most of Nuristan {{is located in the}} Hindu Kush. This is a lofty {{mountain}} range characterized by steep slopes of enormous granite boulders separated by fast moving rivers in deep narrow valleys. The temperate climate of the area provides hot summers, a monsoon season in the summer, and cold winters of ice and snow extending down into the valleys. The combination of volatile weather and rugged mountains make any kind of travel and <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> difficult and challenging. American military operations in Kamdesh were affected as soon as units began gathering for deployment in the area. Operation Deep Strike began on May 5, 2006. This was a re-deployment from the Cowkay and Korangal Valleys to Kamdesh. The pick up zone for Able Troop 2nd Platoon was called PZ Reds, located on the side of an 8,000-foot mountain. It was nicknamed “Heart Attack Ridge” due to its steep slope and obstacles hazardous to low flying aircraft.|$|E
