50|$|Bump steer {{can become}} a problem when cars are {{modified}} by <b>lowering</b> or <b>lifting,</b> when a spring has become worn or broken causing a lower ride height, or if the vehicle is heavily loaded. When a car is <b>lowered</b> or <b>lifted,</b> the wheels' toe setting will change.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{air with}} higher {{humidity}} is less dense, providing <b>lower</b> <b>lift</b> and <b>lower</b> propeller or turbine efficiency (this is somewhat offset by decreased drag).

50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or <b>lowering</b> the <b>lifting</b> frame. One hand tap selected direction to either raise or <b>lower</b> the <b>lifting</b> frame. The second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin <b>lowering</b> of the <b>lifting</b> frame from its vertical position.|$|R

50|$|Observe {{that even}} though Rule 1 has higher confidence, it has <b>lower</b> <b>lift.</b> Intuitively, {{it would seem that}} Rule 1 is more {{valuable}} because of its higher confidence—it seems more accurate (better supported). But accuracy of the rule independent of the data set can be misleading. The value of lift is that it considers both the confidence of the rule and the overall data set.|$|R

50|$|While the {{procedure}} is expensive, often running in the neighbourhood of US$20,000-50,000 for an entire body, it usually leaves long, visible scars on the arms, chest, stomach and legs. Most surgeons break the surgical task into an upper, and a <b>lower,</b> body <b>lift.</b> A <b>lower</b> body <b>lift</b> removes the sagging skin on the back, abdomen, buttocks and thighs while the upper body procedure removes loose skin from the arms, breasts and chest.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} popularity of bariatric sur-gery, patients with multiple body contour deformities {{have become more}} common in plastic surgery practice. Most of the deformities involving the abdomen, thighs, and but-tocks can be effectively corrected with belt lipectomy and <b>lower</b> body <b>lift.</b> A common problem with this procedure is postoperative loss of gluteal projection and resulting flat-tened buttock contour, which is directly proportional {{to the extent of}} <b>lower</b> body <b>lift</b> achieved. The use of local myo-cutaneous flaps to provide coverage for the lumbosacral defects is a common plastic surgery procedure. The authors have used these techniques to create an autologous buttock implant for additional projection during a <b>lower</b> body <b>lift.</b> A local myocutaneous flap originating within the regularly excised supragluteal tissue is rotated caudally to function a...|$|R

5000|$|Lifts, which {{look like}} {{clothing}} buttons, {{can move the}} robot or an object up or down by one level.

If the robot or an object moves onto a raised <b>lift,</b> it will <b>lower</b> by one level. Raised <b>lifts</b> cannot be <b>lowered</b> at their base and become immovable obstacles at ground level.|$|R

30|$|PCP {{is widely}} used along with Electric {{submersible}} pump (ESP) and Gas lift (GS) operation for CHOPS using artificial lift systems (Cavender 2004). The foremost advantage of utilizing PCP is the high capacity of lifting highly viscous mixture of oil and sand, which initially contributed {{to the development of}} CHOPS. The wide usage of PCP in CHOPS is also based on its higher volumetric efficiencies, <b>lower</b> <b>lifting</b> cost, <b>lower</b> capital cost, lower maintenance, application flexibility, and environmental benefits (Revard 1995).|$|R

Hydrodynamic seals have a variety of applications in multiple industries. there are a large number of various groove designs that have been proposed and tested.|$|R
