5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus {{was a large}} bipedal predator, {{weighing}} up to five tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|A related {{study also}} noted a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in the lower}} jaw shared between the two genera. In a {{separate}} paper, Currie noted the possibility that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but stated that the much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in Alioramus suggest it is a distinct genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of Nanotyrannus {{to suggest that it}} may be a distinct genus, rather than a juvenile Tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E

5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of padlock locking mechanisms: {{integrated}} & modular. Integrated <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> directly engage the padlock's shackle with the tumblers. Examples of integrated <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are rotating disks (found in [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style padlocks where a disk rotated by the key enters a notch cut into the shackle to block it from moving) or lever tumblers (where {{a portion of the}} bolt that secures the shackle enters the tumblers when the correct key is turned in the lock). Padlocks with integrated <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are characterized by a design that does not allow disassembly of the padlock. They are usually older than padlocks with modular mechanisms and often require the use of a key to lock.|$|R

25|$|A {{folding knife}} connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, {{allowing}} the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent {{injury to the}} knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user's hand, folding knives typically have a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.|$|E

25|$|Frame Lock – Also {{known as}} the {{integral}} lock or monolock, this <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> was invented by custom knifemaker Chris Reeve for the Sebenza as an update to the liner lock. The frame lock works {{in a manner similar}} to the liner lock but uses a partial cutout of the actual knife handle, rather than a separate liner inside the handle to hold the blade in place.|$|E
25|$|The handle {{material}} of the SARK {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a double detent as the <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material are its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. The handle's scales are made from black G-10 fiberglass, although models were made {{for a few years}} using green G-10. A pocket clip held in place by three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear or MOLLE.|$|E
25|$|Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals {{that require}} a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases the}} <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. The clipless pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{improvements to}} authentication on mobile touchscreen phones and present a novel extension to the widely used touchscreen pattern <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Our solution allows including nodes in the grid multiple times, which enhances the resilience to smudge {{and other forms}} of attack. For example, for a smudge pattern covering 7 nodes, our approach increases the amount of possible lock patterns by a factor of 15 times. Our concept was implemented and evaluated in a laboratory user test (n= 36). The test participants found the usability of the proposed concept to be equal to that of the baseline pattern <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> but considered it more secure. Our solution is fully backwards-compatible with the current baseline pattern <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism,</b> hence enabling easy adoption whilst providing higher security at a comparable level of usability...|$|R

25|$|Mechanical vehicle {{switching}} minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it {{also increases}} the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new switch position, and then wait for the in-vehicle switch's <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> to be verified.

25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E
