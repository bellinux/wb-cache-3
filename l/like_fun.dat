500|$|Despite Miami's {{improvement}} in 1978, Saban departed the school amid controversy. That April, three freshman Miami players attacked a 22-year-old Jewish {{man wearing a}} yarmulke who was walking to religious services on campus. They threw the man, who worked at a campus gathering place for UM's Jewish community, into Lake Osceola {{at the center of}} campus. When Saban returned to campus a few days later, he was unaware the man was Jewish and reportedly said [...] "Getting thrown in the lake? Sounds <b>like</b> <b>fun</b> to me." [...] Miami's Jewish community complained, and despite numerous apologies, Saban offered to resign mid-season. Saban was convinced to remain {{through the end of the}} season, however, before leaving to coach at Army.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it <b>like</b> <b>fun</b> and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why {{not fight}} for her, then? Don't let {{one of these}} boys walk off with her. Look at her. She <b>likes</b> <b>fun</b> and admiration. I believe you do care for her. Why not try to win her?" ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{international}} level, Sívori {{represented the}} Argentina national football team eighteen times and registered nine goals. The Argentine {{side of the}} time had a formidable attack with Sívori, Omar Oreste Corbatta, Osvaldo Cruz, Humberto Maschio and Antonio Angelillo. The attacking trio of Sívori, Maschio, and Angelillo were nicknamed the [...] "caras sucias", which literally means [...] "dirty faces" [...] in Spanish; {{in reference to the}} film of the same name, and due to way they played the game, <b>like</b> <b>fun,</b> dirty faced, mischievous children.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{that they will be}} supporting Hundred Reasons at their upcoming 10th Anniversary shows, playing The Neon Handshake in full along with other songs from their back catalogue. Guitarist Will McGonagle commented on the upcoming shows, [...] "We’ve been friends with Hundred Reasons for over 10 years, so when they suggested playing our first records together it sounded <b>like</b> <b>fun.</b> We are really proud of all the music we’ve made together and look forward to getting together to smash out The Neon Handshake. The early 2000s were exciting times for British rock music. It was a special time for our bands, who toured together and forged strong friendships. Who knows, maybe one day there’ll be a Shatterproof/Transmit Disrupt show too hahahaha.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During their negotiations, {{both sides}} {{agreed that the}} opening act from the inaugural show until their {{scheduled}} performance on April 4 in Philadelphia would be Manson's option, stoner rock band Monster Magnet. A dispute arose on who would take over. According to Erlandson and Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, the two groups had a two-hour meeting {{to arrive at a}} resolution. Manson and his band voted for early 1980s Brit-pop groups <b>like</b> <b>Fun</b> Boy Three and Fine Young Cannibals, while members of Hole wanted [...] "more modern" [...] bands. Auf der Maur noted that [...] "we want romance and they want theater. We want love and they want shtick. We had to explain to them that those kinds of bands make them look good, but us look silly". Eventually, Manson's band ceded the selection of the subsequent opening act to Love, who chose Imperial Teen. During their negotiations, both bands agreed to split the cost of producing each show, which resulted in Hole unwittingly financing most of Manson's disproportionately higher production costs at their own expense. The revenue earned at each show would be split 50/50 between the two bands.|$|E

He <b>likes</b> <b>fun,</b> I'm sure, for he laughed about the 'sumptuous cheek' till his own were red, though he dared not show it, and was as grave as an owl when we met uncle," [...] said Amy, smiling at the recollection.|$|R

60|$|In rebuttal, Mr. Talcott {{drew out}} {{contradictory}} statements from these witnesses, and proved several alibis at points where Harold had been accused.

6000|$|... "If I were you, I'd {{write him}} an apology, Sir. He says he won't come down till he has one, {{and talks about}} Washington, and goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He <b>likes</b> <b>fun,</b> and this way is better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I should {{love to go}} to London, {{and have}} a good time, but I don't think I should care about {{spending}} ever so much money, or going to Court.

60|$|At dinner I {{found myself}} {{between him and}} Lord Carlisle, and perceiving, perhaps, {{that the nature of}} my {{reflections}} was of rather an amusing order, he asked me confidentially if I did not <b>like</b> <b>fun,</b> to which I assented with fervor. I like that little homely word fun, though I understand the dictionary says what it represents is vulgar; but I think it has a good, hearty, Saxon sound, and I like Saxon, better than Latin or French either.|$|E

60|$|And {{in another}} instant an egg flew across the meadow, and burst over Leuthold's shoulder. The crowd howled with delight. This was {{something}} <b>like</b> <b>fun,</b> thought they, {{and the next}} moment eggs, cabbages, cats, and missiles of every sort darkened the air. The two soldiers raved and shouted, but did not dare to leave their post. At last, just as the storm was at its height, it ceased, as if by magic. Everyone in the crowd turned round, and, as he turned, jumped {{into the air and}} waved his hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Much obliged. You {{may also}} tell people I gave up gaiety because I value health more. But I haven't forsworn {{everything}} of the kind, Kit. I go to concerts and lectures, {{and all sorts}} of early things, and have nice times at home, as you know. I <b>like</b> <b>fun</b> as well as ever, but I'm getting on, you see, and must be preparing a little for the serious part of life.

6000|$|... "I {{see it in}} people's eyes, {{and hear}} it in their voices. And they all talk {{to me as if}} I were very steady, and {{altogether}} removed from anything <b>like</b> <b>fun</b> and frolic. It seems to be admitted that if a girl does not want to fall in love, she ought not to care for any other fun in the world. If anybody made out a list of the old ladies in these parts, they'd put down Lady Julia, and mamma, and Mrs. Boyce, and me, and old Mrs. Hearne. The very children have an awful respect for me, and give over playing directly they see me. Well, mamma, we've done at last, and I have had such a scolding from Mrs. Boyce." ...|$|E
