500|$|At {{approximately}} 7:20 pm on Friday, September 19, 2014, Gonzalez scaled {{the iron}} perimeter fence of the White House. Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of things have to be considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll look back and say the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give It Away" [...] is {{performed}} in the time signature of 4/4 time. The track begins with a distinctively [...] "dry" [...] guitar tone that is similar in style {{to the rest of}} the record. Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of Blood Sugar Sex Magik by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band's previous album Mother's Milk. This caused the record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects—those that did, however, were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s. For [...] "Give It Away", along with the rest of the album, Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on [...] "big" [...] sounds: [...] "What you hear is what you get—there's not a lot of trickery. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> the biggest sound, with walls of guitar and huge drums. But I don't think those things matter." [...] The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure; when Kiedis begins singing, Frusciante jumps into a funk-oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass-line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the major}} film studios {{approached}} Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to see me fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story {{was one of the biggest}} hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven." [...] Herb Golden of Variety stated, [...] "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable." [...] Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|Within the story, after {{spending}} time with Luke, Noah is seen struggling {{to come to terms}} with his sexuality, and is often angry and confused. Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. [...] "The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship," [...] Silbermann stated. [...] "Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. The funny thing is, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy [...] because that's what couples on daytime TV do. It's a good sign, actually." [...] Hansis said that [...] "it does throw you a bit, especially since this was [...] first big role on television" [...] and [...] "You go from waiting tables to doing interviews with national magazines and people saying that you changed their lives. It's definitely tricky".|$|E

Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E

Bampton recalled: [...] "It was difficult, especially as Gill and I were roommates {{and at that point}} the England squad was split. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>wanted</b> Clare Taylor to be captain, but it was something I'd always wanted to do and so I just enjoyed it." [...] She retained the captaincy for England's failed 1997 UEFA Women's Championship qualification campaign. In May 1997 Bampton made her final England appearance in a 6 - 0 friendly defeat to United States in Portland.|$|R
2500|$|Das Racist's unique {{style has}} a strong {{polarizing}} tendency; their set at the 2009 Pop Montreal festival was described as [...] "the most divisive show seen at the festival". They describe their approach to music as [...] "'deconstructionalist': sawing the legs out from under hip-hop as they celebrate it". New York Times wrote [...] "Das Racist’s lack of piety has become an aesthetic of its own, with songs that are as much commentary on hip-hop as rigorous practice of it". The Root said DasRacist could speak for both [...] "the ‘hood or the nearest gated community". Playboy called the duo [...] "equal parts hip-hop and Cheech & Chong". In an interview with Sepia Mutiny, Suri described Das Racist's music:we’re not making music that’s instantly appealing. We dabble with non sequiturs, dadaism, repetition, repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it’s a mask on some Paul Laurence Dunbar shit for actual discontent {{with a lot of}} shit in the world. Further, not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to hear rappers talk about Dinesh D'Souza being a punk, Eddie Said, Gayatri Spivak being dope or even know who they are. A lot of people hear Pizza Hut Taco Bell and then have preconceived notions about our entire body of work that fall pretty flat.|$|E
2500|$|... "We Found Love" [...] premiered in the United Kingdom on September 22, 2011, on Capital FM, and {{was sent}} for {{mainstream}} adds in the United States on October 11, 2011. The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did.

Ever since the Rihanna song did well, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E

50|$|Around 1790 {{these ideas}} were firmly rooted {{and the ancient}} classic {{cultures}} (Greek and Roman) were the inspiration for poets, artists, architects and writers. Harmony and Beauty {{were some of the}} ideals of that time. There was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> philosophical and aesthetic writing which accumulated in the Romantic era around 1820 (mostly writers from the nobility). With the Napoleonic Wars going on, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>wanted</b> literature which took them away in a fantasy world. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> religious writing was also providing people with new hope. Klemens Maria Hofbauer, Eduard von Bauernfeld and Franz Grillparzer are but three of the writers influenced by these events. The German writer Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel also lived and worked in Vienna around 1809.|$|R

In Auel's case the didactic component is a postfeminist allegory that validates Woman's new place in society, with one foot in the (hunting/ gathering) workplace and the other still solidly planted on the domestic hearth". Auel is often praised for her knowledge on the Paleolithic, and this chapter in the Earth's Children series is no exception.|$|E
