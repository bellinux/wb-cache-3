60|$|Marcia {{had never}} dined in a restaurant, {{and she was}} {{somewhat}} bewildered by the one into which they turned. There was a great show of roast, and steak, and fish, and game, and squash and cranberry-pie in the window, and at the door a tack was driven through a mass of bills of fare, two of which Bartley plucked off as they entered, with a knowing air, and then threw on the floor when he found the same thing on the table. The table had a marble top, and a silver-plated castor in the centre. The plates were laid with a coarse red doily in a cocked hat on each, and a thinly plated knife and fork crossed beneath it; the plates were thick and heavy; the handle {{as well as the}} blade of the knife was metal, and silvered. Besides the castor, there was a bottle of Leicestershire sauce on the table, and salt in what Marcia thought a pepper-box; the marble was of an unctuous translucence in places, and showed the course of the cleansing napkin on its smeared surface. The place was hot, and full of confused smells of cooking; all the tables were crowded, so that they found places with difficulty, and pale, plain girls, of the Provincial and Irish-American type, in fashionable bangs and pull-backs, went about taking the orders, which they wailed out toward a semicircular hole opening upon a counter at the farther end of the room; there they received the dishes ordered, and hurried with them to the customers, before whom they laid them with a noisy clacking of the heavy crockery. A great many of the people seemed to be taking hulled corn and milk; baked beans formed another favorite dish, and squash-pie was in <b>large</b> <b>request.</b> Marcia was not critical; roast turkey for Bartley and stewed chicken for herself, with cranberry-pie for both, seemed to her a very good and sufficient dinner, and better than they ought to have had. She asked Bartley if this were anything like Parker's; he had always talked to her about Parker's.|$|E
5000|$|In a study {{looking at}} the DITF technique, {{researchers}} found that DITF requests that required metacommunication in the responses had higher rates of compliance than requests that did not. [...] The researchers define metacommunication as establishing social boundaries. This is important because the DITF technique often involves strangers making extreme requests, which might elicit a response that requires metacommunication. For example, a person may use metacommunication to indicate that it is inappropriate for a stranger make such an extreme request. This study included four different groups: one starting with a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> and including a metacommunicative statement, one starting with a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> and excluding a metacommunicative statement, one with only a smaller request and including a metacommunicative statement, and one with only a smaller request and excluding a metacommunicative statement. For all of the groups a confederate asked participants {{to fill out a}} questionnaire about campus activities. The <b>large</b> <b>request</b> required a few hours, while the smaller one required 20 minutes. In the groups that started with a <b>large</b> <b>request,</b> the confederate followed up with the smaller one after a refusal. The requests with metacommunication included a sentence stating, [...] "This is kind of awkward. There is something else I'd like to ask of you, but tell me if even this seems inappropriate between strangers" [...] prior to filling out the 20-minute questionnaire (p. 92). Results show significantly greater compliance to requests that included the metacommunicative statement. The researchers suggest that the explicit statement regarding social boundaries makes participants comply to avoid engaging in metacommunicative conflict.|$|E

50|$|In {{a classic}} {{experiment}} investigating {{the effectiveness of}} the DITF technique, researchers separated participants into three groups. In group 1, experimenters asked participants to volunteer to counsel juvenile delinquents for two hours a week for two years (<b>large</b> <b>request).</b> After their refusal, the group was asked to chaperone juvenile delinquents on a one-day trip to the zoo (small request). Group 2 was given only the small request. In group 3, the experimenter described the <b>large</b> <b>request</b> but asked the participants to perform the small request. 50% of the participants in group 1 agreed to the small request, compared to 17% in group 2 and 25% in group 3. Because compliance for the small request was significantly larger for group 1 than group 2, the DITF technique was successful. Compliance for the small request was also significantly larger for group 1 than group 3, which demonstrates that mere exposure to the more extreme task does not affect compliance as significantly.|$|E
5000|$|Foot-in-the-door (FITD) {{technique}} is a compliance tactic that involves getting {{a person to}} agree to a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> by first setting them up by having that person agree to a modest request. The foot-in-the-door technique succeeds owing to a basic human reality that social scientists call [...] "successive approximations". Essentially, the more a subject goes along with small requests or commitments, the more likely that subject is to continue in a desired direction of attitude or behavioral change and feel obligated to go along with larger requests. FITD works by first getting a small [...] "yes" [...] and then getting an even bigger [...] "yes".|$|E
50|$|The door-in-the-face (DITF) {{technique}} is a compliance method commonly studied in social psychology. The persuader attempts {{to convince the}} respondent to comply by making a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> that the respondent will most likely turn down, much like a metaphorical slamming of a door in the persuader's face. The respondent is then more likely {{to agree to a}} second, more reasonable request, than if that same request is made in isolation. The DITF technique can be contrasted with the foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique, in which a persuader begins with a small request and gradually increases the demands of each request. Both the FITD and DITF techniques increase the likelihood a respondent will agree to the second request.|$|E

50|$|With {{research}} {{starting in}} 1966 by Freedman & Fraser, foot-in-the door {{is one of}} the earliest and most researched compliance gaining techniques. This technique gains compliance by making a smaller easy <b>request</b> then a <b>larger</b> more difficult <b>request</b> at a later time. The smaller request is usually one that would be widely accepted without scrutiny. The <b>larger</b> <b>request</b> is usually the actual the task or goal wanted to be completed.|$|R
50|$|The door in {{the face}} technique, {{otherwise}} known as the rejection-then-retreat technique, involves making an outrageous request that someone will almost certainly turn down, and then make the smaller request that was the favor of interest all along. If done skillfully, the second request {{is seen as a}} concession so compliance with the second request is obtained. However, one must proceed with caution when using this technique. If the first request is so big that it is seen as unreasonable, the {{door in the}} face technique proves useless as the concession made after is not perceived as genuine. The door in the face technique is {{not to be confused with}} the foot in the door technique where individuals getting a person to agree with a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> by first getting them to agree to a moderate request.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{comparing}} reciprocal concessions {{with social}} responsibility found neither explanation to be sufficient. This study employed confederates {{who asked for}} donations door-to-door. Participants were either given a large, moderate, or small request initially. The <b>large</b> <b>request</b> involved 10 hours of volunteering for several weeks, the moderate request involved a $30.00 donation, and the small request involved a donation of any amount. The confederate gave the smaller request after an initial large or moderate one. Participants then filled out a questionnaire that asked about the respondent's perceived obligation to comply, perceptions of negotiation and/or helping in the situation, and whether the respondent was friends with the confederate. Results show that participants {{were more likely to}} comply for friends than strangers, the DITF technique had greater compliance overall than a small request alone, and the DITF technique had larger increases in compliance for strangers. Findings regarding social responsibility and reciprocal concessions were inconclusive, with high correlations between perceptions of negotiation and guilt as well as guilt and obligation. The researchers suggest that both of the explanations work together in the DITF effect.|$|E
50|$|Research {{investigating}} reciprocal {{concessions and}} in-group-out-group biases found both reciprocal concessions and in-group context {{to be important}} in the DITF technique. In-groups are groups that a person feels that they belong to, while out-groups are ones that a person does not belong to and might perceive negatively. This study employed two different types of confederates, in-group confederates who dressed and acted like college students and out-group confederates who dressed and acted more formally. The in-group confederates introduced themselves as university students, while the out-group confederates introduced themselves as private business school students. All of {{the participants in this study}} went to the same university as the in-group confederates. The confederates either made a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> then a smaller one, a smaller request alone, or offered the participant a choice of both requests. Results show greater compliance to the second smaller request for the in-group confederates compared to out-group confederates, but there was still a DITF effect in the out-group context. Participants were most likely to comply to requests from those within their social groups, yet they still had increased compliance to the smaller second request for people outside of their social groups. The researchers suggest that this is evidence for reciprocal concessions because the influence of social group and the DITF effect work independently of each other, therefore, there must be another explanation for DITF that does not involve in-group-out-group biases. The researchers fail to mention the social responsibility explanation, however.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Reliability-based hybrid ARQ (RB-HARQ) is a {{recently}} introduced approach to incremental-redundancy ARQ. In RB-HARQ, the bits {{that are to}} be retransmitted are adaptively selected at the receiver based on the estimated bit reliabilities. This technique has the potential to improve performance and minimize retransmission size by targetting those bits that are likely to be in error. However, previous versions of the RB-HARQ algorithm have resulted in <b>large</b> <b>request</b> (NACK) packets that made the technique appropriate only for systems that can tolerate <b>large</b> <b>request</b> packets on the feedback link. In this paper, we show that RB-HARQ is effective with convolutional codes, and we exploit the time-correlation properties of these codes to significantly reduce the size of the retransmission requests.

40|$|A common {{pattern in}} the {{architectures}} of modern interac-tive web-services is that of <b>large</b> <b>request</b> fan-outs, where even a single end-user request (task) arriving at an application server triggers tens to thousands of data accesses (sub-tasks) to different stateful backend servers. The overall response time of each task is bottlenecked by the completion time of the slowest sub-task, making such workloads highly sensi-tive to the tail of latency distribution of the backend tier. The large number of decentralized application servers and skewed workload patterns exacerbate the challenge in ad-dressing this problem. We address these challenges through BetteR Batch (BRB). By carefully scheduling requests in a decentralized and task-aware manner, BRB enables low-latency distributed storage systems to deliver predictable performance {{in the presence of}} <b>large</b> <b>request</b> fan-outs. Our preliminary simulation results based on production workloads show that our proposed de-sign is at the 99 th percentile latency within 38 % of an ideal system model while offering latency improvements over the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2.

40|$|A {{labeling}} {{technique was}} employed to explore processes underlying the ef-fects of experience. It was found that labeled individuals both behaved and perceived themselves {{in a manner consistent}} with their label. However, these effects were mediated by the consistency of the label with the individual's initial self-schema and the availability of other relevant cues. The findings are interpreted in terms of an extended self-perception explanation that incor-porates the notion of cue salience. The effect of individuals ' behavior on their subse-quent action has emerged as a significant issue in consumer behavior research. Inquiry pertaining to this issue has been based primarily on self-perception the-ory (Bem 1972). According to this formulation, indi-viduals employ their own behavior and the circum-stances in which that behavior occurs as cues to guide their subsequent actions. To the extent that behavior is attributed to internal causes, and is not viewed as motivated by external factors such as incentives or social pressure, a positive attitude toward the behavior is acquired that, in turn, directs future behavior. Tests of self-perception predictions have yielded what seems to be strong support for the theory. One source of evidence emerges from investigations using the foot-in-the-door paradigm. This entails gaining compliance with a small request in the hope of en-hancing compliance with a subsequent larger request. In self-perception terms, it is expected that those who comply with a small request will view themselves as the kind of people who engage in such behaviors, and this self-perception will result in greater compliance with a <b>large</b> <b>request</b> than if the <b>large</b> <b>request</b> alone was solicited. In a substantial number of investigations, where the delay between small and large requests ranged from a day to several weeks, the findings are consistent with the self-perception prediction (Freed...|$|E
