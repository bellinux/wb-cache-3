50|$|Since it is {{shorter than}} λ/4 the T antenna {{has a high}} {{capacitive}} reactance. In transmitting antennas, to make the antenna resonant {{so it can be}} driven efficiently, this capacitance must be canceled out by adding an inductor, a loading coil, in series with the bottom of the antenna. Particularly at lower frequencies, the high inductance and capacitance compared to its low radiation resistance makes the <b>loaded</b> <b>antenna</b> behave like a high Q tuned circuit, with a narrow bandwidth over which it will remain impedance matched to the transmission line, compared to a λ/4 monopole. To operate over a large frequency range the loading coil often must be adjustable, and adjusted when the frequency is changed to keep the SWR low. The high Q also causes a high voltage on the antenna, roughly Q times the driving-point voltage. The insulators at the ends must be designed to withstand these voltages. In high power transmitters the output power is often limited by the onset of corona discharge on the wires.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. An {{efficient}} radiating strucllire {{was needed}} for borehole pulsed radar applications in the 10 - 100 MHz frequency band. Both resistively loaded and insulated wire antennas were investigated and an active antenna is proposed as a fmal solution. The study proceeded from the characterization {{of the origin of}} radiation on a conductive dipole wire antenna when excited with a transient. Different radiation mechanisms were identified when the antenna was excited with a current or voltage source. The wire antenna in insulated surroundings was modelled using transmission line theory to simulate the antenna in the borehole environment. The transmission line model proved to be useful for investigating conducting and resistively loaded antennas for the dimensions associated with borehole surveys. From the modelling results, it became apparent that the asymmetric resistively <b>loaded</b> <b>antenna</b> might provide the best practical solution. This antenna displays reasonably stable input impedance and low far-field variations for different theta angles across the desired frequency band. Different percentage Wu-King resistive profiles were studied to show that a 50 % reduction in the normal Wu-King resistor values will add only a little ringing but have better amplitude response than the 100 % Wu-King loading. The asymmetric resistively <b>loaded</b> <b>antenna</b> has better sensitivity to receiving transients when combined with a high impedance source load than when symmetrically loading the antenna. An active antenna incorporating the asymmetric resistively <b>loaded</b> <b>antenna</b> and a low noise current feedback front end amplifier was built and measured in an air environment. The results show that the active antenna has a flat transfer function and reacts as a wide band electric field probe with better resolution than in the conventional 50 Q loaded cas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{with the}} performance of different loaded (e. g. inverted L, T, I and C-shaped antennas) and unloaded wire antennas as electromagnetic interference (EMI) sensors. To determine electromagnetic radiation from an electronic component, it is required to evaluate the field strength at a certain distance from it using the sensor. The most common performance descriptor of a sensor is its antenna factor. Here, the method of moments with pulse basis function and point-matching technique has been used to evaluate the current distribution on the antenna surface, and hence, the antenna factor of different wire antennas. The same theory for unloaded antennas has been extended for different loaded-wire <b>antennas.</b> The <b>loaded</b> <b>antennas</b> in transmitting mode are widely used for low-frequency communication.
