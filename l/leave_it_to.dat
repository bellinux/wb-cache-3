5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti {{believe that}} king Nynetjer, the third {{ruler of the}} Second dynasty and {{predecessor}} to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, {{in the hope that}} the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{concerned}} property bequeathed in {{the will}} of Alfred's father, Æthelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will. Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, stipulating that {{all of it was}} to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. Æthelred refused, offering instead to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, and the need to provide for their children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother's children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.|$|E
5|$|The second film, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card, was {{released}} in Japan on July 15, 2000. It provided a conclusion to the TV series, in which Syaoran returns to Tokyo in hopes of getting Sakura's answer to his love confession, but her own confession is interrupted {{by the appearance of}} a 53rd Clow Card. It {{was released}} to LD (as a limited edition) and DVD in January 2001, and to VHS in July 2001. It {{was released in}} North America to DVD by Pioneer in November 2003 and featured an English dub by Bang Zoom! Entertainment instead of Nelvana and Ocean Studios, now with Kari Wahlgren as Sakura, and this time retaining the original character names and the content unedited and uncut. The films as released by Pioneer (later renamed Geneon) remained in print in North America until late 2007. A bonus short film titled <b>Leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Kero! was played with the theatrical screening of the second film.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse's {{early period}} {{as a writer}} {{came to an end}} in 1908 with the {{serialisation}} of The Lost Lambs, published the following year in book form as {{the second half of the}} novel Mike. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte—"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: Psmith in the City (1910), a burlesque of banking; Psmith, Journalist (1915) set in New York; and <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Psmith (1923), set at Blandings Castle.|$|E

5|$|Work for {{the actors}} began in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles {{was recorded in}} studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they found their performances no different to film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted such {{that they could not}} ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with directorial approval. To prepare for his role as Michael, Luke gained 25 pounds and studied Rockstar's previous games, starting with Grand Theft Auto IV. He considered Michael's characterisation to be an amalgamation of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal of Ward Cleaver in the American sitcom <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Beaver (1957–63) and Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana in the 1983 film Scarface.|$|E

Hugh Beaumont had died the year before of a heart attack, so she played his widow. She also appeared in the subsequent revival of the series, The New <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Beaver, from 1985-89. During the run of The New <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> Beaver, Billingsley became the voice of Nanny on Muppet Babies from 1984-91.
