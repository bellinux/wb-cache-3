He enlisted in the United States Navy, where he would spend four years. He trained in the Navy Air Corps to become a carrier-based night fighter pilot flying F6F Hellcats.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 1939, Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, {{breaking}} the Munich Agreement, which caused the French Army to start mobilizing {{in anticipation of}} a coming war. Shortly afterwards, several of the film's electricians and technicians left to join the army. Set designer Eugène Lourié <b>left</b> <b>because</b> he was Jewish and a communist, and Max Douy took over as the film's set designer.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the <b>left.</b> <b>Because</b> of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he {{spent the rest of}} World War II working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments.|$|E
5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than a binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew {{to be with their}} husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some <b>left</b> <b>because</b> of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E

5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none <b>left</b> <b>because</b> of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E
5|$|Fifield (Sean Harris) is a {{geologist}} on the Prometheus. After waking up, he rejects friendly overtures from Millburn and casts doubt on Shaw and Holloway's mission hypothesis. Fifield accompanies the expedition to an artificial structure and deploys his spectagraphs, which {{begin to develop}} a layout for the Juggernaut. When the expedition encounters a decapitated Engineer, Fifield abandons his research and leaves the group with Millburn following. They become lost, failing to rendezvous {{with the rest of}} the expedition who has <b>left</b> <b>because</b> of the storm, and find a mound of Engineer corpses and a hidden room containing the thawed, mutating black liquid. They also encounter Hammerpedes: extraterrestrial, eel-like creatures which attack them. Fifield decapitates one, and its corrosive blood melts his helmet. The deformed and mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus, where he attacks the crew and murders several members before he is killed.|$|E
5|$|Frank Carter the {{original}} vocalist of Gallows announced in early July 2011 {{that he would}} be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started to believe that he <b>left</b> <b>because</b> he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted to go in a more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false.|$|E

5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and <b>left</b> <b>because</b> of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father <b>left</b> <b>because</b> Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{began his}} career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 {{alongside}} Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires he finished in sixth place earning one point, something achieved by {{only a handful of}} drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he <b>left</b> <b>because</b> of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.|$|E

25|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, Polish Jews began to leave Poland soon after the Second World War ended. Many <b>left</b> <b>because</b> {{they did not want}} to live under a Communist regime, which confiscated all private property. Some <b>left</b> <b>because</b> {{they did not want to}} live where their family members had been murdered, instead {{choosing}} to live with relatives in different countries. Many wanted to go to British Mandate of Palestine, soon to be the new state of Israel, especially after Gen. Spychalski signed a decree allowing Jews to leave Poland without visas or exit permits. Yet others <b>left</b> <b>because</b> many Poles viewed Jews with hostility due to antisemitic prejudice.|$|E
