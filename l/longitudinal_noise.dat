The solution of master equation is found analytically and analyzed in a broad range of parameters. The fast transverse noise affects the transition probability during much longer time (the accumulation time) than the longitudinal one. The action of the fast <b>longitudinal</b> <b>noise</b> is restricted by the shorter Landau-Zener time, the same as in the regular Landau-Zener process.

40|$|The {{effects of}} valence band {{anisotropy}} on longitudinal and transverse high‐field differential mobilities, diffusivities, and thermal noise temperatures were theoretically investigated.

40|$|As {{telecommunications}} traffic grows {{in response to}} the internet and other high bandwidth users, there will be an increasing need to operate at high data rates that are beyond the processing speeds of electronics. Semiconductor lasers which incorporate individually contacted sections with direct current injection can be applied for high speed optical signal processing because they offer bistabilities, self-pulsations (SP), and excitability on a very fast time scale. SPs are particularly interesting since applications such as clock recovery for signal regeneration and demultiplexing can be addressed. Different laser designs have been investigated to tailor fast SPs. Devices containing two DFB sections provide SP due to dispersive Q-switching (DQS) with pulsation rates in the order of the relaxation oscillations, as well as mode beating pulsations in dual-mode lasers with two highly-pumped DFB sections. In this talk we focus on experiments with lasers where the optical feedback is given by semiconductor sections without a grating. This situation was intensively studied theoretically, originally by Tager and Petermann who predicted very fast SPs. Recently, our cooperation partners at WIAS have created comprehensive bifurcation diagrams, which help the experimentalist to prepare and control the desired laser dynamics. In addition, their simulation tool LDSL is used to understand the impact of effects such as spontaneous emission <b>noise,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> spatial hole burning and nonlinear gain saturation, all of which are present in fabricated devices. For the PFL device, which is the simplest design of monolithically integrated feedback device, both Tager-Petermann and DQS self-pulsations, as well as excitability at a homoclinic bifurcation are demonstrated. However, the feedback strength in experimental devices is low due to optical losses which arise in the integrated feedback cavity. Furthermore, there is no means to vary the feedback strength, which results in restricted control of the frequency {{and the quality of the}} SP...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the monitoring {{and the experience}} of two full scale trials with surface dressing. In one of them modified emulsion was tested on the primary road 84 between Kasteln-Laforsen in the county Hälsingland in the north of Sweden. The test sections were produced during year 2001. A second full scale trial test was carried through during year 2004 with the purpose to optimise the utilizing of the stone aggregate (chippings) with different types of fractions 4 - 8, 4 - 16 and 8 - 16 mm. This trial was carried through on the secondary road 723 between Heden and Färila also in the county Hälsingland. In addition to testing different types of binders, the effect of breaking additive was studied in the respects of how soon the surface dressing could be swept from excess of loose stones after the surface treatment was carried out and the time of the year the surface treatment was carried out. The test sections have been monitored with respect to macro texture, rut depth, <b>longitudinal</b> evenness and <b>noise</b> emission as well as by visual inspections of damages and defects. In addition to this the laboratory testing of the wear resistance and the testing of the sensibility to the effect of water have been carried out. For this purpose a modified laboratory test method (Prall method), for surface dressing, has been used. During the production phase of the surface dressing some advantages were noticed by the use of polymer modified bitumen emulsion {{with the addition of a}} breaking additive. In principle the method is to inject the breaking additive into the emulsion just before spreading of the bituminous emulsion on the road. The stone aggregate was fixed to the road surface after a relatively short time which made it possible to sweep the surface treatment from the excess of loose stones after a few hours after the production of the surface treatment. Modified bitumen emulsion combined with the breaking additive showed consequently positive effects for the road users through better accessibility and a less risk of loose stones damaging the vehicles...|$|R
40|$|In {{the ideal}} case, noise {{measurements}} with four contacts minimize {{the contribution of}} the contact interface. There is a need to characterize conductance noise and noise correction factors for the different geometries provided with four contacts, as already is the case for resistivity measurements with van der Pauw structures. Here, we calculate the noise correction factors for two geometries with a pair of sensors and a pair of current driver electrodes placed in a square array. The first geometry investigated is a very large film compared to the distance L between four circular electrodes, which are placed in a square array far away from the borders of the film. The second is a square-shaped conductive film with side length L and provided with four quarter-circle corner contacts with radius l. The effect of the conductance noise in the film can be observed between current free sensors in a four-point measurement or between current carrying drivers in a two-point measurement. Our analytical expressions are based on approximations to solve the integrals (J·) 2 dA and |J| 4 dA for the voltage noise measured across a pair of sensors, SVQ, and across the drivers, SVD, respectively. The first and second integrands represent the squared dot product of the current density and adjoint current density and the modulus of the current density to the fourth power, respectively. The current density J in the samples is due to the current I passing through the driver contacts. The calculated expressions are applicable to samples with thickness tl 0. 1 L. Hence, the disturbances in the neighborhood of the sensors on J and of the drivers on are ignored. Noise correction factors for two- and four-point measurements are calculated for sensors on an equipotential (transversal noise) with the driver contacts on the diagonal of a square and for sensors next to each other {{on one side of the}} square with the drivers next to each other on the other side of the square (<b>longitudinal</b> <b>noise).</b> In all cases the noise between the sensors is smaller and less sensitive to the contact size 2 l/L than the noise between the drivers. The ratio SVQ/SVD becomes smaller with smaller contact radius l. Smaller sensors give a better suppression of interface noise at the contacts. But overly low 2 l/L values result in overly high resistance between the sensors and too strong a contribution of thermal noise at the sensors. Therefore, equations are derived to calculate the current level needed to observe 1 /f conductance fluctuations on top of the thermal noise. The results from the calculated analytical expressions show good agreement with experimental results obtained from the noise in carbon sheet resistance and numerical results. Transversal noise measurements on a square sample with corner contacts are recommended to characterize the 1 /f noise of the layer. This is due to the increased current densities in the sample compared to the open structure, which result in easier detection of the 1 /f on top of the thermal noise. © 2007 American Institute of Physic...|$|E

The main manufacturing processes are milling, grinding and assembly by welding of the tubes. The mechanized and manual handling and transport operations involved were subjecting the operators to great strain through impact noise and physical exertion. The highest sound levels were generated by the dumping of the tube into two collecting pockets, and amounted to 111 dB(A) at the workplaces. Further main noise sources were the collision of the tubes on the cross conveyor, {{the separation of the}} individual tubes and the transfer to and from roller tables as well as the turnover of the tube panels abaout their <b>longitudinal</b> axis. The <b>noise</b> sources, their significance as well as the factors affecting sound radiation have been determined on the basis of noise measurements in the initial condition. Design measures have made it possible to substantially reduce the greatest part of impact noises. The measures implemented include completely new designs, e. g. two low-noise collecting pockets, a cross conveyor with controlled material displacement and the turnover device as well as numerous modifications of existing equipment units in the form of additional lifting and lowering elements, altered level positions, sound-damping coverings, reduced speeds, interventions in the sequencing control and the like. It was thus possible to fully elemeinate the previous strian and exposure to danger of the operating personnel in manual tumover as well as the risk of injury during turnover by crane of three- and seventube panels.

40|$|A bench-top dual cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) system was developed {{consisting of two}} orthogonally placed 40 x 30 cm 2 flat-panel detectors and two conventional X-ray tubes with two individual high-voltage generators sharing the same rotational axis. The X-ray source to detector distance is 150 cm and X-ray source to rotational axis distance is 100 cm for both subsystems. The objects are scanned through 200 ° of rotation. The dual CBCT (DCBCT) system utilized 110 ° of projection data from one detector and 90 ° from the other while the two individual single CBCTs utilized 200 ° data from each detector. The system performance was characterized in terms of uniformity, contrast, spatial resolution, noise power spectrum and CT number linearity. The uniformity, within the axial slice and along the <b>longitudinal</b> direction, and <b>noise</b> power spectrum were assessed by scanning a water bucket; the contrast and CT number linearity were measured using the Catphan phantom; and the spatial resolution was evaluated using a tungsten wire phantom. A skull phantom and a ham were also scanned to provide qualitative evaluation of high- and low-contrast resolution. Each measurement was compared between dual and single CBCT systems. Compared with single CBCT, the DCBCT presented: 1) a decrease in uniformity by 1. 9 % in axial view and 1. 1 % in the longitudinal view, as averaged for four energies (80, 100, 125 and 150 kVp); 2) comparable or slightly better contrast to noise ratio (CNR) for low-contrast objects and comparable contrast for high-contrast objects; 3) comparable spatial resolution; 4) comparable CT number linearity with R 2 &# 8805; 0. 99 for all four tested energies; 5) lower noise power spectrum in magnitude. DCBCT images of the skull phantom and the ham demonstrated both high-contrast resolution and good soft-tissue contrast. One of the major challenges for clinical implementation of four-dimensional (4 D) CBCT is the long scan time. To investigate the 4 D imaging capabilities of the DCBCT system, motion phantom studies were conducted to validate the efficiency by comparing 4 D images generated from 4 D-DCBCT and 4 D-CBCT. First, a simple sinusoidal profile was used to confirm the scan time reduction. Next, both irregular sinusoidal and patient-derived profiles were used to investigate the advantage of temporally correlated orthogonal projections due to a reduced scan time. Normalized mutual information (NMI) between 4 D-DCBCT and 4 D-CBCT was used for quantitative evaluation. For the simple sinusoidal profile, the average NMI for ten phases between two single 4 D-CBCTs was 0. 336, indicating the maximum NMI {{that can be achieved}} for this study. The average NMIs between 4 D-DCBCT and each single 4 D-CBCT were 0. 331 and 0. 320. For both irregular sinusoidal and patient-derived profiles, 4 D-DCBCT generated phase images with less motion blurring when compared with single 4 D-CBCT. For dual kV energy imaging, we acquired 80 kVp projections and 150 kVp projections, with an additional 0. 8 mm tin filtration. The virtual monochromatic (VM) technique was implemented, by first decomposing these projections into acrylic and aluminum basis material projections to synthesize VM projections, which were then used to reconstruct VM CBCTs. The effect of the VM CBCT on metal artifact reduction was evaluated with an in-house titanium-BB phantom. The optimal VM energy to maximize CNR for iodine contrast and minimize beam hardening in VM CBCT was determined using a water phantom containing two iodine concentrations. The linearly-mixed (LM) technique was implemented by linearly combining the low- (80 kVp) and high-energy (150 kVp) CBCTs. The dose partitioning between low- and high-energy CBCTs was varied (20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % for low-energy) while keeping total dose approximately equal to single-energy CBCTs, measured using an ion chamber. Noise levels and CNRs for four tissue types were investigated for dual-energy LM CBCTs in comparison with single-energy CBCTs at 80, 100, 125 and 150 kVp. The VM technique showed a substantial reduction of metal artifacts at 100 keV with a 40 % reduction in the background standard deviation compared with a 125 kVp single-energy scan of equal dose. The VM energy to maximize CNR for both iodine concentrations and minimize beam hardening in the metal-free object was 50 keV and 60 keV, respectively. The difference in average noise levels measured in the phantom background was 1. 2 % for dual-energy LM CBCTs and equivalent-dose single-energy CBCTs. CNR values in the LM CBCTs of any dose partitioning were better than those of 150 kVp single-energy CBCTs. The average CNRs for four tissue types with 80 % dose fraction at low-energy showed 9. 0 % and 4. 1 % improvement relative to 100 kVp and 125 kVp single-energy CBCTs, respectively. CNRs for low contrast objects improved as dose partitioning was more heavily weighted towards low-energy (80 kVp) for LM CBCTs. For application of the dual-energy technique in the kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) range, we acquired both MV projections (from gantry angle of 0 ° to 100 °) and kV projections (90 ° to 200 °) with the current orthogonal kV/MV imaging hardware equipped in modern linear accelerators, as gantry rotated a total of 110 °. A selected range of overlap projections between 90 ° to 100 ° were then decomposed into two material projections using experimentally determined parameters from orthogonally stacked aluminum and acrylic step-wedges. Given attenuation coefficients of aluminum and acrylic at a predetermined energy, one set of VM projections could be synthesized from two corresponding sets of decomposed projections. Two linear functions were generated using projection information at overlap angles to convert kV and MV projections at non-overlap angles to approximate VM projections for CBCT reconstruction. The CNRs were calculated for different inserts in VM CBCTs of a CatPhan phantom with various selected energies and compared with those in kV and MV CBCTs. The effect of overlap projection number on CNR was evaluated. Additionally, the effect of beam orientation was studied by scanning the CatPhan sandwiched with two 5 cm solid-water phantoms on both lateral sides and an electronic density phantom with two metal bolt inserts. Proper selection of VM energy (30 keV and 40 keV for low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polymethylpentene (PMP), 2 MeV for Delrin) provided comparable or even better CNR results as compared with kV or MV CBCT. An increased number of overlap between kV and MV projections demonstrated only marginal improvements of CNR for different inserts (with the exception of LDPE) and therefore one projection overlap was found to be sufficient for the CatPhan study. It was also evident that the optimal CBCT image quality was achieved when MV beams penetrated through the heavy attenuation direction of the object. In conclusion, the performance of a bench-top DCBCT imaging system has been characterized and is comparable to that of a single CBCT. The 4 D-DCBCT provides an efficient 4 D imaging technique for motion management. The scan time is reduced by approximately a factor of two. The temporally correlated orthogonal projections improved the image blur across 4 D phase images. Dual-energy CBCT imaging techniques were implemented to synthesize VM CBCT and LM CBCTs. VM CBCT was effective at achieving metal artifact reduction. Depending on the dose-partitioning scheme, LM CBCT demonstrated the potential to improve CNR for low contrast objects compared with single-energy CBCT acquired with equivalent dose. A novel technique was developed to generate VM CBCTs from kV/MV projections. This technique has the potential to improve CNR at selected VM energies and to suppress artifacts at appropriate beam orientations. Dissertatio...|$|R
