40|$|This study {{followed}} {{one male}} secondary school cohort over three years, prior and during a positive education implementation at their school. The {{purpose of this}} research was two-fold. Firstly, it investigated the predictive power of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> on the Wellbeing of this cohort. Secondly it examined whether the whole school approach towards positive education had any effect or impact on the predictors and outcome. This research was conducted as Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> have been proposed as protective factors for adolescent wellbeing in theoretical literature, however, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence that demonstrates this. Literature that demonstrates Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are concepts which can successfully be taught as part of a positive education program to enhance student wellbeing is also limited. To conduct the research, a longitudinal mixed method research design was chosen. It followed a sequential exploratory mixed method approach, quantitatively measuring Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life,</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Wellbeing via questionnaires at four time points over two years. The quantitative findings were then used to inform the design of three semistructured focus group interviews with fifteen randomly selected participants. This study found Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> to be strong predictors of secondary boys’ Wellbeing, and, each predictor can be taught as part of a whole school approach towards positive education to enhance wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education is dependent on the successful implementation of the whole school approach. In the case of this study, Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education could be improved by further collaboration with parents/carers/guardians, and, further teacher training on applying student-centred learning to the positive education based classes. These findings are significant as they empirically demonstrate Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are protective factors for male adolescent Wellbeing, and, these predictors are teachable concepts that can be taught as part of a whole school approach to positive education to enhance male adolescent wellbeing...|$|R
