5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The main {{treatment}} for obesity consists of dieting and physical exercise. Diet programs may produce weight loss over the short term, but maintaining this weight <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> frequently difficult and often requires making exercise {{and a lower}} food energy diet a permanent part of a person's lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E

5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Its {{distribution}} {{has been}} greatly reduced and is now discontinuous. Decades of poaching for its velvety pelt, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s, considerably diminished population numbers. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and wild population estimates are typically below 5,000. The Guianas {{are one of the}} last real strongholds for the species, which also enjoys modest numbers — and significant protection — in the Peruvian Amazonian basin. It {{is one of the most}} endangered mammal species in the neotropics. Habitat degradation and <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> the greatest current threat. The giant otter is also rare in captivity; in 2003, only 60 animals were being held.|$|E

5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Many {{projects}} aim {{to prevent}} or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> a natural process {{that should not be}} counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Mass <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has {{one of the}} highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} the court adopted a fairly broad {{definition}} of “sale or exchange” with regard to capital gains and <b>losses</b> <b>is</b> good for taxpayers with regard to realized gains, but bad for taxpayers with regard to realized <b>losses.</b> This <b>is</b> {{because of the way}} that ordinary income and ordinary <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> treated relative to the way that capital gains and capital <b>losses</b> <b>are</b> treated.|$|R
5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that the}} risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. Theodore Savas and J. David Dameron give a {{range of}} 150-500 killed, wounded and captured. Samuel Roads numbers the {{casualties}} of 47 killed and 70 wounded. Henry Dawson estimates 50 killed, 150 wounded and 17 missing for McDougall's and Spencer's commands but has no information on the losses in Haslet's regiment.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from {{saturated}} air and by eating damp sand. Water <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> minimised by the rectal epithelium, which absorbs water, ensuring that the faeces is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E

5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E

40|$|A {{prestressing}} {{system was}} designed to strengthen reinforced concrete (RC) beams with prestressed carbon fiber laminate (CFL). During different prestressing processes, prestress <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> measured using strain gauges attached {{on the surface of}} CFL along the length direction. The prestress <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> 50 – 68 % of the whole prestress <b>loss,</b> which <b>is</b> typically associated with CFL slipping between the grip anchors. Approximately 20 – 27 % of the prestress <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> caused by the elastic shortening of the RC beam. An analytical model using linear-elastic theory was constructed to calculate the prestress loss caused by CFL slipping between the anchors and the elastic shortening of the strengthened beams. The compared results showed that the analytical model of prestress loss can describe the experimental data well. Methods of reducing the prestress <b>loss</b> <b>were</b> also suggested. Compared to other experiments, the prestressing system proposed by this research group was effective because the maximum percentage of prestress <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> 14. 9 % and the average prestress <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> 12. 5 %...|$|R
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{relatively}} shallow water {{in which she}} sank, the majority of bodies could not be recovered from Royal Oak. Marked by a buoy at , the wreck has been designated a war grave and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. In clear water conditions, the upturned hull can be seen reaching to within 5m of the surface. The brass letters that formed Royal Oaks name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. They were returned almost twenty years later, and are now displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness. Royal Oaks <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> commemorated in an annual ceremony in which Royal Navy divers place the White Ensign underwater at her stern.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
