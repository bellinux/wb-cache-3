Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>king,</b> the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.|$|E

25|$|Uthman was {{a family}} man who {{apparently}} led a simple life even after becoming the Caliph of the Rashidun Empire and regardless {{of the fact that}} he was rich due to his flourishing family business. The caliphs were paid for their services from bait al-mal, the public treasury, but Uthman never took any salary for his service as a Caliph, as he was independently wealthy. Uthman was also a humanitarian: He developed a custom to free slaves every Friday, look after the widows and orphans, and give unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics that made him a successful leader. As a way of taking care of Muhammad's wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman wasn't completely plain and simple, however: Uthman built a Palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims considered it his first step towards ruling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>King.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tanith is briefly {{visited in}} Ghostmaker, and {{described}} by the Ghosts in various novels. It was a heavily forested world located in the Sabbat Worlds, a cluster of planets in the Segmentum Pacificus. The main export of Tanith was nalwood, which becomes extremely rare after the planet's destruction. Nalwood trees were capable of uprooting and moving; entire forests migrating and making paths through the forests useless as the constant movement erased them. As a result of this, the Tanith have {{a strong sense of}} direction, bred into them by adapting to this environment. It is assumed that Tanith had one major sea or ocean and polar ice caps. Although Tanith's oceans are never mentioned, Trooper Lesp is said to have come from a coastal settlement called Tanith Longshore, where he worked in the fishing industry; confirming that there was at least one sea on Tanith's surface. The capital city of Tanith – surrounded by a giant wall, presumably to keep the nalwood trees from moving into the city – was Tanith Magna. The world was governed by an Elector, and the main governmental building appears to be the Assembly (although Rawne mentions a place called the Elector's Palace when under the influence of psykers on Monthax). It is unclear {{as to whether or not}} the Elector was elected as the title sounds, or if it was an inherited position <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>king.</b> Tanith was split up into counties, not unlike Ireland (Counties Pryze and Cuhulic are mentioned). Each city on Tanith had a Militia, from which a number of Ghosts (including Corbec, Larkin, Mkvenner and Rawne) are drafted into the Imperial Guard. Tanith's native wildlife included larisel, small animals hunted by woodsmen – for their fur and possibly for food – and shoggy; small amphibian creatures with bulging eyes that dwelled by woodland pools in Tanith's forests.|$|E

Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>king.</b> That's why I did this: to protect you from yourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|They take Jesus to Pilate's Court, but Pontius Pilate, the Prefect of Judaea, proves {{extremely}} {{reluctant to}} condemn Jesus; according to Robert W.

The Jewish elders ask the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus, accusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews. The use of the word [...] "king" [...] is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In [...] Jesus states, [...] "My kingdom is not from this world", but he does not unequivocally deny being the King of the Jews. In [...] Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean, and thus comes under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. Pilate sends Jesus to Herod to be tried, but Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put an expensive robe on him to make him look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>king,</b> and return him to Pilate, who then calls together the Jewish elders and announces that he has [...] "not found this man guilty".|$|E
500|$|In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner {{writes that}} Bob {{is built into}} a highbrow snob and {{conservative}} Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart {{is a product of}} a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of [...] "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that [...] "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." [...] He also tries to [...] "manipulate the tastes of the masses" [...] by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, [...] "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who’ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>king!</b> You need me, Springfield!" [...] He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.|$|E
