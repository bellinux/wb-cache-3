40|$|The {{application}} of capacitive sensing technique is widely distributed in different physical domains {{primarily because of}} the diversity in dielectric permittivity and due to its minimum <b>loading</b> <b>error</b> and inertial effects. Atmospheric ice is a complex mixture of water, ice and air which is reflected in its complex dielectric constant. There are many existing atmospheric icing sensors but only few are based on their complex dielectric permittivity measurements. This technique is very suitable because the capacitive variation in this mixture is due to the reorientation of water dipole in the electromagnetic radiation's oscillating field. Depending on the frequency, the dipole may move in time to the field, lag behind it or remain apparently unaffected. This variation is clearly reflected on the Cole-Cole-diagram, which {{is a measure of the}} relaxation frequency. This paper is a detailed understanding of some capacitive sensing techniques in general but based upon dielectric variations and some existing capacitive based atmospheric ice sensing techniques.

It is shown that Python's rich data structure and object-oriented features can be exploited to write programs that are not only significantly more concise than their counter parts written in Fortran, C or C++, but are also numerically efficient. To illustrate this, a two-dimensional finite element code (ELLIPT 2 D) has been written.

In bivariate cases, which involve two correlated quality variables, the traditional statistical process control (SPC) charts are known to be effective in monitoring but they are lack of diagnosis. As such, process monitoring and diagnosis is critical towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two correlated variables (bivariate), whereby selection of statistical process control (SPC) scheme becomes more critical. In this research, a scheme to address balanced monitoring and accurate diagnosis was investigated. Investigation has been focused on an integrated SPC - ANN model. This model utilizes the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart and ANN model in two-stage monitoring and diagnosis technique.

40|$|A general {{numerical}} {{algorithm is}} presented {{that produces a}} complete set of orthogonal vectors {{that can be used to}} reduce the number of unknown displacements required to produce an accurate analysis of structures subjected to both static and dynamic loads. For any specified type of <b>loading</b> <b>error</b> indicators are calculated and the generation of the vectors can be terminated automatically; hence, the engineer/program-user need only to specify the error tolerance and not the number of vectors requested. Therefore, an optimum number of vectors are calculated and there is no need to add approximate static load corrections to the solution or to be concerned about missing mass in a dynamic response analysis. The new algorithm generates a different set of vectors for different types of spatial loading acting on the structure. Thus, the vectors generated are a set of Natural Load Dependent, NLD, vectors for the problem to be solved. A special application of the NLD vector algorithm, using random load vectors and iteration, produces exacts dynamic eigenvectors, rigid-body modes and static elastic modes for any structural system. However, the use of these exact eigenvectors in a dynamic response analysis may require a very large number of vectors to produce the same accuracy as obtained by the use of a small number of NLD vectors. The NLD vectors are always a linear combination of the exact eigenvectors; however, eigenvectors are not calculated unless they are required to obtain an accurate solution.

40|$|This work evaluates and {{characterizes the}} impact of the support size and mining {{dilution}} of a block model in the operation and selection of equipment at an open pit mine. An exploratory analysis and geostatistical modelling of the grades assayed on a set of drill hole samples is performed, which allows constructing a grade model on a dense grid by means of a conditional simulation. The grades are then averaged to greater selective mining unit supports in order to proceed with the study and methodology. First, the metal-tonnage curves are used to analyse the loss of selectivity on the in situ resources caused by a change of support. Concerning the ore reserves and their mining sequence, defined in the pit optimization and analysis process, the same curves prove that the loss of selectivity is more accentuated. Second, the importance of the block boundary dilution produced during mining operations is assessed. its value depends on the amount of ore in contact with waste, on the <b>loading</b> <b>error</b> of the equipment and on the ore loss/waste dilution criterion assumed by the planner. The dilution percentage and the differences between waste and ore grades become higher when the block size decreases. For these reasons, considering the dilution in the production plans makes mining a small support more constraining. An adequate delimitation of the orebody can improve the mining selectivity, leading to greater income. Finally, a study of the increase in mining cost that provides a zero difference in NFV between the different block size options is carried out, {{in order to determine the}} maximum increase in mining costs for which it remains profitable to mine at a smaller block size...|$|E
