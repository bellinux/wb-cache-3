Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes.

Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental <b>lighting</b> <b>treatments</b> and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high beam lamps on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>treatment.</b> Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with <b>lighting</b> <b>treatments</b> beyond an illuminated low beam headlamp may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|R

For this reason, in this work we examined the effect of low light irradiance on lamb’s lettuce during storage at a {{low temperature}}. Partitioned <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> (4 doses per 1 h per day; 8 doses per 1 h per day; 16 doses per 0. 5 h per day) showed positive effects, while continuous <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> (8 h per day) were deleterious. The content of photosynthetic pigments, energy-linked metabolites and antioxidants was evaluated at the beginning and after 6 days of storage in comparison with samples stored at 4 °C in the dark. The content of such bioactive compounds was increased or at least similar in samples stored under partitioned light and at a higher temperature (6 °C) when compared to those stored in the dark. We suggest that continuous <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> could promote photosynthesis but also cause photo-damage during cold storage of lamb’s lettuce. However, the photosynthesis under partitioned low light is only partially activated and so the photo-damage is limited, although the metabolism of green tissues would be still able to provide carbon moieties for the synthesis of bioactive molecules, thus delaying senescence. With respect to the samples stored in the dark at a lower temperature (4 °C), partitioned low <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> at 6 °C could contribute to ameliorate the quality of lamb’s lettuce and, at the same time, allow an energy saving...|$|R

40|$|Phytochrome, a membrane-localized biliprotein whose {{conformation}} is shifted reversibly by brief red or far-red <b>light</b> <b>treatments,</b> {{interacts with}} the rhythmic oscillator to regulate leaflet movement and potassium flux in pulvinal motor cells of Samanea. Darkened pinnae exposed briefly to red light (high Pfr level) have less potassium in motor cells in the extensor region, more potassium in motor cells in the flexor region, and smaller angles than those exposed to far-red light (low Pfr level). Increase in temperature from 24 ° to 37 ° increases the differential effect of the <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> during opening (the energetic phase) but not during closure, implying that phytochrome controls an energetic process. It seems likely that phytochrome interacts with rhythmically controlled potassium pumps in flexor and extensor cells.

This culinary herb produces an aroma highly appreciated by consumers, primarily composed of terpenes/terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and fatty-acid- derived volatile molecules. Basil plants were grown under narrow-bandwidth light conditions, and leaf area, height, mass, antioxidant capacity and volatile emissions were measured at various time points. The results indicate reproducible significant differences in specific volatiles, and in biochemical classes of volatiles, compared to greenhouse grown plants. For example, basil plants grown under blue/red/yellow or blue/red/green wavelengths emit higher levels of a subset of monoterpenoid volatiles, while a blue/red/far-red treatment leads to higher levels of most sesquiterpenoid volatile molecules. Specific <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> increase volatile content, mass, and antioxidant capacity.

40|$|Fluorescent {{lighting}} {{has been}} highlighted {{as a significant}} factor in eyestrain, headache, lethargy and other asthenopic (eye related) complaints by office personnel. These three symptoms rate amongst the most highly reported complaints attributed to the office environment. An interventional study was conducted in three data entry offices to assess the effect of fluorescent light flicker and modulation depth on the incidence and severity of common workplace symptoms, productivity and satisfaction with the work environment. Each of the three offices had three lighting regimes installed for a four week period in a crossover design with an initial four week baseline period. The three <b>lighting</b> <b>treatments</b> were selected to represent commonly available lighting conditions and included triphosphor fluorescent tubes with high frequency electronic ballasts and low frequency magnetic ballasts and halophosphate fluorescent tubes with low frequency magnetic ballasts. The study provided evidence to suggest that eyestrain and lethargy symptoms were considered to be more severe in the low frequency halophosphate <b>lighting</b> <b>treatment.</b> There was also a higher incidence of lethargy symptoms in the low frequency halophosphate <b>lighting</b> <b>treatment.</b> In addition, significant relationships were present between perceived decreased productivity (due to the work environment) and increased symptom severity in the low frequency halophosphate <b>lighting</b> <b>treatment.</b> The low frequency and high frequency triphosphor <b>lighting</b> <b>treatments</b> did not differ significantly. No significant relationships were shown between actual or perceived productivity and <b>lighting</b> <b>treatments.</b> There was no evidence to suggest that participants were able to perceive flicker from any of the <b>lighting</b> <b>treatment</b> installations on a consistent basis. When participants perceived flicker it was not considered to be disturbing or annoying. The actual productivity of participants was related to eyestrain and lethargy symptoms in one of the offices studied. The effect size was small to medium, explaining between 2 - 5 % of the variability of the data. Actual productivity was not related to any other measures. Office personnel perceived that their productivity (due to the work environment) and work satisfaction was strongly affected by the eyestrain, headache and lethargy symptoms experienced. These results did not show that flicker frequency or modulation depth affected the severity of eyestrain, lethargy and headache symptoms, the satisfaction of the occupants or their perceived or actual productivity. These findings support previous research that has suggested that differences in task performance may be limited to difficult visual tasks with minimal cognitive or motor components. Further, these results suggest that the effect of low frequency flicker on asthenopic symptoms may also be small and easily overwhelmed by other workplace factors. The breadth of this study was ambitious and featured limitations (such as small sample sizes) that may have impacted on the results found in some analyses. This study may not have been sensitive enough to detect small differences in the health, productivity and satisfaction of office personnel due to fluorescent light flicker. The pattern of responses examined alongside research in this field suggested that differences in the spectral distribution of the tubes may be a culpable factor. A small colour component in the work task and an equally small luminance difference between <b>lighting</b> <b>treatments</b> may have contributed to this finding. However, given that there is limited support for this outcome in the literature, and the previous findings in research examining fluorescent light flicker, these results should be considered as exploratory. Taken together, the research findings present a compelling argument for additional field research. This study provides a foundation that will enable future studies to further quantify the relationships between health, productivity and qualitative aspects of lighting in the work environment...|$|R

Specific leaf area increased with decreasing irradiance, and was inversely correlated with delta C- 13.

We find that the overall amino acid acceptance of the plastid tRNA species is elevated following phytohormone and/or <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> to dark-grown ragi seedlings. In particular, the relative acceptor activities for Leu and Tyr in i(6) A-treated dark-grown, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser and Tyr in IAA-treated dork-grown, and Leu and Lys in i(6) A-treated light-grown ragi coleoptiles were 8 to 20 times higher.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of quality parameters in horticultural crops under artificial light during postharvest storage is important for controlling the shelf-life of the crops. In this work, white light, red light, blue light and dark conditions were used at various durations to evaluate the effects of different spectral properties of light on parameters related to physiological and biochemical processes in green asparagus, and on compounds related to human health. For this aim, the level of glucose, fructose and sucrose, {{as well as that}} of vitamin C and the levels of lignin, chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids and anthocyanins, were determined in apical and basal segments of the edible portion of green asparagus spears before and after <b>light</b> <b>treatments.</b> A dark control was stored at 4 C. The irradiance levels of the <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> were 100, 117 and 116 mmol m 2 s 1, respectively for white, blue and red <b>light.</b> Before <b>treatments,</b> in the apical segments, the content of analysed components were higher than in the basal segments, except for soluble sugars and starch, of which the basal segment exhibited higher levels; these results exhibited different nutritional value of the two segments. After the <b>light</b> <b>treatments,</b> the analysed quality-related parameters were differently influenced in the apical and basal segments during postharvest storage. The increase in dry matter content in the apical segment after both white light and red <b>light</b> <b>treatments</b> was most likely attributable to the presence of physiological postharvest activity, rather than to increased transpiration. The results indicated that light with different spectral properties vs. dark-stored controls had small or no effects on the measured parameters. Both light and dark caused the starch levels to increase in both segments. A decrease in the sugar content in the basal part might be explained by translocation of hexoses from basal towards apical regions of the spear. White light primarily determined the lignin deposition in the apical part most likely due to the synergistic effect of red and blue light on lignin biosynthesis. The vitamin C, chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids decreased in <b>light</b> and dark <b>treatments</b> in both segments.
