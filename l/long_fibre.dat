5000|$|Timothy-grass was unintentionally {{introduced}} to North America by early settlers, and was first described in 1711 by John Hurd from plants growing in New Hampshire. Hurd named the grass [...] "hurd grass" [...] but a farmer named Timothy Hanson began to promote cultivation {{of it as}} a hay about 1720, and the grass has been known by its present name since then. Timothy has now become naturalized throughout most of the US and Canada. It is commonly grown for cattle feed and, in particular, as hay for horses. It is relatively high in fibre, especially when cut late. It is considered a harsh, coarse grass little relished by livestock if cut earlier. It is considered part of the standard mix for grass hay and provides quality nutrition for horses. Timothy hay is a staple food for domestic pet rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, often making up the bulk of their diet. Timothy hay is rich in <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> and its abrasive texture helps to grind down the teeth, keeping both the teeth and jaw in good order.|$|E
40|$|Approximately thirty-four {{percent of}} people who {{experience}} acute low back pain (LBP) will have recurrent episodes. It remains unclear why some people experience recurrences and others do not, but one possible cause is a loss of normal control of the back muscles. We investigated whether the control of the short and <b>long</b> <b>fibres</b> of the deep back muscles was different in people with recurrent unilateral LBP from healthy participants. Recurrent unilateral LBP patients, who were symptom free during testing, and a group of healthy volunteers, participated. Intramuscular and surface electrodes recorded the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the short and <b>long</b> <b>fibres</b> of the lumbar multifidus and the shoulder muscle, deltoid, during a postural perturbation associated with a rapid arm movement. EMG onsets of the short and <b>long</b> <b>fibres,</b> relative to that of deltoid, were compared between groups, muscles, and sides. In association with a postural perturbation, short fibre EMG onset occurred later in participants with recurrent unilateral LBP than in healthy participants (p = 0. 022). The short fibres were active earlier than <b>long</b> <b>fibres</b> on both sides in the healthy participants (p < 0. 001) and on the non-painful side in the LBP group (p = 0. 045), but not on the previously painful side in the LBP group. Activity of deep back muscles is different in people with a recurrent unilateral LBP, despite the resolution of symptoms. Because deep back muscle activity is critical for normal spinal control, the current results provide the first evidence of a candidate mechanism for recurrent episodes. © 2008 International Association for the Study of Pain Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration on loadability and pulp properties during LC refining of mechanical pulp. <b>Long</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration was adjusted to three different levels by screen fractionation of the pulp. The three pulps were refined in a single disc pilot scale LC refiner at similar process conditions. Increased <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration supported a larger refiner gap and resulted in less fibre cutting at a given specific energy consumption. The higher <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration probably contributed to a stronger fibre network that maintained a larger refining gap at certain specific energy consumption. Increased <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration also enabled a higher tensile index increase in the LC refiner at certain fibre length reduction. The study supports a process combining LC refining with screen fractionation, where the <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> fraction is recycled to the refiner feed. This enables a higher loadability and a more effective utilisation of the LC refiner. By using this technology, overall specific energy consumption can be reduced if a larger share of the refining is performed in LC rather than HC refining...|$|E
40|$|Pilot plant coating trials {{compared}} a coating basesheet {{made from}} P. radiata (radiata pine) TMP with several European basesheets. The pine basesheet compared favourably when coated using a metered film press coater though more fibre rising occurred with it during coating. The coated sheet also required more severe calendering conditions {{to meet the}} gloss target. It was suggested that the P. radiata TMP used in the trial basesheet would benefit from additional processing that would promote stripping of material from the <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> wall {{in order to make}} it more collapsible and promote improved strength and surface roughness. The TMP would also benefit from processes that would generate more split fibres. The properties of TMP originating from the Australasian mills of Norske Skog were examined and compared to TMP from spruce. Some additional measurements of %split fibres and bendability were made on the pulps at PFI. A Fiberlab fibre analyser was used extensively to measure fibre dimensions. Factor analysis of pressing experiments aided in identifying the P. radiata pulps that approached the quality of spruce pulp used for coating and SC grades of paper. Pulps were fractionated and the dimensions of the fibres, the specific surface area determined from sedimentation measurements and the physical and optical properties of each of the fractions were measured. Specific surface area, tensile index, roughness and sheet density were all significantly correlated and could be used as measures of fibre development. The <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> fraction was identified as being the poorest quality fibre and most in need of development. Mill screening operations were examined to look at their selectivity in removing the <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> fraction from the rest of the pulp so that it could be further processed to promote fibre collapse and flexibility. High consistency screening was compared with low consistency screening and it was concluded that a multistage low consistency screening system was more selective than a single high consistency screen. When refined in a low consistency refiner the properties of the whole pulp improved but the <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> component showed no detectable improvement in density, tensile or wall thickness. High consistency refining of screen rejects improved the whole pulp properties and the properties of the <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> with significant improvements in specific surface area and reduction in the fibre wall thickness. Improved <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> screen selectivity followed by high consistency refining of the <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> is a strategy for improving the quality of the fibre for a coating basesheet...|$|E

The behaviour of <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> composites subjected to tensile loads has been widely studied and theories concerning the failure mechanisms are accepted and included in standard texts. In many applications compressive strength is important and in flexure failure is often initiated on the compressive side of the composite. However, compressive failure has not been studied thoroughly, {{partly because of the}} large number of failure mechanisms which can occur and the difficulties in conducting meaningful compression tests. The aim of this work was to determine the influence of the matrix on the behaviour of <b>long</b> <b>fibre</b> composites subjected to compressive loads so that failure mechanisms could be predicted more accurately.

25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some <b>long</b> <b>fibres</b> termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the <b>long</b> <b>fibres</b> from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind.
