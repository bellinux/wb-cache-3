40|$|Traffic {{dynamics}} on {{single or}} isolated complex networks {{has been extensively}} studied in the past decade. Recently, several coupled network models {{have been developed to}} describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In a system of interconnected networks, the <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> refer to the physical links between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. Thus, the coupling pattern, i. e., the way <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> are added, has a profound influence on the overall traffic performance. In this paper, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the <b>coupling</b> <b>links,</b> which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative and disassortative couplings. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal configuration of <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> given by the SA algorithm and develop a faster method to select the <b>coupling</b> <b>links.</b> Comment: 5 page...|$|R

40|$|An optical {{resonator}} has a piezoelectric element {{attached to}} a quasi-monolithic structure. The quasi-monolithic structure defines an optical path. Mirrors attached to the structure deflect light along the optical path. The piezoelectric element controllably strains the quasi-monolithic structure to change a length of the optical path by about 1 micron. A first feedback <b>loop</b> <b>coupled</b> to the piezoelectric element provides fine control over the cavity length. The resonator may include a thermally actuated spacer attached to the cavity and a mirror attached to the spacer. The thermally actuated spacer adjusts the cavity length by up to about 20 microns. A second feedback <b>loop</b> <b>coupled</b> to the sensor and heater provides a coarse control over the cavity length.

50|$|There {{are several}} other {{proposals}} {{for the implementation}} of photonic boson sampling. This includes, e.g., the scheme for arbitrarily scalable boson sampling using two nested fiber loops. In this case, the architecture employs time-bin encoding, whereby the incident photons form a pulse train entering the loops. Meanwhile, dynamically controlled <b>loop</b> <b>coupling</b> ratios allow the construction of arbitrary linear interferometers. Moreover, the architecture employs only a single point of interference and may thus be easier to stabilize than other implementations.|$|R

40|$|The {{algebraic}} connectivity UN- 1, i. e. {{the second}} smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, plays {{a crucial role}} in dynamic phenomena such as diffusion processes, synchronization stability, and network robustness. In this work we study the algebraic connectivity in the general context of interdependent networks, or network-of-networks (NoN). The present work shows, both analytically and numerically, how the algebraic connectivity of NoNs experiences a transition. The transition is characterized by a saturation of the algebraic connectivity upon the addition of suffcient <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> (between the two individual networks of a NoN). In practical terms, this shows that NoN topologies require only a fraction of <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> in order to achieve optimal diffusivity. Furthermore, we observe a footprint of the transition on the properties of Fiedler's spectral bisection.
