25|$|Along {{with the}} many {{additions}} that X & Y brought, various improvements to the communication features took place. Using the Player Search System (PSS), players can encounter various online players, including strangers, allowing them to easily initiate battles or trades through consent. The Holo Caster allows the player to receive messages and updates from NPCs via StreetPass and SpotPass. Wonder Trade is a new trading feature that lets players make blind trades with anyone in the world. Other features include O-Powers, temporary powers that can increase stats and can be exchanged with other players, and improvements to the Global Trade System, allowing players to request Pokémon they have not encountered. At certain points in the game, players {{will be able to}} take in-game screenshots, which they can then share on the Pokémon Global <b>Link</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this exploratory study {{is to determine the}} delinking practices of webmasters of colleges and universities in Canada and the US. An online questionnaire was created and all the 92 webmasters of Canadian colleges and universities were invited to complete it while the invitation was extended to only 500 of their counterparts in the US. A total of 123 webmasters responded to the survey with about 88 % of them indicating that they have had to remove external links from their web sites before. According to most of the webmasters, delinking is done as often as required but less than 20 times a year. Reasons for delinking a web site are categorized into obvious (e. g., broken/dead links, and content of <b>linked</b> <b>site</b> is no longer current or relevant) and unobvious (e. g., political/philosophical difference with the owner of the <b>linked</b> <b>site,</b> and request from the webmaster of the <b>linked</b> <b>site).</b> Measures to minimize delinking are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|To {{promote the}} movie release in the US, it was {{announced}} on the official US Pokémon website that starting on December 3, 2011 to December 31, 2011, players of Pokémon Black and White could download Victini to their games through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. This Victini also included its signature moves Searing Shot and V-Create (unobtainable in gameplay), as well as Reshiram and Zekrom's unique moves Fusion Flare and Fusion Bolt and held a Fire Gem. A bonus manga sampler of Pokémon Black and White was also given away at theaters playing Pokémon the Movie:White—Victini and Zekrom. A sweepstakes also {{took place on the}} official site as a promotion for the movie. A second promotion was released in the US for the DVD release of the movies. Between March 10, 2012 and April 8, 2012 players were able to download a level 100 Reshiram or a level 100 Zekrom depending on which version the player had through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

40|$|Population genetic theory {{predicts that}} {{selectively}} driven changes of allele frequency for both beneficial and deleterious mutants reduce polymorphism at tightly <b>linked</b> <b>sites.</b> All else being equal, these reductions in polymorphism {{are expected to}} be greater when recombination rates are lower. Therefore, the empirical observation of a positive correlation between recombination rates and amounts of DNA polymorphism across the Drosophila melanogaster genome can be explained by two very different types of natural selection. Here, we evaluate alternative models of effects of selection on <b>linked</b> <b>sites</b> by comparison of X-linked and autosomal variation. We present polymorphism data from 40 genes distributed across chromosome arms X and 3 R of Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster. We find significantly less silent polymorphism in D. simulans on the X chromosome than on 3 R, but no difference between arms for silent divergence between species. This pattern is incompatible with predictions from theoretical studies on the effect of negative selection on <b>linked</b> <b>sites.</b> We propose that some form of positive selection having greater effects on sex chromosomes than on autosomes is the better explanation for the D. simulans data...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} between an organic polymer with plasticizing activity {{and a model}} surface (CaCO 3), with a surface activity similar to the cement one, have been analysed by volumetric analysis and thermal analysis: TG/DTG and DSC. The synthesized polymer has a negative <b>link</b> <b>site</b> (carboxylate) that is able {{to interact with the}} substrate and a long ethylene oxide chain that contribute to the dispersing activity. The pattern of the adsorption isotherm suggests the occurring of a step like adsorption, initially characterised by a coil conformation of PEO chain followed by a more PEO strained, linear, conformation as the amount of polymer increases. The polymer adsorption appears to modify the crystalline phase and morphology of the CaCO 3 surface as the thermal analysis puts in evidence through the CaCO 3 decomposition temperature shifts. SEM analysis confirms the morphology changes induced by polymer adsorption...|$|E
40|$|Despite many drawbacks, {{traditional}} sequencing {{technologies have}} proven to be invaluable in modern medical research, even when the targeted genomes are highly variable. While it is often known in such cases that multiple slightly different sequences are present in the analyzed sample in concentrations that vary dramatically, the traditional techniques typically allow only the most dominant strain to be extracted from a single chromatogram. These limitations made some research directions rather difficult to pursue. For example, the analysis of HIV evolution (including the emergence of drug resistance) in a single patient is expected to benefit from a comprehensive catalog of the patient’s HIV population. In this paper, we show how the new generation of sequencing technologies, based on high throughput of short reads, can be used to <b>link</b> <b>site</b> variants and reconstruct multiple full strains of the targeted gene, including those of low concentration in the sample. Our algorithm is based on a generative model of the sequencing process, and uses a tailored probabilistic inference and learning procedure to fit the model to the obtained reads...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{develops}} an {{earthing system}} design procedure that is flexible in applicability, {{and that leads}} the designer to make conscious articulated decisions to identify hazards, meet appropriate risk targets and maintain compliance with performance requirements {{over the life of}} the installation. A critique of the most popular standards and methodologies in use today identifies many deficiencies and inconsistencies in meeting such a goal. A close examination of the basis behind the physiological safety criteria identifies inconsistencies introduced in transferring laboratory date to published acceptable body current criteria. Based upon a derivation of statistical probability distribution characteristics for key shock circuit parameters an appraisal of the actual safety levels afforded by commonly accepted safety criteria is made. The resultant safety levels are clearly shown not to comply with underlying probabilistic safety risk targets without specification of additional factors such as series impedance (e. g. footwear crushed rock and asphalt) and fault/contact coincidence probability conditions. A rigorous definition of series impedance parameters is based upon probabilistic characteristic derived from extensive field and laboratory testing. Such factors are clearly articulated and incorporated in a technique for deriving defensible safety guidelines which <b>link</b> <b>site</b> and system specific conditions with a family of 'safety characteristics'. The development of a decision theory basis for underlying safety risk targets is presented based on a synthesis of a range of heuristic requirements including: acceptability, reasonableness, practicality and defensibility. Recommendations are made regarding reshaping of regulations in the light of this analysis and inadequacies identified in many existing safety regulations. Unfortunately, safety characteristics and regulations alone are incapable of delivering safe power systems under earth fault conditions. To meet this need a design methodology is developed which optimises the design configuration to produce robust, practical, cost justified designs which comply with applicable performance criteria. Inadequacy in initial phases of design, installation and commissioning, or changes in the electrical and physical configurations can give rise to such risks. A key component of the coordinated design and management philosophy is the ability to identify and eliminate, reduce or manage vulnerability to these risks. Flexible, stages probabilistic models are developed for the active parameters and systems in order to facilitate analysis of the time and spatial dependencies inherent in the occurrence of, and response to, an earth fault condition. The resultant risk analysis based design process identifies the significant parameters, the required level of accuracy, and how best to integrate the individual risk profiles to achieve an overall robust design based upon techniques developed throughout the thesis...|$|E
