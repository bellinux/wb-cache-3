Assad differed from his predecessor at the outset, visiting local villages and hearing citizen complaints. The Syrian people felt that Assad's rise to power would lead to change; one of his first acts as ruler was to visit Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, father of the Aflaqite Ba'athist Mansur al-Atrash, to honor his efforts during the Great Arab Revolution. He made overtures to the Writers' Union, rehabilitating those who had been forced underground, jailed or sent into exile for representing what radical Ba'athists called the reactionary classes: [...] "I am determined that you shall no <b>longer</b> <b>feel</b> strangers in your own country." [...] Although Assad did not democratize the country, he eased the government's repressive policies.|$|E

2500|$|Adaptation raises {{philosophical}} {{issues concerning}} how biologists speak of function and purpose, as this carries implications of evolutionary history – that a feature evolved {{by natural selection}} for a specific reason – and potentially of supernatural intervention – that features and organisms exist because of a deity's conscious intentions. Aristotle introduced teleology to describe the adaptedness of organisms, but without accepting the supernatural intention built into Plato's thinking, which Aristotle rejected. Modern biologists continue to face the same difficulty. On the one hand, adaptation is obviously purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not. On the other hand, biologists want to deny conscious purpose in evolution. The dilemma {{gave rise to a}} famous joke by the evolutionary biologist Haldane: [...] "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.'" [...] David Hull commented that Haldane's mistress [...] "has become a lawfully wedded wife.

2500|$|The Netherlands has {{the second}} highest {{incidence}} of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, {{it is difficult to}} obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. [...] "Jew" [...] or [...] "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 Dutch Jews. According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in Amsterdam was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009.

[...] Others regretted that he had destroyed a historic part of the city.

[...] Jules Ferry, the most vocal critic of Haussmann in the French parliament, wrote: [...] "We weep with our eyes full of tears for the old Paris, the Paris of Voltaire, of Desmoulins, the Paris of 1830 and 1848, [...] when we see the grand and intolerable new buildings, the costly confusion, the triumphant vulgarity, the awful materialism, that we are going to pass on to our descendants." ...|$|E
