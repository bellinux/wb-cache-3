40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{security}} of the power supply for <b>local</b> <b>ventilator,</b> adding an emergency power supply (EPS) to the <b>local</b> <b>ventilator</b> is proposed by the paper. The key technology and the feasibility of the proposed scheme were analyzed in detail. Also, the proposed scheme was compared with the existing scheme. This scheme was proposed can start the emergency power to provide power for the <b>local</b> <b>ventilator,</b> and minimize the gas accumulation or explosion accidents caused by the power failure, {{in the case of the}} double powers failure. Compare to the existing scheme that double powers and double <b>local</b> <b>ventilator</b> machines at the driving face required by “Coal Mine Safety Regulations”. The new scheme can improve {{the security of}} the power supply for <b>local</b> <b>ventilator</b> greatly...|$|E
30|$|Within a large, UK {{teaching}} hospital it was identified that extubation assessment was a multidisciplinary decision but different clinicians applied varying criteria and assessment was not standardised. Following {{a review of}} extubation failure rates, a quality improvement initiative was instigated including the development of <b>local</b> <b>ventilator</b> weaning guidelines and physiotherapy (PT) led assessment of extubation suitability.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} an {{experimental}} study about local thermal discomfort, {{due to the}} draught sensation, that an occupant is subjected in ventilated spaces, will be presented. In the study, done in a climatized full-scale compartment with controlled air temperature, will be used a thermal-manikin, to simulate the human body posture, and a <b>local</b> <b>ventilator,</b> to simulate the non-uniform airflow around an occupant. It will be measured and analysed the air velocity fluctuations around a thermal-manikin in 25 points. During the tests, with the air-forced ventilation system located 2 m in front the manikin, the air velocity values will be measured during 5 minutes with a rate of 50 samples per second. This experimental data {{will be used to}} evaluate the undesirables air velocity fluctuations, using the spectral analysis...|$|E
