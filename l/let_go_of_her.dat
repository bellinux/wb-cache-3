5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen {{is in the foreground}} at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E

She had even written the famous Burgtheater actor Raoul Aslan {{a letter and}} a poem in which she {{expressed}} her desire to one day perform on the same stage. With her dark long hair and beauty, she so impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends on the long back porch of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916. So, as her stepfather, Werfel refused to allow Manon the opportunity.|$|E

But all have grown into their roles, cutting loose in a film that (thankfully) sidesteps the melodrama of its prequels." ...|$|E
