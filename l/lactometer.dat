60|$|Mr. Tollet, of Betley Hall, {{selected}} cows, {{and especially}} bulls, descended from good milkers, {{for the sole}} purpose of improving his cattle for the production of cheese; he steadily tested the milk with the <b>lactometer,</b> and in eight years he increased, as I was informed by him, the product in proportion of four to three. Here is a curious case (20/21. Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 254.) of steady but slow progress, with the end not as yet fully attained: in 1784 a race of silkworms was introduced into France, in which one hundred in the thousand failed to produce white cocoons; but now after careful selection during sixty-five generations, the proportion of yellow cocoons has been reduced to thirty-five in the thousand.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lactometer</b> is used {{to check}} purity of cow's milk. The {{specific}} gravity of milk does not give a conclusive indication of its composition since milk contains a variety of substances that are either heavier or lighter than water. Additional tests for fat content are necessary to determine overall composition. The instrument is graduated into a hundred parts. Milk is poured in and allowed to stand until the cream has formed, then {{the depth of the}} cream deposit in degrees determines the quality of the milk. If the milk sample is pure, the <b>lactometer</b> floats; if it is adulterated or impure, the <b>lactometer</b> sinks.|$|E

5000|$|A term {{often heard}} for {{high-quality}} coffee is Degree Coffee. Milk certified as pure with a <b>lactometer</b> was called degree milk owing to a mistaken {{association with the}} thermometer. It is claimed that coffee prepared with degree milk became known as degree coffee. Yet another possible derivation for the term is from the chicory {{used to make the}} coffee. The South Indian pronunciation of chickory became chigory, then digory, and finally degree. Another explanation is that when coffee is decocted for the first time, it {{is referred to as the}} first degree or simply as the [...] "Degree Coffee". This has the strongest flavour and the necessary strength to mix with milk without watering down the taste. In less affluent households coffee would be decocted for a second or third time from the same initial load and would be called the second or third degree coffee respectively given its lower strength [...] Yet another explanation could be that coffee was mixed by pouring it from one cup to another cup, it has to be poured at a certain angle or [...] "degree" [...] for best taste.|$|E
40|$|Abstract ~., A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the extent of water adulteration of milk produced and marketed in Morogoro municipality in Tanzania. 'A total of 90 milk samples were collec,ted from institutional, private and smallholder fdrms alid milk vendors, The-samples were analysed for <b>lactometer</b> reading (LR), butterfat (EF), solids-not-fat (SNF) and total 'solids (TS). Overall adulteration (AD) 'was calculated as the difference between SNF of standard/genuine ' milk obtained at the farm gate ' and respective milk samples, It was observed that <b>lactometer</b> readingfor the farm milk rangedfrom 25 : 32. to 26. 75 and was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than vendors ' milk, which ranged from 23. 01 to 23. 5 tj o L. The butterfat content for farm milk which ranged from 3. 56 to 4. 12 % was significantly hig~e'r (P< 0. 05) than that of the vendors ' milk that rangedfrom 2. 86 to 3. 03;Va. The SNF content/or farm milk rangedfrom 7. 18 to 7. 67 % and was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that ofvendors'milk,which ranged from 6. 47 to 6. 63 %. Furthermore, TS offarm milk which ranged from 10. 81 to 11. 87 % was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than vendors ' milk, which ranged from 9. 38 to 9. 74 %. The overall adulteration for farm milk ralJged from 6. 57 to 9. 48 % and was significantly lower than that of vendors 'milk, which ranged from, 19. 28 to 21. 13 %. It was concluded that water adulteration ofmilk in Morogoro muniCipality was rampant cmd starts from the farm level. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} the.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} Adulteration of marketable fresh milk adulterated {{with water and}} starch at Khartoum state. Also the research shows the incidence of the adulteration to the consumers {{in addition to the}} economical loss which may happen during the processing. Three hundreds samples from Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri were collected. All samples were chemically examined and analyzed to observe their quality. Then EKO milk device was used to find whether there was starch added to the milk or not on the other hand. <b>Lactometer</b> was used for testing the density of the samples. Further more an oven under (105) c was used to detect the total solids of the samples. The lish meddall equation was used for that analysis. The research concluded that the adulteration at Khartoum state is due to addition of water(35. 3 %) rather than Starch. The research recommended to control the marketing of milk by regulation and rules which include the standards of the sold milk.

40|$|Background The {{prevalence}} of lactose malabsorption varies widely throughout the world. Only people of Caucasian genetic background continue to produce high amount of lactase throughout adulthood. Previous studies in Indonesia {{revealed that the}} {{prevalence of}} lactose malabsorption was 21 - 58 % in children aged 3 - 11 years. Objective To determine the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in the older age group and whether a change in milk drinking habit can affect it. Methods A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted on 98 children aged between 12 and 14 years (junior high school) in Jakarta. Lactose malabsorption was evaluated with <b>Lactometer</b> Breath Hydrogen Test (Hoek Loes, Amsterdam). Milk drinking habit was recorded, and drinking at least 1 glass of milk everyday since 6 months or more before the study was considered as regular milk drinking. Results This study showed 73 % of the children had lactose malabsorption. Regular milk drinking habit was found in 32 (33 %) children and lactose malabsorption occurred in 26. From 66 children who were irregular milk drinkers, lactose malabsorption was found in 46 (70 %). Lactose intolerance {{was about the same}} in both groups. Conclusion There was an increasing prevalence of lactose malabsorption in older children. Milk drinking habit is a major concern to review the practical implications of lactose malabsorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was the considering of the effect of Contrast Temperature Water Therapy on Blood Lactic Acid clearance of male students of Mazandaran University of Science and Technology after exhausting activity. In this semi-experimental study, 30 male students were randomly chosen and classified between two groups with 15 members, in a design with control group and experimental group, before and two hours after CTWT (experimental group) the Bruce test on treadmill was done. The measurement of blood Lactic Acid was done by <b>Lactometer,</b> before and after Bruce tests, and also immediately after CTWT. And then in both groups the results of each test was compared with another test. After that the results between two groups were compared. To analyze the data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, pair T test, and match T test were used in meaning level α≤ 0 / 05 for statistical analyze. To summarize, the following findings have been obtained: 1. CTWT reduced the concentration of blood Lactic Acid after exhausting performance significantly; 2. Two hours after recovery, the effect of CTWT on Lactic Acid concentration did not differ from the passive recovery method effect significantly; 3. CTWT did not also have any significant effect on the Lactic Acid accumulation in next exhausting performance; 4. CTWT did not have any significant effect on fluctuations of blood Lactic Acid in next exhausting performance. It is believed that CTWT facilitates recovery by blood circulation, vaso-pumping, hydrostatic pressure due to immersion, relieving of metabolic waste, and central nervous system stimulation.

40|$|Problem statement: Fatigue is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} that {{can be described as}} a time-dependent exercise-induced reduction in the maximal force generating capacity of a muscle. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effect of exhausting exercise induced fatigue on the double-leg balance of elite male athletes. Approach: This study included 30 apparently healthy young adults (handball and basketball professional players), 15 subjects in the control group (15 men with mean age 23 ± 2. 1 years old, Body Mass 82 ± 1. 3 kg and Body Height 181 ± 9. 7 cm) and 15 subjects in the experiment group (15 men; age 23. 1 ± 2. 2 years old, mean weight 81 ± 0. 9 kg and mean height 183 ± 7. 4 cm), matched evenly for age. In this study RAST test used for fatigue protocole. Biodex balance system and <b>lactometer</b> used for evaluation of balance and blood lactate level (respectively). For statistical analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient, paired t-test and sample t-test were used. Results: Results revealed that there arent any significant main effects for time, such that double legged balance performance was maintained throughout the trial. There arent any significant main effects for time in the mean lateral deflection of the biodex platform. However, there was a significant main effect (p = 0. 091) in the mean anteriorposterior deflection. The mean deflection was significantly reduced, i. e., toward the anterior direction, at the end of each half relative to all other time points. Hence there wasnt a significant relationship between lactate acid accumulation and variations of stability indices (r = - 0 / 661, p Conclusion: Balance was maintained (in eyes opened situation) and this shows that balance have a little decreases in double leg stance in professional athletes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Milk is a {{compulsory}} part {{of daily}} diet for the expectant mothers {{as well as}} growing children. Milk is very important due to its special nutritive value and important role for human and animal health. Adulteration is practised either to substitute cheaper ingredients or to impress the buyer to think the product is more valuable or of better quality. &# 13; Methods: The present study was conducted by the Department of Community Medicine at HIHT, Dehradun. All the samples of the raw milk (open and branded) supplied by the vendors in 5 Km radius of HIHT. The samples of milk were also collected from the Girls and Boys Hostel Mess and canteen. 500 ml of each variety of open milk and 500 ml packet of branded milk were purchased from the milk vendors. The specific gravity of the milk was assessed by <b>lactometer</b> and chemically tested by Adulteration Test Kit supplied by NICE Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. (an ISO 9001 Certified Company). &# 13; Results: It was observed that out of 60 samples of milk, only 12 samples (20 %) had specific gravity of 26 and more which is considered as undiluted milk while 48 (80 %) had specific gravity of less than 26 clearly indicating the dilution of milk with water. It was also observed that all the milk samples including double toned milk collected from different places showed presence of urea and detergents as common adulterants. &# 13; Conclusion:The {{findings of this study}} highlights the need to implement improved hygiene practices and to apply effective monitoring throughout the production to delivery chain. Training and education is also needed for all persons who deal with milk production, marketing and processing...|$|E
40|$|Keeping milk clean Cue: Milk {{is a very}} {{important}} food, particularly for growing children. For example, it contains large amounts of calcium, which is vital for the growth of strong bones. But milk is also a very suitable environment for bacteria to grow, so keeping it free from dirt is essential. The greatest risk of dirt entering the milk is probably during the actual time of milking. But by following some simple procedures, farmers can minimise the chances of contamination. Gabriel Karanja is a Kenyan dairy farmer and milk trader who has recently been given training in safe milk handling. He spoke to Susie Emmett about some of these important procedures for keeping milk clean. IN:		?You see there is a shed ?? OUT:		??water or anything to your milk. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 30 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Eliana Mushi of the Kalali Women?s Group. Earlier, Susie Emmett was talking to Gabriel Karanja, a Kenyan dairy farmer and milk trader. Transcript Karanja	You see there is a shed, there is the milking shed where you go and milk the cows. Then that is where you wash your hands with soap and the clean water. Then you get the warm water and a clean cloth, now you wash the underside of the cow. Emmett	So that is the udder and the teats under the cow, you wash them with warm water. And why do you do that? Karanja	If you milk that cow without washing the udder and the teats there is a problem because this cow where it was sleeping there is dust, there is everything, and sometimes they can lie on the dung. But cleaning the udder first, you are taking care of any contamination of the milk from the cow. So now then you bring your container which you have washed previously, you have sterilised it with hot water, you have made it dry, that is when you milk your cow. Emmett	And you are making a point about not just washing, not just sterilising but things must be dry too? Karanja	Yes, after washing you dry the teats with a dry towel. Before training we used to apply the milking salve but later after training we came to realise milking with a salve can also contaminate the milk. Emmett		So a salve is like a cream that you put on the teats? Karanja	Cream yes. You see the salve is to keep the teats soft so that it cannot crack. But if you milk you use the salve on the teats, when you are milking the cow part of the salve might enter the milk. Emmett	So the cream that you put on the teat can come through your hands and then on to the milk? Karanja	Because the milk is hot. Emmett		Into the container? Karanja	Yes. So the best thing is you milk before you apply the salve and then you apply later after milking, then you can now apply the salve so that it can preserve the teats. Emmett	And what about if you have got a cow that tends to kick or fidget or swish her tail as the milking is going on, how can you stop that so that dirt does not get dropped into the milk? Karanja	That one is controlled by tying you see, but these days we have a locking stick. Emmett		So a piece of wood that you put behind the legs? Karanja	Behind and in front of the legs. Behind so that the cow cannot go out and then in front so that it cannot kick. Then the tail, you tie the tail by the post. And also the other thing we used to sometimes to feed the cow when we are milking. Also that one can contaminate the milk because when it is feeding it is a bit dusty, so this dust can also contaminate the milk. Emmett		So as she feeds she can blow dust from the feed down into the milk? Karanja	Yes so the best thing is you first milk and then you feed it after. Emmett	And then hopefully you have got this lovely clean milk in a lovely clean container. What is it important to do next? Karanja	Now the other thing, so you have to sieve, the milk has to be sieved, from the container from where you are milking to the clean container which carries this milk. Emmett		Through a piece of cloth? Karanja	The sieving, you have a sieve, then you have a clean piece of cloth. Emmett	So sieving or straining the milk into another container will help to remove any small pieces of hair or dust? Karanja	Yes. Emmett	A final question, are there sometimes when if you have treated the cow with a medicine you cannot sell the milk? Karanja	Yes you do not deliver that milk. Because the medicine which has treated the cow it is not fit for human consumption. So if you deliver this milk to your customers, you are making them sick because you are giving them poison. Actually the cow medicine is poisonous for the human beings. Emmett		That is how you think of it? Karanja	Yes that is what I have been taught in the training. Emmett	And so are you careful if you use medicines for mastitis, for infections of the udder or worm medicines, you read the instructions carefully? Karanja	You read the instructions, even not only me, even my suppliers, the other farmers who supply milk to me. I have to instruct them and I tell them if you treat a cow you follow the instructions, if the veterinary officer tells you to take three days, you bring the milk after the three days. That is the time I would take the milk. Emmett		So you sound like a really professional milkman? Karanja	So that I continue with my business, because that is why I am getting my delivery. NARR	Gabriel Karanja, serious about the business of keeping the milk he sells clean. In the town of Moshi in northern Tanzania, the Kalali Women?s Group is also involved in processing and selling milk. Speaking on the telephone, Lazarus Laiser asked Eliana Mushi, one of the group members, about how they maintain high standards of hygiene in their milk. Laiser		How do you test milk from the farmers and ensure that it is clean? Mushi	(Vernac) We test the milk by using <b>lactometer,</b> water thermometer and it shows if it has any contamination or not. Laiser		How do you prevent dirt contaminating the milk? Mushi	(Vernac) After receiving the milk we put in the can and boil in water whilst in the can. After boiling we put again in a well-washed can and close them well and keep safely until cold. Immediately after pouring milk from the can we wash and put them to dry waiting for other milk. Laiser		Have you received milk which is contaminated? Mushi	(Vernac) Yes, we often receive milk which is contaminated with water and other impurities. Such milk we cannot use it. Laiser		It is only a water problem or are there other problems? Mushi	(Vernac) Not water only but other dirt like cow dung caused by not well washed udder. You can feel even by smelling. Others put wheat flour to have more milk. Others water and once we receive this milk we always send back to the farmer. Laiser		How do you advise the farmers especially the process of milking? Mushi	(Vernac) They have to follow instructions on how to milk. They should wash the udder with clean water using a lot of water and rub with a clean towel. You must wash well the can or bucket to be used in milking. Never ever add water or anything to your milk. End of track. Gabriel Karanja, a milk trader and dairy producer in Kenya, and Eliana Mushi of a milk buying group in Tanzania, explain how dairy farmers can keep their milk free of dirt and other contaminants...|$|E
