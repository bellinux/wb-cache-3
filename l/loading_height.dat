The effects of moment distribution between supports and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> {{with respect to}} shear center are examined using numerical and analytical methods. From these methods, independent moment and shear factors are developed {{for a range of}} load types and <b>load</b> <b>heights.</b> A code comparison is performed comparing numeric results with those produced by AISC 360 to illustrate situations where issues occur in terms of strength prediction. A reliability analysis is performed from this data to quantify the difference in terms of the reliability index using a Monte Carlo Simulation. The results of the analysis show large discrepancies between the results produced by the code and those produced by the numerical analysis in circumstance where reverse curvature bending is apparent. Further, large discrepancies result when the load is positioned above the shear center of the member. This difference indicates a need for the code to change to have special provisions that handle the circumstances surrounding the load types studied and the <b>load</b> <b>height</b> effect.

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{capacity of}} the new hollow flange steel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is limited by lateral distortional buckling, which is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Recent research into this unique buckling behaviour has developed appropriate design rules for the member capacity of LiteSteel beams.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation of effect of <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on buckling resistance of steel beams. Shapes that {{are intended to}} be used primarily as a beam are generally proportioned so that moment of inertia about the principal axis is considerably larger than that about minor axis. Hence monosymmetric sections are preferable. The lateral stability of beam subjected to transverse loading is very complicated in monosymmetric sections. The distance of transverse load from shear centre axis may significantly affect the buckling resistance of a simply supported beam. When transverse concentrated load W acts at (Yq-Yo) below the shear centre and moves with the beam it acts as an additional torque W(Yq-Yo) about shear centre which opposes twist and increases resistance to buckling. Conversely, when load above shear centre, additional torque increases the twist rotation and reduces buckling resistance of beam. To verify the effect of <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on buckling resistance, a simply supported beam subjected to concentrated and uniformly distributed load is considered. The effect of <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on buckling resistance has been plotted...|$|R

50|$|In general, most brucks {{have been}} front- or {{mid-engined}} to make best possible {{use of the}} cargo space in the rear end, and to make <b>loading</b> <b>height</b> as low as possible, {{in addition to a}} better weight distribution. In the Nordic countries front-engined chassis from Volvo and Scania were the most common, while many were built on Mercedes-Benz and DAF chassis too. When the front-engined chassis models disappeared from the European market in the early 1980s, mid-engined chassis from Volvo and DAF became the usual choice. A few were also built on rear-engined chassis from Scania, including some 4.2 metres tall doubledeckers in Sweden being bodied by Helmark Carosseri and Van Hool. DAF stopped making mid-engined chassis in the mid 1990s, so from then on brucks were almost exclusively built on Volvo chassis. With bus manufacturers taking over manufacturing of both chassis and body, the Volvo 9700 became the most common bruck model in the 2000s. Since Volvo also stopped making mid-engined chassis in late 2009, there have been far less brucks built than before. Only around 40 rear-engined brucks have been delivered to Sweden since then. As of March 2015, the last known brucks were delivered to Swedish operator Bergvalls Busstrafik in June 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{capacity of}} the new hollow flange steel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is limited by lateral distortional buckling for intermediate spans, which is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Recent research based on finite element analysis and testing has developed design rules for the member capacity of LiteSteel beams subject to this unique lateral distortional buckling. These design rules are limited to a uniform bending moment distribution. However, uniform bending moment conditions rarely exist in practice despite being considered as the worst case due to uniform yielding across the span. Loading position or <b>load</b> <b>height</b> is also known to have significant effects on the lateral buckling strength of beams. Therefore {{it is important to}} include the effects of these loading conditions in the assessment of LSB member capacities. Many steel design codes have adopted equivalent uniform moment distribution and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> factors for this purpose. But they were derived mostly based on data for conventional hot-rolled, doubly symmetric I-beams subject to lateral torsional buckling. In contrast LSBs are made of high strength steel and have a unique crosssection with specific residual stresses and geometrical imperfections along with a unique lateral distortional buckling mode. The moment distribution and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> effects for LSBs, and the suitability of the current steel design code methods to accommodate these effects for LSBs are not yet known. The research study presented in this thesis was therefore undertaken to investigate the effects of nonuniform moment distribution and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on the lateral buckling strength of simply supported and cantilever LSBs. Finite element analyses of LSBs subject to lateral buckling formed the main component of this study. As the first step the original finite element model used to develop the current LSB design rules for uniform moment was improved to eliminate some of the modelling inaccuracies. The modified finite element model was validated using the elastic buckling analysis results from well established finite strip analysis programs. It was used to review the current LSB design curve for uniform moment distribution, based on which appropriate recommendations were made. The modified finite element model was further modified to simulate various loading and support configurations and used to investigate the effects of many commonly used moment distributions and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> for both simply supported and cantilever LSBs. The results were compared with the predictions based on the current steel code design rules. Based on these comparisons, appropriate recommendations were made on the suitability of the current steel code design methods. New design recommendations were made for LSBs subjected to non-uniform moment distributions and varying load positions. A number of LSB experiments was also undertaken to confirm the results of finite element analysis study. In summary the research reported in this thesis has developed an improved finite element model {{that can be used to}} investigate the buckling behaviour of LSBs for the purpose of developing design rules. It has increased the understanding and knowledge of simply supported and cantilever LSBs subject to non-uniform moment distributions and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> effects. Finally it has proposed suitable design rules for LSBs in the form of equations and factors within the current steel code design provisions.

Although the helix slow-wave circuit remains the mainstay of the traveling-wave tube (TWT) industry because of its exceptionally wide bandwidth, a full helical circuit, without significant dimensional approximations, has not been successfully modeled until now. Numerous {{attempts have been made}} to analyze the helical slow-wave circuit so that the performance could be accurately predicted without actually building it, but because of its complex geometry, many geometrical approximations became necessary rendering the previous models inaccurate. In the course of this research it has been demonstrated that using the simulation code, MAFIA, the helical structure can be modeled with actual tape width and thickness, dielectric support rod geometry and materials. To demonstrate the accuracy of the MAFIA model, the cold-test parameters including dispersion, on-axis interaction impedance and attenuation have been calculated for several helical TWT slow-wave circuits with a variety of support rod geometries including rectangular and T-shaped rods, as well as various support rod materials including isotropic, anisotropic and partially metal coated dielectrics. Compared with experimentally measured results, the agreement is excellent. With the accuracy of the MAFIA helical model validated, the code was used to investigate several conventional geometric approximations in an attempt to obtain the most computationally efficient model. Several simplifications were made to a standard model including replacing the helical tape with filaments, and replacing rectangular support rods with shapes conforming to the cylindrical coordinate system with effective permittivity. The approximate models are compared with the standard model in terms of cold-test characteristics and computational time. The model was also used to determine the sensitivity of various circuit parameters including typical manufacturing dimensional tolerances and support rod permittivity. By varying the circuit parameters of an accurate model using MAFIA, these sensitivities can be computed for manufacturing concerns, and design optimization previous to fabrication, thus eliminating the need for costly experimental iterations.

Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the uniformly distributed loads are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to uniformly distributed directed radial loads. Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while uniformly distributed directed radial loads always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling.
