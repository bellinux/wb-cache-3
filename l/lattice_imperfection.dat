In the present overview, recent progress in spherical aberration corrected imaging performed in troika with the ultra-precise measurement of residual wave aberrations and the numerical retrieval of the exit plane wavefunction from focal series of micrographs is illustrated by highlighting their combined use for the atomic-scale measurement of common <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfections</b> observed in compound semiconductors and high-temperature superconductors. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lattice</b> <b>imperfections,</b> such as dislocations and misfitting particles, shift and/or broaden X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) line profiles. Most of {{the present}} analysis methods of the shift and broadening of XRD line profiles do not provide the characteristics of <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfections.</b> The main part of this thesis deals with {{a new approach to}} the analysis of broadened and shifted XRD line profiles that does not have the limitations {{of the present}} analysis methods. The approach is based on micromechanical modelling of the microstructure of the material. A small volume which is representative of the microstructure of the material is used to model and calculate the materials behaviour on a local scale incorporating the (strain fields of the) <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfections.</b> Subsequently, the behaviour of this representative element can be used to calculate the overall materials properties. X-ray diffraction-line profiles are calculated from such model materials and are compared with the measured ones. By adjusting the parameters of the micromechanical model, the calculated line profiles can be matched to the experimental ones. In this way characteristics of the microstructure of the experimental material can be determined and subsequently overall materials properties can be predicted. Hence, a direct link between XRD line-profiles characteristics and materials properties is conceivable...|$|R

40|$|Polycrystalline {{aggregates}} {{are comprised}} of three microstructural features: grain centers, grain boundaries, and regions affected by grain boundaries. It is these features that determine the mechanical properties, and any advanced understanding of microstructure-property relations requires their quantitative description. Traditionally, descriptions of microstructures {{have been based}} on visualization, i. e., how grains appear in the optical or scanning electron microscope (SEM). While this may lead to classification systems that permit differentiation, it does not allow for quantification, especially in complex microstructures, and does not lend itself to either developing or applying structure-property relationships. The goal {{of this study is to}} present a new approach to the characterization of complex microstructures, especially those found in advanced modern high strength steels. For such steels, the new approach employs the fact that different austenite decomposition products formed at different transformation temperatures have different dislocation or sub-grain boundary densities. Hence, measuring the degree of <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfection</b> of the grain centers of the ferrite is one way of first identifying, then grouping, and finally quantifying, the different types or forms of ferrite. The index chosen in this study to distinguish the degree of <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfection</b> is the image quality (IQ). As part of the new approach a procedure has been developed to improve the accuracy of applying IQ measurements. This procedure includes three major features: IQ normalization, Grain Boundary Region (GBR) identification and the Multi-Peak model. These three features make this new approach a unique technique, which quantitatively describes the complex microstructures with much more details. The potential application of this technique and further development has also been discussed at the end of this study...|$|E

Fine particles, having mean sizes ranging from 19 to 200 A, were prepared by calcination of a-FeOOH and by precipitation from aqueous solution of ferric salts.

These synthetic calcium phosphates formed by spontaneous precipitation at pH 7, 25 degreesC and 0. 1 M ionic strength (NaCl as the background electrolyte). The combination of several methods allowed detailed characterisation of the calcium phosphates.

All precipitates were identified as non-stoichiometric, calcium-deficient hydroxylapatites (HAPs), containing carbonate, HPO 42 -, sodium and chloride impurities.

In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are conducted {{to probe the}} effect of stress states on the deformation and fracture of nanocrystalline Cu. Tensile strain is applied on a Cu single crystal, bicrystal and polycrystal respectively, under two different tension boundary conditions. Simulations are first conducted on the bicrystal and polycrystal models without <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfection.</b> The results reveal that, compared {{with the performance of}} simulation models under free boundary condition, the transverse stress caused by the constrained boundary condition leads to a much higher tensile stress and can severely limit the plastic deformation, which in return promotes cleavage fracture in the model.

Under constrained boundary condition, the crack tip propagates rapidly in the single crystal in a cleavage manner while the crack becomes blunting and extends along the grain boundaries in the polycrystal.

30|$|Alumina {{nanorods}} {{were prepared}} from chromium-containing alumina sludge, {{and the effects}} of doping elements, such as Cr, Fe, and Mg, were researched. The results show that the crystal transformation of alumina is restricted by the doped Cr and facilitated by the doped Fe and Mg, which is transformed from θ-Al 2 O 3 to α-Al 2 O 3 in the calcination process. Meanwhile, the crystal transformation of alumina is strongly restrained by co-doped elements from the chromium-containing alumina sludge. The doped elements change the course of phase structure transformation and slightly transform the chemical bond of the alumina nanorods. The impure elements are doped in the alumina crystal and restrain the crystalline growth of alumina nanorods according to the rules. In the sample prepared from chromium-containing alumina sludge, more Cr and Mg but fewer Fe are doped, and most Cr are existed as Cr(III). It is possible that the Fe-doping is confined by the competition of Cr and Mg. Moreover, the <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfection</b> of alumina is caused by doped ions, such as Cr, Fe, and Mg, and the chemical state of O and Al are affected.

The {{suppression}} of K by the occurrence of the superconductivity reported previously by the present authors in both magnetic field directions perpendicular and parallel to the c axis has been confirmed, indicating that the Cooper pairs are in the singlet state. The anisotropy of the suppression amplitudes is consistent with the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling constant Aspin estimated by the K-kai plot. It has also been found that even samples, which do not exhibit a significant amount of the Curie-Weiss-like increase of the uniform magnetic susceptibility kai with decreasing temperature T, exhibit the superconducting transition, which indicates that the superconducting Na 0. 3 CoO 2. 1. 3 H 2 O is not necessarily be in the proximity region of the ferromagnetic phase. It has also been confirmed that the superconducting transition temperature Tc of the samples prepared by mixing Na 0. 7 CoO 2, H 2 O (or D 2 O) and bromine for 4 h, and separating the resultant powder from the solution by filtration, depends on the elapsed time t after filtration.

40|$|Low {{dimensional}} {{carbon based}} materials are strictly dependent from the intrinsic property of self-assembling. Three simple and fast methods to unzip Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) have provided different structural organization of graphite layers,[1] observed by electron microscopy investigations. The graphitic nanoplates {{were obtained from}} disruption of SWCNTs by using high-shear mixing and/or treatments in sulfonitric mixtures either at room or high temperatures. Depending on the process procedures, different kinds of re-organization are found to occur, as evidenced by different and complementary electron diffraction and microscopy techniques. To obtain insight into the local nano-structure of self-assembling of the graphitic phases produced from SWCNTs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {{has been used to}} characterize the morphology arrangement and the crystallinity identifications by Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED). [2] Detailed internal structural investigation has been achieved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and with help of its electron diffraction simulation. Here, we focused our investigation on the structural characterization of self-assembling graphitic layers that it has been and it is a long-standing scientific problem. Unlike crystalline system, where long-range ordering is established by periodic stacking of fundamental building blocks, known as unit cells, rolled open SWCNTs process produces graphitic flakes, having no long-range translational or orientational order, although some degrees of short- and medium-range order do exist. Our structural studies reveal the presence of a deviation from perfect crystal of the graphite aggregations, called turbostratic graphite, {{because of the presence of}} rotational and/or translational stacking faults of its hexagonal basal planes. Another interesting outcome of our research is that experimental evidences using electron diffraction technique indicate the existence of an unstable crystallographic phase of graphite with an orthorhombic cell and symmetry Cmma, detected by SAED and RHEED analysis and simulated by using the unit cell parameters reported by previously theoretical studies [3]. The last case study clearly confirms that EDPs are very sensitive to small variations in periodic structure or <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfection</b> and to investigate phase transition phenomena.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} approach to calculating the low-frequency {{part of the}} spectrum of uniaxially patterned periodic structures. In this approach we ignore to zeroth-order the Bragg scattering by crystalline planes but include local field effects in first order perturbation theory. Bragg reflections are shown to be important only near points of symmetry-induced spectral degeneracy, {{where they can be}} taken into account by the degenerate perturbation theory. We apply this approach to waveguiding by thin patterned slabs embedded in a homogeneous medium. This results in an effective medium approximation, similar to the Maxwell Garnet theory but modified for the local field corrections specific to 2 D geometry. Slab spectra are well described by a single frequency-independent parameter, which we call the guiding power. Simple analytic formulae are presented for both TM and TE polarizations. Comparing these formulae with similar expressions for homogeneous uniaxial slabs of same thickness, we derive the principal values of the effective homogeneous permittivity that provides identical waveguiding. We also discuss the extinction of waves due to the Rayleigh-like scattering on <b>lattice</b> <b>imperfections</b> in the slab.
