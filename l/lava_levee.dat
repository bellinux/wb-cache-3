50|$|A lava {{channel is}} {{a stream of}} fluid lava {{contained}} within marginal zones of static (i.e., solid and stationary) <b>lava</b> or <b>lava</b> <b>levees.</b> The initial channel may not contain levees per se, until the parental flow solidifies over what develops into the channel and creates natural levees. This initial levee allows for {{the building of a}} more complex levee and channel. As the lava flows though the channel, the elevation of the surface of the lava flow pulsates and lava can possibly flood the associated channel walls spilling out of the channel and over the existing levees, creating what is known as overflow levees. Overflow levees increase the height and width of the original <b>levee.</b> The <b>lava</b> that flows in lava channels is commonly basaltic in composition.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{difference}} in size Martian and Hawaiian volcanoes have numerous characteristics in common. Specific features such as lava channels, collapsed <b>lava</b> tubes, <b>levees</b> and flow fronts, all very common in Hawaii, are also abundant on the flanks {{of some of the}} Martian volcanoes. Striking differences also exist, such as the apparent lack of radial rift zones on some Martian volcanoes and the paucity of cinder and spatter cones. Some of the best photographs of Martian and Hawaiian volcanic features are presented. Descriptive legends are provided for each picture. An overview of the geological processes and structures depicted is included...|$|R
40|$|Morphometric {{analysis}} of lava flows provides crucial information {{for a better}} understanding of the processes of lava flow dynamics and emplacement. In this thesis, high-resolution DEMs obtained by the airborne LiDAR system and the UAV-SfM system are used for an extensive morphometric {{analysis of}} the Mount Etna (Italy) lava flow. A digital comparison of pre- and post-eruptive LiDAR DEMs of Etna was made to quantify the lava volumes emitted in the 2004 - 2005, 2005 - 2006 and 2007 - 2010 intervals. The erupted volume of 2004 - 2005 is ~ 63. 3 × 106 m 3 entirely emitted by the 2004 - 05 eruption. The erupted volume of 2005 - 2007 is ~ 42. 0 × 106 m 3, of which ~ 33. 5 × 106 m 3 emitted by the September-December 2006 eruption. The erupted volume of 2007 - 2010 is > 86 × 106 m 3, most of which (~ 74 × 106 m 3) is formed by the lava flows of the 2008 - 2009 flank eruption. Lava flow morphometric analysis was performed over LiDAR DEM for eleven channel-fed lava flows through a semi-automatic procedure and using SVF and openness down parameters to better detect and delimit surface-specific elements, i. e. <b>lava</b> <b>levees,</b> base and channel-bed. The results show an inverse relation between slope and channel width, a certain coherence between average slope of levees and pre-emplacing slope, and the same trend between the channel width and channel-bed width. Finally, in order to investigate less costly methods for producing DEMs, we created a high-resolution DEM of the 1974 lava flow using the UAV-SfM system and then we compared it with the LiDAR-derived DEM. The UAV-SfM system can be effectively used to produce topographic data for large areas with an accuracy and resolution that are even higher than those of the LiDAR system. Therefore, the UAV-SfM system can be effectively used to update the topography of active volcanic areas with reasonable costs and short time of deployment...|$|R
50|$|Ascraeus Mons {{was built}} by many {{thousands}} of fluid basaltic lava flows. Except for its great size, it resembles terrestrial shield volcanoes like those that form the Hawaiian Islands. The flanks of Ascraeus Mons are covered with narrow, lobate lava flows and lava channels. Many of the <b>lava</b> flows have <b>levees</b> along their margins. Levees are parallel ridges formed {{at the edges of}} lava flows. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{before or}} after the buried ice had melted away, dacite lava quietly erupted from Opal Cone {{southeast}} of the Atwell Peak plug dome 10,700 to 9,300 years ago and flowed 20 km down Ring Creek on Garibaldi's southern and southwestern flanks without encountering any residual glacial ice. One of the lava flows traveled down a 30% to 35% grade over the landslide scar on the western flank. About [...] of dacite erupted in Garibaldi's third period of activity. This lava forms a thin layer of solid rock on the southern and western sides of the volcano and contains well-defined <b>lava</b> flow margin <b>levees.</b> The Ring Creek lava flow is very unusual because lengthy lava flows are usually attained by fluid basalt flows, except the Ring Creek flow is dacite.|$|R
40|$|Lava tubes play {{a pivotal}} role in the {{formation}} of many lava flow fields. A detailed examination of several compound ‘a‘a lava flow fields on Etna confirmed that a complex network of tubes forms at successively higher levels within the flow field, and that tubes generally advance by processes that include flow inflation and tube coalescence. Flow inflation is commonly followed by the formation of major, first-order ephemeral vents which, in turn, form an arterial tube network. Tube coalescence occurs when lava breaks through the roof or wall of an older lava tube; this can result in the unexpected appearance of vents several kilometers downstream. A close examination of underground features allowed us to distinguish between ephemeral vent formation and tube coalescence, both of which are responsible for abrupt changes in level or flow direction of lava within tubes on Etna. Ephemeral vent formation on the surface is frequently recorded underground by a marked increase in size of the tube immediately upstream of these vents. When the lining of an inflated tube has collapsed, ‘a‘a clinker is commonly seen in the roof and walls of the tube, and this is used to infer that inflation has taken place in the distal part of an ‘a‘a lava flow. Tube coalescence is recognised either from the compound shape of tube sections, or from breached <b>levees,</b> <b>lava</b> falls, inclined grooves or other structures on the walls and roof. Our observations confirm the importance of lava tubes in the evolution of extensive pahoehoe and ‘a‘a flow fields on Etna...|$|R
