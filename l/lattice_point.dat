25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical <b>lattice</b> <b>point.</b> By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} optical <b>lattice</b> <b>point,</b> there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.|$|E

25|$|The crystal {{structure}} {{consists of the}} same group of atoms, the basis, positioned around each and every <b>lattice</b> <b>point.</b> This group of atoms therefore repeats indefinitely in three dimensions according to the arrangement of one of the Bravais lattices.

25|$|Since {{the mean}} free path of low energy {{electrons}} in a crystal {{is only a few}} angstroms, only the first few atomic layers contribute to the diffraction. This means that there are no diffraction conditions in the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. As a consequence the reciprocal lattice of a surface is a 2D lattice with rods extending perpendicular from each <b>lattice</b> <b>point.</b> The rods can be pictured as regions where the reciprocal lattice points are infinitely dense.|$|E
25|$|The crystal {{structure}} of a material (the arrangement of atoms within a given type of crystal) {{can be described in}} terms of its unit cell. The unit cell is a box containing one or more atoms arranged in three dimensions. The unit cells stacked in three-dimensional space describe the bulk arrangement of atoms of the crystal. The unit cell is represented in terms of its lattice parameters, which are the lengths of the cell edges (a, b and c) and the angles between them (alpha, beta and gamma), while the positions of the atoms inside the unit cell are described by the set of atomic positions (xi, yi, zi) measured from a reference <b>lattice</b> <b>point.</b> Commonly, atomic positions are represented in terms of fractional coordinates, relative to the unit cell lengths.|$|E

25|$|In solid sodium chloride, each ion is {{surrounded}} by six ions of the opposite charge as expected on electrostatic grounds. The surrounding ions are located at the vertices of a regular octahedron. In the language of close-packing, the larger chloride ions are arranged in a cubic array whereas the smaller sodium ions fill all the cubic gaps (octahedral voids) between them. This same basic structure is found in many other compounds and {{is commonly known as}} the halite or rock-salt crystal structure. It can be represented as a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with a two-atom basis or as two interpenetrating face centered cubic lattices. The first atom is located at each <b>lattice</b> <b>point,</b> and the second atom is located halfway between lattice points along the fcc unit cell edge.|$|E
25|$|Now {{consider}} an 8-fold rotation, and the displacement vectors between adjacent {{points of the}} polygon. If a displacement exists between any two lattice points, then that same displacement is repeated everywhere in the lattice. So collect all the edge displacements to begin at a single <b>lattice</b> <b>point.</b> The edge vectors become radial vectors, and their 8-fold symmetry implies a regular octagon of lattice points around the collection point. But this is impossible, because the new octagon is about 80% {{as large as the}} original. The significance of the shrinking is that it is unlimited. The same construction can be repeated with the new octagon, and again and again until the distance between lattice points is as small as we like; thus no discrete lattice can have 8-fold symmetry. The same argument applies to any k-fold rotation, for k greater than 6.|$|E
