500|$|On December 13, newly signed Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez {{added his}} sentiments to the fray. [...] "Of course we're {{going to be}} the frontrunner. Of course we're {{going to be the}} team to beat", Rodriguez told reporters. [...] "I don't want there to be a controversy. I don't want the other team to take it personally, or take it in a bad way. But I'm a really {{competitive}} guy. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> If they ask me, 'Oh, which ballclub is going to win the National League East?' It's going to be the Mets. Easy question." ...|$|E
500|$|Cielo was a {{childhood}} friend of André Schultz. When Cielo was a child, his father formed a group to organize and encourage swimming at Esporte Clube Barbarense. Werner Schultz, André Schultz's father, also belonged to the group. They began to create competitions and take the boys on trips. At one point, there were 500 people practicing swimming at the club, in a city, which almost 20 years later, has less than 200,000 inhabitants. Werner Schultz constructed a swimming pool with two Olympic lanes {{in the courtyard of}} his house, where Cielo used to train. Since childhood, Cielo could not bear to lose. Maria Schultz, mother of André Schultz, said, [...] "He could not bear to lose. Several American coaches say this: that good swimmers <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>win,</b> and exceptional not afford to lose. Such is the case of Cesão." [...] Cielo was so eager for victory that during the 1996 Summer Olympics, at nine years old, he was already studying his main reference, Russian Alexander Popov, through videos, noting details like his starts (block outputs) and turnarounds.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{announcing his}} casting, Maslen {{described}} {{the character of}} Jack as [...] "an extremely competitive man who always <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> in business and in pleasure".

5000|$|It {{would come}} back to haunt Hennessy later but Sublimity showed no signs of any ailments on his first start from John Carr's Kildare base, {{dropping}} his customary hold-up tactics and making all of the running, on rain-softened ground he wouldn't have <b>liked,</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the 2005 Listed Alleged Stakes [...] at the Curragh back in the hands of Johnny Murtagh. That was to prove his last win on the Flat as the same December he switched to hurdling.|$|R

2500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} of each category {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Bernhard said the victory was [...] "especially sweet" [...] because Porsche's success was [...] "hard fought" [...] and it helped reduce the effect of his teammates poor form in the season's first three races. Hartley stated that it [...] "felt good" [...] to finish as the winner and was satisfied with his second stint because the circuit came to his car balance wise. Webber spoke of his happiness for Porsche winning their home event, saying [...] "It was an exceptional performance against strong competition." [...] and was content with Porsche's performance. Di Grassi stated: [...] "We can be happy with our second place. We made no mistakes and constantly drove at the limit. When you’re on the front row you’d obviously <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> But today we were lacking the necessary fortune." [...] Duval said Audi executed [...] "a good performance" [...] in defence but that Porsche were [...] "simply fortunate" [...] in winning the race and his car lost {{a small amount of}} aerodynamic downforce. Jarvis felt the No. 8 Audi's second place result was like [...] "a little victory" [...] and after the team's performance at Le Mans it was to be [...] "an interesting season." [...] Fässler said his team was [...] "pleased" [...] to finish in third but planned to perform stronger in the next race and Lotterer stated Audi worked well as a team and was looking forward to the 6 Hours of Mexico.|$|E

50|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the society girl Francisca Vale Calmon Nogueira da Gama was the model for Emilia, the almost-unattainable diva in Jose Alencar's third work of fiction. He courted the girl, but being rejected during a waltz, left the halls to never bespeak Francisca again. She ended up travelling to Europe and marrying a nobleman. As a result, in 1864, it came to light another of his reflections on the female personality. And, in the novel, Alencar immortalized his lost love's black eyes. Emilia is a rich girl, well-educated and aware of her seducing powers. <b>Likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the boys and then reject them. Augustus, the narrator, is one of them. Exchanges of love, little insults and long letters make for a delicious plot, full of observations about the psychology of women that are still valid.|$|R
50|$|Batista and Alberto Del Rio {{faced each}} other in a rematch with Del Rio {{prevailing}} due to Randy Orton distracting Batista.

Besides, I think the commodore would have <b>liked</b> Elliot <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the cup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But methinks {{that even}} these things hinder {{much less than}} the conduct of the people of Ghent. Since Bruges was {{captured}} there have been, as you know, parties going through the land as far as the frontiers of France, plundering and destroying all the houses and castles of the knights and nobles, under the complaint that they were favourable to the earl, but in truth chiefly because these knaves hate those of gentle blood and are greedy of plunder. Our nobles deem it--and methinks that they have some reason for doing so--to be a business something like that which we have had in England, save that with us it was the country people, while here it is those of the towns who would fain pull down and destroy all those above them in station. Certainly, their acts are not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the friendship and assistance of our English nobles and knights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no hurry," [...] {{he said to}} his skipper, {{when the}} latter {{suggested}} that they should try her at Cowes.

In the next place we must get the crew accustomed {{to each other and to}} the craft. I bought her as a cruiser rather than a racer, and don't want to have her full of men, as are most of the racers. It is a heavy expense, and fewer hands accustomed to work well together do just as much work, and more smartly than a crowd. We found, when we sailed round the islands with the Royal Victoria race, that, considering we went under reduced canvas, we held our own very fairly; and I have no doubt that when we get all our light canvas up, the Osprey will give a good account of herself. Our gear is scarcely stretched yet.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} a certain {{agitation}} was perceptible; several ladies, impatient of vain delay, had left their places, to appeal personally to Mrs. Farrinder, who was presently surrounded with sympathetic remonstrants. Miss Birdseye had given her up; it had been enough for Miss Birdseye {{that she should have}} said, when pressed (so far as her hostess, muffled in laxity, could press) {{on the subject of the}} general expectation, that she could only deliver her message to an audience which she felt to be partially hostile. There was no hostility there; they were all only too much in sympathy. [...] "I don't require sympathy," [...] she said, with a tranquil smile, to Olive Chancellor; [...] "I am only myself, I only rise to the occasion, when I see prejudice, when I see bigotry, when I see injustice, when I see conservatism, massed before me like an army. Then I feel--I feel as I imagine Napoleon Bonaparte to have felt on the eve of one of his great victories. I must have unfriendly elements--I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> them over." ...|$|E

60|$|Boodle {{was playing}} {{pool at the}} Rag, and Archie joined him; but pool is a game which hardly admits of {{confidential}} intercourse as to proposed wives, and Archie was obliged to remain quiet on that subject all the afternoon. He cunningly, however, lost a little money to Boodle, for Boodle <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>win,</b> and engaged himself to dine {{at the same table}} with his friend. Their dinner they ate almost in silence--unless when they abused the cook, or made to each other some pithy suggestion as to the expediency of this or that delicacy--bearing always steadily in view the cost as well as desirability of the viands. Boodle had no shame in not having this or that because it was dear. To dine with the utmost luxury at the smallest expense was a proficiency belonging to him, and of which he was very proud.|$|R
5000|$|Though most Filipinos adopted Spanish {{surnames}}, some chose surnames that {{derive from}} words in local languages, like Tagalog, Ilocano, Kapampangan, or Cebuano. Indigenous surnames primarily derive from verbs, usually from Tagalog, <b>like</b> Manalo (<b>to</b> <b>win)</b> or Dimatulac (cannot be pushed). A few surnames are native-sounding alterations of foreign surnames, like the case of Dimaano, that is an alteration of Spanish [...] "de Maño". Most indigenous surnames have traditional spellings altered to follow Spanish orthography rules.|$|R
