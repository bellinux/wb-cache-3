5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he <b>liked</b> <b>best.</b> However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|The {{contributors}} to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken {{social and cultural}} critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles {{could have been a}} genuine form of conservatism. Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the war, that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he <b>liked</b> <b>best.</b> The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was the spark of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia. Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore. Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie Bărbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians. Two distinct voices were those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist. Beyond politics, Seara came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.|$|E
25|$|The {{first series}} proved successful, leading Telltale to begin {{development}} of a second episodic season. The first episode of the second season was released in late 2013. According to Connors, Telltale incorporates what players <b>liked</b> <b>best</b> from the previous seasons, while considering how and by what means they will continue the story, and include the possibility of tying in more of the characters from the television show.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, to {{complement}} the suit of clothes, Coco Chanel commissioned the perfumer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume for the House of Chanel, his perfumes included the perfume No.5, named after {{the number of the}} sample Chanel <b>liked</b> <b>best.</b> Originally, a bottle of No. 5 de Chanel was a gift to clients of Chanel. The popularity of the perfume prompted the House of Chanel to offer it for retail sale in 1922.|$|E
25|$|He fired {{only when}} {{he thought he could}} destroy. Two hundred and fifty yards was the {{distance}} from which he <b>liked</b> <b>best</b> to fire. A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was usually it. He picked his targets off cleanly and decisively, swinging his sight smoothly through them as a first-class shot strokes driven partridges out of the sky. It was a fluent and calculated exercise... For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
25|$|The BBC {{decided not}} to {{commission}} a third series of the show, partly because Dick Clement and Ian LaFrenais had written a pilot script for another 1973 series, entitled Seven of One, in which Ronnie Barker appeared in seven different situations from different writers, each {{of which was a}} try-out for a possible series. The BBC decided they <b>liked</b> <b>best</b> the one by Clement and LaFrenais, who found themselves suddenly offered a new series, starring Ronnie Barker, which became the television comedy Porridge.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese {{initially}} {{named the}} film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi {{changed the name}} to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he <b>liked</b> <b>best,</b> and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.|$|E
25|$|To {{compose the}} music for Broadchurch, Ólafur read the show's scripts to put himself in the right mood. He also {{researched}} sounds which might be heard in Dorset {{as a means of}} inspiration. As with most of his music, he then improvised at the piano. He composed several themes, some for the series as a whole and some for specific characters. He then shared them with Chibnall, and together they picked out the themes they <b>liked</b> <b>best.</b> Using synthesizers or electronic sound generators, Ólafur also composed sounds to be heard when action occurred in certain spaces, such as the cliffs. Once he saw the completed footage for the first episode, he rearranged some themes to fit the imagery, and composed several new themes as well. Because there was so little time between his being hired and the air date, Ólafur composed very quickly and spent extraordinarily long days at work. He had just four months to generate about 30 minutes of sound and music for each episode, spending one-and-a-half to two weeks on each episode. Despite the time crunch, Ólafur credited Chibnall's relaxed attitude as the key to the music's success.|$|E
25|$|The Sarmatians had a near-religious {{fondness for}} their swords: tribal worship was {{directed}} at a sword sticking up from the ground, similar to the sword in the stone. They carried standards {{in the form of}} dragons. Ossetian Nart sagas contain a number of interesting parallels to the Arthurian legends. First, the life of the Nart warrior (batraz) is tied to his sword, which must be thrown into the sea at his death. When one wounded Batraz asks his last surviving comrade to do the task for him, his companion tries to fool him twice before finally hurling the weapon into the sea; rather like Arthur's wondrous sword Excalibur which had to be returned to the Lady of the Lake at his death by his last surviving knight, Bedivere, who only did the deed on his third trip to the lake. The Nart heroes Soslan and Sosryko, collect the beards of vanquished enemies to trim their cloaks like Arthur's enemy Rience: the subjects of both stories have one last beard to obtain before the cloak is complete. Two other similar motifs are the Cup of the Narts (Nartyamonga), which appeared at feasts, delivered to each person what he <b>liked</b> <b>best</b> to eat, and which was kept by the bravest of the Narts ('Knights') - somewhat similar to the Holy Grail connected to the Arthurian cycle – and the magical woman, dressed in white, associated with water, who helps the hero acquire his sword – similar to the Lady of the Lake.|$|E

500|$|A {{large number}} of {{character}} models, documents and pictures from different Lego System characters and models {{were sent to the}} developers, who eventually chose to use the Castle, Space, Adventurers and Pirates themes in the game. High Voltage Software chose the characters they <b>liked</b> <b>best</b> from these themes and created character studies for them to [...] "capture the mood of each persona". Certain characters were focused on as [...] "champs" [...] in the game, while others were featured as racers. The developers also created two original characters, Rocket Racer and Veronica Voltage.|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe {{wrote to}} friends {{that he was}} {{infatuated}} with Kirchherr, and asked her German friends which colours, films, books and painters she <b>liked.</b> <b>Best</b> commented that {{the beginning of their}} relationship was, [...] "like one of those fairy stories". Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom. Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, which they were shocked to learn, as they thought he would give up his career as an artist, although he told Kirchherr {{that he would like to}} be an art teacher in London or Germany in the future. After moving into the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, oversized shirts and long scarves, and also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she <b>liked</b> <b>best.</b> Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E
500|$|Their playing {{schedule}} at the Kaiserkeller {{remained the}} same as {{it had been in the}} Indra. Lennon said: [...] "We had to play for hours and hours on end. Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it. That's what improved the playing. There was nobody to copy from. We played what we <b>liked</b> <b>best</b> and the Germans liked it as long as it was loud." [...] The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool, but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout “Mach schau, mach schau!” ("make [...] show" [...] or, more idiomatically, [...] "put on a show" [...] for the customers). Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to “dance around like a gorilla, and we’d all knock our heads together.” As Best had been the only one to take O-Level German at school, he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group, and was invited to sing a speciality number called [...] "Peppermint Twist" [...] (while McCartney played the drums) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage. Willie Limpinski, Koschmider's business manager, decided that the club would attract more customers if it presented continuous live music.|$|E
500|$|DJ Kool Herc {{developed}} the style {{that was the}} blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the record {{to focus on a}} short, heavily percussive part in it: the [...] "break". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers <b>liked</b> <b>best,</b> Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record {{reached the end of the}} break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into [...] "five-minute loop of fury". This innovation had its roots in what Herc called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round," [...] a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called [...] "The Merry-Go-Round" [...] because according to Herc, it takes [...] one [...] "back and forth with no slack." [...] Herc told The New York Times that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972. The earliest known Merry-Go-Round involved playing James Brown's [...] "Give It Up or Turnit a Loose" [...] (with its refrain, [...] "Now clap your hands! Stomp your feet!"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, [...] "Bongo Rock" [...] by The Incredible Bongo Band. From the [...] "Bongo Rock"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on [...] "The Mexican" [...] by the English rock band Babe Ruth. Kool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: [...] "Rock on, my mellow!" [...] "B-boys, b-girls, are you ready? keep on rock steady" [...] "This is the joint! Herc beat on the point" [...] "To the beat, y'all!" [...] "You don't stop!" [...] For his contributions, Herc is called a [...] "founding father of hip hop," [...] a [...] "nascent cultural hero," [...] and an integral part of the beginnings of hip hop by Time.|$|E
