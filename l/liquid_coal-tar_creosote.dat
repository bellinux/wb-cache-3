2500|$|Lignite-tar {{creosote}} {{is produced}} from lignite rather than bituminous coal, and varies considerably from <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote.</b> Also called [...] "lignite oil", {{it has a}} very high content of tar acids, and has been used to increase the tar acids in normal creosote when necessary. When it has been produced, its generally been applied in mixtures with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> or petroleum. Its effectiveness when used alone has not been established. In an experiment with southern yellow pine fence posts in Mississippi, straight lignite-tar creosote was giving good results after about 27 years exposure, although not as good as the standard <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> used in the same situation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two main}} kinds {{recognized}} in industry are <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> and [...] wood-tar <b>creosote.</b> The <b>coal-tar</b> variety, having {{stronger and more}} toxic properties, has chiefly {{been used as a}} preservative for wood; <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> was also formerly used as an escharotic, to burn malignant skin tissue, and in dentistry, to prevent necrosis, before its carcinogenic properties became known. The wood-tar variety has been used for meat preservation, ship treatment, and such medical purposes as an anaesthetic, antiseptic, astringent, expectorant, and laxative, though these have mostly been replaced by modern formulations.|$|R
2500|$|For {{some part}} of their history, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>{{creosote}}</b> and wood-tar creosote were {{thought to have been}} equivalent substances—albeit of distinct origins—accounting for their common name; the two were determined only later to be chemically different. All types of creosote are composed of phenol derivatives and share some quantity of monosubstituted phenols, but these are not the only active element of creosote. For their useful effects, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> relies on the presence of naphthalenes and anthracenes, while wood-tar creosote relies on the presence of methyl ethers of phenol. [...] Otherwise, either type of tar would dissolve in water.|$|R
25|$|<b>Coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> {{despite its}} toxicity, {{was used as}} a {{stimulant}} and escharotic, as a caustic agent used to treat ulcers and malignancies and cauterize wounds and prevent infection and decay. It was particularly used in dentistry to destroy tissues and arrest necrosis.|$|R
50|$|Brushing {{preservatives}} is a long-practised {{method and}} {{often used in}} today's carpentry workshops. Technological developments mean {{it is also possible}} to spray preservative over the surface of the timber. Some of the liquid is drawn into the wood as the result of capillary action before the spray runs off or evaporates, but unless puddling occurs penetration is limited and may not be suitable for long-term weathering. By using the spray method, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> oil-borne solutions and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied. A thorough brush or spray treatment with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> can add 1 to 3 years to the lifespan of poles or posts. Two or more coats provide better protection than one, but the successive coats should not be applied until the prior coat has dried or soaked into the wood. The wood should be seasoned before treatment.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> {{has been}} {{distinguished}} {{from what was}} thought of as creosote proper—the original substance of Reichenbach's discovery—and it has been [...] referred to specifically as [...] "creosote oil". But, because <b>creosote</b> from <b>coal-tar</b> and wood-tar are obtained from a similar process and have some common uses, they have also been placed {{in the same class}} of substances, with the terms [...] "creosote" [...] or [...] "creosote oil" [...] referring to either product.|$|R
25|$|Independently, {{there were}} {{investigations}} into the chemical nature of creosote. A study by F.K. Völkel revealed that the smell of purified creosote resembled that of guaiacol, and later studies by Heinrich Hlasiwetz identified a substance common to guaiacum and creosote that he called creosol, and he determined that creosote contained a mixture of creosol and guaiacol. Later investigations by Gorup-Besanez, A.E. Hoffmann, and Siegfried Marasse showed that wood-tar creosote also contained phenols, giving it a feature in common with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wood-tar {{creosote}} is to {{some extent}} used for wood preservation, but it is generally mixed with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> since the former is not as effective. Commercially available preparations of [...] "liquid smoke", marketed to add a smoked flavour to meat and aid as a preservative, consist primarily of creosote and other constituents of smoke. Creosote is the ingredient that gives liquid smoke its function; guaicol lends to the taste and the creosote oils help act as the preservative. Creosote can be destroyed by treatment with chlorine, either sodium hypochlorite, or calcium hypochlorite solutions. The phenol ring is essentially opened, and the molecule is then subject to normal digestion and normal respiration.|$|R
25|$|Water-gas-tar {{creosote}} is also {{derived from}} petroleum oil or shale oil, {{but by a}} different process; its distilled during the production of water gas. The tar is a by-product resulting from enrichment of water gas with gases produced by thermal decomposition of petroleum. Of the creosotes derived from oil, it is practically the only one used for wood preservation. It has {{the same degree of}} solubility as <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> and is easy to impregnate into wood. Like standard oil-tar creosote, it has a low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and has less antiseptic qualities. Petri dish tests have shown that water-gas-tar creosote is one-sixth as anti-septically effective as that of coal-tar.|$|R
25|$|Oil-tar {{creosote}} {{is derived}} from the tar that forms when using petroleum or shale oil in the manufacturing of gas. The distillation of the tar from the oil occurs at very high temperatures; around 980°C. The tar forms {{at the same time as}} the gas, and once processed for creosotes contains a high percentage of cyclic hydrocarbons, a very low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and no true anthracenes have been identified. Historically, this has mainly been produced in the United States in the Pacific coast, where petroleum has been more abundant than coal. Limited quantities have been used industrially, either alone, mixed with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> or fortified with pentachlorophenol.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> is {{the most}} widely used wood {{treatment}} today; both industrially, processed into wood using pressure methods such as [...] "full-cell process" [...] or [...] "empty-cell process", and more commonly applied to wood through brushing. In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellant. It's commonly used to preserve and waterproof cross ties, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Although suitable for use in preserving the structural timbers of buildings, it is not generally used that way because it is difficult to apply. There are also concerns about the environmental impact of the secretion of creosote preservative into the aquatic ecosystem.|$|R

2500|$|The use of <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> on a {{commercial}} scale began in 1838, when a patent covering the use of creosote oil to treat timber was taken out by inventor John Bethell. The [...] "Bethell process"—or as it later became known, the full-cell process—involves placing wood to be treated in a sealed chamber and applying a vacuum to remove air and moisture from wood [...] "cells". The wood is then pressure-treated to impregnate it with creosote or other preservative chemicals, after which vacuum is reapplied separate the excess treatment chemicals from the timber. Alongside the zinc chloride-based [...] "Burnett process", use of creosoted wood prepared by the Bethell process became a principal way of preserving railway timbers (e.g., ties, sleepers) so wood rot and need for replacement could be avoided.|$|R
25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation.

The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote.</b> Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin.

2500|$|<b>Coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> is greenish-brown <b>liquid,</b> with {{different}} degrees of darkness, viscosity, and fluorescence depending on how it's made.

After settling, the oil is dark green by reflected light and dark red by transmitted light. To the naked eye, it will generally appear brown. The creosote (often called [...] "creosote oil") consists almost wholly of aromatic hydrocarbons, with some amount of bases and acids and other neutral oils. The flash point is 7075°C and burning point is 90100°C, and when burned it releases a greenish smoke.

40|$|Shake flask studies {{examined}} the rate {{and extent of}} biodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 42 components of <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> present in contaminated groundwater recovered from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, Fla. The ability of indigenous soil microorganisms to remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions was determined by gas chromatographic analysis of organic extracts of biotreated groundwater. Changes in potential environmental and human health hazards associated with the biodegradation of this material were determined at intervals by Microtox assays and fish toxicity and teratogenicity tests. After 14 days of incubation at 30 degrees C, indigenous microorganisms effectively removed 100, 99, 94, 88, and 87 % of measured phenolic and lower-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and S-heterocyclic, N-heterocyclic, and O-heterocyclic constituents of creosote, respectively. However, only 53 % of the higher-molecular-weight PAHs were degraded; PCP was not removed. Despite the removal {{of a majority of}} the organic contaminants through biotreatment, only a slight decrease in the toxicity and teratogenicity of biotreated groundwater was observed. Data suggest that toxicity and teratogenicity are associated with compounds difficult to treat biologically and that one may not necessarily rely on indigenous microorganisms to effectively remove these compounds in a reasonable time span; to this end, alternative or supplemental approaches may be necessary. Similar measures of the toxicity and teratogenicity of treated material may offer a simple, yet important, guide to bioremediation effectiveness...|$|R

The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|R
