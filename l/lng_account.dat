40|$|A careful {{comparison}} of the experimental results {{reported in the literature}} reveals different variations of the melting temperature even for the same materials. Though there are different theoretical models, thermodynamic model has been extensively used to understand different variations of size-dependent melting of nanoparticles. There are different hypotheses such as homogeneous melting (HMH), liquid nucleation and growth (LNG) and liquid skin melting (LSM) to resolve different variations of melting temperature as reported in the literature. HMH and <b>LNG</b> <b>account</b> for the linear variation where as LSM is applied to understand the nonlinear behaviour in the plot of melting temperature against reciprocal of particle size. However, a bird's eye view reveals that either HMH or LSM has been extensively used by experimentalists. It has also been observed that not a single hypothesis can explain the size-dependent melting in the complete range. Therefore we describe an approach which can predict the plausible hypothesis for a given data set of the size-dependent melting temperature. A variety of data have been analyzed to ascertain the hypothesis and to test the approach...|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, Qatar began {{exporting}} LNG when it sent [...] of LNG to Spain. Qatar {{has become}} the world's leading LNG exporter. In 2009, Qatar exported nearly [...] of LNG. Japan, South Korea, and India were the primary destinations for Qatar's <b>LNG</b> exports, <b>accounting</b> for about 57% in 2009. European markets including Belgium, the United Kingdom and Spain were also significant buyers of Qatari <b>LNG,</b> <b>accounting</b> for an additional 33% ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, <b>LNG</b> <b>accounted</b> for 7 {{percent of}} the world’s natural gas demand. [...] The global trade in LNG, which has {{increased}} {{at a rate of}} 7.4 percent per year over the decade from 1995 to 2005, is expected to continue to grow substantially. [...] LNG trade is expected to increase at 6.7 percent per year from 2005 to 2020.|$|R
40|$|India is 70 percent import {{dependent}} for crude oil, but imported gas (<b>LNG)</b> <b>accounts</b> {{for just}} 28 {{percent of its}} total gas consumption. With the former comprising 30 percent of India’s primary commercial energy supply against 11 percent of gas (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2011), {{it is evident that}} unlike oil, imported gas has not featured predominantly in the country’s energy mix. There are several reasons for the limited role to date of natural gas imports on the Indian market – most prominently the difficulty of establishing a transnational gas pipeline and the absence of a long-term pricing policy in Indian gas user industries, which is necessary to support LNG supply contracts. Consequently, and in spite of the proximity of India to large gas deposits in the Gulf, the country is not an important player in the world gas market at present...|$|R
5|$|The export-oriented {{economy is}} {{dominated}} by liquefied natural gas (<b>LNG),</b> which <b>accounts</b> {{for more than half}} of total exports. Crude petroleum accounts for 20.8%, while palm oil, sawlogs, and sawn timber account for 9.0% collectively. The state receives a 5% royalty from Petronas over oil explorations in its territorial waters. Most of the oil and gas deposits are located offshore next to Bintulu and Miri at Balingian basin, Baram basin, and around Luconia Shoals.|$|R
40|$|The Asian LNG {{importing}} markets (and those {{expected to}} become LNG importers) loom large in the aspirations of LNG supply project investors. The mature Asian LNG importers Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan commenced LNG imports in 1969, 1986, and 1990 respectively. As a group these 'mature' Asian <b>LNG</b> importers <b>accounted</b> for two-thirds to three-quarters of global LNG imports from 1980 to 2016. These countries have minimal domestic gas resources and depend on natural gas to differing degrees in their power and non-power sectors. All three markets have enjoyed economic growth based on exportoriented manufacturing and technology goods production; however, with the slowdown in Chinese growth and the limits to growth inherent in this economic model, there are questions regarding their future economic performance. Japan in particular is struggling to stimulate domestic demand {{in the face of}} ongoing defl ationary tendencies. Declining population trends are also a relatively new challenge for these countries, threatening domestic consumption growth and workforce renewal. </p...|$|R
