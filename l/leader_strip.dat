25|$|The council {{shoulder}} patch (known as the CSP) is an arc-shaped patch worn {{at the top}} of {{the sleeve}} that identifies the local council. Below this, Scouts at the unit level wear a unit number and units with veteran status may wear a veteran unit bar above the numbers. Lone Cub Scouts and Lone Scouts wear the Lone Scout emblem in place of the unit numeral. On the new (2008) style official shirt, the badge of office is centered on the pocket, but on the older official uniform shirts, the badge of office is centered and touching the bottom of the unit numeral, or centered 4inches below the shoulder seam. When earned for the current position, the green lettering Trained <b>leader</b> <b>strip</b> is centered {{at the top of}} the pocket flap on the new style official shirt, but on the older official uniform shirts, the red lettering Trained <b>leader</b> <b>strip</b> is centered immediately below and touching the badge of office. Qualified commissioners may wear the Commissioner Arrowhead Honor in the bottom-most position (or if wearing the first version of the Centennial shirt, immediately below the Council Shoulder Strip in the location where a unit number would be worn). Youth who are serving as a Den Chief may wear a Den Chief cord around the left shoulder and under the shoulder strap instead of the emblem. Den Chiefs who earn the Den Chief Service Award may wear the service award cord in addition to the den chief cord, and may continue to wear it for as long as they are a youth.|$|E
50|$|A {{ramshackle}} Galactic Protectorate eventually {{emerges from}} {{the rubble of the}} Empire, though incessant power struggles keep it weak. <b>Leaders</b> <b>strip</b> subordinate commanders of trained personnel to strengthen their own positions while discouraging any ideas of rebellion. As a result, space fleets receive inadequate maintenance, and the level of civilization ebbs.|$|R
50|$|The new mosque <b>leaders</b> <b>stripped</b> Zayid {{from his}} post and {{replaced}} him with Masoud Ali Masoud, a conservative Islamic scholar {{and member of the}} Muslim Brotherhood. Changes were made in the community whereby women were asked to cover their hair and separated from men. In November, 1981 protests broke out among mosque members who objected to being affiliated with the Brotherhood and the foundation’s decision to turn the deed of the mosque over to the North American Atlantic Trust. Eventually, the dispute was settled in a 1983 Chicago hearing by a judge who deemed that no one had acted unlawfully. The community has steadily diversified to include Muslims of many languages and experiences—all praying side-by-side, with their children, in a brimming mosque that cannot contain them.|$|R

40|$|English and Power is a {{corporate}} learning and development programme and {{a process for}} doing sociolinguistic leadership research. At a practical level, the workshop helps women <b>leaders</b> <b>strip</b> back the meaning in meetings and interactions and develop a more nuanced understanding {{of the dynamics of}} power and how this is established, maintained, and challenged. In terms of research, the preparatory and workshop activities elicit linguistic data about professional identities and about the lived experience of influence, inclusion and exclusion. In this paper I explain the steps and activities involved in the English and Power programme in detail, concentrating first on the intervention as a learning and development event. I then go on to give an overview of the sociolinguistic analysis of the data from the four programmes run in conjunction with the Professional Women’s Network in Spain between April 2013 and July 2014. Finally I ask how far it is possible to do intervention and research at the same time...|$|R
50|$|The 735th Tank Battalion went {{immediately}} into occupation duties upon {{cessation of}} hostilities. Initially the battalion helped the infantry receive and guard the persistent stream of surrendering German soldiers. With {{an eye on}} the planned invasion of Japan, key leaders, including 3 out of 4 tank company commanders and 12 of 15 lieutenant platoon <b>leaders,</b> were <b>stripped</b> from the battalion and assigned to the 771st Tank Destroyer Battalion, destined for duty in the Pacific Ocean Theater of Operations. As a relatively senior unit, the rest of the 735th was slated to return to the United States and presumed deactivation.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the coffee attack, then-Senate Minority <b>Leader</b> David Paterson <b>stripped</b> Smith of her state-issued car, her honorary title, and a $9,500 per year stipend attached to her leadership position. Paterson stated that the coffee attack was the latest demonstration of what he called [...] "a pattern of inappropriate, unprofessional and often abusive behavior" [...] from Smith.|$|R
50|$|The {{efforts of}} the other guild <b>leaders</b> to <b>strip</b> Giselle of {{the spirits of the}} long dead guild leaders fail (issue 6) but the leaders of all but two of the magic guilds regard the {{situation}} as unacceptable. To destroy Giselle the guild leaders (with the exception of Astral and Nouveau) break the prison which confined Animora. This sets in motion a conflict which lasts for the next 12 issues between Giselle (and her sister Genevieve, the leader of the Nouveau guild) against Animora and the other guild leaders. Darrow rapidly switches sides and supports Animora also. With the reluctant aid of the spirits of the former guild leaders, Giselle is able to defeat all her enemies (issue 14 and again in issue 20) but at a cost.|$|R
50|$|A {{leader of}} The Fellow Association mysteriously dies under {{the hands of}} a Bajiquan master, and Fung becomes the number one suspect. Kuen and Fung investigate, and the case leads them {{straight}} to Fa Man, the <b>leader</b> of a <b>stripping</b> dance troupe. As the drama progresses, more mysteries behind the deaths of Chiu and Duen begin to unravel. Kuen finds that The Fellow Association is not the only society that is plaguing the walled city with evil.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} had no conventional leadership and often entire village population sat together and discussed for hours {{as to the}} steps {{to be taken in}} the movement. Men, women, youth, students all took part in these grand meetings. The traditional <b>leaders</b> were not <b>stripped</b> of the respect that they usually received but were given no more weight than anyone else at the meetings. A forum was thus launched which had no conventional political color and which united the entire adivasi society for a common cause after a long time. It gained immense popularity and most mainstream parties and their mass bases vanished altogether.|$|R
2500|$|Tasked by {{the politburo}} with {{controlling}} the Romanian Jewish community, Leonte Răutu became a denouncer of the [...] "Ioanid Gang". This name {{was applied to}} a cell of Jewish anti-communists who managed to rob the National Bank of Romania; captured, they were also accused of having plotted Răutu's murder. Such issues troubled the cultural ideologist: Răutu looked on as the Jews, discriminated against by the PMR's antisemitic lobby, registered for mass emigration to Israel. Răutu asked the party <b>leaders</b> not to <b>strip</b> all those who applied of their Romanian citizenship, and, responding to Gheorghiu-Dej's antisemitic comments, concluded that Romanian communism had failed at integrating the Jewish minority.|$|R
5000|$|His revolutionary {{programs}} for African self-reliance {{made him an}} icon to many of Africa's poor. Sankara remained popular with most of his country's impoverished citizens. However his policies alienated and antagonised the vested interests of an array of groups, which included the small, but powerful Burkinabé middle-class, the tribal <b>leaders</b> whom he <b>stripped</b> of the long-held traditional right to forced labour and tribute payments, and France and its ally the Ivory Coast. He was overthrown and assassinated in a coup d'état led by Blaise Compaoré on 15 October 1987. A week before his assassination, he declared: [...] "While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{movie is}} set in 180 AD, and focuses on a Roman general who {{is on his way}} to {{becoming}} Emperor, also known as Caesar. A jealous man in power decides to usurp the general's destiny and sets in motion a power play to become <b>leader</b> himself. By <b>stripping</b> the general (Toni Ribas) of all his rank and power, then sending him to become a slave who must fight in the arena to entertain the citizens, the thought is that the general will die an early death and never bother him again. Needless to say, the general survives, and thrives, which makes him become a threat to those who stole his position.|$|R
50|$|On February 20, all 14 Senate Democrats {{announced}} they would indefinitely remain in Illinois. Walker and the State Senate's Republicans {{tried to get}} the absentee Democrats to return. In late February, the Governor threatened to lay off state workers as the deadline to restructure the state's debt approached, however the deadline passed without incident. State Senate Majority <b>Leader,</b> Scott Fitzgerald, <b>stripped</b> Democratic staffers of their access to the copy machines if their representatives were absent without leave for two days or more, forcing staffers for the 14 legislators on the run to have to pay out of pocket for printing and photocopying. Senators were not allowed to receive their salary via direct deposit if they are absent for two days or more, which would have forced them to collect their pay checks in person, which none could do until they all returned from Illinois after the legislation was signed.|$|R
5000|$|Oppositional leader Vazgen Manukyan officially {{received}} 41% of {{the vote}} and denouncing them started mass demonstrations in the afternoon of 23 September claiming electoral fraud by Ter-Petrosyan's supporters. An estimated of 200,000 people gathered in Freedom Square to protest the election results. On 25 September, the mass of 150,000 to 200,000 gathered in the same square. Manukyan led the demonstrators to Baghramyan Avenue, where the parliament building is located (the Electoral Commission was inside the building at the time). Later during the day, the protesters broke the fence surrounding the Armenian parliament {{and got into the}} building. They beat up the parliament speaker Babken Ararktsyan and vice-speaker Ara Sahakyan. The security forces were brought into Yerevan to restore order. On the same day, Defence Minister Vazgen Sargsyan stated that [...] "even if they opposition win 100 percent {{of the vote}}s, neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior Ministry would recognize such political leaders." [...] Sargsyan was later criticized by the West for such statement. Vazgen Sargsyan and Minister of National Security Serzh Sargsyan announced on the Public Television of Armenia that their respective agencies have prevented an attempted coup d'état. The government sent tanks and troops to Yerevan to enforce the ban on rallies and demonstrations on 26 September 1996. A number of opposition <b>leaders</b> were <b>stripped</b> off legal immunity. Manukyan appealed to the Constitutional Court with the request for a new election, but it was rejected.|$|R
25|$|James Anthony Froude, a {{well-known}} English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule. In 1886, he published Oceana, {{another one of}} Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack {{of exposure to the}} native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions on the benefits of the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black <b>leaders</b> who would <b>strip</b> away whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not as bad as it was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals; however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies.|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} nation {{to use the}} RB-45C was the United Kingdom, where it was {{operated}} by an ad hoc unit of crews largely drawn from Nos. 35 and 115 squadrons. Whilst the USAF was prohibited by the President of the United States from overflying the Soviet Union unless under a state of war, US allies closer to the European theatre of war could. In the United Kingdom, whilst successive Labour governments had refused, the return of Winston Churchill and a Conservative administration to Downing Street brought a more co-operative atmosphere to joint intelligence initiatives. As a result, under Operation Ju-jitsu, in July 1951 four aircraft were leased to Britain from the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing to form a Royal Air Force (RAF) Special Duties Flight commanded by Squadron <b>Leader</b> John Crampton. <b>Stripped</b> of all USAF markings and then applied with RAF markings, the four aircraft were attached to a USAF squadron based in RAF Sculthorpe, Norfolk in eastern England. The aircraft were tasked with flying deep-level reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union to gather electronic and photographic intelligence. The Special Duties Flight conducted missions during the period 1952-54.|$|R
50|$|From the 11th century on the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the army}} was the king (kral), a veliki vojevoda or 'high military chief, equivalent to the Byzantine Grand Domestic, being appointed in his absence. However, since any call to arms had {{to be approved by}} the Sabor (the National Assembly) the king actually had limited military power, in effect being no more than a glorified Grand Župan, or elected tribal <b>leader.</b> Although Dušan <b>stripped</b> the Sabor of much of its power, the crown's dependence on a permanent nucleus of mercenaries that was not subject to the assembly's whims had by then already evolved, constituting the core of all Serbian armies throughout this period. Under Stephen Uroš II Milutin (1282-1321) these mercenaries included such diverse elements as Cumans; Anatolian Turks (some 1,500 were employed in 1311 from amongst those who had been allied to the Catalans in Thrace and Macedonia); Tartars from South Russia; and Christian Ossetians (Jasi in Serbian and Russian sources) from the Caucasus. However, it was Western European style heavy cavalry which soon came to predominate. As early as 1304 a certain Francisco de Salomone is mentioned in an inscription in Trevise as having distinguished himself in the service of 'Orosius, rex Rascie' (i. e. Uroš, king of Serbia). Mercenaries in Stephen Uroš III's army that defeated the Bulgarians at Battle of Velbazhd in 1330 were 1,500 Aragonese, Spaniards, and Germans, and it was the latter who seem to have predominated during Dušan reign. The papal legate to his court reported seeing 300 German mercenaries there under the knight Palman Bracht, who held the rank of capitaneus. In addition we know that the Serbian troops supplied to the Byzantine Emperor, John VI Kantakouzenos, in 1342-43 were Germans, and that the troops garrisoning Beroia in Macedonia in 1341-50 were German mercenaries too. Even at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 it is significant that many of Lazar men were German and Hungarian mercenaries according to a Florentine account, while a mid-15th century Ottoman source reports that his army included Wallachians, Hungarians, Bohemians, Albanians, Bulgarians and Franks, doubtless chiefly mercenaries. Another says he employed many mercenaries from among the Serbians themselves as well as the Hungarians, Bosnians and Albanians. Serbian documents indicate that as well as Germans the other predominant European mercenary elements comprised Spaniards (possibly as many as 1,300-strong at one point) plus Hungarians, Frenchmen, Italians and Swiss. One prominent name to appear in their ranks was that of Philippe de Mézières, in later life Chancellor of Cyprus and one of the last protagonists of the Crusade. Inevitably, in the 15th century Ottoman auxiliaries were also used, for example by Vuk Lazarević against Stephen, 1409-13. In addition to the king or despot, the larger cities also employed some mercenaries of their own to back up their militia.|$|R
