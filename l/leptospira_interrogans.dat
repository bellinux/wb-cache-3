40|$|Objective: Severe {{leptospirosis}} manifestations include acute renal failure, {{caused by}} acute interstitial nephri-tis and pulmonary hemorrohage. Spirochete invasion and toxicity of outer membrane cause robust inflamma-tory host responses. These responses {{lead to the}} generation of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory cell infiltrations which result in severe organ dysfunctions. The immunomodulation by the modulation of host immune response may alleviate the renal and pulmonary injury. The authors determined whether the current immunosuppressive agents could alleviate the inflammation and minimize the organ injury in hamster model. Material and Method: The animal experiments were conducted {{with the approval of}} The Ethical Research Committee of Chulalongkorn University Hospital. The <b>leptospira</b> <b>interrogan</b> serovar pyrogenese was isolated from a wild rat. The spirochete was grown in Fletcher’s semisolid media and after subcultures were transferred to the Fletcher’s liquid media. An amount of 0. 5 ml of the spirochete culture media containing 1 x 108 lepto-spires/ml was intraperitoneally injected to golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocrietus auratus), age 4 - 6 weeks, weighing 60 - 80 grams.

L. interrogans provoke an interstitial nephritis, but the induction of fibrosis caused by L. interrogans has not been studied in murine models.

40|$|<b>Leptospira</b> (L.) <b>interrogans</b> are {{bacteria}} {{responsible for}} a worldwide reemerging zoonosis. Some animals asymptomatically carry L. interrogans in their kidneys and excrete bacteria in their urine, which contaminates the environment. Humans are infected through skin contact with leptospires and develop mild to severe leptospirosis. Previous attempts to construct fluorescent or bioluminescent leptospires, which would permit in vivo visualization and investigation of host defense mechanisms during infection, have been unsuccessful. Using a firefly luciferase cassette and random transposition tools, we constructed bioluminescent chromosomal transformants in saprophytic and pathogenic leptospires. The kinetics of leptospiral dissemination in mice, after intraperitoneal inoculation with a pathogenic transformant, was tracked by bioluminescence using live imaging. For infective doses of 106 to 107 bacteria, we observed dissemination and exponential growth of leptospires in the blood, followed by apparent clearance of bacteria. However, with 2 × 108 bacteria, the septicemia led {{to the death of}} mice within 3 days post-infection. In surviving mice, one week after infection, pathogenic leptospires reemerged only in the kidneys, where they multiplied and reached a steady state, leading to a sustained chronic renal infection. These experiments reveal that a fraction of the leptospiral population escapes the potent blood defense, and colonizes a defined number of niches in the kidneys, proportional to the infective dose. Antibiotic treatments failed to eradicate leptospires that colonized the kidneys, although they were effective against L. interrogans if administered before or early after infection. To conclude, mice infected with bioluminescent L. interrogans proved to be a novel model to study both acute and chronic leptospirosis, and revealed that, in the kidneys, leptospires are protected from antibiotics. These bioluminescent leptospires represent a powerful new tool to challenge mice treated with drugs or vaccines, and test the survival, dissemination, and transmission of leptospires between environment and hosts...|$|R

The 16 S rRNA and lipL 32 genes were highly conserved, and the lipL 41 and ompL 1 genes were significantly more variable. Synonymous substitutions are distributed throughout the ompL 1 gene, whereas nonsynonymous substitutions are clustered in four variable regions encoding surface loops. While phylogenetic trees for the 16 S, lipL 32, and lipL 41 genes were relatively stable, 8 of 38 (20 %) ompL 1 sequences had mosaic compositions consistent with horizontal transfer of DNA between related bacterial species. A novel Bayesian multiple change point model was used to identify the most likely sites of recombination and to determine the phylogenetic relatedness of the segments of the mosaic ompL 1 genes. Segments of the mosaic ompL 1 genes encoding two of the surface-exposed loops were likely acquired by horizontal transfer from a peregrine allele of unknown ancestry.

Analyses were made by PCR using specific primers for detection of <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> DNA. The rodent species that tested positive were Heteromys gaumeri and Ototylomys phyllotis, both of which are new hosts for the bacteria in Southeastern Mexico. These records provide new insights into the disease&# 8217;s transmission that should be studied carefully in order to identify other potential host species, including humans, which are at risk of becoming infected if they are in contact with infected wildlife...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{alkalinity}} and hypertonicity on the motile behaviour of <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> (bzflexa) B I 6 were observed, quantified, {{and compared}} with effects previously shown by similar factors on the motility of eubacteria. <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> tolerated relatively {{high concentrations of}} hydroxide ions. Motility {{similar to that in}} controls was observed at pH values up to 9 - 8; but at pH 10. 0 motility declined sharply with time of exposure, and there was structural altera-tion, visible as a blebbing of the cell envelope. Unlike the behaviour of eubacteria, immobilization of L. interrogans induced by hydroxide ions could not be reversed by lowering the pH. It is suggested that by restricting entry of hydroxide ions, the cell envelope protects its motility apparatus from adverse effects. <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> was completely immobilized in 0. 5 M and I so M-sucrose solutions. Unlike the eubacteria, leptospires were incapable of spontaneous re-version to motile forms and resumption of motility was dependent on both concentration and time of exposure to sucrose. Deuterium oxide did not affect movement, suggesting that even though leptospire endoflagella and the exoflagella of eubacteria are analogous, the motile behaviour of L. interrogans is significantly different from that of eubacteria...|$|E
40|$|Erythrocyte osmotic {{fragility}} (EOF) {{was carried}} out in nineteen dogs naturally infected by <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> serovar icterohaemorrhagiae/copenhagi. A decreased EOF was observed, suggesting a modification of erythrocyte components secondary to disturbances that occur during canine leptospirosis, such as renal damage and hepatic disease...|$|E
40|$|Three {{monoclonal}} antibodies produced against <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> serovar pomona {{have been}} studied for their diagnostic usefulness. All three monoclonals reacted strongly in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect fluorescent antibody test with serovar pomona and did not react with serovars grippotyphosa, canicola, icterohaemorrhagiae and hardjo...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} titres to four endemic leptospiral serovars in dog sera submitted to diagnostic laboratories {{with the purpose of}} identifying patterns of risk, and generating further hypotheses for investigation of canine leptospirosis in New Zealand. METHODS: Serum samples from 655 dogs were sourced from the central and lower North Island and from the South Island of New Zealand in 2005. They were screened by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) against <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> serovars Copenhageni, Pomona and Ballum and L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis. Variables investigated for their association with seropositivity to leptospirosis included serovar, breed, region, North vs. South Island, age and gender. RESULTS: Positive MAT titres to <b>Leptospira</b> <b>interrogans</b> serovar Copenhageni were found in more than 10...|$|E
