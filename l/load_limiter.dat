5000|$|Safety {{was a key}} {{focus of}} the Megane I, Renault's first car {{reflecting}} their new focus of selling on safety. It featured a pillar-mounted three-point seatbelt for the middle-rear occupant (replacing the common 'lap strap'), standard front belt pre-tensioners and load limiters, driver's airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive safety structure - a specification ahead of most rivals in 1995. Some features, such as the three-point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the Megane). The car also benefited from Renault's first [...] "System for Restraint and Protection" [...] (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, pretensioner, <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> and airbag. The Megane I achieved a best-in-class 4-star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by Euro NCAP.|$|E

40|$|Our {{thesis is}} made in {{collaboration}} with Autoliv Sweden and the department Global Development Seatbelt in Vårgårda. Autoliv was founded in 1953 by two brothers from Vårgårda. Since then, they have become world leading in automotive safety and cooperates with several major automotive companies.   The aim {{of the project was}} to evaluate a concept that Adrian Bud for Global Development Seatbelt department in Vårgårda had come up with. The concept aims to simplify the design and reduce the number of parts in an adaptive <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> (LLA). With a {{reduction in the number of}} parts, the price for the LLA would decrease and also make assembly easier.   An LLA adjusts the chest compression from the seatbelt in a crash sequence. This helps reducing the injury that might result from such chest compressions in a crash. The <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> ensures that the slowdown of the body is done in a smooth manner by adjusting the amount of belt released.   Our concept evaluation has included conceptual design, primary design, visualization of design in Catia V 5 and FEM analysis. Finally prototypes were built with the help of Autolivs central workshop and tests were performed at Autoliv.

The article was published as part a Special Issue of the 59 th Annual Scientific Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine (AAAM), October 2015. Objective: To determine whether varying the seat belt <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> (SBL) according to crash and occupant characteristics could have real-world injury reduction benefits in frontal impacts and, if so, to quantify those benefits. Methods: Real-world UK accident data were used to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and frontal crash scenarios where improved chest protection could be most beneficial. Generic baseline driver and front passenger numerical models using a 50 th percentile dummy were developed with MADYMO software. Simulations were performed where the <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> threshold was varied in selected frontal impact scenarios. For each SBL setting, restraint performance, dummy kinematics, and injury outcome were studied in 5 different frontal impact types. Thoracic injury predictions were converted into injury probability values using Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2 + age-dependent thoracic risk curves developed and validated based on a methodology proposed by Laituri et al. (2005). Real-world benefit was quantified using the predicted AIS 2 + risk and assuming that an appropriate adaptive system was fitted to all the cars in a real-world sample of recent frontal crashes involving European passenger cars.

40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to validate a mathematical simulation model of the Q 3 ATD in an integrated forward-facing booster-type restraint in the rear seat and to evaluate restraint parameters to further develop design guidelines for this type of restraint system for forward facing children corresponding {{to the size of the}} Q 3. Only frontal impact was considered. Methods: The software MADYMO was used to create and run the model of the restraint system and model of the child. The restraint system consisted of a seat and a safety belt. The child dummy model was the Q 3. The complete model was validated to sled tests on 12 response signals: displacements of the dummy model, safety belt forces, and dummy model accelerations. The method used in the evaluation of the restraint parameters was a factorial design of experiments (DOE). The study included a total of 9 parameters: 6 related to the safety belt, such as pretensioner, <b>load</b> <b>limiter,</b> and belt anchor positions; two parameters related to the seat (stiffness and pitch angle); and one related to the foot support. The parameters were evaluated based on their effect on a number of dummy model responses. Results: The validation study showed that the mathematical model predicted the ATD's kinematics and measurements. Furthermore, the parameters that had the greatest effect on the dummy model responses were the lap belt angle, the D-ring x and y positions (upper belt anchor), the retractor pretensioner, and the retractor <b>load</b> <b>limiter.</b> The lap belt angle had the greatest effects of all parameters. The resulting head x displacement was 7. 8 cm shorter with a lap belt angle of 24 degrees to the horizontal, compared to a 73 degrees to the horizontal lap belt angle; it also resulted in a reduction of the head resultant acceleration by 9. 8 g. Conclusions: In order to decrease the Q 3 ATD head, chest and pelvis accelerations and to limit the Q 3 ATD head displacement, the following practices are recommended: first, position the D-ring rearward of the ATD so that the belt encloses the ATD's shoulder; second, position the lap belt anchors to make the lap belt angle 24 degrees to the horizontal, but make sure submarining is not induced; and finally, use a safety belt with pretensioner and <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> functions. However, these recommendations need to be balanced with the recommendations for other occupant sizes, and any specific settings have to be evaluated further before introduction into vehicles. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Investigate the {{combined}} effects of belt geometry, seat substructure, and seat belt pretensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> on rear seat occupant injury risk. Methods: An instrumented Hybrid III 5 th percentile adult female dummy {{was subjected to}} simulated frontal impacts (Δv = 45. 8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27. 1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, {{and the use of}} seat belt pretensioners with <b>load</b> <b>limiters.</b> Results: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on submarining. Seat belt pretensioners with <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent submarining. The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented submarining in one case but could not prevent submarining with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and submarining. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash belt fit, antisubmarining seat pans, belt buckles positioned near the seat bight, and seat belts with pretensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> for rear seat occupants.

40|$|Traffic related {{trauma is}} {{the main cause of}} child {{fatality}} and injury in Europe and North America, with the large majority of fatalities and injuries occurring to children in cars. Specifically, head injury is a common outcome in injury causing car accidents. Furthermore, injury statistics show that the injury rate increases at the graduation from one type of restraint system to another. In Sweden, the graduation from a rear facing restraint to the forward facing booster child restraint has been identified as the first critical graduation. It occurs as the children reach the approximate weight of 18 kg. This size is similar to the anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) that correspond to 3 -year-old children, and the two with most measurement capabilities are the HIII 3 YO and the Q 3. These ATDs are used in order to improve restraint systems for children, and they need to emulate real child crash behaviour adequately in order to properly inform proposals for improvements. The Q 3 is the newest and it is under consideration to be included in European requirements. Thus, both further improvements of the restraint systems for 3 -year-old children and additional evaluation of the Q 3 are needed. Therefore, this thesis presents two studies: one that investigates which restraint system characteristics are beneficial for forward facing 3 -year-olds in frontal crashes; the other study evaluates the head kinematics of the Q 3 math model and a modified version of it, by comparing the math models’ responses to the assumed kinematics of 3 -year-old children in real accidents. The restraint system study was done through mathematical simulations with the MADYMO model of the Q 3 ATD. Nine parameters were studied: six related to the seat belt (such as pretensioner, <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> and belt anchor positions); two parameters were related to the seat (stiffness and pitch angle); and one related to the foot support. The parameters that had the greatest effect on the dummy responses were: belt anchor positions, retractor pretensioner and retractor <b>load</b> <b>limiter.</b> The conclusions were that: the upper belt anchor should be positioned rearward of the dummy so that the belt encloses the dummy’s shoulder; the lap belt anchors should be positioned to make the lap belt angle as horizontal as possible without inducing submarining; and the seat belt should have pretensioner and <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> functions. However, these recommendations need to be balanced with the recommendations for other occupant sizes and ages before implementation into any vehicle. In the second study, the Q 3 math model and the modified Q 3 math model head kinematics were evaluated through mathematical reconstructions of real accidents. Head x, y and z displacements were compared with the assumed displacements {{of the children in the}} accidents, and differences were identified. The modifications to the Q 3 math model consisted of an increase in the bend and twist flexibility of the thorax, and an update of some anthropometric measures to new data of weights and lengths of body parts. The simulation results showed that in straight frontal crashes, the Q 3 math model predicted the head displacement adequately. In oblique frontal crashes, the rigid torso of the Q 3 math model appeared to obstruct the expected head displacements. The modified version correlated better to the assumed head kinematics of the children in the oblique frontal crashes. Its performance in straight frontal crashes was adequate. Future updates of the Q 3 ATD and math model should include consideration of these findings. Finally, despite the identified lacks of the Q 3 math model, the findings of the second study do not alter the conclusions of the first study; the results are valid also for the modified Q 3 math model. The two studies are thus important contributions to the continuous work of mitigating traffic accident induced injury and fatality to children...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In Europe, the deployment characteristics of frontal crash restraints are generally optimised to best protect an average young male, since a 50 th percentile male dummy is used in a stylised frontal impact scenario. These single point restraint systems may not provide similar levels of effectiveness when the crash scenarios vary {{with respect to the}} regulatory and consumer crash test procedures. Previous research has demonstrated that varying restraint deployment characteristics according to occupant and crash variation can provide further injury reduction in frontal impacts. This thesis reports the investigation conducted to assess the potential real world injury reduction benefit of smart restraint systems in frontal impacts. The intelligent capability of the restraint was achieved by varying the seat belt <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> (SBL) threshold, according to the frontal crash scenario. Real world accident data (CCIS) were analysed to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and frontal impact scenarios where employing smart load limiters could be most beneficial, particularly in reducing chest injury risk.

40|$|The {{work done}} in this master thesis can de divided into several categories, but the main idea was to {{optimize}} the principle of energy absorption that {{was developed in the}} Sirius course. If possible, the principle would then be implemented in three applications in the interior of a personal vehicle. These applications were the steering column - which would get the main focus, the ride down seats and the shoulder belt <b>load</b> <b>limiter.</b> A drop test rig, which tried to resemble a crash situation, was built in order to test di erent materials and cutting geometries. By input from VMCC, the mass of the weight and the height from which it was dropped could be calculated. From previous experience it was known that a material that gave short chips gave large fluctuations in force, so a search was carried out to find materials that would give long chips. Also, the geometry of the cutting insert was thought {{to play a role in}} the stability of the resulting forces. Therefore, an investigation of cutting geometries was carried out. This resulted in five di erent materials (aluminium, copper, brass, bronze and PTFE) and six cutting geometries that were to be tested. A testing matrix was developed so that each cutting geometry would be tested three times on each material. This first test series lead to the conclusion that aluminium was the most suitable material, but it was also realized that the test rig was not sti enough to decide the best geometry of the cutting insert. This understanding lead to a redesign of the test rig. In the second test setup two cutting inserts were put with cutting edges pointing towards each other, and the aluminium test plates fell down between. This way the perpendicular forces were cancelled out and the cutting process got much more stable. Again, all cutting geometries were tested, but only with the aluminium test plates. After some statistical analysis, the choice of most optimal cutting geometry could be decided. With both the material and cutting geometry chosen, other parameters could be examined. Different cutting depths were tested to see if a dependency between depth and force could be found. An almost linear relationship was found when the cutting depth was plotted with the cutting force, but a somewhat di erent behaviour was shown when the specific cutting force was plotted next to the force. This means that if both cutting inserts has nearly the same cutting depth the force is linear to the cutting depth, but if they di er, especially at low cutting depths, the linearity is broken. Tests with varying temperatures were also carried out. A series of tests were performed both at - 15 C and 55 C, but no big di erences could be seen in relation to the tests performed at room temperature. Finally, the static load at which cutting first started was investigated. A test performed in a tensile strength measuring machine showed that the cutting force is independent of the velocity. This was also confirmed when looking at the plots from the drop tests, as the force did not rise towards the end of the cutting process, when the cutting velocity obviously was lower. To summarize the energy absorbing principle, the tests performed in this work show that the stability of the force level is strongly depending of the material. The cutting geometry has only a small influence, while the temperature and the velocity has little to none. Design proposals of the steering column, ride down seats and shoulder <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> are presented at the end of this rapport, specially designed to take as little space as possible and using the same principle as in test setup two.

40|$|For {{assessment}} of their performance and {{for the development of}} injury risk functions {{there is a need for}} additional biofidelity data. In this report two types of data are made available: Part A - post mortem human subject exposed to various restraints; Part B – volunteer shoulder rang-of-motions. Part A LAB- 2002 : Load-limiting belt restraints have been present in cars since 1995. An accident study showed the greater effectiveness in thorax injury prevention using a 4 kN <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> belt with an airbag than using a 6 kN <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> belt without airbag. Frontal sled crashes were performed using PMHS. Restraint conditions evaluated are 6 kN load-limiting belt and 4 kN load-limiting belt with an airbag. Loads between the occupant and the sled environment were recorded. Various measurements characterize the PMHS behaviour and injuries were noted. LAB- 2005 : Many studies have reported multiple rib fractures sustained by an Out-of-Position (OOP) driver subjected to a frontal airbag deployment. Two successive phases occur during the bag deployment: punch-out loading of the thorax, followed by a membrane effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the thoracic injuries generated by each phase separately. Tests of nine post-mortem human surrogates were carried out on a static test bench using a driver side airbag module. Three loading configurations were performed: membrane only, punch-out only, and both types combined. The membrane-only tests were performed with the thorax initially positioned at 13, 78 and 128 mm from the plate in order to vary the load magnitude. The punch-out and the combined tests were performed with the thorax initially 8 mm from the module. Accelerometers and angular rate sensors were fixed on the sternum and on the first, fourth, and eighth thoracic vertebrae of the PMHS. Ribs 2 to 6 were instrumented with strain gauges. The reaction force of the bag on the plate was measured using four 2 -axis load cells. Results showed that both pure punch-out and pure membrane loading can result in thoracic injuries. However, the rib fracture locations seemed to differ from one type of loading to the other. Moreover, for the same initial distance between the airbag module and the thorax, the injuries were more severe in the combined effect tests than in the pure punch-out or pure membrane. LAB- 2008 : Ribs of 8 PMHS were equipped with up to 96 strain gauges. In a first series of 3 tests, the subjects were seated upright and their chests were loaded by a 23. 4 kg impactor propelled at 4. 3 m/s in pure frontal, oblique and pure lateral directions. In a second series of 3 tests, the subjects were loaded by the deployment of an unfolded airbag in the same 3 directions. Part B The shoulder complex is rarely exposed to injuries in frontal and oblique frontal collisions, but influence the belt interaction and as such the thorax compression and head kinematics. The purpose of this study was to establish response requirements for the shoulder complex in terms of range-of-motion and stiffness. Six male volunteers were seated in a rigid seat that simulated a car driver’s posture whilst in a special designed test rig. Loads to the shoulders were applied through the arms, by means of brackets fastened to the elbows, loads rearward were applied by means of a strap around the shoulder complex. Torso movement was blocked by two pre-tensed diagonal belts that were routed close to the neck to avoid excessive clavicle interaction. Shoulders were loaded with increasing load from 0 ̶ 200 N/shoulder at 50 N increments. A test series included four load series: shoulders pulled straight forward, forward-upward, upward and rearward. Each volunteer was exposed to three tests. Shoulder positions relative to the spine were obtained from film analysis. Photo markers were mounted on the volunteer’s skin: head, posterior tip of acromion process, chest, T 1 and T 4. The right and left acromion relative to T 1 displacements were used to calculate the shoulder range-of-motion in three directions. Belt loads and seat back loads were recorded. Average resultant volunteers’ acromion relative to T 1 range-of-motion, at the maximum load, was 55 mm for forward loads, 69 mm for forward-upward loads, 73 for mm upward loads and 50 mm for rearward loads. The volunteers provided measurements with reasonable repeatability. The volunteers curved their spines only slightly when shoulder loads were applied. Hence, shoulder complex motion was successfully isolated and results reflect pure shoulder relative to chest motions. The applied loads were lower than those commonly seen in frontal crashes, however the shoulder is highly mobile and its response to loads is largely dependent on muscle characteristics. As such studies using volunteers may be complimentary to tests with post mortem human subjects...|$|E

40|$|Autoliv {{as a world}} leading {{enterprise}} in automotive safety has determined four Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study for its main products including airbag, seatbelt, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and Night Vision Camera to improve its knowledge about these products and their supply chain. This particular LCA study {{has been carried out}} for Autoliv’s pyrotechnic front seatbelt. In this study the whole life cycle is considered; starting from extraction and production of raw materials, manufacturing of components at suppliers plants, seatbelt assembly at Autoliv plant in Hungary, installation in Audi Ingolstadt, use phase in the cars and finally seatbelt’s end of life when it is shredded together with the car. The results of the study indicate that {{over the course of the}} life cycle of the seatbelt, the use phase has the largest potential to cause global warming (total 41 kg), acidification (total 75 g), eutrophication (total 8. 72 g) and air ecotoxicity (total 90 kg). This is mainly due to high amount of CO 2 and variety of other toxic substances that are released during combustion of fuel and could be improved through weight reduction. In case of water ecotoxicity (total 6 kg) the most influential activity is manufacturing and for soil ecotoxicity (total 3 g) and human toxicity (total 1. 8 kg), material production is the main responsible. From the results, it could also be observed that pretensioner retractor is the component which has the largest environmental load, due to its complexity and high number of the components which involve variety of suppliers in its realization. The comparison between airbag and seatbelt shows that considering global warming potential airbag has larger impact in the production phase and end of life while smaller in the use phase. Regarding acidification and eutrophication, in production phase the results are quite similar but in use phase, seatbelt dominates quite significantly. In cases of air and water ecotoxicity and human toxicity the result represents that airbag has larger impacts. Moreover, results signify that production processes carried out in Autoliv’s plants are less harmful to environment in comparison with the production processes carried out in other suppliers’ plants and also other phases in the life cycle. The results also prove that transportation has quite low contribution in global warming. The results show that about 70 % of seatbelt is recycled and 26. 4 % is recovered as energy. It is worth to mention that against our initial expectation, studied seatbelt was a quite complex product since it has the features of seatbelt pretensioner and <b>load</b> <b>limiter...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Euro NCAP {{tested a}} second {{generation}} Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection {{inside the car}} for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection {{at all on the}} front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. [...] "A poor result for a new car" [...] was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the Getz {{was tested}} by the Euro NCAP, scoring an overall rating of four-stars. The model tested {{featured}} driver and passenger airbags, seat-mounted thorax and head airbags, and front seat belts with pre-tensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters.</b> It {{was described as a}} [...] "reasonably balanced performance" [...] and [...] "generally good" [...] in-car protection for children. It was noted, however, that the design of the car did little to protect pedestrians. An additional point was scored for the seat belt reminder that is provided for the driver.|$|R
5000|$|Body {{strength}} increases, {{aimed at}} improving occupant safety and the Falcon's rating in the independent ANCAP [...] crash test program, were also achieved. In the said tests, it received a three star adult occupant protection rating with a score of 24.2 and in the offset crash test, {{it was found that}} there was a low risk of injury to all body regions (including the driver’s foot and lower leg due to excessive brake pedal movement). New safety features included a passenger airbag and seatbelt pretensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> on the front seats across the range. Wagons were fitted with a three-point lap-sash rear centre seatbelt, with the retractor integrated into the seat back.|$|R
40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of rear seat occupants through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of rear seat occupants, new safety technologies intended for the rear seat, studies of rear seat belt and seat geometry, and methods for assessing belt fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of rear seat occupants, built-in booster seats with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the rear seat should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the rear seat should have higher priority. <b>Load</b> <b>limiters,</b> seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for rear seat occupants. If <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> are installed in rear seats, the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the rear seat than in the front seat. The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row occupant seating patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children. Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating...|$|R
