40|$|OBJECTIVE: Trocar-site incisional hernias {{and their}} {{complications}} {{are reported in}} 1 % to 6 % of patients. Such hernias are attributed {{to the difficulty of}} applying standard suturing techniques to wound closure. We report our experience with a simple device, the Deschamps <b>ligature</b> <b>needle.</b> METHODS: The Deschamps needle has a handle and a tip (sharp or blunt), with an opening to pass suture. The blunt tip is very effective for closing trocar sites. Disposable needles are obviously sharp, but can bend on the needle holder and break in a deep small incision. The Deschamps needle is a rigid, noncutting instrument that can be forced through fascia and peritoneum (around the surgeon's fingertip) avoiding loss of pneumoperitoneum. A full-thickness closure is accomplished. We perform closure under direct vision through the scope. Tactile sense is provided by the surgeon's finger. The last trocar site is closed in the same manner without the scope. RESULTS: We have used the Deschamps needle since 1992 in all (1400) laparoscopic procedures. We close 10 -mm and 5 -mm trocar sites and have not observed wound dehiscence or hernias at these sites. CONCLUSION: The Deschamps needle is effective in preventing incisional hernias and wound dehiscence. It is cost-effective. Disposable, single-use devices vary in price from $ 30 to $ 75 each. The Deschamps needle is sold in Italy at approximately $ 35 each. Considering that it may have been in the trays of most operating rooms for years (as in our case), and the number of procedures performed, we conclude that the real cost of this instrument is almost negligible...|$|E

For ML, the ligature was initially tightened with a needle holder around {{the wings of the}} bracket, and then loosened by one turn to allow free movement of the archwire.|$|R
