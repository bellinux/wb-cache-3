The reduction of. electrodeposited P-lead dioxide to <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> in 5 M sulphuric acid has been studied at the stationary and RDE. Potential step and sweep experiments have been made and {{a model for the}} discharge process of lead dioxide has been proposed based on charge transfer and limited high field conduction. T'he potentiostatic oxidations of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> overlying lead and lead dioxide have been investigated. The reduction behaviour of porous one-dimensional lead dioxide electrodes have been examined and shown to be independant of rotation speed in a large excess of 5 M sulphuric acid. The reduction peak was broadened by the porosity. This broadening was interpreted in terms of the reaction being driven more deeply into the pore structure as the front of the electrode becomes progressively more resistive. The effect of different potential sweep rates on the current response and effects of progressive redox cycles can be fully explained on this model. The potentiostatic oxidation of porous electrodes of lead dioxide containing <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> has also been investigated. The form of the current transient was found to depend on the balance of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> and lead dioxide. Investigations have been carried out on the above electrodes using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy and alternating current. Possible interpretations of the results are discussed. The influence of the solid/porous material interphase on the electrode behaviour has been investigated for a variety of alloy supports with special reference to the charge output on reduction, ease of reoxidation and electrode support/porous phase adhesion.

The <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> particles are an undesirable byproduct, and thus the model is used to ascertain the optimal system temperature configuration such that particle extraction is maximised. The model describes the evolution of a single, spherical particle due to the mass flux of lead particles from a surrounding acid solution. We divide the concentration field into two separate regions. Specifically, a relatively small boundary layer region around the particle is characterised by fast diffusion, and is thus considered quasistatic. In contrast, diffusion in the far-field is slower, and hence assumed to be time-dependent. The final system consisting of two nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential equations for the particle radius and lead concentration, is integrated numerically...|$|E

The technique of scanning electron microscopy {{has been used to}} observe morphological changes occurring in the redox processes involved in the interconversion of lead dioxide and <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Observations have been made on lead dioxide films on platinum and pure lead substrates and on one and two dimensional porous lead dioxide electrodes supported either by pure lead or lead-antimony alloys.

For porous lead dioxide electrodes cycled to a constant response, three well defined regions were found to exist within the electrode. The oxidation of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> on lead and leadantimony alloys has shown that a duplex layer of lead dioxide existed on the lead-antimony alloys only. The primary layer of lead dioxide found on these alloys was analogous to the single layer on the pure lead electrodes.

40|$|Historical {{stained glass}} {{has a clear}} {{tendency}} to form a crusted layer on its surface due to the environmental exposure. One of the most delicate aspects to be faced during the restoration of historic glass windows is the cleaning of these thick corrosion crusts. For several centuries, stained glass windows have been cleaned using damaging mechanical (scalpel) and chemical (high acidic or alkaline solutions) methods. Today's understanding of the cleaning process comprises two complementary aims: improving the readability of the glass and reducing the weathering process of the historical glass. The act of removing deposits and encrustations resulting from corrosion should not endanger the artwork itself. Mechanical methods, cleaning solutions or gel pads are now being developed. However, these methods could present further problems. In this study, we examine a new cleaning method that can be employed to remove encrustations in a quick and efficient way. Results up to now, obtained on specific stained glass windows are promising; further researches are in process for other cases. We propose an optimized solution to dissolve calcium carbonates and <b>lead</b> <b>sulphates</b> from Avila Cathedral glass windows crust. This system is tailored to control pH, temperature, conductivity and concentration of Ca 2 +. Continuous on-line analysis of these parameters allows us to monitor the cleaning process.

30|$|Red lead, or minium, has a {{long history}} of use in {{worldwide}} artistic and artisanal practices, although nomenclature issues are evident [1, 237, 238]. Its synthesis and relation with the other lead oxides is well described in literature [238]. As a pigment, it is not stable in fresco, or in watercolour. It was anyway used, for its optical properties and cheap price, compared to other red pigments [1, 120]. It is reportedly blackened on manuscripts and in glue tempera paintings exposed to light and humidity [1, 64]. On the other hand, it is reported that medium-rich proteinaceous red lead paints are stable to light, the binder protecting the pigment [239]. Moreover, the pigmented layer has different properties than an unpigmented one [51]. It is soluble in diluted acids (nitric, chloridric, oxalic, acetic), with formation of the corresponding salts, and when heated it transforms to litharge [1, 240]. It is sensitive to sulphur containing compounds, as H 2 S and SO 2 of atmospheric or biological origin, and pigments such as arsenic sulphides (AsxSy), vermillion (HgS) and ultramarine (Na 8 [Al 6 Si 6 O 24]Sn), especially in manuscripts, wall paintings, and in case the pigment is not mixed with a binder, which cause the formation of dark grey PbS [1, 60, 93, 124, 238, 241] and of whitish PbSO 4 [59, 68, 233, 242]. This was known to artists and artisans, as demonstrated by the presence of a blank space between yellow orpiment and red lead in a 12 th century illuminated manuscript, although mixtures of the two pigments do not behave consistently. The reaction between red lead and orpiment produced galena, which could further degrade into <b>sulphates,</b> and <b>lead</b> arsenate species [241]. Mimetite Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl was as well identified as a reaction product of minium and orpiment [186]. Moreover, it seems that minium promotes the blackening of leadwhite, when the pigments are mixed [204]. Some cases of red lead lightening are reported as well, and are related to the formation of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphates</b> and/or carbonates, according to the atmospheric pollutants and to the initial amount of PbO in red lead [68, 93, 200, 237, 238], via the formation of plumbonacrite [228].|$|R

The effect of acid and water wash as common demineralisation pre-treatments were also analysed to evaluate their roles in the thermal degradation of the biomass. Results from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (Py-MS) measurements indicated that these pre-treatments change the matrix and the physical-chemical properties of wood. Results suggested that these structural changes increase the thermal stability of cellulose during pyrolysis. Sample preparation was also found to be a crucial factor during pyrolysis; different anions of metal salts changed the weight loss rate curves of wood material, which indicates changes in the primary degradation process of the biomass. Results also showed that dry-mixing, impregnation or ion-exchange influence the thermal behaviour of wood in different ways when a chosen metal salt was and added to the wood material...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The infra-red {{spectrum}} and X-ray powder pattern of a chemically analysed specimen ofleadhillite, a <b>lead</b> carbonate <b>sulphate</b> hydroxide mineral from Lead-hills, Scotland, are {{shown to be}} different from those in the literature. The IR spectra of several specimens suggest that mutual replacement of SO 4, CO 3, and OH may occur in this mineral, and it is thought hat this might be responsible for the observed variation in X-ray spacings. IN a recent study of leadhillite~ " (Pb 4 SO 4 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2) from Leadhills, Scotland (Milodowski, in prep.), its infra-red absorption spectrum was ob-served to differ considerably from those in the literature (Moenke, 1962; Omori and Kerr, 1963), which in turn differed from each other.

It was also noted that, while the X-ray powder pattern of leadhillite showed the same relative intensities as those reported in the JCPDS index and in the literature, the d-spacings were significantly larger.

50|$|The {{veins of}} lead in the Castleton area formed 280 million years ago when a fault in the local Carboniferous {{limestone}} allowed mineralising fluids to flow into fissures in the rock, pushed up by great pressure from beneath the Earth's surface. <b>Lead</b> and <b>sulphate</b> combined to form the lead ore galena. In its heyday, the mine was a complex system of levels and shafts that extended for approximately 1500 metres into the Edale shales beneath the nearby Mam Tor. In the early days the mining was open cast, forming a gorge in the hillside with the water diverted by a leat to the north to keep the workings dry. Later the miners followed the vein of lead underground. The vein is exposed on the surface in a small limestone outcrop {{at the entrance to}} the mine and then continues underground just south of due west in the limestone under the Edale shales of Mam Tor. The 1769 plans of the mine show that there were several branch veins leading from the main lead workings. There are several small pipe caverns contained within the mine; the most prominent of these is Odin Cave (called Gank Hole by the miners) which was formed by groundwater opening out a void between limestone boulders.

Alteration of soil-lime reactions in the presence of <b>sulphate</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of ettringite after curing for longer periods. The formation of these compounds affects strength development by cementation. However, after curing for short periods, the strength of lime-treated soil is improved in the presence of sulphate.

Consequently the stress-strain behaviour and effective stress paths of treated soil cured for long periods show the behaviour of a normally consolidated soil rather than of cemented soils. The reduction in strength is due primarily to a reduction in the effective cohesion intercept. The effective friction angle has not been affected significantly. Â© 2006 Thomas Telford Ltd...|$|R
