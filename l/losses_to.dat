5|$|Affeldt pitched {{with the}} Wilmington Blue Rocks of the single-A {{advanced}} Carolina League in 2000.

5|$|After World War I, the {{nationwide}} prohibition of alcohol in 1919 brought heavy <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> the St. Louis brewing industry. Other industries, such as light manufacturing of clothing, automobile manufacturing, and chemical production, filled {{much of the}} gap, and St. Louis's economy was relatively diversified and healthy during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's biggest win at Highbury came on 9 January 1932, with an 11–1 {{victory over}} Darwen in the FA Cup. Their biggest defeats were 0–5 <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> Huddersfield Town in the First Division on 14 February 1925 and against Chelsea in the League Cup on 11 November 1998.|$|E

5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the German bombers were {{touching}} {{down in the}} Pas de Calais. Two were {{so badly}} damaged that they were written off in crash landings, bringing the total <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> eight Do 17s. Almost all bore the scars of battle. One machine had sustained 70 hits, another 200.|$|E

5|$|Guillemin was {{a member}} of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France's first victory in the Five Nations. After all the {{previous}} French <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> the Home Nations teams, the Scottish were favourites to win, and France's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press. It proved a reversal of the defeats, accompanied with humiliating press commentary which suggested that the French were too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Australian weasel shark is {{commonly}} caught by prawn and fish trawlers operating off northern Australia. Smaller numbers are also captured in gillnets and on longlines.

5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> the French when they were losing two men to one. Both the French and the Russians {{suffered}} terribly but the Russians had reserve troops, and a clear advantage in the logistics war. The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces. According to Rhien, so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> the Akron Pros, the Triangles did not {{contend for}} the APFA trophy in 1920. The Triangles' {{performance}} of 5–2–2 {{would be the}} team's best before folding in 1929. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the 1920 All Pro team; no players made the first team, Sacksteder made the second team, and Bacon made the third team. As of 2012, no players from the 1920 Dayton Triangles were enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Clark Shaughnessy {{returned}} from Pittsburgh to Maryland {{for one more}} season.

50|$|The {{next game}} for the Commodores was a <b>loss</b> <b>to</b> Western Michigan at home, 27-23. Vanderbilt put {{themselves}} out of bowl contention with a 31-6 <b>loss</b> <b>to</b> Georgia. The week following, Vanderbilt got their first win, a 17-14 win over South Carolina. The next game also ended with a Vandy victory, a 36-33 overtime win over Duke. Victory was short lived, however, as the Dores lost their final three games. A 45-13 <b>loss</b> <b>to</b> Florida started the gloomy November, followed by a <b>loss</b> 55-17 <b>to</b> Kentucky, and a 41-0 <b>loss</b> <b>to</b> instate rival Tennessee.|$|R
