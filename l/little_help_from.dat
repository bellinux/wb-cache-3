5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Martin {{published}} a memoir, All You Need is Ears (co-written with Jeremy Hornsby), that described {{his work with}} the Beatles and other artists (including Peter Sellers, Sophia Loren, Shirley Bassey, Flanders and Swann, Matt Monro, and Dudley Moore), and gave an informal introduction to the art and science of sound recording. In 1993 he published Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt Pepper (published in the U.S. as With a <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> <b>from</b> My Friends: The Making of Sgt Pepper, co-authored with William Pearson), which also included interview quotations from a 1992 South Bank Show episode discussing the album. Martin also edited a 1983 book called Making Music: The Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording.|$|E
5|$|The party truce {{ended in}} 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's {{handling}} of the territorial dispute between the German Confederation and Denmark known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. Disraeli had <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office. Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the July 1865 general election. In {{the wake of the}} poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E
5|$|The Regent let his ministers {{take full}} charge of {{government}} affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The {{principle that the}} prime minister was the person supported by {{a majority in the}} House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.|$|E
25|$|The confederal union {{received}} <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Florida; the 15,000 men {{it offered}} were generally sent elsewhere. The largest engagements {{in the state}} were the Battle of Olustee, on February 20, 1864, and the Battle of Natural Bridge, on March 6, 1865. Both were Confederate victories. The war ended in 1865.|$|E

25|$|The Addams Family {{television}} series began after David Levy, a television producer, approached Addams {{with an offer}} to create it with a <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the humorist. All Addams {{had to do was}} give his characters names and more characteristics for the actors to use in portrayals. The series ran on ABC for two seasons, from 1964 to 1966.|$|E

His control was admirable, and when Benaud gets a batsman in trouble he rarely if ever gives him a loose one. He keeps him pinned down, probing and probing until the victim is well and truly enmeshed.|$|E
50|$|The Dutch-Portuguese War {{was fought}} almost entirely overseas, with the Dutch mercantile surrogates, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, {{repeatedly}} attacking Portugal's colonial possessions in the Americas, in Africa, in India, {{and in the}} Far East. Portugal was in a defensive posture throughout, and it received very <b>little</b> military <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Spain.|$|R
50|$|Long Bob did {{his best}} to ensure his own success in 1907. Pitching over 330 innings, he {{compiled}} a career-best ERA of 1.73 and averaged almost twice as many strikeouts as bases on balls. Although he won 17 games, <b>little</b> offensive <b>help</b> <b>from</b> his teammates resulted in 19 losses. Ewing accomplished all this at the age of 34 that year.|$|R
40|$|Economists {{have sought}} <b>little</b> {{systematic}} <b>help</b> <b>from</b> economic anthropology. Some {{of the reasons}} for this neglect can be gleaned from a study of the history of economic anthropology and in monitoring the reaction of economists to these efforts. The substantivist-formalist methodological debate and the fieldwork of some modern development economists are examined. There are some indications that the interaction between economists and anthropologists might be moving in a more productive direction. ...|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> {{the rest}} of the batting line-up, Ben Smith with 58 and Steven Davies and 43 gave Worcestershire Royals a total of 200, after Nottinghamshire Outlaws' Ryan Sidebottom had bowled four maiden overs and limited the scoring. Worcestershire made it to 200 for 9, however, but with Stephen Fleming making 73 in his first match for Nottinghamshire {{following}} the tour of Zimbabwe with the New Zealand team, Nottinghamshire made it to the target with five wickets in hand, despite Kabir Ali and Ray Price taking two wickets each.|$|E
25|$|The plays {{swept the}} {{audience}} along {{a unique and}} enjoyable journey, an Odyssey of insights which recounted {{the story of one}} member of an invisible minority who struggled with her sexuality and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, with more than a <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> her friends. Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} {{takes its}} only break at 11pm local time {{to allow for}} the CTV affiliates to broadcast the CTV National News.

50|$|After {{having to}} fight the British invasions by {{themselves}} with <b>little</b> direct <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Spain, the seeds of independence were starting to grow. Local militia battalions being commanded mostly by revolutionaries (like Cornelio Saavedra, Manuel Belgrano, Esteban Romero, Juan Martín de Pueyrredón, Juan José Viamonte and Martín Rodriguez) {{also contributed to the}} growth of revolutionary zeal. In 1810, not three years after the second invasion, the May Revolution took place, as a prelude to the Declaration of Independence of Argentina of 1816.|$|R
25|$|The War of 1812 {{marked the}} final {{confrontation}} between major Indian forces {{trying to stop}} the advance, with British aid. The British war goal included the creation of an independent Indian state (under British auspices) in the Midwest. American frontier militiamen under General Andrew Jackson defeated the Creeks and opened the Southwest, while militia under Governor William Henry Harrison defeated the Indian-British alliance at the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813. The death in battle of the Indian leader Tecumseh dissolved the coalition of hostile Indian tribes. Meanwhile, General Andrew Jackson ended the Indian military threat in the Southeast at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 in Alabama. In general the frontiersmen battled the Indians with <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the U.S. Army or the federal government.|$|E
25|$|While {{a victory}} for Hungary overall (albeit with heavy {{civilian}} casualties), the war was a political disaster for the king. Like his grandfather before him, many nobles accused him of inviting the Mongols into his lands, due to his perceived ties to the Cumans. Possibly more disastrously, the invasion was fended off by local barons and other magnates with <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the king. After proving their military skills, the efficiency of their fortifications and armed forces, {{and their ability to}} ensure the safety of their subjects to a greater degree than the king or his dignitaries, various local elites expanded their net of supporters and deemed themselves entitled to rule large regions of the kingdom. The crisis brought to light the king's lack of significant military resources and inability to compensate for such via political skills.|$|E
25|$|Falkinburg {{continued}} wrestling {{and brought}} other wrestlers into his stable, The Diamond Mine, such as Scotty Flamingo (Raven) and Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash). The relationships between DDP, Flamingo, and Vegas {{were used in}} many angles over the following months. Falkinburg went {{in the corner of}} Scotty Flamingo, at Clash of the Champions XXI on November 18, 1992, when Flamingo fought Johnny B. Badd in a worked boxing match. Flamingo won this bout with a <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Falkinburg who filled Flamingo's glove with water. The following year, after Studd and Flamingo left the stable, Falkinburg teamed with Vinnie Vegas as the Vegas Connection. However, the team was disbanded shortly after its debut when Falkinburg suffered a torn rotator cuff in a match against Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce toward the end of 1992 and was later fired, while Nash left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E
50|$|Aristagoras, {{seeing the}} {{rebellion}} falling to pieces around him, and <b>little</b> <b>help</b> forthcoming <b>from</b> the Greeks, {{began looking for}} a shelter to which he could execute a strategic retreat. He and his men resolved on Myrcinus in Thrace, which had been an Ionian stronghold in the abortive Persian invasion of Scythia. He put Pythagoras, “a man of distinction,” in charge of Miletus and set sail for Thrace, where he attempted to establish a colony on the Strymon river, at the same site as the later Athenian colony of Amphipolis.|$|R

25|$|In April 1920, {{while the}} Azerbaijani army {{was locked in}} Karabakh {{fighting}} local Armenian forces, Azerbaijan {{was taken over by}} Bolsheviks. On 10 August 1920, Armenia signed a preliminary agreement with the Bolsheviks, agreeing to a temporary Bolshevik occupation of these areas until final settlement would be reached. In 1921, Armenia and Georgia were also taken over by the Bolsheviks who, in order to attract public support, promised they would allot Karabakh to Armenia, along with Nakhchivan and Zangezur (the strip of land separating Nakhchivan from Karabakh). However, the Soviet Union also had far-reaching plans concerning Turkey, hoping that it would, with a <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> them, develop along Communist lines. Needing to placate Turkey, the Soviet Union agreed to a division under which Zangezur would fall under the control of Armenia, while Karabakh and Nakhchivan would be under the control of Azerbaijan. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would likely have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established within the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 July 1923.|$|E
25|$|At NYU Schoonmaker {{also met}} filmmaker Michael Wadleigh and later edited his {{influential}} music festival documentary, Woodstock on which Scorsese also worked. Her first major film editing work on Woodstock gained Schoonmaker an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing. Her use of superimpositions and freeze frames brought the {{performances in the}} film to life, and added to the movie's wide appeal, thus helping to raise the artistry and visibility of documentary filmmaking to a new level. Among the most haunting of Woodstock’s brilliantly edited sequences are the relatively sedate, nearly painterly, composition of Joan Baez’s mesmerising rendition of “Joe Hill” and her a cappella “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”, sung before a raptly silent audience of half-a-million and Joe Cocker’s “With a <b>Little</b> <b>Help</b> <b>from</b> My Friends”, featuring the singer’s falsetto response to his own vocal on {{the other half of}} the split screen….Only infrequently does editing inspiration flag, notably on Jimi Hendrix’s very long guitar solo that concludes the “Director’s Cut”….the Hendrix number evidences the flaccidity of material unmediated by the editing magic of Scorsese and Schoonmaker.|$|E
25|$|His finest {{moment as}} a bowler arguably {{came at the}} 1983 World Cup in England, where he used the helpful {{conditions}} to register his two only ODI five-wicket-hauls. First, at Headingley against Pakistan, he took five for 39, but got <b>little</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> his team-mates and couldn't quite carry the team to the target, being last out as Sri Lanka needed 12 more to win off 10 balls. Two days later, however, they moved to The County Ground, Derby, and de Mel once again took five wickets - this time for only 32 runs, as New Zealand crumbled to 181 and Sri Lanka won by three wickets, their only win in the tournament. De Mel returned Sri Lanka's best bowling figures in every match. He was the tournament's second highest wicket taker with 17 wickets, one behind India's Roger Binny. Many years later, {{it was discovered that}} one of the wickets credited to Rumesh Ratnayake in Sri Lanka's first round match against England was actually taken by De Mel, but the scorecards still don't reflect that.|$|E
