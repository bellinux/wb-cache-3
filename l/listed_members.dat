During the party's campaign launch on 9 July, the Green Party proposed charging bottling companies a ten percent tax for exporting water with the resulting revenue being split between local councils and Māori tribes or iwi. In addition, the Greens announced that they would ban new resource consents for bottling companies until the establishment of a new comprehensive commercial water pricing scheme.|$|E
500|$|As well as fiction, {{there were}} some non-fiction departments, {{including}} readers' letters (even in the first issue—Gernsback obtained letters by advertising the magazine to readers who subscribed to his other magazines), book reviews, and miscellaneous crime or science-related fillers. [...] The first issue included {{a test of the}} readers' powers of observation: it showed a crime scene, which the readers were supposed to study, and then posed questions to see how much they could remember of the details. [...] There was also a questionnaire about science, which asked about scientific facts mentioned in the stories, and a [...] "Science-Crime Notes" [...] section containing news items about science and crime. [...] Gernsback's editorial argued that science would eventually end crime, and suggested that both the police and criminals would make growing use of scientific innovations in the future. [...] Gernsback included on the masthead the names of several experts on crime, such as Edwin Cooley, a professor of criminology at Fordham University; he also <b>listed</b> <b>members</b> of his staff on the masthead with made-up titles: C.P. Mason, a member of his editorial staff, was listed as [...] "Scientific Criminologist", for example.|$|E

40|$|The Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales electoral systems created both {{constituency}} and <b>list</b> <b>members.</b> The article discusses hypotheses {{for exploring}} their behaviour and notes the particular context of regional party systems dominated {{to a greater}} or lesser extent by the Labour party. The authors find that constituency members of the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly broadly conduct more constituency work than <b>list</b> <b>members,</b> although the extent of <b>list</b> <b>member</b> is still significant for a variety of reasons. The qualitative nature of <b>list</b> <b>member</b> constituency work is not systematically different from that of constituency members. Nevertheless, there are variations in <b>list</b> <b>member</b> approaches. Constituency and <b>list</b> <b>member</b> perceptions of <b>list</b> <b>member</b> work also differ and this has become a serious source of controversy. Relationships between constituency and <b>list</b> <b>members,</b> and between devolved representatives and MPs, are competitive or co-operative, predominantly in relation to partisan interest. In both Scotland and Wales predominantly Labour constituency members have critical views of the roles of <b>list</b> <b>members</b> and have contested the rules governing constituency work. This has been alleviated to some extent by commitments to political pluralism, though more in Scotland than in Wales...|$|R
40|$|The mixed member {{electoral system}} {{used for the}} Scottish Parliament has {{produced}} two kinds of parliamentarians - those elected to represent constituencies (constituency members) and those elected to represent regions (<b>list</b> <b>members).</b> This system has created the possibility that <b>list</b> <b>members</b> might shadow constituency members {{with the intention of}} contesting the constituency seat in the next election. One manifestation of this is where <b>list</b> <b>members</b> locate their offices. Existing research on the shadowing of constituency <b>members</b> by <b>list</b> <b>members</b> has focused on the opinions of samples of members. In this paper we measure the behaviour of all members to examine the question of whether, how, and why <b>list</b> <b>members</b> shadow constituency members through the location of their offices. Among a number of findings, we provide evidence that <b>list</b> <b>members</b> of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) are significantly more likely to locate offices in most marginal constituencies, suggesting that electoral poaching is a feature of the system...|$|R

2500|$|In the meantime, Veblen {{had made}} {{contacts}} {{with several other}} academics, such as Charles A. Beard, James Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey. The group of university professors and intellectuals eventually founded the New School for Social Research (known today as The New School) in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where students could “seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth, and present working". From 1919 to 1926, Veblen continued to write and maintain a role in The New School’s development. It was during this time that he wrote The Engineers and the Price System. In it, Veblen proposed a soviet of engineers. According to Yngve Ramstad, the view that engineers, not workers, would overthrow capitalism was a [...] "novel view". Veblen invited Guido Marx to the New School to teach and to help organize a movement of engineers, by such as Morris Cooke; Henry Laurence Gantt, who had died shortly before; and Howard Scott. Cooke and Gantt were followers of Taylor's Scientific Management. Scott, who listed Veblen as on the temporary organizing committee of the Technical Alliance, perhaps without consulting Veblen or other <b>listed</b> <b>members,</b> later helped found the Technocracy movement. Veblen had a penchant for socialism and believed that technological developments would eventually lead toward a socialistic organization of economic affairs. However, his views on socialism {{and the nature of}} the evolutionary process of economics differed sharply from that of Karl Marx; while Marx saw socialism as the final political precursor to communism, the ultimate goal for civilization, and saw the working class as the group that would establish it, Veblen saw socialism as one intermediate phase in an ongoing evolutionary process in society that would be brought about by the natural decay of the business enterprise system and by the inventiveness of engineers. Daniel Bell sees an affinity between Veblen and the Technocracy movement. Janet Knoedler and Anne Mayhew demonstrate the significance of Veblen's association with these engineers, while arguing that his book was more a continuation of his previous ideas than the advocacy others see in it.|$|E
