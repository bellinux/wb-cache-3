50|$|Some {{aftermarket}} wheels {{will only}} fit smaller lug nuts, or not allow an ordinary lug nut to be properly torqued down because a socket will {{not fit into}} the <b>lug</b> <b>hole.</b> Tuner lug nuts were created {{to solve this problem}} by utilizing a special key to allow removal and installation with standard lug wrench or socket. The design of tuner lug nuts can range from bit style to multisided or spline drive, and are sometimes lightweight for performance purposes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} is the [...] "locking wheel nut", {{which is almost}} universally used for alloy wheels in the United Kingdom. One standard lug nut on each wheel is replaced with a nut which requires a special and unique key (typically a computer-designed, rounded star shape) to fit and remove the nut. This helps to discourage theft of wheels. However, universal removal tools are available which grip {{the head of the}} locking nut using a hardened left-hand thread. The success of these depends on whether there is room to use it in the <b>lug</b> <b>hole,</b> and whether the manufacturer has incorporated a free-spinning outer casing to the lock. Keeping an appropriate tool to lock and unlock aftermarket nuts, and a spare set of nuts, with the spare tire in the boot of the car is recommended by manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, {{the right}} landing gear of an Air Lanka Boeing 737-200 (registration 4R-ULL) at Madras airport (now Chennai International Airport) failed upon landing {{and the right}} engine {{came into contact with}} the runway. The {{aircraft}} pulled to the right and finally came to a stop, with the nose wheel and right wing on the grass {{to the right of the}} landing runway. The right engine caught fire - extinguished by the airport safety services - and the 104 passengers and 12 crew evacuated the aircraft via the chutes on the left side without injury. The damage to the aircraft was substantial; the plane was subsequently repaired and sold on. The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation concluded that [...] "the accident occurred as a result of failure of the right hand main landing gear beam during the landing due to pre-existing stress corrosion cracks and pits at its inboard <b>lug</b> <b>hole</b> and higher than normal landing loads contributed to its failure".|$|E
50|$|Radially {{assembled}} {{retaining rings}} are installed externally into machined grooves on a shaft. These rings have no <b>lug</b> <b>holes</b> {{and must be}} installed using applicators.|$|R
50|$|Self-locking {{retaining}} rings {{can be installed}} in a housing/bore or on a shaft that {{has not had a}} groove machined into it. Self-locking rings with no <b>lug</b> <b>holes</b> are impossible to remove without either destroying the ring or warping it out of specified tolerances.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>lug</b> <b>holes</b> {{should have}} been drilled and the tiebars secured by pins filling the holes (rather than bolts) (Cochrane had not been {{surprised}} that boltholes had been cast conical; moulders were notorious for this, unless you stood over them. Even so, he would not rely on supervision or inspection, {{he would have the}} holes bored or reamed to ensure they were cylindrical - it had an important bearing on the stability of the structure. Pole - called by Bouch's counsel - agreed. Bouch said if he had known the holes were cast conical he would have had them bored or reamed. Gilkes said casting <b>lug</b> <b>holes</b> conical would have been done [...] "as a matter of course, and unless attention had been drawn to it, it would not be thought then so important as we think it now".|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the lifting yoke and blast shield assembly considers the bending stress, weld strength, and resistance of the <b>lug</b> <b>hole</b> to tear out. The bending stress of the lifting lugs is evaluated {{to ensure that they}} meet the requirements of the American Institute for Steel Construction (AISC 1989). Also considered in the calculations is the capability of the thick lugs to withstand the weight of the pump together with that of the container and strongback during rotation to the horizontal position...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on single-pinned and double-pinned lugs made from alloy steel FV 520 B and loaded by means of 2 in diameter pins. The effects of pin fit for both clearance and interference and of various treatments were investigated. The treatments included side relieving the <b>lug</b> <b>hole,</b> bushing the bore, applying the Sulhuz process to the lug or overstraining the lug bore. Two conditions of mean stress were investigated, namely, pulsating or repeated tension and 15 tons/ina mean tension. Basing comparison on the fatigue strength at 30 x lo 8 cycles, the untreated lugs with close fit pins showed the lowest strength of all. Both clearance and interference fits were beneficial and by appropriate choice, the fatigue strength could be at least doubled {{and in some cases}} trebled. Lugs which had side relief, had been bushed, Sulfinuz treated or which had oversuained bores also gave worthwhile increases in fatigue strength and the strength ratios were generally in excess of 2. An increase in mean stress significantly reduced fatigue strength for all lugs tested, except for those with close fit or clearance fit pins. Comparing the present results with those obtained on lugs one-quarter the size, a considerable sue effect is evident for some conditions, large lugs being weaker than small lugs...|$|E
50|$|Inverted {{retaining}} rings are {{a variation of}} axially assembled rings in which the <b>lug</b> <b>holes</b> are inverted to fit {{in the bottom of}} the groove. Inverting the lugs allows greater clearance on a shaft or in a housing and forms a higher uniform shoulder good for retaining bearings and other components with large corner radii or chamfers.|$|R
50|$|The {{expander}} system {{consists of}} patented {{products that are}} intended {{to take the place}} of conventional pivot pins in heavy machinery and equipment. Conventional pivot pins may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot <b>lug</b> <b>holes,</b> called line boring. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.|$|R

50|$|Axially {{assembled}} {{retaining rings}} are installed into machined grooves in housings/bores (internal) or on shafts (external). These rings are manufactured with <b>lug</b> holes—small <b>holes</b> in the <b>lugs</b> of both axial {{internal and external}} retaining rings—that are used to install/remove them, using pliers designed for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|When {{marketing}} of Vistalites started in late 1972, the drums {{were available in}} clear, blue, green, red, amber, and yellow, with clear and blue being the largest sellers. In 1976 the company broadened the line to include [...] "Rainbow" [...] Vistalites with multicolored shells, with [...] "Tequila Sunrise" [...] (a combination of red, orange and yellow stripes) {{being one of the}} most popular combinations. Multi-colored acrylic shells were co-invented by Elvis Presley's drummer Ronn Tutt. Tutt, however, tried his invention and was unimpressed, enough that he immediately went back to playing maple drums. Other Vistalite variations included bass drums without tom mounts (often referred to as [...] "virgin" [...] bass drums) and concert toms (toms without <b>lug</b> <b>holes</b> or a rim on the bottom of the shell). Since Ludwig technically offered any drum it manufactured (other than tympani) in Vistalite, rare examples such as congas and bongos have become valuable collectibles.|$|R
5000|$|A lug {{may also}} only be shaped as a lip for {{suspension}} - (no hole). In Ancient Egypt, <b>lugs</b> contained a <b>hole</b> for suspension, with 2 - [...] or 3 - lugged vessels most common.|$|R
50|$|Most {{types of}} alabastron have a narrow {{body with a}} rounded end, a narrow neck and a broad, splayed mouth. They were often left without handles, but some types were {{equipped}} with ear-shaped projections or <b>lugs</b> into which <b>holes</b> were punched. Strings were then put through these holes for easy mobility.|$|R
50|$|They {{constructed}} enormous stone temple complexes decorated {{inside and}} out with painted sculptures. While the stone sculptures and the inner sanctum image empowering the temple remained immovable, changing religious concepts during the 10th century demanded that the deities {{take part in a}} variety of public roles similar to those of a human monarch. As a result, large bronze images were created to be carried outside the temple to participate in daily rituals, processions, and temple festivals. The round <b>lugs</b> and <b>holes</b> found on the bases of many of these sculptures are for the poles that were used to carry the heavy images. They were admired for the sensuous depiction of the figure and the detailed treatment of their clothing and jewelry in Chola-period bronzes.|$|R

50|$|Mounting the {{indicator}} may be done several ways. Many indicators have a mounting <b>lug</b> with a <b>hole</b> for a bolt {{as part of}} the back plate. Alternately, the device can be held by the cylindrical stem that guides the plunger using a collet or special clamp, which is the method generally used by tools designed to integrate an indicator as a primary component, such as thickness gauges and comparators. Common outside diameters for the stem are 3/8 inch and 8 mm, though there are other diameters made. Another option that a few manufacturers include is dovetail mounts compatible with those on dial test indicators.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical {{study of the}} stress distribution in pin-loaded lugs. The effects of: (i) the ratio of lug width (w) to hole diameter (d), (ii) {{the ratio of the}} distance of the hole centre from the free end of the <b>lug</b> (h) to <b>hole</b> diameter (4, and (iii) the pin interference/clearance, on the magnitude and position of the maximum circumferential stress around the <b>hole</b> in the <b>lug</b> are established and discussed. Pin fit is shown to be a particularly important detail and the beneficial effects of an interference fit are shown to be considerable. It is also shown that for ratios w/d greater than 4 and h/d greater than 3 there is little variation in the maximum circumferential stress for a given applied load. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} material and geometric variables on the response of U-shaped band-reinforced metallic lugs was performed. Variables studied were reinforcement, adhesive and metallic <b>lug</b> mechanical properties, <b>hole</b> diameter, reinforcement and adhesive thickness, and the distance from the hole s center {{to the end of the}} lug. Generally, U-shaped band reinforced lugs exhibited superior performance than non-reinforced lugs, that is higher load at the conventional lug design criteria of four percent hole elongation. Depending upon the reinforcement configuration the increase in load may be negligible to 15 or 20 percent. U-shaped band reinforcement increases lug load carrying capability primarily through two mechanisms; increasing the slope of the response curve after the initial knee and restraining overall deformation of the metallic portion of the lug facilitating increased yielding of metallic material between the hole and the edge of the metallic portion of the lug...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} a second {{respiration}} {{of the atmosphere}} {{gave birth to the}} breeze. Raoul whistled for the wind, and the lugger moved ahead, gliding toward the frigate. But in half a minute she had gathered sufficient way, her helm was put down, and she came round as easily and as gracefully as the bird turns on his wing. Not so with the heavier frigate. She had hauled in her starboard head-braces and had to get the foretopsail aback, and to pay well off with her head to leeward, in order to swing her yards and fill her sails, while le Feu-Follet was slipping through the water, going seemingly into the wind's eye. By this single evolution the lugger gained more than a cable's length on her enemy, and five minutes more would have put her beyond all immediate danger. But Captain Cuffe knew this as well as his competitor, and had made his preparations accordingly. Keeping his head-yards aback, he knocked his ship round off, until her broadside bore on the lugger, when he let fly every gun of his starboard batteries, the utmost care having been taken to make the shot tell. Twenty-two heavy round-shot coming in at once upon a little craft like le Feu-Follet was a fearful visitation, and the [...] "boldest held their breath for a time" [...] as the iron whirlwind whistled past them. Fortunately the lugger was not hulled; but a grave amount of mischief was done aloft. The jigger-mast was cut in two and flew upward like a pipe-stem. A serious wound was given to the mainmast below the hounds, and the yard itself was shivered in the slings. No less than six shot plunged through both <b>lugs,</b> leaving <b>holes</b> in the canvas that made it resemble a beggar's shirt, and the jib-stay was cut in two half-way between the mast-head {{and the end of the}} bowsprit. No one was hurt, and yet for a moment every one looked as if destruction had suddenly lighted on the lugger. Then it was that Raoul came out in his true colors. He knew he could not spare a stitch of canvas just at that moment, but that on the next ten minutes depended everything. Nothing was taken in, therefore, to secure spars and sails, but all was left to stand, trusting to the lightness of the breeze, which usually commenced very moderately. Hands were immediately set to work to get up a new stay; a new main-yard and sail were got along, and everything was prepared for hoisting both as soon as it could be ascertained that the mast would bear them. Nearly similar preparations were made forward as the shortest way of getting rid of the torn foresail; for that it was the intention to unbend and bend, the yard being sound.|$|R
