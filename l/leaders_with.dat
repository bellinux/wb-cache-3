40|$|Preliminary version We {{study the}} e¤ects and di¤erences {{of having a}} <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> "reward " power or a <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> "exclusion " power in a public good game; whether the fact of being a leader voluntarily or exogenously {{determined}} a¤ects the average contribution of the group; and whether having a leader that can observe what the others have contributed before deciding his own contribution, a¤ects {{the contribution of the}} group, compared with our baseline –all the members of the group contribute simultaneously. First of all, we …nd that having a <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> reward possibilities or a <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> exclusion power increases contribution, compared with the control treatment, and that the presence of a <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> exclusion power leads to higher contributions than the presence of a <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> reward possibilities. Secondly, we …nd that the average contribution in the treatment where any subject can voluntarily decide to be the leader of the group is higher than the contribution when the leader is set exogenously or when there is no leader. Finally, we …nd evidence of no di¤erence in average contributions if the groups have a leader that contributes the last, in comparison with the situation <b>with</b> no <b>leader...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ambohimanga {{has been}} viewed by many Merina since the late 19th century as the {{embodiment}} of an ideal social order blessed by the ancestors. The significance attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to a sense that Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles (andriana) believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction (hasina) to serve as the national capital and imbue national <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country. The descendents of the andriana have consequently been key in promoting and protecting Ambohimanga, such as by playing a significant role in successfully lobbying UNESCO to list Ambohimanga as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that {{the fallout from the}} Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed the playoffs {{for the first time in}} four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> 449 points.|$|E

5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

5|$|Wax was {{particularly}} involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 {{by a group of}} Memphis city <b>leaders,</b> <b>with</b> a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E
5|$|During {{the longest}} season in Iraqi football, the 1992–93 season, when every club played 69 matches, Al-Talaba had Yahya Alwan as their {{manager in the}} first stage of the league, in which they won 14 matches, drawn seven and lost two, 1–0 against Kirkuk and the same score against Samarra. They {{completed}} the stage in third place with 35 points. Before the start of the second stage, Al-Talaba signed Ayoub Odisho as their new manager, and he led them through the second stage to have exactly the same statistics as the first one, finishing with 70 points and in second place. In the third stage, the team won 18 matches, drew four and lost only once against Al-Khutoot. After 69 matches, Al-Talaba finished top of the league with 110 points, having scored 130 goals and conceded 34. In the 1992 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup which was organised by the Iraq FA, Al-Talaba finished the group stage as the Group Two <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> four points. In the semi-finals, they had to face Al-Zawra'a in a match which was considered a replay of the 1991 semi-final which Al-Zawra'a won 1–0. In this match, Al-Talaba won 3–2 with a golden goal in the 100th minute during extra time. In the final against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, the match ended in a 0–0 draw which led to extra time when Alaa Kadhim scored the winning goal in the 104th minute. In the 1992–93 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final after defeating Haifa, Salahaddin, Salam and Samarra. In the final, they lost to Al-Zawra'a 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} the subject of {{religious}} beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near the Niger Delta, buried their <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.|$|E

5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County <b>leaders,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E
