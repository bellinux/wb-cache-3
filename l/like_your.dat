500|$|In {{addition}} to the tired former prisoners and civilians, {{the majority of the}} Rangers had only slept for five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. Benzedrine was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march. One Ranger commented on the effect of the drug: [...] "It felt <b>like</b> <b>your</b> eyes were popped open. You couldn't have closed them if you wanted to. One pill was all I ever took—it was all I ever needed." ...|$|E

500|$|Orbison {{was a rare}} performer; {{when many}} rock and roll concerts were {{accompanied}} with frenetic performances onstage, Orbison rarely moved. His voice was what got the attention of listeners. k.d. lang, who sang [...] "Crying" [...] {{with him in a}} duet, later wrote, [...] "It wasn't like Elvis: It wasn't <b>like</b> <b>your</b> loins were on fire or anything like that. It's more like Roy was a private place to go — a solace or a refuge." [...] Monument Records founder Fred Foster said of him, [...] "He used such intricate, beautiful melodies. He brought a kind of baroque, classical style to pop music." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Yorke, {{the first}} verse — [...] "I'll drown my beliefs / To have your babies / I'll dress <b>like</b> <b>your</b> niece / And wash your swollen feet" [...] — {{addresses}} the [...] "difference between young and old", when people {{grow out of}} childish behaviour; the narrator is offering not {{to grow up to}} keep someone they love. The lines [...] "And true love lives / On lollipops and crisps" [...] were inspired by a story Yorke read about a child who was left alone by his parents for days and survived by eating junk food. The song features a [...] "pleading" [...] refrain: [...] "Don't leave, don't leave." ...|$|E

[...] Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it, he answered, [...] "Uh, yeah. Okay."

500|$|The mixing {{started at}} Chalice Recording Studios, but moved to Grohl's house as {{engineer}} Alan Moulder {{said it was}} the way [...] "to make it sound <b>like</b> <b>your</b> garage." [...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it sounds good on a lousy stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E
500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel <b>like</b> <b>your</b> brain is scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] was {{included}} on Aerosmith's second album Get Your Wings. [...] A 3:15 edited {{version of the}} song without the added audience noises was released as a single, {{but it did not}} appear on the record charts. [...] The song continues to be a highlight of the group's shows and the album version has become a staple of album-oriented rock and classic rock radio. [...] It has become so identified with Aerosmith, that when Jeff Beck (whose 1965 and 1966 recordings with the Yardbirds inspired Tyler and Perry) occasionally performs it, he often hears comments like [...] "Hey, I <b>like</b> <b>your</b> angle on the Aerosmith tune".|$|E

500|$|When {{the news}} of Rowe's {{pregnancy}} broke to Jackson's mother Katherine, the Jackson family matriarch urged her son to wed {{the mother of his}} unborn child. Katherine did not want her son to be like his father, who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to Michael's mother. Katherine first spoke on the telephone to Rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the Jehovah's Witness faith. She later spoke to Jackson, telling him to marry [...] "that nice girl, Debbie" [...] and [...] "give your child a name, not <b>like</b> <b>your</b> poor, half-sister, Joh'Vonnie". The words resonated with the musician, {{who did not want to}} repeat his father's sins.|$|E

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{when the}} voice actors for The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{requesting}} additional income, The Scotsman cited a quote by Homer from the episode: [...] "If you don't <b>like</b> <b>your</b> job, you don't strike.

The voice actors were asking for an increase from US$125,000 to $360,000 per episode. The same quote by Homer to Lisa was cited by Michael Schneider in Daily Variety, who wrote: [...] "...insiders note that the actors work just six to seven hours to voice an episode—which would mean $ 360,000 for a day's work, a figure that even Everybody Loves Raymond star Ray Romano doesn't match." ...|$|E
