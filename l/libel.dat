Bukovsky's attempt to sue the CPS for <b>libel</b> failed in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} and subsequently filed a civil <b>libel</b> {{suit against the}} Liberal Party. Because <b>libel</b> laws {{do not apply to}} statements made in the House of Commons, the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members outside the House and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} about <b>libeling</b> {{asked by the}} Freedom of the Press Index concerns existing penalties for <b>libeling</b> officials or the state.

Furthermore the MSI question contains the aspect of the civil law against <b>libeling.</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} at the Bar, Hastings was {{involved}} in a variety of <b>libel</b> cases and in a divorce case which significantly changed the law relating to the admission of evidence from spouses regarding the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child. His first significant <b>libel</b> case was Siever v Wootton. Robert Sievier was a well-known horse racing journalist and owner with a reputation for brushes with the law and underhanded dealings, having previously been tried for blackmail and acquitted on a technicality. In 1913 he accused Richard Wootton, a noted trainer of racehorses, of ordering his jockeys to withdraw from races if he had bet on another horse so as to allow him to make large amounts of money. Wootton sued him for <b>libel</b> and won, but was granted only a symbolic farthing in damages because the jury thought that Sievier had not intended to cause harm. As a result of this pyrrhic victory, Wootton held a grudge against Sievier for many years.|$|E

Six years later, Simorangkir filed another lawsuit against Love for further defamatory Twitter posts, and Love paid a further $350,000 in recompense. A similar suit was brought against Love by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes in 2014, who also accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages. It {{was the first}} case of alleged Twitter-based <b>libel</b> in U.S. history {{to make it to}} trial. The jury, however, found in Love's favor.|$|E
5000|$|Cushman's {{first problem}} with {{authorities}} came in 1603 {{while he was}} still apprenticed to George Masters. This involved the illegal distribution of <b>libels</b> (derogatory religious writings) in Canterbury by Cushman [...] "of the parish of St. Andrew of Canterbury." [...] The <b>libels</b> were handwritten notices stating [...] "Lorde have mercy uppon us" [...] which were posted on church doors throughout Canterbury. The authorities ordered that the [...] "lewd seditious persons" [...] posting the <b>libels</b> be found, interrogated and committed to prison if they refused examination. Robert Cushman was arrested by the authorities and not providing satisfactory answers upon questioning, for [...] "certain reasons" [...] was committed to Westgate prison for one night. Friends of Cushman's from his prior parish of St. George were also involved in posting <b>libels.</b>|$|R

5|$|The McCanns began a <b>libel</b> {{action against}} Amaral and his {{publisher}} in 2009. Madeleine's Fund covered the legal fees. In 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in <b>libel</b> damages; Amaral's appeal against that decision succeeded in 2016. A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or {{sales of the}} book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral's freedom of expression. The ban was reinstated in 2015 {{as part of the}} <b>libel</b> ruling, then lifted when Amaral's appeal succeeded in 2016. The McCanns' appealed the 2016 decision to Portugal's Supreme Court, but the court ruled against them in February 2017; in their 76-page ruling, the judges wrote that the McCanns had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008. In March 2017 the Supreme Court rejected the McCanns' final appeal.|$|E

5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of <b>libel</b> where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged <b>libel</b> relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the <b>libel.</b> If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
5|$|Darby {{eventually}} brought {{suit for}} <b>libel</b> against Kendall and Eliza Sharp, {{as well as}} Senator Beauchamp and Sharp's brother Leander. Numerous delays and changes of venue prevented any of the suits from ever going to trial. Darby died in December 1829.|$|E

5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's hard labor for publishing The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious <b>libel</b> and blasphemous <b>libel.</b> The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the <b>libel</b> and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been filed in New York City by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York.

5|$|In May 1762, the {{incumbent}} Whig {{government of the}} Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny {{that he was having}} an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English. John Wilkes, a Member of Parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious <b>libel</b> but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons, and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and <b>libel.</b> In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power.|$|E
5|$|R v Baillie, {{also known}} as the Greenwich Hospital Case, was a 1778 {{prosecution}} of Thomas Baillie for criminal <b>libel.</b> The case initiated the legal career of Thomas Erskine. Baillie, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Greenwich Hospital for Seamen, a facility for injured or pensioned off seamen, had noted irregularities and corruption in the hospital, which was formally run by the Earl of Sandwich. After his official reporting of the problems failed to bring about reform in the hospital, Baillie published a pamphlet that was critical of the hospital's officers, alleging that Sandwich had given appointments to pay off political debts; Sandwich ignored the pamphlet but ensured that Baillie was indicted for criminal <b>libel.</b> Baillie hired five barristers, including Erskine, then newly called to the Bar, and appeared before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench on 23 November 1778.|$|E

50|$|Small {{communities}} however, incorporated these prejudiced {{ideas into}} their beliefs, {{which led to}} some instances of Blood <b>Libels</b> which took many Jewish lives. Blood <b>Libels</b> consisted of accusations directed at small Jewish communities that promoted a false belief {{that there was a}} sacrificial aspect in Jewish prayer. These falsities proclaimed that a Jewish religious event included the sacrifice of a Christian child. In Blois, France, as many as 40 Jews were accused of killing a young Christian boy. They were found guilty and killed. Though Blood <b>Libels</b> and persecution did not define Jewish-Christian relations in the Middle-Ages in France, it had a large impact on the way the history of this time period is recited.|$|R
