5000|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet. For water, a wettable surface may also be termed hydrophilic and a nonwettable surface hydrophobic. Superhydrophobic surfaces have contact angles greater than 150°, showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Lotus effect".

5000|$|The {{processes}} of grafting [...] "onto", [...] "from", and [...] "through" [...] are all {{different ways to}} alter the chemical reactivity of the surface they attach with. Grafting onto allows a preformed polymer, generally in a [...] "mushroom regime", {{to adhere to the}} surface of either a droplet or bead in solution. Due to the larger volume of the coiled polymer and the steric hindrance this causes, the grafting density is lower for 'onto' in comparison to 'grafting from'. The surface of the bead is wetted by the polymer and the interaction in the solution caused the polymer to become more flexible. The 'extended conformation' of the polymer grafted, or polymerized, {{from the surface of the}} bead means that the monomer must be in the solution and there for <b>lyophilic.</b> This results with a polymer that has favorable interactions with the solution, allowing the polymer to form more linearly. Grafting from therefore has a higher grafting density since there are more access to chain ends.|$|E
50|$|In surface science, {{the term}} {{adhesion}} almost always refers to dispersive adhesion. In a typical solid-liquid-gas system (such as {{a drop of}} liquid on a solid surrounded by air) the contact angle is used to evaluate adhesiveness indirectly, while a Centrifugal Adhesion Balance allows for direct quantitative adhesion measurements. Generally, cases where the contact angle is low are considered of higher adhesion per unit area. This approach assumes that the lower contact angle corresponds to a higher surface energy. Theoretically, the more exact relation between contact angle and work of adhesion is more involved and is given by the Young-Dupre equation. The contact angle of the three-phase system is a function not only of dispersive adhesion (interaction between the molecules in the liquid and the molecules in the solid) but also cohesion (interaction between the liquid molecules themselves). Strong adhesion and weak cohesion results in {{a high degree of}} wetting, a <b>lyophilic</b> condition with low measured contact angles. Conversely, weak adhesion and strong cohesion results in lyophobic conditions with high measured contact angles and poor wetting.|$|E

40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} based mesogens {{have gained}} an {{importance in the}} field of liquid crystals, primarily through the amphiphilic nature of many sugar derivatives. A constitutional requirement for the amphiphilic mesogen is that the molecule consists of distinct regions within the molecule that separately would have different responses to changes in thermal energies and/or solvations. Such molecules can be synthesized by linking one or more alkyl chains of appropriate length to both cyclic and acyclic sugars. A driving force for the mesophase formation in these molecules is the phase segregation, leading to aggregates, possessing distinct <b>lyophilic</b> and hydrophilic regions. In this review, we discuss the thermotropic behavior of the carbohydrate amphiphiles. We discuss the relationship between constitutions, configurations, functionalities of the sugar component and the length of the hydrophobic chains necessary to form the various types of thermotropic phases.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} shape of a nanodroplet on a <b>lyophilic</b> elliptical patch in lyophobic surroundings on a flat substrate. To compute the droplet equilibrium shape, we minimize its interfacial free energy using both Surface Evolver and Monte Carlo calculations, finding good agreement between the two methods. We observe different droplet shapes, which are controlled by the droplet volume and the aspect ratio of the ellipse. In particular, we study the behavior of the nanodroplet contact angle along the three-phase contact line, explaining the different droplet shapes. Although the nanodroplet contact angle is constant and fixed by Young&# 039;s law inside and outside the elliptical patch, its value varies along the rim of the elliptical patch. We find that because of the pinning of the nanodroplet contact line at the rim of the elliptical patch, which has a nonconstant curvature, there is a regime of aspect ratios of the elliptical patch in which the nanodroplet starts expanding to the lyophobic part of the substrate, although there is still a finite area of the <b>lyophilic</b> patch free to be wetted...|$|E

We consider sessile drops on a <b>lyophilic</b> (attractive for the monomers) region of circular shape with radius R_D while the remaining part of the substrate is lyophobic. The variation of the droplet shape, including its contact angle, with R_D is studied, and the density profiles across these droplets also are obtained. In addition, the interaction of droplets adsorbed on two walls forming a slit pore with two <b>lyophilic</b> circular regions just opposite of one another is investigated, paying attention to the formation of a liquid bridge between both walls. A central result of our study is the measurement of the force between the two substrate walls at varying wall separation as well as the kinetics of droplet merging.

40|$|Polyhedral foams offer large gas-liquid {{interfacial}} area {{associated with a}} small amount of liquid. Therefore, if a solute adsorbs preferentially at the interface, the concentration of the solute in the foam will be greater than in the solution from which the foam has been generated. This effect provides a simple method of concentrating materials which have a tendency to adsorb on the gas-liquid interface. This is particularly relevant to biomaterials like whole cells, proteins, enzymes etc., which are surface active and are present in low concentrations in the broth. Foam separation has therefore attracted considerable attention, and several reports exist in literature on concentrating cells, proteins and enzymes using foams. Foam separation is based on the difference in surface activity of the components to be separated. A surface active molecule consists of a lyophobic and a <b>lyophilic</b> group. (As water is commonly used as a solvent, the <b>lyophilic</b> and lyophobic groups are called hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, respectively).

From high speed video image analysis, the average large bubble diameter, the frequency of occurrence of large bubbles, the gas-liquid interfacial area, and the large bubble hold-up are obtained. The liquid side mass transfer coefficient is calculated from the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the gas-liquid interfacial area. The <b>lyophilic</b> silica particles are rendered lyophobic by a methylation process to study {{the influence}} of particle wettability. The influence of organic electrolyte (sodium gluconate) and the combination of electrolyte and particles is also studied. It is found that <b>lyophilic</b> silica, lyophobic silica, and lyophobic carbon particles at concentrations larger than 2 g/l (0. 4 vol%) decrease the gas hold-up and shift the regime transition point (where the first large bubbles appear) to a lower gas velocity. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient increases with gas velocity, increases with electrolyte concentration, decreases with slurry concentration, and is higher for lyophobic particles.

The adsorption of 2, 4 -D at different pH values indicated that the undissociated form was preferentially adsorbed on C 10 M, whereas the anionic form was adsorbed by C 10 V. The adsorption of 2, 4 -D was much greater for C 10 V than for C 10 M. X-ray diffraction diffractograms and FT-IR spectra of C 10 M did not show any changes after exposure to 2, 4 -D, indicating adsorption on external surfaces by weak <b>lyophilic,</b> aromatic ring-alkylchain(tail), bond. The d 001 values of the two C 10 V samples expanded after 2, 4 -D exposure from 2. 1 to 2. 9 nm and from 2. 4 to 3. 3 nm, indicating interlayer adsorption of the herbicide.

Polypropylene (PP) fiber is a property enhancing additive, commonly used in cement-based composites. In this study, we tried to modify the surface properties of PP to enhance its bonding with calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). The surface was at least partly converted from <b>lyophilic</b> to hydrophilic by partial oxidation using potassium dichromate. The change in surface properties was examined by FT-IR, AFM, SEM and contact angle. The appearance of peaks at 1635, 1650 and 3200 cm- 1 in FTIR spectra for the treated PP, indicated the adsorption of water molecules on the surface, verifying the increase in hydrophilicity of PP. The AFM observation depicted that the roughness of partially oxidized PP surface was significantly increased. The contact angle was reduced due {{to the increase in}} hydrophilicity of the PP surface. However, the tensile strength of PP fiber had no significant reduction after being subjected to partial oxidation. Finally, AFM and SEM observations have shown that treated PP film bonded to C-S-H more tightly than that of original PP.

The present work involves measurements of the heat capacity of gelatin gels between 0 ° and 80 °C. and an attempt to elucidate the heat effects accompanying changes in the gelatin water relationship which occur within that range of temperatures. It was considered that similar measurements on a different type of system involving 'bound' water might aid in throwing light on the mechanism of water binding by gelatin. Consequently a calorimetric investigation has been made of the properties of the water Borbed by activated charcoal...|$|E
40|$|Recognition and binding of anions {{in water}} is {{difficult}} {{due to the}} ability of water molecules to form strong hydrogen bonds and to solvate the anions. The complexation of two different carboxylates with 1 -(4 -carbomethoxypyrrolidone) -terminated PAMAM dendrimers was studied in aqueous solution using NMR and ITC binding models. Sodium 2 -naphthoate and sodium 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoate were chosen as carboxylate model compounds, since they carry structural similarities to many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and they possess {{only a limited number of}} functional groups, making them ideal to study the carboxylate-dendrimer interaction selectively. The binding stoichiometry for 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoate was found to be two strongly bound guest molecules per dendrimer and an additional 40 molecules with weak binding affinity. The NOESY NMR showed a clear binding correlation of sodium 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoate with the <b>lyophilic</b> dendrimer core, possibly with the two high affinity guest molecules. In comparison, sodium 2 -naphthoate showed a weaker binding strength and had a stoichiometry of two guests per dendrimer with no additional weakly bound guests. This stronger dendrimer interaction with sodium 3 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoate is possibly a result of the additional interactions of the dendrimer with the extra hydroxyl group and an internal stabilization of the negative charge due to the hydroxyl group. These findings illustrate the potential of the G 4 1 -(4 -carbomethoxy) pyrrolidone dendrimer to complex carboxylate guests in water and act as a possible carrier of such molecules...|$|E
