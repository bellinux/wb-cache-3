5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture <b>like</b> <b>hers.</b> However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the recent}} Januaries, Ford's ghost-story home was {{referred}} to by another newspaper story; this time someone was seeking to live in one <b>like</b> <b>hers.</b> It turned out that Ford's family was no longer living there. Her household was noted as {{an eclectic mix of}} family and boarders - her three children, Roland, Lynette and Gareth; a Germon woman and her young child; of an American woman and her son; of a young African or African American student of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} Mortal Peril {{is situated}} where the numeral 12 would normally be. Throughout {{the first five}} books the hands change to reflect the varying statuses of the family members, but by the sixth book all nine hands point to mortal peril at all times, except when someone is travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with Voldemort's return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as {{she does not know}} anyone else who has a clock <b>like</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the post-print {{world of}} the not very distant future, Anana had been enjoying {{her job at the}} NADEL, a {{scholarly}} foundation-funded project, even though she was not much of a reader, herself. Like most people, she got all the news and narrative she wanted on her [...] "Meme," [...] an artificially intelligent as well as smart phone/digital assistant. She shrugged off her father's aversion to the device, because she <b>liked</b> <b>hers.</b> It had learned her preferences and mapped her life so intimately that it automatically took care of things for her, from ordering menu items or driverless car rides to downloading a definition from the Word Exchange for a word she had momentarily forgotten.|$|R
25|$|Grand Duchess Olga was {{witty and}} had a strong personality. Her sharp tongue brought her {{a lot of trouble}} at the Russian court. She despised the morganatic wife of Alexander II and later she was {{particularly}} indignant at Alexander III's decision {{to limit the number of}} Grand Dukes, a title her own grandchildren would be deprived of. While her husband busied himself with his military and governmental career, Grand Duchess Olga ruled her family with an iron hand. She demanded complete obedience from her children. She was particularly close to her eldest son Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia, whose intellectual interests were <b>like</b> <b>hers,</b> but she remained aloof and cold towards the others. Her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, who was not intellectually gifted (she called him a fool), was a constant source of disappointment for her. In 1879, Olga with Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna arranged the marriage between her only daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, with Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Maria Pavlovna's brother. Anastasia carried some bitterness about her upbringing and relationship with her mother - her daughter CÃ¤cilie recounts that at a party to celebrate her engagement, when she committed some infraction she was sent to bed by Olga like a naughty child. There was also an incident involving an apricot tree, which belonged to Anastasia but whose fruit she was not allowed to eat.|$|E

2500|$|The public's {{reaction}} {{towards the}} documentary has been positive. MTV asked various fans in New York and Los Angeles, California {{what they thought}} about the film, a fan quoted, [...] "It made me love her even more," [...] Shanna Birnbaum, 23, told MTV News. [...] "I think she was very honest. She really let her true self shine through. It showed people and young girls you can get through anything." [...] Stacey Medura, agreed, adding that [...] "For the Record" [...] humanized the pop star. [...] "It's easier to understand how she feels," [...] Medura said. [...] "Her opinion matters most. I think she covered a lot [...]" [...] Some said this look into Britney's life was inspiring. [...] "I really have gained {{a lot of respect}} for her now," [...] Derek wrote. [...] "I felt like this was the first time since she burst onto the scene a decade ago that she has spoken from the heart. ... I think this is what fans and others have wanted from her for a long time, to be honest. Her honesty can be helpful for others who may be going through situations <b>like</b> <b>hers,</b> such as dealing with a custody battle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stacey is spooked {{when a man}} {{she does}} not know begins to follow her. Unbeknownst to Stacey, the man, Kyle (Riley Carter Millington), also has a key <b>like</b> <b>hers.</b> When Stacey finds out Martin is {{planning}} to propose, she says she does not want to marry again. He later proposes that she become his [...] "not-wife", so they are committed but not married, and she agrees. When Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) fails to corrently fix a faulty electric socket, Stacey is electrocuted. She and her baby are fine, and she finds out she is having a boy. She forgives Lee, and tells Shabnam that she saw her dead father Brian when she was electrocuted. When Shabnam finds the baby scan Stacey is hiding, Stacey throws her out of the flat and tears up the scan photo. When Shabnam asks why Stacey is hiding the photo from Martin, Stacey admits he is not the father but the real father was a one-night stand before getting together with him. When Kush confronts her, she tells him that she thinks he could be the father. Kush's mother Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) notices Kush and Stacey talking, and realises that he could be the father of Stacey's baby. Kush and Stacey convince Carmel not to tell Shabnam or Martin. When Stacey later attends a church service and prays for her father, she sees Kyle, who then leaves suddenly without telling her who he is, causing her to become more suspicious.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} artists have {{acknowledged}} Houston as an influence, including Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, LeAnn Rimes, Jessica Simpson, Nelly Furtado, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears, Ciara, P!nk, Aneeka, Ashanti, Robin Thicke, Jennifer Hudson, Stacie Orrico, Amerie, Destiny's Child, and Ariana Grande. Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, [...] "She [...] {{has been a}} big influence on me." [...] She later told USA Today that [...] "none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn't ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn't." [...] Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with Good Morning America on February 13, 2012, saying [...] "Whitney's been an amazing inspiration for me. I've been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career <b>like</b> <b>hers,</b> sing like her, look beautiful like her." [...] BeyoncÃ© told the Globe and Mail that Houston [...] "inspired [...] to get up there and do what [...] did". She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston's death, [...] "I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [...] Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. So many of my life's memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us." ...|$|E

It is yet another example of a Spanish adaptation (<b>like</b> others of <b>hers</b> and several by Antonio de Trueba) of a tale from another country, in this instance a variation on the Grimmsâ âThe Three Spinners. ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{said that}} if my heart was old and tired she would refresh it, and you said truly. I {{do not know how}} I got along without her, before. I was a forlorn old tree, but now that this blossoming vine has wound itself about me and become the life of my life, it is very different. As a {{furnisher}} of business for me and for Mammy Dorcas she is exhaustlessly competent, but I like my share of it and of course Dorcas <b>likes</b> <b>hers,</b> for Dorcas [...] "raised" [...] George, and Cathy is George over again in so many ways that she brings back Dorcas's youth and the joys of that long-vanished time. My father tried to set Dorcas free twenty years ago, when we still lived in Virginia, but without success; she considered herself {{a member of the family}}, and wouldn't go. And so, a member of the family she remained, and has held that position unchallenged ever since, and holds it now; for when my mother sent her here from San Bernardino when we learned that Cathy was coming, she only changed from one division of the family to the other. She has the warm heart of her race, and its lavish affections, and when Cathy arrived the pair were mother and child in five minutes, and that is what they are to date and will continue. Dorcas really thinks she raised George, and that is one of her prides, but perhaps it was a mutual raising, for their ages were the same--thirteen years short of mine. But they were playmates, at any rate; as regards that, there is no room for dispute.|$|R

Her PataPi is Francesca (ãã©ã³ãã§ã¹ã« Furanchesuka), one which is an equally intelligent multitasker whom Suzume improves to be [...] "the best"; it transforms into the Diva Hestia.
