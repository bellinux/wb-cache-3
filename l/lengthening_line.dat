60|$|The man {{glanced at}} the clock and obeyed. Philip {{swallowed}} half of it at a gulp, then sat down with the tumbler in his hand. All of a sudden something disappeared from {{in front of one of}} the portholes. His heart gave a little jump. They were moving! He sprang up and hurried to the doorway. Slowly but unmistakably they were gliding away from the dock. Already a <b>lengthening</b> <b>line</b> of people were waving their handkerchiefs and shouting farewells. Around them in the river little tugs were screaming, and the ropes from the dock had been thrown loose. Philip stepped to the rail, his heart growing lighter at every moment. His ubiquitous steward, laden with hand luggage, paused for a moment.|$|E

60|$|The King now arose {{and took}} up the line of march, {{turning away from the}} country of the Gaumers. But he had not gone {{more than two or three}} hundred yards before he {{received}} a message from the Queen. It came to him very rapidly, every man in the line seeming anxious to shout it to the man ahead of him as quickly as possible. The message was to the effect that he must either stop where he was or come home: his constantly <b>lengthening</b> <b>line</b> of communication had used up all the chief officers of the government, all the clerks in the departments, and all the officials of every grade, excepting the few who were actually needed to carry on the government, and if any more men went into the line it would be necessary to call upon the laborers and other persons who could not be spared.|$|E
60|$|The getting {{forward of}} hundred-day troops to sustain General Sherman's <b>lengthening</b> <b>lines</b> {{promises}} much good. Please put your best efforts into the work.|$|R
6000|$|He ceased. His earnestness {{unforeseen}} Moved, but not swayed {{their former}} mien; [...] And they dismissed him. Forth he went Through vaulted walks in <b>lengthened</b> <b>line</b> Like porches erst upon the Palatine: [...] Historic reveries their lesson lent, [...] The Past her shadow through the Future sent.|$|R
2500|$|The same {{project of}} the 1960s also decided to merge lines 13 and 14 to create a quick {{connection}} between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as [...] a new north-south line. Distances between stations on the <b>lengthened</b> <b>line</b> 13 differ from that on other lines {{in order to make}} it more [...] "express" [...] and hence to extend it farther in the suburbs. The new Line13 was inaugurated on 9November 1976.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she hesitated}} to beg {{that he would}} keep entire silence on a subject which she had herself {{unnecessarily}} mentioned, not being used to stoop in that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of unintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things stood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and seeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a <b>lengthening</b> <b>line</b> of wool, shouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate, jumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and swept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted sock-top, fitted it over the kitten's head as {{a new source of}} madness, while Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty--it was a history as full of sensation as [...] "This is the house that Jack built." [...] Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came up and the tete-a-tete with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he could, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her severity by saying [...] "God bless you" [...] when she shook hands with him.|$|E
60|$|We {{left the}} latter making its retreat on the {{preceding}} evening towards Skenesborough. The lake above Ticonderoga becomes so narrow that, in those times, it was frequently called South River. The bateaux, deeply laden, {{made their way}} slowly in a <b>lengthened</b> <b>line.</b> The rear-guard of armed galleys followed at wary distance. No immediate pursuit, however, was apprehended. The floating bridge was considered an effectual impediment to the enemy's fleet.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>lengthening</b> the <b>line,</b> moving {{the line from}} Kaarlenkatu and Helsinginkatu to Fleminginkatu in Kallio was proposed on 10 October 2008.|$|R
60|$|The army of Ferdinand {{advanced}} in <b>lengthened</b> <b>line,</b> glittering along {{the foot of}} the mountains which border the Mediterranean, while a fleet of vessels, freighted with heavy artillery and warlike munitions, kept pace with it at a short distance from the land, covering the sea with a thousand gleaming sails. When Hamet el Zegri saw this force approaching, he set fire to the houses of the suburbs which adjoined the walls and sent forth three battalions to encounter the advance guard of the enemy.|$|R
50|$|Plans are {{in place}} to <b>lengthen</b> the <b>line</b> with four {{additional}} stops, including Tenerife North Airport. There would also be new stations in San Antonio, San Lazaro (Park and Ride) and Los Rodeos-TFN.|$|R
25|$|At Reagan National Airport, {{check-in}} <b>lines</b> <b>lengthened</b> after {{baggage handling}} programs were affected.|$|R
5000|$|He {{said that}} after he had taken Singapore, he wanted to discuss with Tojo {{a plan for the}} {{invasion}} of Australia... Tojo turned down the plan, making the excuse of <b>lengthened</b> supply <b>lines,</b> which would be precarious and open to enemy attack...|$|R
5000|$|The company {{operated}} the Coal Hill Coal Railroad, a 1.5 mi, [...] narrow gauge railroad until 1871, {{when it was}} sold to the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad, which <b>lengthened</b> the <b>line.</b> The company assumed control of the Montour Railroad in 1901.|$|R
500|$|Wachusett is a {{commuter}} rail {{station on the}} MBTA Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line. It is northwest of the intersection of Massachusetts Route 2 and Route 31 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. It serves as the northwestern terminus for Fitchburg Line trains. The opening of Wachusett extended service [...] west from Fitchburg on the Pan Am Southern main <b>line,</b> <b>lengthening</b> the Fitchburg <b>Line</b> to [...] The station is expected to draw 400 daily riders.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} lamplighter, and two <b>lengthening</b> <b>lines</b> of light all {{down the long}} {{perspective}} of the street, until they were blended and lost in the distance. Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the blind, and went up-stairs. Presently, a light went up-stairs after her, passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase windows, on its way up. By and by, {{one corner of the}} second-floor blind was disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit's eye were there; also the other corner, as if the light porter's eye were on that side. Still, no communication was made to Stephen. Much relieved when the two hours were at last accomplished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for so much loitering.|$|R
50|$|Most historians {{agree that}} the {{weakened}} Allied right flank would have been destroyed, had the French left wing attacked. Vendôme realized this, asking Burgundy for permission to attack with the left wing. Burgundy sent a messenger with a refusal but the messenger failed to deliver the message. The situation worsened with Vendôme believing that an attack would support his troops, who were <b>lengthening</b> their <b>line,</b> threatening to envelop the Allied left flank. As Argyll's regiments approached, they <b>lengthened</b> the Allied <b>line</b> but too slowly and not great enough in extent, to prevent the French from threatening such an envelopment.|$|R
50|$|Wachusett is a {{commuter}} rail {{station on the}} MBTA Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line. It is northwest of the intersection of Massachusetts Route 2 and Route 31 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. It serves as the northwestern terminus for Fitchburg Line trains. The opening of Wachusett extended service 4.5 mi west from Fitchburg on the Pan Am Southern main <b>line,</b> <b>lengthening</b> the Fitchburg <b>Line</b> to 54 mi. The station is expected to draw 400 daily riders.|$|R
25|$|After fifty-five {{years of}} operation, {{transporting}} two million passengers annually, the funicular was {{in need of}} renovation. A novel idea was proposed by the RATP and the Mairie de Paris: <b>lengthen</b> the <b>line</b> with a tunnel to the Anvers métro station. The idea was abandoned due to its high cost.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a tunnel}} of 539 metres (1767 ft) near Maoribank, {{but on the}} eastern side where two short tunnels (220 metres (11 chain) and 180 metres (9 chain)) had been {{proposed}} through a spur it was cheaper to <b>lengthen</b> the <b>line</b> by 140 metres (7 chain) and have open cuttings.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, a huge project {{installed}} approximately 50 km of new metro tunnels. This construction included {{a direct connection}} between downtown Madrid (Nuevos Ministerios) and the airport, the <b>lengthening</b> of <b>line</b> 8, and adding service to the outskirts with a huge 40 km loop called MetroSur serving Madrid's southern suburbs.|$|R
25|$|On March 23, he had <b>lengthened</b> <b>line</b> Benton eastward {{through the}} 1st Cavalry Division's patrol base at Ch'unch'on {{and as far}} as the 1st Marine Division's zone on the IX Corps right, where it joined the last few miles of line Cairo. On the {{following}} day he had extended line Cairo from its original terminus in the Marine zone northeastward across the remainder of the army front to the town of Chosan-ni on the east coast. The final objective line of the Operation Ripper thus had become a combination of the Benton and Cairo lines, following the upstream trace of the Imjin virtually to the 38th parallel in the west, hanging slack a few miles below the parallel for almost all of its remaining length to the east, then rising to an east coast anchor some eight miles (13km) above the parallel.|$|R
5000|$|The work on 2 of the {{stations}} that were initially meant to <b>lengthen</b> the first <b>line</b> has been stopped because it posed danger to buildings of {{historical and cultural}} value.|$|R
5000|$|In an 1981 {{interview}} with Frank Kinahan, Heaney said Field Work [...] "was {{an attempt to}} try to do something deliberately: to change the note and to <b>lengthen</b> the <b>line,</b> and to bring elements of my social self, elements of my usual nature, which is more convivial than most of the poems before that might suggest, to try to bring all that into play.|$|R
2500|$|Schwarzenberg had an {{opportunity}} to drive forward and crush the French forces before him. Instead he called a halt at Langres while diverting Hieronymus Karl Colloredo-Mansfeld's I Corps and Prince Frederick of Hesse-Homburg's Reserve Corps to seize Dijon to the south. Militarily this move made little sense but he was carrying out the instructions of Metternich to avoid major fighting. By nature a cautious general, Schwarzenberg was jittery about his <b>lengthening</b> supply <b>lines</b> stretching back to the Rhine, partly explaining the Army of Bohemia's slow [...] per day advance.|$|R
40|$|Hamidah Hassan {{works at}} SATS, a {{provider}} of gateway services at Changi Airport. SATS has a symbiotic relationship with Changi Airport Singapore and Singapore Airlines. Hamidah {{is in charge of}} the operations at the check-in counter. As passenger traffic at Changi Airport increases, the <b>lengthening</b> waiting <b>lines</b> threaten to impair customer perceptions of the airline and airport. In order to implement an efficient solution, she has to balance her cost of operations against the cost of waiting for passengers and the service level agreement with the airport authority. This case analyses the problem using an integer linear program before performing a simulation analysis...|$|R
50|$|The Black Forest Railway was {{the first}} {{mountain}} railway to use hair-pin loops, which artificially <b>lengthened</b> the <b>line,</b> but allowed for the grade to stay under 20 per mille at any point. Without this solution, the construction of part of the line as a rack and pinion railway, like the Murg Valley Railway or the Höllental Railway, would have been necessary. Between Hausach und Sankt Georgen, the railway ascends a total of 564 metres. The two towns are separated by only 21 kilometres in a straight line; the railway traverses 38 kilometres to make the trip.|$|R
30|$|The fourth case is {{illustrated}} by meeting an unknown animal in a zoo and learning that it is called Rosie. Thus a word bank must provide for two dimensions of continuous extension: (1) the time-linear <b>lengthening</b> of token <b>lines</b> (horizontal) and (2) the insertion of new token lines into the column of owner values (vertical).|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the Germans {{decided to}} <b>lengthen</b> the Nordland <b>Line</b> from Lønsdal in Saltfjellet going northwards. Over {{a period of}} three years, the {{original}} plan was to first have both the road and the railroad all the way to Narvik and then on to Kirkenes, but they only managed to build the railroad to Bodø.|$|R
25|$|The {{second line}} was to {{parallel}} the Caspian coast from Hazi Aslanov through Baku's industrial districts, meeting {{the first line}} again at the Baku Railway Terminal, and then continuing westwards before turning north to join Baku's northwestern districts. To accelerate construction, a branch was opened from May 28 station to Khatai in 1968, and in 1976 {{in the opposite direction}} towards Nizami. The second and first line used the same station (May 28). This posed no serious problems initially, as the line was two stations long, but when the second stage opened in 1985, <b>lengthening</b> the <b>line</b> to 8 stations (Memar Ajemi), construction of a transfer was desperately needed.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of inauguration there were two {{potential}} rail pathways south from London, and the Speaker of the House of Commons had said no further pathways would be permitted. The SER therefore considered routes to Dover from the proposed London and Southampton Railway line at Wimbledon, or from the existing London and Greenwich Railway (L&GR) at Greenwich. The former left London {{in the wrong direction}} and then on a roundabout route. The latter provided a useful way for a northern route via Gravesend, Rochester, and Canterbury, except that <b>lengthening</b> the <b>line</b> beyond Greenwich was blocked by opposition from the Admiralty, and this route would involve tunnelling through the North Downs.|$|R
50|$|The Third Battle of the Aisne {{came as a}} {{complete}} surprise to the allies, including British troops who had been sent there to rest in a quiet sector. A German breakthrough was aided by orders of a French general to mass troops in the front line - a tactic by this date discredited. The penetration broke into open country and fighting went on from 27 May to 6 June 1918, but ran out of energy owing to lack of a strategic objective and <b>lengthening</b> supply <b>lines.</b> During the Second Battle of the Marne, the last fight on the Chemin des Dames occurred between 2 August and 10 October 1918.|$|R
50|$|The {{second line}} was to {{parallel}} the Caspian coast from Hazi Aslanov through Baku's industrial districts, meeting {{the first line}} again at the Baku Railway Terminal, and then continuing westwards before turning north to join Baku's northwestern districts.

2500|$|A typical four-point-moor {{consists}} of an X pattern with four Stato Anchors at the outside corners and Grasp at the center, made fast to a spring buoy for the close end of each mooring leg with synthetic mooring lines. [...] Using her capstans, Grasp can shorten or <b>lengthen</b> the mooring <b>line</b> for each leg and change her position within the moor.|$|R
50|$|The Geldern Emplacement <b>lengthened</b> the Siegfried <b>Line</b> northwards {{as far as}} Kleve on the Rhine, and {{was built}} {{after the start of}} the Second World War. The Siegfried Line {{originally}} ended in the north near Brüggen in the Viersen district. The primary constructions were unarmed dugouts which were extremely strongly built out of concrete. For camouflage they were often built near farms.|$|R
2500|$|The {{northern}} track through Arne Garborgs plass {{was moved}} to allow the installation of a roundabout in 1941, <b>lengthening</b> the <b>line</b> by [...] The tracks were rerouted at two places in 1947. The first, from 6 to 16 July, moved the tracks from Sannergata to Birkelunden. The second, which took effect on 19 October, saw new tracks through Grensen between Stortorvet and Akersgata in the city center. The line until then passed through a narrow part of Akersgata, where there was not sufficient width for two trams to meet. The curve was also so sharp that the motormen could not see an on-coming tram. Therefore, a guard had to be posted at the curve.|$|R
