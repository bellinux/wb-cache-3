5000|$|Commander B, 1899-built Hawthorn Leslie 0-4-0ST, {{named after}} the collection's founder, Cdr. Baldock. The engine was {{originally}} purchased by the Admiralty for use in Chatham Dockyard, and was brought to Hollycombe for restoration in 1985, several years after withdrawal from the docks. Currently stored in the open on tracks of the abandoned standard gauge <b>line,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and in deteriorating condition, due to unaffordable heavy overhaul and boiler repairs.|$|E
50|$|The gap {{in actual}} usage during the {{prolonged}} transition from Southern Pacific freight {{use to the}} proposed Wine Train service {{was not enough to}} take the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> although the many years of deferred maintenance necessitated the investment of approximately $20 Million to rehabilitate the line before trains could be safely operated on it. The rail line connects to the Union Pacific Railroad and California Northern Railroad and has hosted special trains from Amtrak as well as private excursion trains.|$|E
50|$|For Network Rail {{to route}} freight trains onto the line {{during the week}} and GCR(N) to operate {{heritage}} trains at the weekend, a length of rail north of East Leake was removed to create two separate railways. However, with this 'rail break', the GCR(N) were unable to access Rushcliffe Halt, and a better solution {{was found in the}} form of a clip-on, double-sided wheel scotch, padlocked to the line at the site of the rail break. At weekends, the GCR(N) phone Network Rail to take possession of the line: Network Rail then lock the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> from their end and allow the GCR(N) to unlock the rail break and access the track to Loughborough. In 2003, regular services to Rushcliffe Halt resumed. Passenger trains further south now run on a regular basis to the site of a proposed Loughborough High Level station.|$|E
50|$|On Thursday 22 September 1892 near Lindal station, a {{large hole}} had {{appeared}} beneath the railway, taking many <b>lines</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and swallowing up a locomotive. Rescue attempts were abandoned and the locomotive still lies underground at an unknown depth. The {{cause of the}} hole has been debated but remains unclear to this day.|$|R
50|$|The <b>line</b> fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in the 1950s, {{the track}} {{was taken up}} in the 1960s, {{and most of the}} route was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|By 1950 the L&MMR line {{crossing}} the GWR main <b>line</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> as sea trade had vanished; onward conveyance of local minerals was now by rail alone.|$|R
5000|$|At Hindley {{there are}} now two {{platforms}} in use, with the overgrown remains of two further platforms (for the fast <b>lines</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> on 21 November 1965.) ...|$|R
50|$|By 1950 the L&MMR line {{crossing}} the GWR main <b>line</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> as sea trade at Llanelly had vanished; onward conveyance of local minerals was now by rail alone.|$|R
50|$|The canalside <b>line</b> fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> {{after new}} 'straightened' lines were opened in 1864, {{with a new}} station Thorne South {{about a third of}} a mile to the south. Another station Thorne North opened, {{to the north of the}} town centre, with the line to Hull in 1869.|$|R
50|$|The {{dieselization}} of the Chicago and North Western {{reduced the}} Chicago-based railroad's {{need for an}} in-house coal supply. Passage, starting in 1963, of the Clean Air Acts made Macoupin County coal redundant. Coal haulage declined on the Girard-Peoria line, and the branch <b>line</b> went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The {{rundown of}} the line began in 1939 when the Beaufort Ironworks <b>line</b> fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> Next came {{dieselisation}} in 1958 and then closure to passengers on 30 April 1962. The line was then singled in 1964 and the signal box was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> on 17 August in the same year. Closure to goods traffic came on 1 December 1969.|$|R
50|$|The docks {{were served}} by a myriad of {{dockside}} <b>lines</b> which fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> during the 1990s although some remnants of the dockside lines are still evident today.|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} left {{in place for a}} number of years. In 1880 William Traill, {{promoter}} of the Giant's Causeway, Portrush and Bush Valley Railway & Tramway Company, sought to build a [...] railway across Glenariff to link the GIOH line with [...] on the narrow gauge Ballymena, Cushendall and Red Bay Railway, which connected with Ireland's [...] railway network at [...] Traill was unsuccessful and the GIOH <b>line</b> remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
50|$|Opposite {{the station}} is a disused goods shed and a crane. East of {{the station is}} the {{junction}} for the freight-only Eaglehawk-Inglewood line, which connects to the Robinvale and Kulwin lines. The <b>line</b> was booked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in May 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{freight service}} last ran on 28 May 1956, but the track {{remained}} {{and was used}} to store condemned vans and wagons. The <b>line</b> was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in April 1960, although a short section at Fullerton remained until 1 June 1964.|$|R
50|$|The section between Binnaway and Gwabegar is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> having {{closed on}} 28 October 2005 by the RIC for safety reasons. The <b>line</b> is booked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> north <b>of</b> Charbon Colliery, but {{is able to}} be opened for charter {{services}} to operate as far as Kandos.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the end of}} {{freight traffic}} from Cauldon & Oakamoor in 1988 the <b>line</b> went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> but was {{designated}} as a strategic freight site. [...] In 2009, Moorland and City Railways Ltd (MCR) obtained a 150-year lease on the Cauldon Lowe Branch from Network Rail {{with the intention of}} reopening the line for quarry traffic. This would require the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the Stoke-Leek line as well, and negotiations have been ongoing since 2010 regarding the return to service of the line.|$|R
50|$|Ryongjŏng Station is {{a railway}} station of the Korean State Railway in Ryongjŏng, Ŭnnyul County, South Hwanghae Province, North Korea. It is the {{terminus}} of the narrow-gauge Ryongjŏng Branch of the Ŭnnyul Line. The {{station and the}} branch <b>line</b> have been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> since 2002.|$|R
5000|$|The former OW&WR line, now {{partially}} {{incorporated in}} the Cotswold Line, was reduced to single track between Wolvercote Junction and [...] on 29 November 1971 when the Up <b>line</b> was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> The second track was reinstated between Ascott-under-Wychwood and [...] on 6 June 2011.|$|R
2500|$|The {{remaining}} {{section of}} the Moretonhampstead <b>line</b> was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in 2009 when 'temporary stop blocks' {{were placed on the}} line [...] from the junction at Newton Abbot. The line to Heathfield has since been re-opened, seeing daily timber trains in 2012 to Chirk in Wales.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the end of}} {{limestone}} traffic in 1988 the <b>line</b> went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> but was designated as a strategic freight site. [...] In 2009 Moorland and City Railways Ltd obtained the line on a 150yr lease from network Rail {{with the intention of}} reopening the line for quarry traffic. [...] With a merger having taken place between Lafarge and Tarmac though, the future ownership of Caldon Low quarry is, , in doubt and the plans for reopening the line for quarry traffic are on hold.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{section of}} the Moretonhampstead <b>line</b> was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in 2009 when 'temporary stop blocks' {{were placed on the}} line 53 chain km from the junction at Newton Abbot. The line to Heathfield has since been re-opened, seeing daily timber trains in 2012 to Chirk in Wales.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 1904 {{and closed}} {{a decade later}} {{it was part of}} a concerted effort to boost revenue and thus see off {{competition}} from the burgeoning tramway network. The station's only platform was on the down line, the up <b>line</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> The final nail in the line's coffin was a government directive issued shortly after the declaration of war that railways unable to support themselves would cease operations at the earliest opportunity; and, as the line clearly fell into this category, the last train ran early in August 1914.|$|R
50|$|The <b>line</b> name is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> since March 26, 2016 {{when the}} Hokkaido Shinkansen opened and {{replaced}} regular passenger services connecting Aomori and Hakodate on the Tsugaru-Kaikyō Line. The railway lines {{that formed the}} Tsugaru-Kaikyō Line continue to operate freight and passenger trains except for passenger trains on the Kaikyō Line section.|$|R
50|$|On 11 July 2004, {{the line}} to Ballarat was reopened, with V/Line {{passenger}} services reinstated. The contract for the works were awarded in February 2003, and required a diamond crossing and signalling to be installed, to allow the broad gauge line to reach the platform. The Maryborough <b>line</b> was booked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in January 2005.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, {{the entire}} Vietnamese railway network was {{a target of}} bombardments and {{sabotage}} by both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese forces. The Da Lat-Tháp Chàm line was no exception; plagued by sabotage and mining by the Viet Cong, the <b>line</b> gradually fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> with regular operations {{coming to an end}} in 1968.|$|R
50|$|After steam {{locomotives}} {{were introduced}} by the Cornwall Minerals Railway in 1874, wagons continued to be moved between Newquay railway station and the harbour incline by horses. Traffic handled at the harbour gradually declined and the <b>line</b> was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in 1926. Part of the route is now a footpath from opposite the station to the cliff tops above the beach.|$|R
5000|$|The Ryongjŏng Branch, {{also known}} as the Sŏhaeri Line, is a ten-kilometre long, non-electrified [...] gauge line opened in 1964. At its peak the line carried 6,000 tonnes of ore daily. Besides the {{frequent}} trains to stations, there were 12 daily round trips to the port, each train consisting of 21 self-unloading hoppers. The <b>line</b> has been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> since 2002.|$|R
50|$|Washington {{is located}} on the mothballed Leamside line and, until the mid-1960s, had regular {{passenger}} services to Sunderland, Teesside and Newcastle upon Tyne, via Pelaw Junction. Freight services continued until 1991 and the <b>line</b> is currently <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> with all major infrastructure extant. Washington is therefore one of the largest towns in Britain without an operational railway station (see Dudley, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Gosport).|$|R
50|$|The station {{started to}} be run down {{following}} {{the closure of the}} line to Truro on 4 February 1963. The goods yard was closed in 1965; the roof on platforms 2 and 3 was removed in 1964. Platform 3 was shortened in 1966 and its locomotive release <b>line</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> on 4 October 1972, by which time four of the carriage sidings had been removed. On 5 October 1987 the signal box was closed, all the remaining signals were dismantled and the rails serving platform 1 were lifted. At the same time the last of the carriage sidings were closed and lifted. The track beside the former platform 3 was kept as a siding until the mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|On 29 March 1986 the two Bristol <b>lines</b> {{were taken}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> between Cogload and Taunton, {{returning}} {{the line to}} its original two tracks. The following weekend saw Cogload signal box closed on 5 April, and the points and signals were then operated from Exeter Panel Signal Box. A slight realignment of the up Bristol line {{at the same time}} allowed the junction to be moved and the speed limit raised to 90 mph.|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Transport Administration will from 2011 start {{upgrading}} the 57 km section from Emmaboda to Karlskrona, {{with the goal}} to reduce travel time from 40 to 33 minutes. This {{will result in the}} <b>line</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> from December 2011 to June 2013, with all work being completed in 2014. The upgrades include continuous welded rails, centralized traffic control, a new catenary system, new passing loops at Gullberna and Vissefjärda, upgrade of the passing loops at Spjutsbygd and Holmsjö, new platforms at Holmsjö Station, speeds up to 200 km/h, 40 level crossings removed, 8 new tunnels and bridges, new track layout and signaling system at Emmaboda, and a rebuilt Karlskrona Station. The project will cost 950 million Swedish krona (SEK).|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Ayrline Electrification by British Rail in {{the early}} 1980s, the {{connection}} to the line to Renfrew was removed (the line had previously become derelict and mostly removed), the locomotive siding and the Slow <b>lines</b> were taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> between Wallneuk Junction and Arkleston Junction. The practical application of this was the former Up Goods Loop and Up Slow line were removed and the Down Slow Line became the Up Goods Loop.|$|R
50|$|The station, {{which was}} first opened by the North British Railway in June 1846, {{used to have}} two {{platforms}} and an overall roof. Both features no longer exist - the northbound platform loop <b>line</b> was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and lifted in the early 1970s, whilst the platform itself and the station roof were both removed during the modernisation and electrification by British Rail of {{the northern end of}} the East Coast Main Line between 1989 and 1991.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924, the {{development}} of Harrow Hill colliery, on the up side, led to the provision of two new sidings, with connections at both ends. North of Speedwell, the Mitcheldean <b>line</b> remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> until opened in 1907 for rail-motor services to Drybrook halt (up side), preceding which bridges carried the line over the Trafalgar tramway and a lane. Yet a further [...] mile fragment of the line was opened as late as 18 October 1928, from Drybrook halt to Drybrook quarries. Two over-bridges and a short tunnel were traversed on this section, and as the gradient fell towards Bilson at 1 in 46, catch-points were provided north of the halt to protect the auto-train from runaways. At the quarries, two sidings were provided on the down side, looped to the running line.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s, the <b>lines</b> {{radiating}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Moree {{have been}} basically on a seasonal basis only, serving {{the needs of}} the grain producers. The stationmaster at Boggabilla was withdrawn in 1979. In 1987, the line was truncated at North Star and grain was road trucked to the silos there and at Crooble. The last train to run to Boggabilla was on 23 November 1987. In November 2013, the remainder of the <b>line</b> was booked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> It is able to be reopened with 14 days notice, being reopened in full for three weeks from 28 July 2014.|$|R
