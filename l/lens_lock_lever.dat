5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> cylinder <b>locks,</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is locked with a vertically tilting, downward <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R
5000|$|First {{manufactured}} in 1976, the Benelli B76 is a locked-breech, fixed-barrel pistol, that works {{thanks to a}} unique [...] "inertia lock" [...] system, as explained in [...] In this system, the gun has a bolt provided with ribs extending transversely to the bolt axis and adapted to engage in and disengage from corresponding mating grooves in the receiver, and a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> that links the bolt with the slide which acts as a bolt carrier. Upon firing, while the pistol recoils in {{the hand of the}} shooter, the inertia of the slide makes it maintain its position relative to the receiver, constraining the bolt ribs' motion in the corresponding grooves via the <b>locking</b> <b>lever,</b> and so keeping the breech positively locked. As soon as the recoil movement of the pistol in the hand of the shooter slows down, the slide tends to continue its rearward movement, so retreating relative to the receiver. At that point, the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> does not force the bolt into its locking recesses any more and the bolt is free to recoil as well, pushed by the residual pressure of the gasses in the barrel with enough force to complete the shooting cycle.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when pushed to the side to strip and is separate from the slide lock, as on the Megastar. The slide <b>lock</b> <b>lever,</b> magazine release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R
50|$|In railway {{signalling}}, an Annett’s key or Annett key {{is a large}} {{key that}} <b>locks</b> <b>levers</b> or other items of signalling apparatus, thereby serving as a portable form of interlocking. When not in use, the key is normally held in an Annett's lock (or Annett lock) that is fixed to the lever or concerned apparatus.|$|R

25|$|After having built {{a number}} of prototypes and {{experimental}} vehicles, AvtoVAZ designers launched the first car entirely of their own design, the VAZ-2121 Niva, in 1977. This highly popular and innovative SUV was made with off-road use in mind, featuring a gearbox with a central differential <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> {{as well as a}} low- and high-range selector lever.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} a joint that employs a unique spring-loaded mechanism that automatically secures a ball hitch upon insertion into a coupler. This {{eliminates the need for}} the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> found in most conventional ball joints. Connections made using MSFC's quick-connect joint are easier, safer, and more reliable than those made using conventional ball joints...|$|R

50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 mechanical <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|R
50|$|Some {{connector}} housings {{are designed with}} locking mechanisms to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. Locking mechanism designs include <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> of various sorts, screw locking, and toggle or bayonet locking. Depending on application requirements, housings with locking mechanisms may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure {{the integrity of the}} electrical connection and housing seals.|$|R
50|$|The LPS {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} LPS rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail similar in design to the mounting used for Russian SVD rifles and PSO-1 optical sights and positions the {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver and bore center axis.The Warsaw Pact mount has a castle nut that screws {{into the bottom of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed.The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy access to the receiver cover which needs to be removed for cleaning.Due to the offset to the left and the relative height of the mounting, the PSL iron sights can be used with a LPS scope mounted, though the positioning of the scope’s optical center axis may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R
50|$|The Airphibian {{took the}} {{approach}} of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook {{on the side of}} the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging <b>lock</b> <b>levers</b> connecting the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use.|$|R
50|$|A 3 <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a common}} type of <b>lever</b> <b>lock,</b> but is {{generally}} used for low security applications such as internal doors as their tolerances are much lower (there are fewer combinations of key available, so {{they are likely to}} unlock doors they shouldn't).|$|R
50|$|These little pistols were {{intended}} to be a parlor pistol and not a defensive weapon. They are designed for use with a percussion cap and lead shot, without gunpowder. There are two types of breech-pieces, about equal in frequency in existing production guns; all known prototypes have the one-piece design, which provides no cover to enclose the cap, and its <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> is quite short. The two-piece design has a cone to hold the cap, a cover providing protection from the exploding cap, and a longer lever.|$|R

50|$|The MAG's {{receiver}} {{is constructed}} from sheet metal stampings reinforced by steel plates and rivets. The front is reinforced {{to accept the}} barrel nut and gas cylinder which are permanently mounted. Guide rails that support the bolt assembly and piston extension during their reciprocating movement are riveted to the side plates. The bolt's guide rails are shaped downward to drive the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> into engagement with the locking shoulder, which is also riveted to the side plates. The rear of the receiver has been reinforced and slotted to accept the butt-stock.|$|R
50|$|The {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} SVD rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail (a type of dovetail rail). The side rail mount is an offset mounting that positions the PSO-1 {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver center axis. The mount has a castle nut that screws {{into the bottom of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed.|$|R
25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator gust lock became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the gust lock was made possible by the condition of the gust <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{is made up}} of a set of 'levers' (typically {{between two}} and five) which are raised to {{different}} heights by the key when it is turned. Once all the levers have been moved to the correct height, the locking bolt is free to slide across and secure the door. The teeth or bittings of the key have flat tops rather than being pointed. <b>Lever</b> <b>lock</b> keys tend to be bigger and less convenient for carrying, although <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> are considered to be harder to pick and so are recommended by most insurance companies.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Chiappa began {{marketing}} {{a version}} of the Aircrew Survival Weapon called the Chiappa X-Caliber. It is an evolution of the M6 Scout, which had the major failing of disassembling by removing a pin to take the gun down into two easy to stow parts. If the pin was lost, the gun could not be reassembled. The Chiappa X-Caliber is designed to fold in half by pushing one <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> In addition, it comes with adapters that allow up to a dozen different calibers of cartridges and shotshells to be used, one at a time in each barrel.|$|R

50|$|F-mount <b>lenses</b> <b>lock</b> {{by turning}} {{counter-clockwise}} (when {{looking at the}} front of lens) and unlock clockwise. Nearly all F-mount lenses have zoom and focus controls that rotate in the clockwise direction (as viewed from behind the camera) to increase focal length and focus distance respectively. This convention is also used in Pentax K-mount and Sony A-mount lenses but is opposite of the direction normally used by Canon. F-mount lenses also typically have aperture rings that turn clockwise to close.|$|R
5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new pin type offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in Socket T was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the load plate {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down a <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The pressure of the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> on the load plate clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection. The load plate only covers the edges of the top surface of the CPU (integrated heat spreader). The center is free to make contact with the cooling device placed on top of the CPU. The spacing for the CPU cooler mounting holes is 72mm x 72mm.|$|R

50|$|Handguns {{must have}} a one piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the dust cover (with or without an {{accessory}} rail) can have a maximum length of 75 mm from the leading edge {{to the rear of}} the slide stop pin. Magazine wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35 mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped trigger guards (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide <b>lock</b> <b>levers</b> and thumb shields provided they do not act as a thumb rest. Cosmetic modifications are permitted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} system employs three {{differentials}} (centre, front and rear). The transfer case involves a high/low range selector lever and a central differential <b>lock</b> <b>lever.</b> Low range can be selected with the centre differential locked or unlocked. The original Niva had a maximum speed of 81 mph, [...] and can cruise at 90 km/h while consuming petrol at [...] Its towing capacity is rated {{for up to}} 860 kg (1900 lb). It debuted in Western Europe at the 1978 Paris Motor Salon, and rapidly captured forty percent of Europe's market for four-wheel drive vehicles, making it Lada's top-selling export. Because of export demand, and higher priority for exports, domestic customers faced long waiting lists.|$|R
50|$|The New FD range {{changed the}} {{method by which}} the <b>lens</b> <b>locked</b> to the <b>lens</b> mount; instead of the silver locking ring at the base {{rotating}} {{while the rest of}} the lens remained still, the whole lens barrel rotated to <b>lock</b> the <b>lens,</b> even though the actual mating surfaces of the breech-lock mount remained stationary in respect to each other. This made the lenses attach more like the bayonet-lock mounts of other brands, and did away with the criticism that Canon lenses were more slow and fiddly to mount.|$|R

50|$|Interviews from Merpati {{officials}} {{revealed that}} the first two aircraft had several problems on the Power <b>Lever</b> <b>Lock</b> System, whereas the automatic power <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> system sometimes failed to open after landing. In May 2008, the board of instructors had agreed to revise the Normal Checklist that the Power Lock system selects to “OPEN” before landing. However, further analysis {{revealed that the}}re were no faults in the engines.|$|R
50|$|The Chubb Detector Lock is a {{variation}} of the <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> which was designed to detect and prevent picking attempts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lever</b> tumbler <b>lock,</b> {{which uses}} a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{required}} the <b>lever</b> to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R
50|$|To {{mount the}} optics, a side-rail is {{permanently}} {{attached to the}} left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail rail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give {{easy access to the}} receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place.|$|R
