During his {{acceptance}} speech, he {{revealed that he}} had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier.

500|$|Mendes called American Beauty a rite {{of passage}} film about {{imprisonment}} and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester's existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing. In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, [...] "reiterating rituals that hardly please him". He masturbates in the confines of his shower; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, [...] "confined [...] nearly crossed out". The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester's journey is the story's center. His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to [...] " [...] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise". After Lester shares a joint with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn. Changed by Ricky's [...] "attractive, profound confidence", Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his [...] "banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence"; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could [...] "see his whole <b>life</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him".|$|E

You got your whole <b>life</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> you!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The long {{tracking}} {{shot through the}} Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission {{to go in the}} short way, and this forced them to go round the back. Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire <b>life</b> was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him, commenting, [...] "It's his seduction of her [...] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him". This sequence was shot eight times.|$|R

2500|$|Andrew is {{partially}} based on writer Marc Cherry himself, who copied much of Bree's dialogue {{from his own}} mother's reaction {{when he came out}} to her. Andrew can be selfish and manipulative, and regularly uses other people to get what he wants, for example, persuading his boyfriend Justin to hit him so he can claim Bree is abusing him. He has also committed a range of crimes, from being expelled from school for smoking marijuana, to running over Mamá Solis while drunk. After Bree hushed up the accident for him, he then refused to feel bad, reasoning [...] "She's an old lady! I have my whole <b>life</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> me!"

[...] Both the World Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S. government are investigating Landis' accusations.

This allowed King {{to take charge of}} the set and win the next four games in a row from 23 games advantage to Evert, which Evert's serve got broken by King in the seventh and ninth games, and the first set was hers 36 losing only nine points in the four games. During the second set, King would hit a drop shot winner and from that point onwards Evert lost her games flow pattern and poise, and started hitting errant shots outside of the court. This match was played before a sellout crowd of 13,500 fans in attendance, which included then-Vice-President Spiro Agnew, which King said to Evert {{at the end of her}} first lost in a Grand Slam that [...] "Don't let it bother you Chris.

As monsters go, she's rather endearing ... the two Lyons offspring, who fuss and fight but remain one-note characters." ...|$|R

40|$|It {{used to be}} {{the case}} that {{participation}} in political life was considered to be a vocation, and that those who chose it were in it for the long haul, through thick and thin. The most prominent example of this in Australian history was Billy Hughes.

Mike Baird 2 ̆ 7 s resignation, both as New South Wales premier and from the state parliament, comes as somewhat of a shock.
