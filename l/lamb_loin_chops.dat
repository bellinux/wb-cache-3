40|$|This study {{evaluated}} omega- 3 intramuscular {{fatty acids}} in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum of commercially prepared Australian <b>lamb</b> <b>loin</b> <b>chops.</b> Meats, denuded of external fats were cooked {{by means of}} conductive dry-heat using a fry grilling hot plate, to a core temperature of 70 °C. An untrained consumer panel assessed meat appearance, aroma, tenderness, juiciness, taste and overall liking. Results showed no compositional alterations (P > 0. 05) to omega- 3 fatty acids due to cooking treatment, whereas on absolute terms (mg/ 100 g muscle) omega- 3 fatty acids significantly (P < 0. 05) increased. The mean EPA + DHA content of the cooked meat at 32. 8 ± 2. 3 mg/ 100 g muscle exceeded the minimum 30 mg/ 100 g per edible portion required for the defined Australian classification as 'source' long-chain (≥ C 20) omega- 3 for cooked lamb. A 3. 4 % intramuscular fat content in the initial raw meat was sufficient to maintain acceptable overall sensory eating quality.

40|$|The ‘organic’ {{label on}} a product {{guarantees}} that synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and hormones {{are not used}} in the production process and {{that the use of}} pharmaceutical products and drugs is limited. However, product quality is often questioned and we have to anticipate the consumer demand for product quality guarantees. This study was conducted to compare the sensory and nutritional meat and carcass qualities of lambs raised under an organic (O) or a conventional (C) production system. Comparisons were made with both pasture-fed lambs and lambs that were stall-fed indoors with concentrate and hay. The experiment was conducted over two years for stall-fed lambs (S) (group O, n= 24; group C, n= 24) and three years for pasture-fed lambs (P) (group O, n= 36; group C, n= 36). For P lambs, O and C production systems differed in terms of the level of mineral N fertilisation of the pasture. For S lambs, the feed was organic vs. conventional, and the ingredients of O and C concentrates were the same. The nutritional quality of the meat (longissimus dorsi) was assessed in terms of its fatty acid (FA) composition, and the sensory quality of the <b>loin</b> <b>chop</b> was assessed by a trained sensory panel. In stall-fed lambs, the health value of meat FA for human consumption was higher in the O group than in the C group, but {{there was no difference in}} the sensory quality of the meat and the carcass between the O and C groups. In pasture-fed lambs, there were no significant differences between the O and C groups in terms of the health value of meat FA. However, in pasture-fed <b>lambs,</b> the <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> had a higher level of abnormal odour of the fat in the organic than in the conventional group, probably due to a higher proportion of white clover in the diet...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of ageing time of <b>lamb</b> <b>loins</b> prior to freezing on technological characteristics and oxidation stability of coarse ground <b>lamb</b> <b>loin</b> sausage using in a model system. Methods <b>Lamb</b> <b>loins</b> (M. longissimus lumborum, n = 25) were aged at − 1. 5 °C for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8 wk and then frozen for the remaining days (a total of 30 wk). The aged/frozen/thawed <b>lamb</b> <b>loins</b> were ground, and model sausages were formulated with 75 % aged/frozen/thawed <b>lamb</b> <b>loin,</b> 25 % water, 1. 5 % sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0. 3 % sodium tripolyphosphate. The pH and thaw/purge loss of aged/frozen/thawed <b>lamb</b> <b>loins</b> were evaluated, and protein functionality (protein solubility and emulsifying capacity), water-holding capacity and textural properties of model sausages were determined. Cooked model sausages were vacuum-packaged in a plastic bag and displayed under continuous fluorescent natural white light (3 °C± 1 °C). Colour and lipid oxidation of the cooked model sausages were evaluated on 0 and 21 d of display storage. Results Ageing prior to freezing had no impact on pH and purge/thaw loss of <b>lamb</b> <b>loins</b> and the colour of cooked sausages (p> 0. 05) made from the <b>loins.</b> <b>Lamb</b> <b>loins</b> aged for at least 3 wk prior to freezing numerically improved total and myofibrillar protein solubilities (p> 0. 05) and emulsion activity index (p = 0. 009) of meat batter, but decreased cooking loss (p = 0. 003) and lipid oxidation (p< 0. 05) of model sausages.

40|$|Changes in the {{features}} of food demand and consumption have moved from the mass consumption model towards an increasing qualitative differentiation of products and demand. This movement towards addressing consumers ’ demand for food products with more advanced quality attributes has led to increasingly complex food qualification processes and a proliferation of standards. Accompanying these changes in the agro-food system is a growing consumer concern for food safety and quality. One important attribute of ‘quality ’ is the origin of a food product. This paper focuses on lamb originating from Karoo region of South Africa and tests consumers ’ willingness {{to pay a premium}} for this specific origin attribute of the product.

40|$|Meat colour is an {{important}} criterion in the appeal of meat to consumers {{at the point of}} sale. The bright red colour of fresh beef and lamb and the pinkish colour of fresh pork are due to the oxygenation of the myoglobin pigment when the meat is exposed to air. However, exposure to air over several days causes irreversible browning and rejection of the meat by consumers. The gaseous environment in which retail cuts are stored is therefore critical to ensure a good colour over the display life. Existing packaging systems do not have a sufficiently long storage life for the additional time required for exports from Ireland to the UK or continental Europe. The objective of this project was to develop a bulk packaging system for retail cuts that would have a sufficient shelf life to be used by the Irish industry to export retail ready cuts. In conclusion, a packaging system has been developed on a laboratory scale which is capable of extending the storage life of some beef cuts, <b>lamb</b> <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> and pork loin chops. The display life of these after storage is comparable to fresh cuts. In order for this system to be commercialised {{it would have to be}} shown to work on a larger scale in a production environment.

Suffolk (S) and Texel (T) rams were mated to similar ewes to produce non-carrier crossbred S (n = 55) and T (n = 52) lambs. Lambs were finished on a high-energy diet to a target live weight of 57 kg. Pre-slaughter weight was recorded for each lamb {{prior to its}} transfer and slaughter through a commercial facility. Hot carcass weight and kidney and pelvic fat (KPF) were recorded at slaughter. Chilled carcasses were measured then fabricated into trimmed retail cuts by plant personnel. Each cut was weighed, and two <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> were collected from each carcass for later cooking. CLPG lambs had the highest dressing % (53. 6 versus 49. 8 – 50. 6; P < 0. 05). At the same cold carcass weight, CLPG lambs had larger longissimus muscle areas (19. 5 cm 2 versus 14. 0 – 15. 2 cm 2 for the rest; P < 0. 05), less KPF (0. 9 kg versus 1. 04 – 1. 13 kg; P < 0. 05), less carcass fat (P < 0. 05 for all measures), shorter carcasses (60. 7 cm versus 61. 8 – 64. 7 cm; P < 0. 05), and heavier trimmed sirloins, legs, and shoulders {{than any other group}} (a 11 P < 0. 05).

Loins were split and right and left sides were designated to receive one of two treatments: control, or marinade injection followed by topical spice rub. Following treatment, whole loins were fabricated into loin chops and displayed under retail lighting for 0, 7, and 14 days. Chops were cooked at 70 ?C at day 0 of storage WEEK 2 and WEEK 3 and evaluated by consumer panels for acceptance of palatability attributes. Consumer panel data indicated that appearance, odor, juiciness, flavor, tenderness, and overall like/dislike were higher for treated chops than for controls (P < 0. 05). Consumers rated treated chops almost twice as high as control chops for attribute flavor. However, consumers did not prefer the overall appearance of raw treated chops to the appearance of raw control chops (P < 0. 05). Microbiological data indicated that aerobic plate counts (APCs) for treated and control chops were different (P < 0. 05) at 7 and 14 d shelf life for both storage periods, with treated chops having lower mean APC than controls. Lipid oxidation was measured and an increase in shelf life days resulted in higher thiobarbituric acid test (TBA) values with treated chops having lower mean TBA values than control chops. An interaction between treatment and day was significant where day 7 and day 14 showed differences between treatment and control, with control chops having higher TBA values (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Purple rice is {{a strain}} of glutaneous rice rich in {{anthocyanins}} and γ-oryzanol. Both types of compounds are involved in antioxidant and lipid metabolism of mammals. Three experimental diet types were used which consisted approximately by half either of purple rice, white rice or corn. Diets were fed to 3 × 10 pigs growing from about 30 to 100 kg. Meat samples were investigated either as raw or cured <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> or as smoked bacon produced from the belly. Various physicochemical traits were assessed and data were evaluated by analysis of variance. Traits describing water-holding capacity (drip, thaw, and cooking losses) and tenderness (sensory grading, shear force) of the meat were mostly not significantly affected by the diet type. However, purple rice feeding of pigs resulted in lower fat and cholesterol contents of loin and smoked bacon compared to white rice, but not compared to corn feeding except of the fat content of the loin. The shelf life of the raw <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> was improved by purple rice as well. In detail, the occurrence of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances after 9 days of chilled storage was {{three to four times}} higher in the white rice and corn diets than with purple rice. The n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in the raw <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> was 9 : 1 with purple rice and clearly higher with 12 : 1 with the other diets, meat lipids.

There are not too many consumers of mutton in the Czech Republic. This kind of meat is consumed mostly during Easter, while in Anglo-Saxon countries {{it has been a}} sought-after food resource. Worlds mutton yearly consumption has been about 2 kg per capita. In the Czech Republic it is only 0. 4 kg. Meat of slaughter animals is rich in biogenic amines and polyamines, especially in spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD). Their contents in beef, pork and chicken meat have been determined previously. Literature data on mutton and lamb has been lacking for polyamines and information on biogenic amines has been very scarce. Liquid chromatography method in UPLC arrangement was used for the determination of putrescine (PUT), cadaverine (CAD), tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), histamine (HIM), tryptamine (TRM), SPD and SPM, the amines with considerable biological effects. Mutton and <b>lamb</b> <b>loin</b> (19 and 20, respectively) and leg (17 and 20, respectively) were analysed 24 hours after slaughter The samples originated from various minor breeders and they were hybrids of several breeds.

Samples from one chop were evaluated for tenderness, juiciness, chewiness, pork flavor and off flavor by a trained sensory panel using a five-point category scale. The second chop was punctured to 80 % of the original sample height using a five-point star-shaped puncture probe mounted on an Instron Universal Testing Machine. Broiled chops were analyzed for moisture and total lipid content;Mean sensory scores on a five point scale for the three phases combined were 2. 87 for juiciness, 3. 27 for tenderness, 2. 67 for chewiness, and 2. 45 for pork flavor. Mean lipid percentage was 2. 97 for raw and 3. 27 for cooked loin samples in the three combined phases. Mean moisture percentage of the cooked tissue was 65. 71 and cook loss percentage was 22. 66.

This experiment showed that feeding 2 x 10 (6) IU/d of vitamin D 3 to market lambs, callipyge or normal, raised serum Ca++ concentration, but did not increase muscle Ca++ concentration. This lack of response in muscle Ca++ was likely the reason that no differences were observed for Warner-Bratzler shear force values or troponin-T degradation data between the vitamin D 3 and control <b>loin</b> <b>chops.</b> A higher dose of vitamin D 3 may be required to improve tenderness...|$|R
40|$|Lamb meat {{has been}} commercialized in Brazil almost {{exclusively}} as a frozen product {{due to the}} longer shelf life provided by freezing when compared to refrigeration. However, {{as a result of}} the current trend of increased demand for convenience products, a need has emerged for further studies to facilitate the marketing of refrigerated lamb cuts. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of active packaging technology in extending the shelf life of <b>lamb</b> <b>loins</b> (Longissimus lumborum) stored under refrigeration (1 ± 1 ° C) when compared to the traditional vacuum packaging. For this purpose, two kinds of sachets were employed: oxygen scavenger sachet and oxygen scavenger/carbon dioxide emitter sachet. Experiments were conducted in three treatments: 1) Vacuum (Control), 2) Vacuum + oxygen scavenger sachet and 3) Vacuum + oxygen scavenger/carbon dioxide emitter sachet. Microbiological (counts of anaerobic psychrotrophs, coliform at 45 ° C, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Salmonella and lactic acid bacteria) and physical-chemical (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, objective color, pH value, water loss from cooking and shear force) analyses were carried out weekly for a total storage period of 28 days. The experiment was performed three times for all treatments. Results showed that the lamb meat remained stable with respect to the majority of the evaluated physical and chemical indexes and remained within the standards established by Brazilian legislation for pathogenic microorganisms throughout the storage period in all three packaging systems. However, all treatments presented elevated counts of anaerobic psychrotrophic microorganisms and lactic acid bacteria, reaching values above 10 (7) CFU/g at 28 days of storage. Thus, under the conditions tested, neither the oxygen scavenger sachet nor the dual function sachet (oxygen scavenger/carbon dioxide emitter) were able to extend the shelf life of refrigerated <b>lamb</b> <b>loin</b> when added to this meat vacuum packaged...|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA), a geometrical and positional isomer of {{linoleic acid}} was fed at 0. 75 % {{of the diet}} to growing-finishing pigs. Experiment 1 consisted of 92 pigs fed CLA for varying weight gain from 28 kg to a 115 kg slaughter weight. Treatments included a control diet with 0 kg gain on CLA (T 1) and CLA diets at 28 kg, 56 kg and 87 kg of gain (T 2, T 3, and T 4, respectively). Meat quality, objective and subjective, were evaluated. Compared with T 1, a linear increase was observed for subjective marbling and firmness scores with increased time on a CLA diet. When T 1 and T 4 chops were compared for other measures of meat quality, we observed an increase in Hunter b* values, an improvement in water holding capacity, {{and a decrease in}} lipid oxidation over days of retail storage due to CIA supplementation. Furthermore, no differences were observed for pH, subjective color, Hunter L* or a* values, or sensory characteristics because of CLA supplementation. Experiment 2 evaluated 64 stress-genotype (normal, carrier, positive) pigs fed 0. 75 % CLA. Subsequently, growth, performance, carcass, and meat quality characteristics were analyzed. Feed efficiency was improved while 10 th rib fat depth was decreased with CLA supplementation, regardless of genotype. Postmortem pH was lower at 3 h with CLA supplementation compared to control diet carcasses. Subjective marbling scores were significantly improved with CLA supplementation in the normal stress-free pigs. <b>Loin</b> <b>chops</b> from CLA fed pigs exhibited higher Hunter L* values over 7 d of self-service shelf storage compared to <b>loin</b> <b>chops</b> from control diet pigs. No differences were attributed to CLA supplementation for Hunter a* values or sensory panel characteristics. Results from these two experiments show that CLA supplementation can improve feed efficiency, decrease backfat, and improve certain aspects of meat quality in growing-finishing pigs at the level of 0. 75 % in the diet...|$|R
