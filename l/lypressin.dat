25|$|A {{very similar}} substance, lysine {{vasopressin}} (LVP) or <b>lypressin,</b> {{has the same}} function in pigs and is used in human AVP deficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The vasopressins are {{peptides}} {{consisting of}} nine amino acids (nonapeptides). (NB: {{the value in}} the table above of 164 amino acids is that obtained before the hormone is activated by cleavage.) [...] The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin (argipressin) is Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, with the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond and the C-terminus of the sequence converted to a primary amide. [...] Lysine vasopressin (<b>lypressin)</b> has a lysine {{in place of the}} arginine as the eighth amino acid, and is found in pigs and some related animals, whereas arginine vasopressin is found in humans.|$|E

40|$|Fluid loading (FL) before Shuttle reentry is a {{countermeasure}} {{currently in}} use by NASA {{to improve the}} orthostatic tolerance of astronauts during reentry and postflight. The fluid load consists of water and salt tablets equivalent to 32 oz (946 ml) of isotonic saline. However, {{the effectiveness of this}} countermeasure has been observed to decrease with the duration of spaceflight. The countermeasure's effectiveness may be improved by enhancing fluid retention using analogs of vasopressin such as <b>lypressin</b> (LVP) and desmopressin (dDAVP). In a computer simulation study reported previously, we attempted to assess the improvement in fluid retention obtained by the use of LVP administered before FL. The present study is concerned with the use of dDAVP. In a recent 24 -hour, 6 degree head-down tilt (HDT) study involving seven men, dDAVP was found to improve orthostatic tolerance as assessed by both lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and stand tests. The treatment restored Luft's cumulative stress index (cumulative product of magnitude and duration of LBNP) to nearly pre-bedrest level. The heart rate was lower and stroke volume was marginally higher at the same LBNP levels with administration of dDAVP compared to placebo. Lower heart rates were also observed with dDAVP during stand test, despite the lower level of cardiovascular stress. These improvements were seen with only a small but significant increase in plasma volume of approximately 3 percent. This paper presents a computer simulation analysis of some of the results of this HDT study...|$|E
