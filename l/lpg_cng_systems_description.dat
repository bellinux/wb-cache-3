40|$|Fluctuating {{fuel prices}} and {{associated}} pollution problems of largely exploited petroleum liquid fuel has stimulated {{the research on}} abundantly available gaseous fuels to keep the mobility industry intact. In the present work an air cooled diesel engine was modified suitably into a spark ignition engine incorporating electronic ignition and variable speed dependant spark timing to accommodate both <b>LPG</b> and <b>CNG</b> as fuels. Engine was optimized for stoichiometric operation on engine dynamometer. Materials of a few intricate engine components were replaced to suit <b>LPG</b> and <b>CNG</b> application. Ignition timing was mapped to work with gaseous fuels for different speeds. Compensation was done for recovering volumetric efficiency when operated with CNG by introducing more volume of air through resonator. Ignition timing was observed to be the pertinent parameter in achieving good performance with gaseous fuels under consideration. Performance and emission tests were carried out on engine dynamometer and chassis dynamometer. Under wide open throttle and at rated speed condition, {{it was observed that}} the peak pressure with LPG was lying between diesel fuel and CNG fuel operation due to slow burning nature of gaseous fuels. As compression ratio was maintained same for <b>LPG</b> and <b>CNG</b> fuel operation, low CO emissions were observed with LPG where as HC + NOx emissions were lower with CNG fuel operation.

50|$|A NOx {{adsorber}} {{is designed}} to reduce oxides of nitrogen emitted in the exhaust gas of a lean burn internal combustion engine. Lean burn engines, particularly diesels, present a special challenge to emission control system designers because of the relatively high levels of O2 (atmospheric oxygen) in the exhaust gas. The 3-way catalytic converter that has been successfully used since the 1980s on stoichiometric engines (such as fueled by petrol, <b>LPG,</b> <b>CNG,</b> or ethanol) will not function at O2 levels in excess of 1.0%, and does not function well at levels above 0.5%. Because of the increasing need to limit NOx emissions from diesel engines, technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) have been used, however EGR is of limited effectiveness and SCR requires a continuous supply of reductant to the exhaust.|$|R

The programme written from this simulation model and modified so {{can be used to}} assist in the design of a spark ignition engine for alternative fuels as well as to study many design parameters such as the effect of engine design parameter like stroke and diameter of the cylinder on the performance and exhaust emissions of spark ignition engines. In this paper, the description of three type of engines design parameters according to (stroke/diameter) which are called under square, square and over square engines using three type of fuel (gasoline, <b>LPG,</b> <b>CNG)</b> singly have been taken. The variations of power output, thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, ignition delay, temperature of exhaust gases, heat loss and the exhaust emissions (CO 2, CO, NO, O 2) by volume, were calculated for each type of engine and then comparing the results to investigate how to increase engine efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. The accuracy of the present model is confirmed by comparison with experimental result that have established by previous literatures and the results were agreement with literatures. The main results obtained from the present study shows that, the square engines (S/D= 1) can be considered as most efficient, modern and suitable design for engines running by gasoline and alternative fuels like <b>LPG</b> and <b>CNG,</b> because of higher power output due to the suitable piston area for pressure distribution.

Generally bio-diesel is the renewable fuel which is derived by chemically reacting with the sources of bio diesel like vegetable oils, animal oils, plastics, and waste automobile tyres etc. The chemical reaction requires a catalyst usually a strong acid or base such as sulfuric acid, sodium or potassium hydroxide, and produces a new chemical compounds called methyl or ethyl esters of the vegetable crude oil which is called as bio-diesel.
