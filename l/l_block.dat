40|$|To {{clarify the}} afferent {{pathways}} from intervertebral discs to {{dorsal root ganglia}} (DRGs) in humans we evaluated the effect of an upper and lower spinal nerve block on discogenic low back pain. Patients suffering from discogenic low back pain originating from the L 4 / 5 or L 5 /S 1 intervertebral disc received a spinal nerve root <b>block</b> (<b>L</b> 2 nerve <b>block</b> group: n= 34, L 4 or <b>L</b> 5 nerve <b>block</b> group: n= 34). Lidocaine (1. 5 ml of 1 Descriptionolution) was administrated to L 2, L 4, or L 5 spinal nerves. In both groups, spinal nerve blocks were significantly effective in alleviating discogenic low back pain (P< 0. 05). Fifteen minutes after the block, the average visual analogue pain scale score decreased from 8. 0 to 4. 3 (<b>L</b> 2 root <b>block</b> group) and from 7. 8 to 3. 4 (L 4 or <b>L</b> 5 root <b>block</b> group). The average effective period was significantly longer in the <b>L</b> 2 root <b>block</b> group (13 days) than in the L 4 or <b>L</b> 5 root <b>block</b> group (8 days) (P< 0. 05). The upper and lower spinal nerves appear to include sensory afferent nerves from the L 4 / 5 or L 5 /S 1 intervertebral disc.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{originally}} envisaged as a 1.3 L and 1.5 L four-cylinder, with a 2.0 L six-cylinder created by adding two cylinders to the 1.3 <b>L</b> <b>block.</b> However, as development continued it appeared the 1.3-litre E-series {{would not have}} any huge benefits over the 1.3 L A-series being developed at that time from the existing 1.1 L, so the smaller E-series was dropped. The result was a saving in development capital for BMC, but also meant the six-cylinder had to be developed from the 1.5 <b>L</b> <b>block,</b> creating its unusual engine size of 2227 cc.|$|E

40|$|New neurons are {{generated}} in adult mammalians and {{may contribute to}} repairing the brain after injury. Here, we show {{that the number of}} new neurons in the dentate gyrus of adult rats increased in cerebral ischemic stroke and correlated with activation of the cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB). Inhibition of endogenous CREB by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of CREB (CREB-S 133 A or CREB-R 287 <b>L)</b> <b>blocked</b> ischemia-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult rats, whereas expression of constitutively active CREB, VP 16 -CREB, increased the number of new neurons.
