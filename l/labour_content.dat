The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the indirect labour input into the commodity. Putting together the direct and indirect labour inputs, one finally gets the total labour input into the commodity, which may also be called the total embodied labour in it, or its direct and indirect <b>labour</b> <b>contents.</b>|$|R

As far as this measurement capacity of labour is concerned, we try to demonstrate, that, from a theoretical point of view, the introduction of more efficient production techniques {{of goods and services}} produces an increase in the “prices divided by their corresponding values” ratio, when the wage is fixed, and, in addition, allows, a lower set of prices at the previous – lower - rate of profit. Current measures of inflation do not detect such price increases and normally interpret price changes – often bundled together with more product features -, as a price decrease. Furthermore, when two economies with different innovation levels, interchange products and services, the one with more intense innovation gives less labour time per unit of price to the other and receives a quantity of labour time proportionally higher than before.

5000|$|In Sraffian theory, {{the value}} of a {{commodity}} [...] "contains" [...] both the average labour directly involved in making it ("direct labour") and past labour contained in the materials from which it is made ("indirect labour" [...] or [...] "dated labour"). After some pioneering work by various scholars in the 1960s, Luigi Pasinetti provided a methodological foundation for measuring the <b>labour</b> <b>content</b> of commodities, in this sense, which was developed further by Anwar Shaikh, Eduardo Ochoa, and Lefteris Tsoulfidis. In Marx's developed theory, however, {{the value of}} the commodity represents the average labour currently required to make it, given {{the current state of the}} whole production complex - it is the current social valuation (the replacement cost) of that commodity. This is a synchronic valuation, not a diachronic one. This was not so clearly realized during the 20th century, because economists could not grasp how, in the course of Marx's dialectical story, the meaning of the operative concept of value itself could undergo some important changes. Because Marx's developed concept of value differs from the simplified concept of value, economists thought that Marx's theory was formally inconsistent.|$|E

Beller lays out the case {{that it is not}} obsolete but that both it and our historical moment have been misunderstood. For Beller, Marx' observation that value is dead labour - alienated life - more comprehensively grasps the nature of value globally now than ever before, although value-creating labour today, which includes, for the most privileged strata of workers, so much leisure activity, entertainment consumption and unremunerated (unwaged, unsalaried) attention labour (what is often called [...] "playbor") - labour conditions very different from those the international division of labour and polarizing class divisions assign to the poorest strata of the global working class - has to be understood as taking quite diverse concrete forms. This is in keeping, Beller argues, with Marx' conception of abstract labour, not a phenomenon requiring the transcendence of that analysis.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{theories}} on human capital, labour market segmentation and discrimination fail to fully explain gender gaps—for example, the large gender gap in elite occupations where women apparently possess high labour market power. This article seeks to extend our understanding, through {{the interaction between}} <b>labour</b> segmentation, regulation <b>content</b> and regulation distance, the last referring {{to the extent to}} which employment of particular workers is (un) regulated, including by collective agreements, legislation or other instruments. Regulation distance encompasses a continuum from ‘regulation proximity’ to ‘market proximity’. A greater reliance on the ‘market’ does not necessarily remove pay distortions; rather, it might increase their impact through the mechanism of gendered norms. Empirical evidence is drawn from studies in several countries, most commonly Australia. This approach more clearly specifies the roles of under-valuation, labour segmentation, group norms and human and social capital; illuminates public sector and union effects; explains why the gender gap is greatest for a group of women with the most labour market power; and illustrates some non-pay aspects of gendered experience at work.
