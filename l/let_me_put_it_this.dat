No matter how ingenious, imaginative or artfully put, unless interpretive methodologies are tied to the original intent of the framers, they have no more basis in the Constitution than the latest football scores. To be sure, even the most conscientious effort to adhere to the original intent of the framers of our Constitution is flawed, as all methodologies and human institutions are; but at least originalism has the advantage of being legitimate and, I might add, impartial.|$|E

5000|$|At the time, {{claims were}} made by media outlets that Vikernes was {{associated}} with theistic Satanism.

But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way: There was one person who started it. I was not found guilty of burning the Fantoft stave church, but anyway, that was what triggered the whole thing. That was the 6th of June and everyone linked it to Satanism ... What everyone overlooked was that on the 6th June, 793, in Lindesfarne in Britain was the site of the first known Viking raid in history, with Vikings from Hordaland, which is my county ...

[...] Daydream proved {{to be one of}} the bestselling and most acclaimed albums of 1995. When the Grammy Award nominees were announced, and Daydream was nominated for six different awards, critics began raving how it would be [...] "cleaning up" [...] that year. The 38th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 28, 1996 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Carey, being a multiple award nominee, was one of the headlining performers. Together with Boyz II Men, she sang a live rendition of [...] "One Sweet Day", to a very positive response. However, as the award winners were announced one by one, Carey watched as her name was not called up even once. Daydream had lost all of its six nominations, shocking most critics who branded it the [...] "album of the year". With every passing loss, the television cameras continued to zoom on Carey's face, who was finding it more difficult to retain her smile. By the end of the night, Carey had not won a single award. The disappointment on her face was painfully obvious. While Carey was nominated again the following year, she did not perform again until the 2006 ceremony, when she was nominated for eight awards (winning three) for The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{enforcement}} of EC environmental law by decentralized authorities. Obviously {{this is a}} complicated matter. A recent study of the Commission of the European Community, for example, shows {{that in many cases}} swimming water in the Netherlands does not meet the requirements laid down in the EC Bath Water Directive. According to a report in the Dutch newspaper NRC-Handelsblad of 15 june 1995, the Commission stated that only two thirds of the Dutch swimming water is in accordance with the required minimum quality of the directive. This failure {{is a good example of}} the problems relating to enforcement of the environmental standards laid down in EC directives and regulations. Nevertheless, I want to discuss the following question: what are the requirements imposed by EC law on decentralized authorities enforcing EC Environmental law? How must decentralized authorities respond to an infringement of European environmental law? This is the central question of this article. Or <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> way, some aspects of this question will be discussed. It is impossible, of course, to answer this question completely in a short paper. The following remark must be made. Dealing with the subject of the enforcement of Community environmental law I will, as a Dutch legal researcher, focus on examples of Dutch law. The structure of this article is as follows. First, the meaning of some definitions will be explained. Secondly, I will make some general remarks on the role of decentralized authorities in EC law. Thirdly, the general requirements for the enforcement of EC law will be discussed. In the fourth place, I will examine to what extent and in what way decentralized authorities are obliged to monitor compliance with EC environmental law. How can they exercise control over the observance of EC environmental standards? In the fifth place, the sanctions imposed by decentralized authorities will be discussed. Finally, I will draw some conclusions...|$|E
