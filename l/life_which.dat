5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half <b>life,</b> <b>which</b> allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E

5|$|Bernoulli's work {{influenced}} {{many contemporary}} and subsequent mathematicians. Even the afterthought-like tract on calculus has been quoted frequently; most notably by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. Jacob's program of applying his art of conjecture to the matters of practical <b>life,</b> <b>which</b> was terminated by {{his death in}} 1705, was continued by his nephew Nicolaus Bernoulli, after having taken parts verbatim out of Ars Conjectandi, for his own dissertation entitled De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure which was published already in 1709. Nicolas finally edited and assisted in the publication of Ars conjectandi in 1713. Later Nicolaus also edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.|$|E

5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in <b>Life,</b> <b>which</b> listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E

5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A <b>Life,</b> <b>which</b> emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing a}} movie based on Riefenstahl's <b>life</b> <b>which</b> would star actress Jodie Foster. The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any scenes to which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted Sharon Stone to play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E

50|$|His {{work was}} indebted to de work of Jan Davidszoon de Heem, a {{prominent}} Dutch still life painter who {{was active in}} Antwerp from the mid-1630s. His brother-in-law Andries Benedetti also painted large still <b>lifes,</b> <b>which</b> followed the innovations of de Heem. As a result it is sometimes difficult to distinguish compositions by de Coninck from work by Benedetti.|$|R
50|$|Van Boucle painted many {{works that}} allude to wealth and luxury. These {{elements}} are visible in his still <b>lifes,</b> <b>which</b> show the luster {{of fruits and}} vegetables that contrast with the glow of jewelry, silverware and other objects.

5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} {{working on a}} key {{component}} of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half <b>life,</b> <b>which</b> made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E
