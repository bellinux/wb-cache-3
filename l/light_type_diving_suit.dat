50|$|Standard diving dress (also {{known as}} hard-hat or copper hat equipment, or heavy gear) is a <b>type</b> of <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> that was {{formerly}} {{used for all}} underwater work which required more than breath-hold duration, and included marine salvage, civil engineering, pearl shell diving and other commercial diving work, and similar naval diving applications, though has largely been superseded by lighter and more comfortable equipment.|$|R
40|$|Recently, a new <b>type</b> of <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> fabric called thenno-metal {{neoprene}} {{was introduced}} {{on the market}} It consists of a closed-cell neoprene with the inner cloth lining coated with metal. The metal-coated lining is claimed 10 act as a reflective barrier that minimises radiative heat loss from the body and hence, improves the thermal properties of the fabric by 25 % over uncoated neoprene. The objective of the present shldy was 10 verify {{the claims of the}} manufacturer by comparing the insulation of two thermo-metal neoprenes (titanium and stainless steel coated) to the current Canadian Forces (CF) Arctic <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> neoprene in a dry environment at 1 atmosphere and in a wet environment under pressures 10 simulate dives up to 100 m...|$|R
25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able to assess what <b>type</b> of <b>diving</b> exposure <b>suit</b> is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that it is the right size, and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, dry suit skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, dry suit skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the dry suit safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of <b>diving</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Experience {{gained in}} the {{development}} of the <b>Type</b> I <b>diving</b> bell had greatly helped the development of QSZ-I, and this planned second stage of development began even before the completion of the <b>Type</b> I <b>diving</b> bell. Development of QSZ-I atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> (ADS) took four years, from 1982 to 1986, and unlike its predecessor <b>Type</b> I <b>diving</b> bell that had to go through half a decade of civilian use to prove its worth, QSZ-1 ADS was immediately pressed into service in 1987 after its completion.

50|$|By {{inflating}} the BC at the surface, {{the conscious}} diver {{may be able}} to easily float face-up, depending on their equipment configuration choices. A fatigued or unconscious diver can be made to float face up on the surface by adjustment of their buoyancy and weights so the buoyancy raises the top and front of the diver's body and the weights act on the lower and back of the body. An inflated horse-collar BC always provides this orientation, but an inflated vest or wing may float the diver face-down if the center of buoyancy is behind the centre of gravity. This floating orientation is generally considered undesirable and can be minimized by relocation of some of the weights further to the rear, and using higher density cylinders (typically steel), which also move the center of mass towards the back of the diver. The BC type can also be selected with this factor in mind, selecting a style with a center of buoyancy further forward when filled, as this has the same net effect. Any or all of these options can be utilized to trim the system out to its desired characteristics and many factors can contribute, such as the number and position of <b>diving</b> cylinders, the <b>type</b> of <b>diving</b> <b>suit,</b> the position and size of stage cylinders, {{the size and shape of}} the diver's body and the wearing of ankle weights, or additional dive equipment. Each of these influence a diver's preferred orientation under the water (horizontal) and at the surface (vertical) to some degree.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>suits</b> can {{be divided}} into two classes: [...] "soft" [...] or ambient {{pressure}} <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> - examples are wetsuits, dry suits, semi-dry <b>suits</b> and <b>dive</b> skins, and [...] "hard" [...] or atmospheric pressure <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> - armored suits that keep the diver at atmospheric pressure at any depth within the operating range of the suit.|$|R

An exterior version of the great searchlight is affixed to the newly remodeled submarine; and finally, newly strengthened <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> and a special <b>type</b> of <b>diving</b> bell have been built for the expedition.|$|R
25|$|A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> is {{a garment}} or device {{designed}} to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving dress or atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suit).</b> {{but in most cases}} applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.|$|R
