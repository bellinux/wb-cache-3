"Sometimes, indeed, the {{neighbours}} {{thought it}} strange {{that the rich}} Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the wonderful <b>things</b> the Miller used {{to say about the}} unselfishness of true friendship.|$|R
5000|$|... "Love You To" [...] was {{the third}} track the Beatles {{recorded}} for Revolver, after [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to Get You Into My Life". Rodriguez comments that [...] "Love You To" [...] "made explicit the Indian influence implicit throughout the entire album", as songs such as [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to Get You Into My Life", together with the non-album single tracks [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and [...] "Rain", all incorporate drone sounds or otherwise display the limited harmonic movement that typifies the genre. In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: [...] "We were <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> sorts of <b>things,</b> Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, {{and most of it}} made its way onto our records." ...|$|R
60|$|In the calm, still watches of that night, {{as he lay}} sleepless {{upon his}} bed and saw things without heat, there crept a change into his mental attitude. He {{reviewed}} all the evidence that had led her to her conclusions, and {{he was forced to}} confess that she was in some measure justified of them. If she had wronged him, he had wronged her yet more. For years she had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the poisonous <b>things</b> that were said of him by his enemies--and his arrogance had made him not a few. She had disregarded all because she loved him; her relations with her brother had become strained on that account, yet now, <b>all</b> this returned <b>to</b> crush her; repentance played its part in her cruel belief that it was by his hand Peter Godolphin had fallen. It must almost seem to her that in a sense she had been a party to his murder by the headstrong course to which she had kept in loving the man her brother hated.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternate}} theory, {{that two}} tapes {{of the same}} performance were edited together for The Fillmore Concerts release, has been posited by rock photographer Kirk West on the Allman Brothers website forum:the problem with liz reed is this (and i know this to be true because i've spent months in the polygram tape vaults {{over the years and}} have handled and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of these <b>things),</b> there is a tape in the vaults that is a [...] "compilation reel", that is the selected versions of several songs and on it is a version of the liz reed from the 13th early set. this tape was included in the shipment of tape from the tape vault to the mixing studio where tom worked. this tape is not clearly marked as a [...] "comp tape" [...] but upon close investigation it proved to be just that back in 91-92. as i said, i had picked all these alt tracks in the winter of 91-92 and was on the road when tom did the mixing. tom did splice the front end of liz reed from one tape to the back end of liz reed from a second tape. unfortunately, it was two tapes of the same performance of liz reed, that of the 13th early show. in the process of remixing these tapes in 92 tom did hear things that he hadn't heard before, he says that exact thing in the liner notes.|$|R
60|$|It is {{this life}} of simple, unchanging actions and of habits that are like instincts, of hard labour in sun and {{wind and rain}} from day to day, with its weekly break and rest, and of but few comforts and no luxuries, which serves to bind man and wife so closely. And the longer their life goes on {{together}} the closer and more unbreakable the union grows. They are growing old: old friends and companions have died or left them; their children have married and gone away and have their own families and affairs, so that the old folks at home are little remembered, and <b>to</b> <b>all</b> others they have become of little consequence in the world. But {{they do not know}} it, for they are together, cherishing the same memories, speaking of the same old, familiar things, and their lost friends and companions, their absent, perhaps estranged, children, are with them still in mind as in the old days. The past is with them more than the present, to give an undying interest to life; for they share it, and it is only when one goes, when the old wife gets the tea ready and goes mechanically to the door to gaze out, knowing that her tired man will come in no more to take his customary place and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the <b>things</b> she has stored up in her mind during the day to tell him; and when the tired labourer comes in at dusk to find no old wife waiting to give him his tea and talk to him while he refreshes himself, he all at once realizes his position; he finds himself cut off from the entire world, from all of his kind. Where are they all? The enduring sympathy of that one soul that was with him till now had kept him in touch with life, had made it seem unchanged and unchangeable, and with that soul has vanished the old, sweet illusion as well as all ties, all common, human affection. He is desolate, indeed, alone in a desert world, and it is not strange that in many and many a case, even in that of a man still strong, untouched by disease and good for another decade or two, the loss, the awful solitude, has proved too much for him.|$|R
