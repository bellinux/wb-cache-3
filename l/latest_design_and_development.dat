2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} {{has moved to}} improve engineering design. Generation IV reactors are now in <b>late</b> stage <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> to improve safety, sustainability, efficiency, and cost. Key to the <b>latest</b> <b>designs</b> {{is the concept of}} passive nuclear safety. [...] Passive nuclear safety does not require operator actions or electronic feedback in order to shut down safely {{in the event of a}} particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a loss of coolant or loss of coolant flow). This is in contrast to older-yet-common reactor designs, where the natural tendency for the reaction was to accelerate rapidly from increased temperatures. [...] In such a case, cooling systems must be operative to prevent meltdown. [...] Past design mistakes like Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. New reactors with passive nuclear safety eliminate this failure mode.|$|R
40|$|System {{stakeholders}} fail {{to engage}} with security until comparatively <b>late</b> in the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> process. User Experience artefacts like personas and scenarios create this engagement, but creating and contextualising them is difficult without real-world, empirical data; such data cannot be easily elicited from disengaged stakeholders. This paper presents an approach for engaging stakeholders in the elicitation and specification of security requirements at a late-stage of a system's design; this approach relies on assumption-based personas and scenarios, which are aligned with security and requirements analysis activities. We demonstrate this approach by describing how {{it was used to}} elicit security requirements for a medical research portal...|$|R

Yet there remain few if any holistic frameworks to manage this process. In this paper we present such a framework, R 4. It coordinates and relates the different perspectives that inform the entire SWA <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> process. We base R 4 on SWA <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> framework requirements derived from the literature. We formulate and relate four basic perspectives, the User, Culture, Technology and Business spheres and define stages, (Re) <b>Design,</b> Realization <b>and</b> Reformation (RRR), of the entire SWA <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> lifecycle. We then suggest basic SWA <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> guidelines derived from our R 4 framework and develop an example methodology based on that framework.

40|$|ABSTRACT:In today's highly {{competitive}} business environment, introducing {{a new product}} with expectation of high level of customer satisfaction is an intricate and immense challenge to the companies. Concurrent Engineering {{has a great deal}} of importance in <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> of new products in Indian automobile industry and is posing a big challenge to Indian firms in the wake of globalization. Success of concurrent engineering demands that major areas of product <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> of an organization are kept in focus concomitantly. The aim of the paper is to assess and establish the benefits of concurrent engineering in the new product <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> The survey presents its evaluation based on the data analysis using cumulative weighed average with the help of primary data which was collected through a pre-tested questionnaire. The findings reveal that the two wheeler manufacturing companies in India are realizing maximum benefits with the implementation of the concurrent engineering in new product <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> The research further recommends that companies must focus on weak areas of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> in order to enhance the productivity...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{preliminary}} research effort towards an effective computer support environment for the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). We first identify the characteristics of MEMS product <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> processes <b>and</b> examine the state-of-the-art of MEMS CAD and simulation systems. We then propose a function-(environment-effect) -behavior-(principle-state) -form (FEEBPSF) framework based on the NIST core product model and its extensions for modeling MEMS products, and apply the OESM (open embedded system model) developed to model information and knowledge for embedded MEMS <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> Moreover, in order to tackle the knowledgeintensive tasks of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> for MEMS products, we develop a general and flexible knowledge repository, called KR-MEMS, based on the FEEBPSF framework and the UML/XML model, and integrate KR-MEMS into a web-based MEMS design support system.
