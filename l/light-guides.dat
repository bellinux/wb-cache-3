This advantage is heightened in the dry and sunny tropical regions where the sun rises to very high altitudes and often the hours of sunshine last throughout the whole day. Hollow <b>light-guides</b> with very high inner specular reflectances can transport sunbeams downward into the windowless building core very effectively. Due to the tube's diameter and length and multiple reflections, complex illuminance patterns are produced {{on the underside of}} the tube, i. e. on top of the glazed ceiling aperture that illuminates the interior space or its working plane.

The unit of wedge-shaped LG combined with a light-emitting diode (LED) light-bar was designed and fabricated to collimate the extraction light within a narrow angular extent. Based on the edge lighting approach, the volume of backlight system can be reduced down to 25 mm without sacrifice of the optical behavior. As a result, 2750 nits average luminance subject to 50 % duty cycle and 83 % uniformity can be achieved. The leakages into the consecutive adjacent blocks were well suppressed to 11. 86 %.

It can extendthe conventional planar microlens array to a three dimensional curved surface. Thenon-planar surface has micro-post array patterns in resist. It can further be electroforming tomake a mold insert. The three dimensional lithography includes the prototype fabrication forexperiments to verify its feasibility. Large sizes of <b>light-guide</b> plate will be the practicalobject. Different geometric patterns will be studied in the new lithography process andformed on a roller with micro patterns. We will also explore new microlens array forenhance <b>light-guide</b> efficiency. The innovative merit of this plan is to explore new threedimensional lithography on a three dimensional structure. The planar patterns on the maskcan be transferred onto a non-planar structure. It is indeed required for a future large size flatpanel display. The roller type microlens array mold insert can be further used for light-guideplate formation in large size flat panel display. 本研究案為新世代LCD 背光源與導光模組設計與製程開發總計畫之子計畫四，針對新世代LCD 導光模組需之元件製程做研究，第一年研發多顆LED 端緣式光源之新型微透鏡陣列結構，以微透鏡陣列之光學結構應用於導光板，為新一代高亮度與全彩面板之趨勢，採用LIGA-like(類光刻鑄模製程) 開發高填充率(fill factor) 與漸變階梯式(gradation step) 微透鏡陣列，具有創新與獨特之做法。高填充率鏡片陣列，在於增加單位面積之鏡片比率，增加鏡片結構之深寬比(height-aspect-ratio) 與鏡片填充率，有助於LED 光源傳播效能。第二年研發單顆LED 角落式光源之新型微透鏡陣列結構，經由漸變階梯式微透鏡陣列，擬在開發面板中形成高低漸變型態之微透鏡陣列，靠近光源端為較低鏡片，較遠離光源處具有較高鏡片，以形成均光性與高導光率，達到能以最少數目LED 顆數(單顆) 進行光源傳播。第三年開發以滾壓式轉印模具之製程， 超大尺寸之面板得以運用滾輪式模具轉印光學鏡片，面板尺寸可比由滾輪圓周大小，經光阻塗佈，UV 光轉印設計之微透鏡陣列，經電鑄金屬成型為一可轉印之模仁/模具，需開發立體式光阻塗佈機，立體曝光微影機台，可以將光罩圖形之微光學點陣，複製到平面製程所無法製作的圓柱狀基材上，配合大尺寸精密電鑄，可製成所設計之滾輪式微透鏡陣列模仁，以因應平面顯示器之導光面板成型需求...|$|R

40|$|Dosimetry {{with plastic}} scintillators is an {{interesting}} alternative for the measurement of the absorbed dose. A scintillator does not disturb the radiation field due to its mass absorption coefficients and its mass stopping powers which are water-equivalent {{in a wide range}} of energies. Furthermore, plastic scintillation dosimeters provide a fast and direct reading of the measuring value combined with a high spatial resolution. In a set-up described so far the light produced by the scintillators was transported via <b>light-guides</b> to single-channel or multi-channel photomultipliers to be transformed into an electrical current read out by pico-amperemeters. The use of photomultipliers becomes expensive and complicated for a dosimeter system with many parallel channels.

To understand how signal integration in PCs occurs and how subtle changes in the modulation of PC firing lead to adjustment of motor behaviors, {{it is important to}} precisely record PC firing in vivo and to control modulatory pathways in a spatio-temporal manner. Combining optogenetic and multi-electrode approaches, we established a new method to integrate <b>light-guides</b> into a multi-electrode system.

40|$|We are {{developing}} thin tile scintillator detectors with silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) readout {{for use in}} a multi-layer fast-neutron tracker. The tracker is based on interleaved Timepix and plastic scintillator layers. The thin 15 × 15 × 2 mm plastic scintillators require suitable optical readout in order to detect and measure the energy lost by energetic protons that have been recoiled by fast neutrons. Our first prototype used dual SiPMs, coupled to opposite edges of the scintillator tile using <b>light-guides.</b> An alternative readout geometry was designed in an effort to increase the fraction of scintillation light detected by the SiPMs. The new prototype uses a larger SiPM array to cover the entire top face of the tile.

40|$|The self-action {{features}} of wave packets propagating in a two-dimensional system of equidistantly arranged fibers are studied analytically and numerically {{on the basis}} of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Self-consistent equations for the characteristic scales of a Gaussian wave packet are derived {{on the basis of}} the variational approach, which are proved numerically for powers P < 10 P_cr exceeding slightly the critical one for self-focusing. At higher powers, the wave beams become filamented, and their amplitude is limited due to nonlinear breaking of the interaction between neighbor <b>light-guides.</b> This make impossible to collect a powerful wave beam into the single light-guide. The variational analysis show the possibility of adiabatic self-compression of soliton-like laser pulses in the process of their three-dimensional self-focusing to the central light-guide. However, the further increase of the field amplitude during self-compression leads to the longitudinal modulation instability development and formation of a set of light bullets in the central fiber. In the regime of hollow wave beams, filamentation instability becomes predominant. As a result, it becomes possible to form a set of light bullets in optical fibers located on the ring...|$|E

40|$|Segmented quartz {{windows are}} a concept to build larger windows for {{receivers}} {{that require a}} closed aperture. Reflection losses are a significant loss factor for such solar receivers. Without any additional measures, the reflection loss can reach about 12 %. One important measure to improve transmission is the application of anti-reflective coatings, which is beneficial in any case. Another option is modifying the window geometry, especially the edge surfaces of the glass segments. A certain fraction of the reflection losses are caused by a <b>light-guide</b> effect in the glass body, for rays entering through the front surface. Changing the cut surfaces in a way reducing the <b>light-guide</b> effect can significantly improve transmission of a segmented window. Several possible configurations are evaluated and discussed.

40|$|The task of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the possibilities of using micro-structuring {{on the surface of}} thin <b>light-guides</b> to efficiently couple light from top-emitting LEDs into such <b>light-guides.</b> Areas of application are backlighting for LCD TV and flexible light emitting layers for lighting purposes. The micro-structures considered are prisms and pyramids. The micro-structures can be {{on the same side of}} light-guide as the LEDs or on the opposite side. When located on the opposite side, the micro-structures are coated with a specular reflecting layer or with a diffuse reflecting layer. The LEDs can either be in optical contact with the light-guide or not in optical contact. Optical ray-tracing software package Light-Tools is used for all ray-tracing simulations of these geometries. In simulations, a two-step approach is taken: Firstly, we build in Light-Tools a simple model of an LED in proximity to a micro-structured light-guide in order to ascertain which geometry is most likely to show a high in-coupling efficiency. In the next step, we made a more elaborate and more accurate model of the most promising geometries. The results of these simulations show that, for micro-structures that are located on the light-guide on the side opposite to the LEDs, a diffuse reflecting layer (i. e. a Lambertian scatterer) is more useful than a specular reflecting layer (i. e. a mirror). Also, in general, the prisms structures perform better than the pyramid structures. The highest efficiency reached in the simulations is 60 % for Model I 1   in which the light source is not in optical contact with the light guide and the mirror is on the opposite side of the light guide. Compared to the result reported in a previous paper, the incoupling efficiency improvement is 8 %. We also looked into using Retro-reflection Films for improving the in-coupling efficiency. Several prototypes with a Retro-reflection Film were made and tested in the laboratory. Measurements were performed for three thicknesses of the light guide: 0. 25 mm, 0. 5 mm and 1 mm. The best in-coupling efficiencies measured are 37 % for a 0. 25 mm thick light guide, 53. 1 % for a 0. 5 mm thick light guide and 57. 1 % for a 1 mm thick light guide. Compared to the samples without Retro-reflection Film, the best Retro-reflection Film results in a 7 % increase for the 0. 25 mm thick light guide, 6. 2 % increase for the 0. 5 mm case and 2. 8 % increase for the 1 mm case, respectively...|$|E
