Ernest had already questioned father's policy of having socialists and labor leaders at his house, and of openly attending socialist meetings; and father had only laughed at him for his pains. As for myself, I was learning much from this contact with the working-class leaders and thinkers. I was seeing {{the other side of}} the shield.

60|$|That night Buck {{faced the}} great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly {{in the midst}} of the white plain; and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and Francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he {{recovered}} from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was <b>learning</b> <b>fast),</b> and they let him go his way unmolested.|$|E

There was no other means of {{independence}} open to me; and I had a dream, I have it still, that there, if anywhere, I might do my work. You told me that I might become a great actress: I have set my heart on becoming one; on learning to move the hearts of men, till the time comes when I can tell them, show them, in living flesh and blood, upon the stage, the secrets of a slave's sorrows, and that slave a woman. The time has not come for that yet here: but I have had my success already, more than I could have expected; and not only in Canada, but in the States. I have been at New York, acting to crowded houses. Ah, when they applauded me, how I longed to speak! to pour out my whole soul to them, and call upon them, as men, to--. But that will come in time. I have found a friend, who has promised to write dramas especially for me. Merely republican ones at first; in which I can give full vent to my passion, and hurl forth the eternal laws of liberty, which their consciences may--must--at last, apply for themselves. But soon, he says, we shall be able to dare to approach the real subject, if not in America, still in Europe; and then, I trust, the coloured actress will stand forth as the championess of her race, of all who are oppressed, in every capital in Europe, save, alas! Italy and the Austria who crushes her. I have taken, I should tell you, an Italian name. It was better, I thought, to hide my African taint, forsooth, for awhile. So the wise New Yorkers have been feting, as Maria Cordifiamma, the white woman (for am I not fairer than many an Italian signora?), whom they would have looked upon as an inferior being under the name of Marie Lavington: though there is finer old English blood running in my veins, from your native Berkshire, they say, than in any a Down-Easter's who hangs upon my lips.

This system forms part of a framework which is extended by adding a self organizing map based affordance learning system. This affordance system learns the correlations between perceived object features and relevant motor outputs expressed {{in the form of}} synergies, and comes to guide grasping of an object by predicting the appropriate synergy outputs for a given object.

40|$|Abstract—We present here {{a system}} capable of {{learning}} to extract the correct comprehension and production of personal pronouns and proper nouns during Human-Robot or Human-Human interactions. We use external 3 D spatial and acoustic sensors with the robot iCub to allow the system to learn the proper mapping between different pronouns and names to their properties in different interaction contexts. The properties are Subject (Su), Speaker (Sp), Addressee (Ad) and Agent (Ag). A fast mapping system is used to extract correlation between the different properties. After a learning phase, the robot is {{able to find the}} missing property when only 3 out of 4 are known, or at least to discriminate which word cannot be used to be the lacking property.

40|$|Long {{conduction}} {{delays in}} the nervous system prevent the accurate control of movements by feedback control alone. We present a new, biologically plausible cerebellar model to study how fast arm movements can be executed {{in spite of these}} delays. To provide a realistic test-bed of the cerebellar neural model, we embed the cerebellar network in a simulated biological motor system comprising a spinal cord model and a six-muscle two-dimensional arm model. We argue that if the trajectory errors are detected at the spinal cord level, memory traces in the cerebellum can solve the temporal mismatch problem between e€erent motor commands and delayed error signals. Moreover, learning is made stable by the inclusion of the cerebello-nucleo-olivary loop in the model. It is shown that the cerebellar network implements a nonlinear predictive regulator by learning part of the inverse dynamics of the plant and spinal circuit. After <b>learning,</b> <b>fast</b> accurate reaching movements can be generated...|$|E
