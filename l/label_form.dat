40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{clustering}} based classification method and apply it in network anomaly detection. A set of labeled training data consisting of normal and attack instances are divided into clusters which are represented by their representative profiles consisting of attribute-value pairs for selected subset of attributes. Each category of attack and normal instances are broken down into a set of clusters using a training algorithm based on supervised classification algorithm. The cluster profiles together with their class <b>label</b> <b>form</b> rules for labeling unseen test instances. Methods for clustering, training and prediction are provided. The proposed method is evaluated using real life TUIDS Intrusion datasets. Evaluation results on KDD 1999 datasets showed good performance in comparison to results produced by decision tree counterparts. The method presented can be utilized for classification jobs in any other domain. Povzetek: Predstavljena je metoda za identifikacijo anomalij v omrežju. ...|$|E
