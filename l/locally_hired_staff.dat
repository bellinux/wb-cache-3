2500|$|Hussein is an Iraqi {{citizen and}} shopkeeper who in 2003 {{was living with}} his family in Fallujah, where he sold cell phones and computers.

50|$|Virtually {{all of the}} <b>locally</b> <b>hired</b> {{employees}} at the U.S. Embassy to East Germany (1977-1990) were not German, but were from other countries — a group sometimes still called TCNs (third country nationals).

50|$|AIT is a {{non-profit}} corporation {{incorporated in the}} District of Columbia on 16 January 1979 after the US established full diplomatic relations with the PRC on January 1, 1979. Following the authorization of the Taiwan Relations Act, the Department of State, through a non-official contract with AIT, provides guidance and some funding in its operations. Like other U.S. missions abroad, AIT is staffed by employees of the Department of State and other agencies of the United States, {{as well as by}} <b>locally</b> <b>hired</b> <b>staff.</b> Prior to a 2002 amendment to the Foreign Service Act (Section 503 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended by the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003), United States government employees were required to resign from government service for their period of assignment to AIT. According to Section 12 (a) of the Taiwan Relations Act, agreements conducted by AIT have to be reported to Congress, just as other international agreements concluded by United States and governments with which it has diplomatic relations. Thus, while relations between the US and Taiwan through AIT are conducted on an informal basis, the US government still treats the relationship within the same confines as with other states with formal diplomatic relations.|$|E

40|$|After {{years of}} self-imposed and {{externally}} imposed isolation, Myanmar is now {{opening up to}} the outside world. The Myanmar government is looking to exploit opportunities arising from the growth in tourism, with a main aim of promoting growth in other sectors, during the early phase of the country’s democratisation process. This development is taking place {{at the intersection of}} two highly problematized processes of cultural, social and economic change – development and tourism. Discursive practices are explored throughout the thesis, with an aim of uncovering some of the mechanisms that can be said to constitute this part of Myanmar’s development. By exploring the strategies applied by both expatriate consultants and <b>locally</b> <b>hired</b> <b>staff,</b> the thesis aims at uncovering what space of agency the tourism development discourse offer different actors. Investigating how the perceived “universal” notion of heritage diverge and converge with local understandings of heritage as rooted in daily life, the thesis aims at revealing some of the knowledge practices engaged in a specific tourism development project...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that around 40 % of aid workers develop a psychological disorder (such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder) either while on assignment or shortly after returning home [Lovell, 1997; Eriksson et al., 2001]. Good briefing [Gamble & Lovell-Hawker, 2004] and debriefing may significantly reduce this. An effective debriefing procedure may be key to reducing the incidence of post traumatic stress symptoms – a recent study showed that where there was no debriefing process, 24 % of returning aid workers went on to develop post traumatic stress symptoms, compared to only 7 % of those who received personal debriefing [Lovell-Hawker, 2002 b]. This evidence is contrary to claims that debriefing after traumatic events is unhelpful [e. g. McNally et al., 2003]. However, the claims that debriefing is unhelpful are based on a handful of studies in which a very short (20 – 60 minute) session of ‘debriefing ’ was offered, often by inexperienced debriefers and often in the first 24 hours after a trauma such as a fire or traffic accident. In contrast, thorough debriefing (lasting on average 2 hours) from experienced debriefers several days after an aid worker has returned from overseas appears to be highly effective at reducing symptoms [Lovell-Hawker, 2002 b]. In 1992 McConnan found that 72 % of aidworkers reported feeling inadequately debriefed and supported on their return, while in 2003 Foyle found that 43 % reported that debriefing was inadequate. It appears that progress has been made, but there is still room for improvement. Debriefing is not just for expatriates, but there are cross cultural issues to take into account when debriefing <b>locally</b> <b>hired</b> <b>staff.</b> So effective debriefing is essential. But what exactly is effective debriefing, and what does it include? What do we mean by ‘debriefing’...|$|E
40|$|Here for good: What {{new arrivals}} need to fit in, be {{productive}} and stay by Jenny Magee. Does your company advertise and recruit offshore for skilled staff? Then Here For Good {{is the book}} is for you. New Zealand employers are increasingly searching overseas for skilled employees. It’s a costly and protracted process {{to find the best}} {{people who are willing to}} move their lives and their families across the world. Helping those staff settle well is not only good business sense, but it’s also the right thing to do if you want them to thrive and to stay. The onboarding processes you’re using for <b>locally</b> <b>hired</b> <b>staff</b> simply aren’t enough to help newcomers to understand and adjust to Kiwi culture. While providing relocation support is standard practice for multi-national companies, most smaller businesses are leaving the essential learnings about culture, communication and connections to the individual or to chance. These same businesses are then left wondering why there is miscommunication and misunderstanding. Here For Good is a call to action for New Zealand SMEs, who, with the best of intentions, are leaving their new arrivals to sink or swim, hoping that well-meaning colleagues will fill in the gaps about ‘how we do things around here. ’ Drawing on more than 30 years of working across cultures in New Zealand, Jenny Magee offers practical advice for you to help your new staff to settle in, get quickly up to speed and stay. She has worked with many businesses and migrant employees, whose settlement experiences range from the cautionary to the positive. Choosing to come to New Zealand is definitely about the job, but also, importantly about lifestyle, safety and a host of other reasons. When businesses help new staff, and their families, to understand local culture and communication and to build connections, everyone benefits - the new arrival, their manager, the team, the clients, as well as your organisation’s reputation as a great reason to move across the world.
