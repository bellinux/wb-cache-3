40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to account for}} the slow corrosion rates of microtektite glass in nature by comparing the leach rates of synthetic microtektite glass samples in deionized water and in sea-water, respectively. In order to obtain systematic data about <b>leachant</b> <b>composition</b> effects, leach tests were also carried out with synthetic leachant compositions enriched with respect to silica or depleted with respect to certain major components of sea-water (Mg, Ca) ...|$|E

40|$|Glass-bonded zeolite {{is being}} {{developed}} at Argonne National Laboratory in the Electrometallurgical Treatment Program as a potential ceramic waste form for the disposition of radionuclides associated with the US Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) spent nuclear fuel conditioning activities. The utility of standard durability tests [e. g. Materials Characterization Center Test No. 1 (MCC- 1), Product Consistency Test (PCT), and Vapor Hydration Test (VHT) ] are being evaluated as an initial step in developing test methods {{that can be used}} in the process of qualifying this material for acceptance into the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System. A broad range of potential repository conditions are being evaluated to determine the bounding parameters appropriate for the corrosion testing of the ceramic waste form, and its behavior under accelerated testing conditions. In this report we provide specific characterization information and discuss how the durability test results are affected by changes in pH, <b>leachant</b> <b>composition,</b> and sample surface area to leachant volume ratios. We investigate the release mechanisms and other physical and chemical parameters that are important for establishing acceptance parameters, including the development of appropriate test methodologies required to measure product consistency...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} mechanisms involving saturation {{and reactions}} {{that lead to}} the formation of altered phases in silicate glasses considered for use in geologic repositories for nuclear waste. It is shown that the rate of dissolution of silicate glasses exposed to a broad range of contact times, <b>leachant</b> <b>compositions,</b> and surface-to-volume ratios is strongly affected by the presence of reactive species such as Al, Mg, and Fe. The reactive materials may originate in the leachant or, under conditions of high surface-to-volume ratio, in the glass itself. The effects of glass composition on the course of the corrosion process can be viewed in terms of the formation of a surface layer on the leached glass; the type, composition, and structure of this layer control the dissolution behavior of the glass...|$|R
40|$|Static leach {{tests were}} {{performed}} in both 304 L stainless steel and Teflon vessels using a synthetic high-level waste glass with either deionized water (DIW) or a tuff groundwater solution as the leachant {{to assess the}} effects of the vessel and the initial <b>leachant</b> <b>composition</b> on the extent and nature of the glass reaction. The tests were performed using monolith samples at 340 m{sup {minus} 1 } and crushed samplesat 2000 m{sup {minus} 1 } for times up to 1 year. The results show less silicon is released from the glass into the groundwater solution than into DIW at both high and low glass surface area/leachant volume ratios (SAN), but the alkali metal and boron releases are not affected by the leachant used. Tests performed in a stainless steel vessel resulted in slightly lower leachate pH values, but similar reaction rates to those performed in a Teflon vessel, as measured by the boron release. Blank tests with DIW or EJ- 13 in the vessels showed the Teflon vessels to release small amounts of fluoride (1 to 2 ppm) and to acidify the DIW slightly (4. 0 < pH < 5. 6). The pH values of blank tests with EJ- 1 3 increased from 8. 2 to about 8. 6 in steel and to about 9. 2 in Teflon vessels. The slightly higher pH values attained in Teflon vessels are attributed to outgassing of CO{sub 2 } during the test...|$|E
40|$|This work {{tests the}} premise that felsic {{volcanic}} rocks, particularly ash-flow tuffs, can serve as source rocks for uranium deposits. The applicability of this idea to several geologic environments is investigated. ^ A genetic model is developed dealing with the behavior of uranium during and subsequent to ash-flow tuff deposition. It is based upon previously described investigations, geologic logic, data presented here, and speculation. Chemical changes resulting from early post-depositional processes such as devitrification and hydration are detailed. The influence of later post-depositional faulting, heating, erosion, alteration by ground water and hydrothermal systems {{and the influence of}} underlying units is discussed. ^ Uranium may be released during the initial degassing, during hydrothermal alteration, and/or during later diagenesis. Experimental studies have been designed and carried out to simulate natural leaching conditions such as might occur during near surface diagenesis. Synthetic ground waters have been pumped through pulverized uraniferous vitrophyres in experiments at 20, 60 and 80 (DEGREES) C (and atmospheric pressure). Na, K, Ca, Mg, Si, CO(, 2), Cl, SO(, 4) and minor element contents have been determined for the starting and product solutions and solids. ^ The most significant chemical changes take place quickly, within a matter of days. Near equilibrium is attained within 7 days. Several starting and product leachant solution were analyzed fluorimetrically for uranium. They show significant increases in uranium contents, from less than 1 ppb at the start to greater than 10 ppb maximum. Such leachant solutions might be significant transport agents of uranium given geologic time. Leaching at low temperatures appears to involve a thin surface reaction and diffusion layer. Both dissolution and ion exchange influence the <b>leachant</b> <b>composition.</b> ^ Vitrophyre-altered vitrophyre pairs from the Pena Blanca Uranium District were analyzed for major and minor element contents. Significant changes were seen in the content of uranium and other minor elements commonly associated with uranium. The U-K gamma ray spectrometry analyses of these samples show important trends similar to those seen in samples from Virgin Valley, Nevada, and Date Creek, Arizona. ^ Volcanoclastic sediments are also subject to uranium leaching and enrichment during diagenesis. Fresh glass and partially-zeolitized units in Presidio County, Texas, Zeolite deposits at Resse River and Eastgate, Nevada, a uranium-enriched zeolite locality at Virgin Valley, Nevada, and a uranium deposit in zeolitized lacustrine deposits at Date Creek, Arizona, were studied. Thorium, uranium and potassium gamma ray spectrometry analyses of volcanoclastic sediments from a number of different environments demonstrates that definite thorium, uranium and potassium signatures are developed at the different stages in the diagenetic processes. Erionite, clinoptilolite and montmorillonite, three common diagenetic products in volcanoclastic sediments exhibit different U/K ratios regardless of variations in the thorium content. ^ Tri-plots of the thorium, uranium and potassium gamma-ray spectrometry analyses are shown to be an important tool in the exploration for volcanogenic uranium deposits. ...|$|E
