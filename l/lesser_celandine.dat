The site is {{recognised}} by Reading Borough Council {{as an area}} of wildlife and historical interest, and examples of elm, walnut, ash, horse chestnut and sycamore trees grow there. Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> bluebells and Queen Anne's lace appearing in the spring. Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.|$|E
25|$|Oakwell Beck winds {{its course}} along the {{southern}} boundary of Colliery Field. Along its length are exposed coal seams and fossilized 'ripples' from ancient seas. It {{does not support the}} same diversity of plants as Nova Beck, but in spring and early summer, the wooded areas are thick with wild garlic, <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> and bistort. Occasional patches of lords and ladies survive in shadier parts. ash, alder and willow make up the majority of the tree cover and provide habitat for tawny owls.|$|E
25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E

60|$|The Rector’s wife {{might be}} content to turn her back complacently on the country; it was the Rector’s tragedy that the country turned its back on him. With the best {{intention}} {{in the world and}} the immortal example of Gilbert White before him, the Rev. Wilfrid found himself as bored and ill at ease in his new surroundings as Charles II would have been at a modern Wesleyan Conference. The birds that hopped across his lawn hopped across it as though it were their lawn, and not his, and gave him plainly to understand that in their eyes he was infinitely less interesting than a garden worm or the rectory cat. The hedgeside and meadow flowers were equally uninspiring; the <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> seemed particularly unworthy of the attention that English poets had bestowed on it, and the Rector knew that he would be utterly miserable if left alone for a quarter of an hour in its company. With the human inhabitants of his parish he was no better off; to know them was merely to know their ailments, and the ailments were almost invariably rheumatism. Some, of course, had other bodily infirmities, but they always had rheumatism as well. The Rector had not yet grasped the fact that in rural cottage life not to have rheumatism is as glaring an omission as not to have been presented at Court would be in more ambitious circles. And with all this death of local interest there was Beryl shutting herself off with her ridiculous labours on The Forbidden Horsepond.|$|E

Economy {{of time is}} very {{important}} both to the insects and the flowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no time is wasted the bees will get more honey, {{and in doing so}} will fertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several observers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower at a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over other species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness in going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower, or incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those flowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to assist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital importance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which bloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in form and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring, the copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone, and the <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> forming a beautiful contrast, {{while at the same time}} the purple and the white dead-nettles abound on hedge banks. A little later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (Scilla nutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort (Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon), all distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we have the ragged robin (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O. maculata), and the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in drier meadows we have cowslips, ox-eye daisies, and buttercups, all very distinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet poppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue cornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make a gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the insect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of the same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods, and heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each season of the year.[149] ...|$|E

50|$|Species {{which are}} {{particularly}} characteristic of ancient woodland sites are called ancient woodland indicator species, such as bluebells, yellow rattle, <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> wood anemone, and primrose for example representing {{a type of}} ecological indicator.|$|E
50|$|The adult {{butterfly}} flies between late April and June, {{being one}} of the earliest fritillaries to emerge. It will feed on the nectar from early spring flowers such as bugle, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), and <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the United States, where <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> is {{considered}} a plant pest to gardens, lawns, and natural areas, many governmental agencies have made great effort attempting to slow the spread of this species with limited success. As of 2014, the species {{was reported to be}} invasive and established in 25 states. USDA APHIS considers Ficaria verna to be a high risk weed which could spread across 79 percent of the United States, anticipating possible impacts to threatened and endangered riparian species. The U.S. National Park Service's Plant Conservation Alliance recommends avoiding planting <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> and instead planting native ephemeral wildflowers such as Asarum canadense, bloodroot, the native twinleaf (Jeffersonia diphylla), and various species of Trillium as alternatives.|$|E
50|$|Gunton Warren is {{a coastal}} site which has sand dunes, shingle, lowland heath and cliff slopes. Birds include rare {{migrants}} including icterines and yellow-browed warblers.

5000|$|Several {{species of}} orchid thrive in Garston Wood, [...] along with <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> butcher's broom, wood anemone, dog violet, primrose, wild garlic, the rare toothwort and bluebells. Trees include oak, beech, hazel, which is coppiced, and {{a species of}} ash tree which is {{suffering}} from dieback.|$|E
50|$|The hilly site {{is almost}} wholly wooded, {{and one of}} the floristically richest ancient woods in the London area. Its {{highlight}} is the abundance of flowers in spring, with a carpet of bluebells together with yellow archangel, <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> wood anemone and the rare coral root bittercress (cardamina bulbifera).|$|E
50|$|There is a scrub line {{along the}} wall {{boundary}} which includes hawthorn, dog-rose, bramble, field maple, hazel, holly and traveller's joy. There are some mature ash, sycamore and horse-chestnut trees. The ground flora beneath the trees and scrub includes ivy, dog's mercury, bluebell, <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> hairy St John's-wort and cow parsley.|$|E
50|$|Celandine {{is named}} after a {{flowering}} medicinal herb. It may either be Greater celandine of the poppy family, or <b>Lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> a buttercup. The plant figures in all three volumes of the trilogy, {{but it is not}} clear from the descriptions which of the two Steve Augarde has in mind.|$|E
50|$|Natural England, in {{its report}} of May 2011, reports the {{coverage}} and density of the flowering as being 75% of the whole field and between 40% to 60% cover. Other species recorded in the meadow are <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> common sorrel, cuckooflower and creeping buttercup. The presence of {{a significant number of}} bumblebees was noted.|$|E
50|$|The soils {{provide an}} unusual {{combination}} of habitats to exist side by side, including ash woods, species-rich grassland, heathland and open water. The spring flowers include the primrose or Primula vulgaris and the <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine.</b> The local landscape {{is a mix}} of traditional agriculture and quarrying activity, with ancient woodlands, and field systems. Forestry is also practised.|$|E
50|$|At {{least since}} 1886, {{public access to}} the island was largely {{prohibited}} due {{to the protection of}} the drinking water supply system. Due to low human activity, wildlife is abundant on the island. Sihoť features a variety of protected plants including Snowdrops, Lily of the Valley and <b>Lesser</b> <b>celandine.</b> The ecosystem is largely intact, save for some limited legal logging.|$|E
50|$|Perennial weeds with bulbils, such as <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> and oxalis, or with {{persistent}} underground stems such as {{couch grass}} (Agropyron repens) or creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens) store reserves of food, {{and are thus}} able to grow faster and with more vigour than their annual counterparts. Some perennials such as couch grass exude allelopathic chemicals that inhibit the growth of other nearby plants.|$|E
50|$|In the near-natural {{riparian}} woods, ash and alder trees abound. In spring {{yellow wood}} anemone, bulbous corydalis and <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> blossom in the woods. Opposite-leaved golden saxifrage and primrose grow on the wetter tracts {{of the nature}} reserve. There are also marsh marigold meadows which are also graced by flowers such as the western marsh orchid, water avens and goldilocks buttercup.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> is a hairless perennial, with spirally-arranged cordate dark-green leaves without stipules. It {{produces}} actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) {{flowers with}} 3 sepaloid tepals and 7-12 glossy yellow petaloid tepals. Double flowered varieties also occur. The stamens and carpels are numerous, and the fruit is a single-seeded achene {{with a very}} short style. In several sub-species, tubers are formed in the leaf axils after flowering.|$|E
5000|$|Ficaria {{is a small}} genus {{of several}} species of plants in the Ranunculaceae family, which were {{previously}} grouped with Ranunculus. The genus includes Ficaria verna, known as fig buttercup or <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> and related species. The name [...] "Ficaria" [...] is Classical Latin for fig. Plants in the genus {{are closely related to}} true buttercups, but generally have only three sepals and swollen smooth achenes.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{diversity}} of plants, especially in the meadow area. Some recently seen plants include Birdsfoot trefoil, Bloody cranesbill, Corncockle, Cowslip, Dog rose, Evening primrose, Field speedwell, Lesser periwinkle, Michaelmas daisy, Oxeye daisy, Vipers bugloss, Sweet violet, Lucerne, Wild gladiolus, Green alkanet, Herb robert, <b>Lesser</b> <b>celandine,</b> Marsh marigold, Purple loosestrife, Yellow flag, Wild strawberry, Yarrow and many others. Some of these have been introduced, others found their own way here.|$|E

After {{the death of his father}} when he was 14, he helped his mother in running the small family {{textiles}} business. A local healer taught him the recipe for a hemostatic ointment based on the <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> flower, and he decided to sell the ointment by mail order with adverts in the magazine Ici Paris.|$|E
50|$|All {{plants of}} the {{buttercup}} family (Ranunculaceae) contain a compound known as protoanemonin When {{the plant is}} wounded, the unstable glucoside ranunculin turns into the toxin protoanemonin. Contact with damaged or crushed Ficaria leaves can cause itching, rashes or blistering on the skin or mucosa. Ingesting the toxin can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, spasms, or paralysis. In one case, a patient experienced acute hepatitis and jaundice when taking untreated <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> extracts internally as an herbal remedy for hemorrhoids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plant is}} known as {{pilewort}} by some herbalists because it has historically been used to treat piles (hemorrhoids). <b>Lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> is still recommended in several [...] "current" [...] herbal guides for treatment of hemorrhoids by applying an ointment of raw leaves as a cream or lanolin to the affected area. Supposedly, the knobby tubers of the plant resemble piles, {{and according to the}} doctrine of signatures this resemblance suggests that pilewort could be used to cure piles.|$|E

50|$|Legbourne Wood {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} ancient woodlands in eastern Lincolnshire and the largest of the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust woodland nature reserves. The Trust bought the wood in 2004. The canopy at Legbourne is ash and oak. Beneath the trees, over 60 species of wildflowers have been recorded including primrose, early purple orchid, bluebell, wood anemone, sweet woodruff, wood sorrel and <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine.</b> There is a varied bird population, including one of the largest heronries in the county.|$|E
50|$|The reserve also {{contains}} a large variety of ground flora, being known as a bluebell wood. Spring-flowering plants that occur on the site include the bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common primrose (Primula vulgaris), <b>lesser</b> <b>celandine</b> (Ranunculus ficaria), ramsons (Allium ursinum) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Orchids are also present, with the varieties bird's-nest (Neottia nidus-avis), early purple (Orchis mascula) and the greater butterfly-orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) being found. The very rare ghost orchid (Epipogium aphyllum) has once been found within the site as well.|$|E
