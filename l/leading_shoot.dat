The women of the village might be much fonder of Tom Brangwen, and more at their ease with him, yet if their lives had been robbed of the vicar, and of Lord William, the <b>leading</b> <b>shoot</b> would have been cut away from them, {{they would have been}} heavy and uninspired and inclined to hate.

After 9 -month cutting, results showed that the number of shoots was not different between species. The average <b>leading</b> <b>shoots</b> of C. crenata and Q. lucida were nearly twice as long as the average <b>leading</b> <b>shoots</b> of Q. glauca and S. lucida. This gives an indication of high resilience of deciduous species after cutting in comparison with that of everfreen species.

60|$|CLEMATIS.--C. glandulosa.--The thin upper internodes revolve, moving {{against the}} course of the sun, {{precisely}} like those of a true twiner, at an average rate, judging from three revolutions, of 3 hrs. 48 m. The <b>leading</b> <b>shoot</b> immediately twined round a stick placed near it; but, after making an open spire of only one turn and a half, it ascended for a short space straight, and then reversed its course and wound two turns in an opposite direction. This was rendered possible by the straight piece between the opposed spires having become rigid. The simple, broad, ovate leaves of this tropical species, with their short thick petioles, seem but ill-fitted for any movement; and whilst twining up a vertical stick, no use is made of them. Nevertheless, if the footstalk of a young leaf be rubbed with a thin twig a few times on any side, it will in {{the course of}} a few hours bend to that side; afterwards becoming straight again. The under side seemed to be the most sensitive; but the sensitiveness or irritability is slight compared to that which we shall meet with in some of the following species; thus, a loop of string, weighing 1.64 grain (106.2 mg.) and hanging for some days on a young footstalk, produced a scarcely perceptible effect. A sketch is here given of two young leaves which had naturally caught hold of two thin branches. A forked twig placed so as to press lightly on the under side of a young footstalk caused it, in 12 hrs., to bend greatly, and ultimately to such an extent that the leaf passed to the opposite side of the stem; the forked stick having been removed, the leaf slowly recovered its former position.|$|E
6000|$|These highly {{cultivated}} plants seem eminently liable to bud-variation. I will give {{only a few}} well-marked cases. Gartner has seen (11/23. 'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 s. 76.) a plant of P. zonale with a branch having white edges, which remained constant for years, and bore flowers of a deeper red than usual. Generally speaking, such branches present little or no difference in their flowers: thus a writer (11/24. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 336.) pinched off the <b>leading</b> <b>shoot</b> of a seedling P. zonale, and it threw out three branches, which differed in the size and colour of their leaves and stems; but on all three branches [...] "the flowers were identical," [...] except in being largest in the green-stemmed variety, and smallest in that with variegated foliage: these three varieties were subsequently propagated and distributed. Many branches, and some whole plants, of a variety called compactum, which bears orange-scarlet flowers, have been seen to produce pink flowers. (11/25. W.P. Ayres 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1842 page 791.) Hill's Hector, which is a pale red variety, produced a branch with lilac flowers, and some trusses with both red and lilac flowers. This apparently {{is a case of}} reversion, for Hill's Hector was a seedling from a lilac variety. (11/26. W.P. Ayres ibid.) Here is a better case of reversion: a variety produced from a complicated cross, after having been propagated for five generations by seed, yielded by bud- variation three very distinct varieties which were undistinguishable from plants, [...] "known to have been at some time ancestors of the plant in question." [...] (11/27. Dr. Maxwell Masters 'Pop. Science Review' July 1872 page 250.) Of all Pelargoniums, Rollisson's Unique seems to be the most sportive; its origin is not positively known, but is believed to be from a cross. Mr. Salter, of Hammersmith, states (11/28. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 968.) that he has himself known this purple variety to produce the lilac, the rose-crimson or conspicuum, and the red or coccineum varieties; the latter has also produced the rose d'amour; so that altogether four varieties have originated by bud variation from Rollisson's Unique. Mr. Salter remarks that these four varieties [...] "may now be considered as fixed, although they occasionally produce flowers of the original colour. This year coccineum has pushed flowers of three different colours, red, rose, and lilac, upon the same truss, and upon other trusses are flowers half red and half lilac." [...] Besides these four varieties, two other scarlet Uniques are known to exist, both of which occasionally produce lilac flowers identical with Rollisson's Unique (11/29. Ibid 1861 page 945.); but one at least of these did not arise through bud-variation, but is believed to be a seedling from Rollisson's Unique. (11/30. W. Paul 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 968.) There are, also, in the trade (11/31. Ibid page 945.) two other slightly different varieties, of unknown origin, of Rollisson's Unique: so that altogether we have a curiously complex case of variation both by buds and seeds. (11/32. For other cases of bud-variation in this same variety see 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 pages 578, 600, 925. For other distinct cases of bud-variation in the genus Pelargonium see 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 194.) Here is a still more complex case: M. Rafarin states that a pale rose-coloured variety produced a branch bearing deep red flowers. [...] "Cuttings were taken from this 'sport,' from which 20 plants were raised, which flowered in 1867, when it was found that scarcely two were alike." [...] Some resembled the parent-form, some resembled the sport, some bore both kinds of flowers; and even some of the petals on the same flower were rose-coloured and others red. (11/33. Dr. Maxwell Masters 'Pop. Science Review' July 1872 page 254.) An English wild plant, the Geranium pratense, when cultivated in a garden, has been seen to produce on the same plant both blue and white, and striped blue and white flowers. (11/34. Rev. W.T. Bree in Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 8 1832 page 93.) ...|$|E

50|$|Similarly, some {{research}} suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R.

50|$|In British Columbia, the Forest Practices Code (1995) governs {{performance}} criteria. To {{minimize the}} subjectivity of assessing deciduous competition {{as to whether}} or not a plantation is established, minimum specifications of number, health, height, and competition have been specified in British Columbia. However, minimum specifications are still subjectively set and may need to be fine-tuned in order to avoid unwarranted delay in according established status to a plantation. For example, a vigorous white spruce with a strong, multi-budded <b>leading</b> <b>shoot</b> and its crown fully exposed to light on 3 sides would not qualify as free-growing in the current British Columbia Code but would hardly warrant description as unestablished.|$|E
50|$|Timber is {{currently}} also harvested in New Guinea. Although {{it is not}} generally a viable plantation species, trees are regularly harvested by Forestry in the Atherton region of Queensland. It grows best in an environment with high light levels, however in the relative darkness of the rainforest understorey, it is less susceptible to attack by the cedar tip moth. The cedar tip moth lays its eggs on the tree's <b>leading</b> <b>shoot,</b> allowing the larvae to burrow into the stem. This causes dieback and a multi-branched tree with little commercial value. The tree exudes a chemical that the female cedar tip moth seeks out. This moth does not attack commercial plantings of Asian/African/Australian native meliaceas in South America. As a result, successful planting of Toona ciliata is being observed {{in many parts of}} Brazil, including genetic improvement and clonal production.|$|E
50|$|The {{size and}} shape and general {{appearance}} of a seedling can nevertheless give useful indications of PSPP. In low-stress outplanting situations, and with a minimized handling and lifting-planting cycle, a system based on specification for nursery stock and minimum morphological standards for acceptable seedlings works tolerably well. In certain circumstances, benefits often accrue {{from the use of}} large planting stock of highly ranked morphological grades. Length of <b>leading</b> <b>shoot,</b> diameter of stem, volume of root system, shoot:root ratios, and height:diameter ratios have been correlated with performance under specific site and planting conditions. However, the concept that larger is better negates the underlying complexities. Schmidt-Vogt (1980), for instance, found that whereas mortality among large outplants is greater than among small in the year of planting, mortality in subsequent growing seasons is higher among small outplants than among large. Much of the literature on comparative seedling performance is clouded by uncertainty as to whether the stocks being compared share the same physiological condition; differences invalidate such comparisons.|$|E

The plants' growth activities were greatest under LD conditions. SD conditions were necessary for the plants to complete their vegetative growth. For bud formation and lignification of the <b>leading</b> <b>shoot,</b> relatively high temperatures were required under SD conditions.
