When generating lemmas, however) the currently used lemma generation procedures suffer from the well-known problems of forward reasoning methods, e. g., the proof goal is ignored. In order to overcome these problems we propose two relevancy-based lemma generation methods for top-down provers. The first approach employs a bottom-up <b>level</b> <b>saturation</b> procedure controlled by top-down generated patterns which represent promising subgoals. The second approach uses evolutionary search and provides a self-adaptive control of lemma generation and goal decomposition. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} “Deep <b>Level</b> <b>Saturation</b> Spectroscopy” (DLSS) as the {{nonlinear}} method {{to study the}} deep local defects in semiconductors. The essence of a method {{is determined by the}} processes of sufficiently strong laser modulation (up to saturation) of quasistationar two-step absorption of the probe light via deep levels (DLs). DLSS is based on nonequilibrium processes of the optically induced population changes for deep levels which lead to the changes in an impurity absorption. This method allows us the separation of the spectral contributions from different deep centers (even in the case of their full spectral overlap), {{on the basis of the}} difference of their optical activity (photon capture cross-sections) and of their electroactivity difference (carriers capture coefficients). As shown, DLSS is allowed to determine directly the main set of phenomenological parameters (cross-sections, concentration, bound energy, etc.) for deep local defects, their content and energy position in the band gap. Some important aspects of DLSS were shown also: the possibility to connect directly the measured data to the local centers which are participating in radiative recombination, and also the possibility to study directly	 the phonon relaxation processes in the localized states of deep defects...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn smart grids, the {{expected}} increase of electrical vehicle (EV) penetration will impose sizeable charging load, which can critically overburden the distribution network (DN) if the delivered power is non-pragmatically aggregated and induce significant impacts on various important existing grid assets. Among them, the residential distribution transformer is {{considered as one}} of the most important components in the grid. The ageing of the transformer is closely related to the temporal evolution of the hot-spot temperature (HST), which is induced by the operating load level history. We propose an optimal control approach to obtain a new EV charging algorithm: the novel aspect of this algorithm is that it takes inertial behavior of HST into account, which is the key parameter to capture the ageing. Though our formulation closely resembles to the linear quadratic control problem that includes costs induced from the state of the transformer and its present charging load, the natural constraints which are imposed to the instantaneous charging <b>level</b> (<b>saturation</b> constraints) induces intricate complicacy for the analytical solution. Thus, we follow the Pontryagin maximum principle approach to obtain the optimal charging policy and resort to numerical methods to compute the optimal charging trajectory.

The chronological age of the tissue was found to be correlated with the mitotic index which reached a peak at 2 weeks and then declined. The metabolism of 2, 4 -D changed with age of the root callus tissue. The amount of free 2, 4 -D found in 3 -week-old root callus tissue rapidly increased as the concentration of 2, 4 -D in the medium was increased from 10 − 6 to 10 − 5 molar, whereas the low level of aqueous (glycosides) and ether soluble metabolites (2, 4 -D amino acid conjugates) increased slowly. With 9 -week-old root callus tissue, the amount of free 2, 4 -D remained at a relatively low, constant <b>level</b> (<b>saturation</b> level) as the concentration of 2, 4 -D in the medium increased. Under these conditions the aqueous metabolites increased only slightly but the ether fraction (2, 4 -D amino acid conjugates) rapidly increased.

Like bacteria, fungi can cause severe lung diseases, but their infection rates are much lower. This study compared the bacterial and fungal communities of sputum samples from a large cohort of 56 adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) during nonexacerbation periods and under continuous antibiotic treatment. Molecular fingerprinting based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed fundamental differences between bacterial and fungal communities. Both groups of microorganisms were taxonomically classified by identification of gene sequences (16 S rRNA and internal transcript spacer), and prevalences of single taxa were determined for the entire cohort. Major bacterial pathogens were frequently observed, whereas fungi of known pathogenicity in CF were detected only in low numbers. Fungal species richness increased without reaching a constant <b>level</b> (<b>saturation),</b> whereas bacterial richness showed saturation after 50 patients were analyzed. In contrast to bacteria, {{a large number of}} fungal species were observed together with high fluctuations over time and among patients. These findings demonstrated that the mycobiome was dominated by transient species, which strongly suggested that the main driving force was their presence in inhaled air rather than colonization. Considering the high exposure of human airways to fungal spores, we concluded that fungi have low colonization abilities in CF, and colonization by pathogenic fungal species may be considered a rare event. A comprehensive understanding of the conditions promoting fungal colonization may offer the opportunity to prevent colonization and substantially reduce or even eliminate fungus-related disease progression in CF...|$|E

Thirteen fixed stimulus intensities from 5 to 25 mA with 2. 5 mA intervals were applied at random to the left mental area, and stimulus-response (S-R) curves were built for each subject. The first stimulation intensity at which the ES 2 appeared was defined the reflex threshold, while the lowest stimulus intensity the subjects scored as painful, was called the pain threshold. Using the S-R curves, the other reflex parameters (appearance <b>level,</b> <b>saturation</b> level, slope from appearance to saturation, maximum duration of ES 2, and maximum suppression degree) were also determined. Two measurement sessions were scheduled. Both the reflex and the pain sensation appeared at significantly lower stimulus intensity in females than males (P < 0. 05). The reflex threshold, the reflex appearance and saturation level showed a significant decrease from the first to second session (P < 0. 05), while the pain threshold was significantly higher during the second session (P < 0. 01). By contrast, a good reproducibility was found for the maximum duration and suppression degree of ES 2. Consequently, if S-R curves {{would be used to}} study the relation between the ES 2 parameters and stimulus intensity in normal subjects for their applicability in clinical conditions, maximum duration and maximum suppression degree should be focused upon, in order to avoid session and gender effects as confounding factors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Although current {{assessments}} of agricultural management practices on soil organic C (SOC) dynamics are usually conducted without any explicit consideration of limits to soil C storage, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the SOC pool has an upper, or saturation limit with respect to C input levels at steady state. Agricultural management practices that increase C input levels over time produce a new equilibrium soil C content. However, multiple C input level treatments that produce no increase in SOC stocks at equilibrium show that soils have become saturated with respect to C inputs. SOC storage of added C input {{is a function of}} how far a soil is from saturation <b>level</b> (<b>saturation</b> deficit) as well as C input level. We tested experimentally if C saturation deficit and varying C input levels influenced soil C stabilization of added C- 13 in soils varying in SOC content and physiochemical characteristics. We incubated for 2. 5 years soil samples from seven agricultural sites that were closer to (i. e., A-horizon) or further from (i. e., C-horizon) their C saturation limit. At the initiation of the incubations, samples received low or high C input levels of 13 C-labeled wheat straw. We also tested the effect of Ca addition and residue quality on a subset of these soils. We hypothesized that the proportion of C stabilized would be greater in samples with larger C Saturation deficits (i. e., the C- versus A-horizon samples) and that the relative stabilization efficiency (i. e., Delta SCC/Delta C input) would decrease as C input level increased. We found that C saturation deficit influenced the stabilization of added residue at six out of the seven sites and C addition level affected the stabilization of added residue in four sites, corroborating both hypotheses. Increasing Ca availability or decreasing residue quality had no effect on the stabilization of added residue. The amount of new C stabilized was significantly related to C saturation deficit, supporting the hypothesis that C saturation influenced C stabilization at all our sites. Our results suggest that soils with low C contents and degraded lands may have the greatest potential and efficiency to store added C because they are further from their saturation level.

40|$|International audienceThe ThermoMap project ([URL] is an EC co-funded project (FP 7 -ICT Policy Support Programme) {{and focuses}} on mapping very shallow {{geothermal}} energy potentials (vSGP) in Europe. Geothermal energy, as defined in the directive on renewable energy sources from 2009, is {{energy in the form}} of heat beneath the Earth's surface. Horizontal and vertical heat exchangers and other very shallow heat exchange systems including ground source heat pumps (GSHP) are effective devices to exploit the energy of the shallow underground. The key objective of the project is to provide an appropriate visualisation of the estimated very shallow geothermal energy potential by using a specially developed open-source web mapping (WebGIS) application running in a web browser on the Internet. ThermoMap collects, harmonises, combines, analyses and validates available pedological, climatological, topographical, geological, groundwater and administrative (meta-) data to estimate the shallow geothermal energy potential at depths up to ten metres below surface. A multitude of further background information on a medium scale (European Outline Map) to regional and local scale (14 Test Areas) across Europe has been derived. The results show variations of temperature and heat flow at depths up to ten metres. These variations are controlled by internal soil properties like texture, moisture, pore size distribution (characteristic air and water balance) and bulk density as well as climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation) and hydro-/geological parameters (groundwater <b>level,</b> <b>saturation</b> conditions). Using the approach and formulas according to Kersten (1949) and Dehner (2007) geothermal energy potentials have been calculated with a resulting spatial dataset of heat conductivity values in W/(m*K) and volumetric heat capacity in MJ/(m 3 *K). The GIS pre-processing takes into account parameters such as legal constraints, slope and unsuitable soil types as well as the availability of the softrock zone required for the efficient installation and operation of different horizontal and vertical heat collector systems. One main output of the project work is a WebGIS-based open-source mapping application named ThermoMap MapViewer ([URL] The contained visualised geodata consists of the technically and semantically harmonised, processed and analysed datasets from each case study area. No spatial analysis is performed by the web mapping application, it acts as a central portal visualising pre-processed GIS results collected from distributed databases via Web Map Services from each project country partner. For end-users of the developed estimation system, four possible target groups have been identified: research, industry, public and public agencies. The different target groups are invited to use the WebGIS interface according to their different needs. In tailoring the demands and needs of the end-users, graduated information levels within the MapViewer application were developed. These are represented by different 'Info Tools' allowing for differing levels of focus, content, terminology, data volume and information scope. For the general end-user a special query tool was created that displays interpreted information which can also be downloaded as PDF-file or printed as a 'Location Information Sheet' enriched with map details, diagrams and tables. To ensure a continual validation and improving of the ThermoMap R&D outcomes, a testing phase in the form of user seminars has been performed and evaluated. Additionally, modelling results have been cross-validated with field measurements and laboratory analyses of key characteristics such as soil texture, bulk density, and heat conductivity. The appropriate evaluation of both activities will create not only valuable feedback for an enhancement of the user-friendliness of the WebGIS service, but also provides the consortium with comparable measured data to be able to validate the developed process concept as well as to improve the accuracy of the ThermoMap estimation system for the very shallow geothermal potential (vSGP) across Europe...|$|E
