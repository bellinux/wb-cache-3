40|$|The {{effect of}} {{controlled}} drainage (CD) on ammonia volatilization (AV) <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI) was investigated by managing water table control levels using a lysimeter. Three drainage treatments were implemented, namely, controlled water table depth 1 (CWT 1), controlled water table depth 2 (CWT 2), and controlled water table depth 3 (CWT 3). As {{the water table}} control levels increased, irrigation water volumes in the CI paddy fields decreased. AV <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> paddy fields reduced due to the increases in water table control levels. Seasonal AV <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> CWT 1, CWT 2, and CWT 3 were 59. 8, 56. 7, and 53. 0 [*]kg[*]N[*]ha− 1, respectively. AV <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> CWT 3 were 13. 1 % and 8. 4 % lower than those from CWT 1 and CWT 2, respectively. A {{significant difference in the}} seasonal AV losses was confirmed between CWT 1 and CWT 3. Less weekly AV losses followed by TF and PF were also observed as the water table control levels increased. The application of CD by increasing water table control levels to a suitable level could effectively reduce irrigation water volumes and AV <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> CI paddy fields. The combination of CI and CD may be a feasible water management method of reducing AV <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> paddy fields...|$|R

40|$|The {{level of}} insured <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> natural and {{man-made}} disasters {{occurred in the}} world from 2012 to 2016 did not exceed 30 - 45 %. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study another perspective source of financing <b>losses</b> refunding <b>from</b> natural and man-made disasters. The objective of this research is to consider financing <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> natural and man-made disasters by use of crowdfunding, especially in emerging countries. It was defined that the most appropriate model of crowdfunding for financing <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> natural and man-made disasters is donation model with reward-based and donation-based business models. Stimulus for individuals to take part in crowdfunding for financing <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> natural and man-made disasters can be different depending on their location and business model. Sets of assessments based on four categories of questions and method of results visualization were used to examine a country’s readiness for crowdfunding on the example of Ukraine. Complete level of Ukraine’s readiness for crowdfunding was defined. It shows that reward-based crowdfunding is the first stage towards crowdfunding implementation and development. Further research should be done to investigate the mechanism of using a tax discount in case of implementation of the reward-based crowdfunding for financing <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> natural and man-made disasters...|$|R

Results {{of this study indicate}} that seepage rates from the stock ponds studied are dynamic, controlled largely by the volumes and frequencies of inflows and the permeabilities of the materials underlying the ponds. Required input to the model includes an inflow record, pan evaporation data, a stage-surface area relationship, and estimates of the model parameters of minimum and maximum hydraulic conductivity. Comparison of model output to actual data indicates the program successfully predicts seepage <b>losses</b> <b>from</b> small unlined water impoundments...|$|R

5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of <b>loss</b> <b>from</b> any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface.

This type of gas <b>loss</b> <b>from</b> a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
