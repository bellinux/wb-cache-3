40|$|Unlike some European countries, {{there have}} been few motor scooters and mopeds on Australian roads <b>and</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>and</b> {{training}} of these riders has received little attention.

A number of challenges to developing a coherent <b>licensing</b> <b>and</b> training system are identified and discussed: lack of information regarding moped and motor scooter safety and about the safety outcomes of current <b>licensing</b> <b>and</b> training systems, the absence of official definitions of scooters worldwide, the significant growth in this market, whether different <b>licensing</b> <b>and</b> training requirements should apply to tourists, and the status of similar vehicles...|$|R

Opponents said the reliance on fees sometimes imposed a hardship on those who could least afford them. Romney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $181million from businesses {{over the next two}} years and over $300million for his term. He did so in the face of conservative and corporate critics who viewed these actions as tax increases.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day.

However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for <b>licenses</b> <b>and</b> that Cross was aware of this.
