40|$|The paper explores two interrelated {{tensions}} at {{the heart}} of UK welfare to work policy: (i) between competition and cooperation in delivering employment services, and (ii) between centralisation and localisation of policy control. It examines their potential impact on employment programmes {{at the level of the}} city through the DWPs Cities Strategy and its Commissioning Strategy. At this early stage it appears that while the Cities Strategy is building capacity for <b>local</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management,</b> the contracting out of DWPs own programmes is centralised and prioritises competition rather than local integration and alignment. It remains to be seen whether the two approaches can be brought together pragmatically on the ground to deliver better services and get welfare to work, particularly in the difficult current economic climate. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores and {{analyzes}} {{the demand for}} and supply of forests in and near urban areas from a social perspective. Specific focus is directed towards recreational qualities of forests located just outside urban borders, that is, urban fringe forests. To this end, the thesis is based on four empirical research papers. Papers I and II explore the demand component, while Paper III focuses on the supply component. Finally, Paper IV integrates issues of both demand and supply. In Paper I, a survey directed {{to the general public}} in urban areas is used to address differences between public attitudes to the forest in general and to the urban fringe forest more specifically. Paper II builds upon interviews with municipal planners with responsibility for green space issues in nine Swedish cities. In Paper III, spatial forest data is analyzed in a GIS to examine how urbanization and population developments influence the supply of urban fringe forests over time. Spatial analysis is further used in Paper IV to quantify forest attractiveness and accessibility in a single measure of urban fringe forest demand and supply. In Paper I it is shown that urban residents associate the urban fringe forest with a variety of design characteristics, as people’s opinions do not solely concern social qualities but also ecological and functional qualities. It is concluded that the overall influence of socioeconomic and demographic attributes is modest in comparison to the basic values and beliefs people hold about life, the environment, and the forest in general. In Paper II it is demonstrated that it is imperative for municipalities to own forest, since this allows them to secure sufficient provisions of recreational forests for future residents and from urban land developments. However, as private citizens do generally not take part of <b>local</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> decision-making there is an obvious risk for decisions biased towards the interests of social organizations, with specific activity and structural demands that do not necessarily reflect the interests of the general public. From Paper III it is evident that urbanization and population developments do not necessarily lead to a reduced supply of urban fringe forests over time; forest management practices are equally important to consider with regards to people’s opportunities to visit attractive forests for recreation. Finally, in Paper IV it is shown that more attractive forests are generally less accessible to urban residents, regardless of mode of transportation, and that the accessibility to urban fringe forests is generally lower in more deprived neighborhoods. The research for Paper I of this thesis was conducted in collaboration with Future Forests, a multidisciplinary research program, and its sponsors: the Strategic Foundation for Environmental Research (Mistra), the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Umeå University, the Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk), and the Forestry Industry in Sweden.

40|$|This {{project has}} {{explored}} {{the implementation of}} an integrative and collaborative policy _ vision in a real world setting - the emerging relationship between the river basin <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> (RBMP) <b>and</b> development <b>planning</b> regimes in Scotland. This relationship fits comfortably {{with some of the}} latest paradigms in the fields of water <b>management</b> <b>and</b> land use <b>planning.</b> Both fields espouse the need for greater integration and collaboration, particularly within and between public sector organisations. Such approaches are often portrayed as key to achieving ambitions for sustainability. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) places particular emphasis on building linkages between water <b>management</b> <b>and</b> land use <b>planning</b> systems. There is growing understanding that such linkages can emerge as a patchwork of overlapping and interrelated institutions. However, there is still limited empirical understanding of such institutional relationships and what they mean in practical terms for those involved. This project's approach is based in interpretive policy analysis, and it has explored how various public bodies have constructed different understandings of this emerging relationship - what it is, how it works, and why it is needed. Methods included analyses of key documents, as well as in-depth interviews, primarily with RBMP <b>and</b> <b>planning</b> staff from <b>local</b> authorities, SEPA and other agencies. The findings show that the locus of the relationship is 'downshifting' towards lower levels of the planning regime - i. e. <b>local</b> development <b>plans,</b> <b>and</b> development <b>management.</b> In keeping with this, some higher level issues - such as the wider tradeoffs between enabling new development and ensuring the protection and improvement of the water environment - are not being discussed in this context. This pattern is shaped by wider socio-political aims, such as the government's central purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth. These findings support the need for higher-level interactions in which these wider aims can be discussed and debated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|South East Queensland (SEQ) is a fast growing, mega-city {{region in}} Australia and {{innovative}} metropolitan regional <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> collaborative governance arrangements have been evolving {{in the region}} since the early 1990 s. This report {{presents the results of}} recent research on the evolution of collaborative governance in SEQ. The report outlines a broad concept of collaborative governance involving governments, the community and the private sector. However, the focus of the research is on the collaboration of state and local governments in metropolitan planning in SEQ between 1990 and 2010. The report outlines the process by which governance <b>and</b> <b>planning</b> in SEQ evolved, by agreement of all the parties, from a voluntary model to a statutory model of metropolitan planning. It explores the collaborative dynamics of the partnership and identifies some implications for ongoing governance <b>and</b> <b>planning</b> in SEQ <b>and</b> in other states and multi-level metropolitan regions. Metropolitan areas are the largest urban areas or the capital cities of countries and states and are growing and expanding rapidly. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme, UN-HABITAT, has noted that metropolitan areas are spreading ‘over different administrative boundaries’ and creating challenges for ‘governing in a city of cities’. Government is the formal system of administration and laws by which a country or local community is managed. From the 1990 s onwards a wider concept of ‘governance’, as distinct from ‘government’, has developed which incorporates informal, as well as formal, arrangements for administering, managing <b>and</b> <b>planning</b> communities <b>and</b> metropolitan areas. Important roles are still played by formal governments but significant roles are also played by private sector organisations (business and the market) and by the community sector (community organisations and individuals).

40|$|Health system {{governance}} {{has to do}} with decision-making – {{who makes}} decisions, when, where, how and why. At the district level – the level of care which operationalises health policies – governance is critical, yet remains little understood. Governance has the ability to influence health system performance, and this is essential in maternal and newborn health, where timely decisions are required to support policy implementation. In this regard, district managers are particularly important.   They are the link {{in the middle of the}} health system, connecting top-end policy formulation to bottom-end implementation. Their abilities to interpret, translate, support and challenge policy will have an effect on what gets operationalised. However, capacity weaknesses in district <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership are often cited as a factor in poor health system performance. This thesis seeks to deepen understandings of district-level <b>management,</b> leadership <b>and</b> decision-making for policy <b>and</b> programme <b>management</b> <b>and</b> implementation for maternal and newborn health. Within this, the thesis also seeks to understand the scope for change that an intervention to strengthen <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership capacities can bring. This thesis contributes to the applied field of health policy and systems research by drawing on policy implementation theory, organisational <b>management</b> theory <b>and</b> complexity theory as its theoretical basis. A realist approach methodology was undertaken to understand the contexts in which district managers are embedded, how this influences their decision-making, and what the effects of a managerial intervention are, given these contexts. The thesis followed an embedded case study flexible design. The first case study was an exploratory qualitative case study to understand how and why district managers make decisions in maternal and newborn health policy implementation. The second case study was an historical case study of district manager decision-space over time. The third case study was an explanatory qualitative case study of the <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership intervention. The final validation of our theorising throughout the cases was achieved through the administration of a questionnaire across all district health management teams of the Great Accra Region. This thesis demonstrates that district managers find themselves in contexts of strong hierarchical authority and resource uncertainty – in particular, lacking financial transparency. This promotes a <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership typology which attunes managers towards serving the health system bureaucracy, resulting in reduced district-level responsiveness to maternal and newborn health challenges. The outcome is that district manager decision-space is narrow surrounding resource allocation decisions, and this in turn affects <b>local</b> <b>planning</b> programming <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> The thesis further demonstrates that broader patterns of centralised governmental decision-making have affected the development of the district health system over time. Particularly, the sequencing of decentralisation processes has ensured that national-level decision-making has remained empowered in contrast to district-level decision-making. System fragmentation – through reduced Government of Ghana funds and increasingly verticalised donor funds – has also been a contributor. This accounts for the observed hierarchical authority and resource uncertainty which affects district managers. As a result of these contexts, this thesis also showed that an intervention to strengthen <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership capacities was limited in its sustainability. This thesis raises the issues of health system organisation as critical to the potential of district <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership effectiveness. It provides evidence that weaknesses in district <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership arise out of the organisational governance mismatches in autonomy and responsibility. It suggests that in strengthening <b>management</b> <b>and</b> leadership, approaches which seek to address organisational capacities, not only individual capacities, are needed to convey sustainable change. Advancements in this regard have the scope to improve district manager decision-making for maternal and newborn health policy and programme implementation in the future...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} {{influential}} global conservation concepts playing various {{roles in the}} Thai natural resource conservation system. The overall {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the intersection of conservation policies and cultures in and around national park management in Thailand. The objectives of this study are to look at approaches, concepts, and models of natural resource conservation in practices and discourses of the central agencies, local park officials, other official agencies, NGOs and indigenous people. The thesis highlights tensions and contradictions at the local level as national policies are implemented. The thesis results inform proposed strategies for future national park <b>management</b> <b>and</b> local resource conservation and utilization in Thailand. Qualitative research approaches were the most appropriate methodological choice to investigate and analyse perceptions, objectives, values, practices of different groups. Informal conversational interview, semi-structured interview and unstructured direct observation were the techniques for key data collection. Discourse analysis was the main analytical method. The results show that there are two main conservation concepts influencing conservation policy and implementation in and around the national park case study. One concept is the orthodox national park model based on conservation by excluding humans from a conservation area, and the other is a newer conservation concept based on the ideas of sustainability, participation, and biological conservation that accept humans as part of ecosystems. The two different concepts produce different cultures, discourses and practices in the Thai conservation system. A key issue demonstrated in this study is that the orthodox national park model plays a role as a cornerstone and strong influence on the culture of the Thai natural resource conservation system. As a result, the rights, interests, needs and values of indigenous people are marginalised by national park officials in national park management. Although, the new conservation concept that supports interests of indigenous people is accepted in the park policy, in practice it is devalued by the national park officials. The idea and form of the national park cannot be divorced from its social origins. The idea of the national park as a space of wilderness or pristine nature is had to sustain. vii viii Rather, it is a cultural landscape that embodies multiple cultural constructions of people and nature by both park officials and indigenous villagers. There are tensions and contradictions between these cultural groups. The tensions and contradictions are based on different values of the role of park resources for utilization or protection. This study suggests that the villagers and their uses of park resources should be considered to a greater extent on social equality grounds. Their <b>management</b> <b>and</b> use of resources needs to be recognized in <b>local</b> natural resource <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> In addition, the park policy makers should renew national park management to integrate with the two different conservation concepts. They should accept the values of villagers who live in and adjacent to the national park and take them into account in national park policy and implementation. In this study, models of joint management are offered as an alternative to current Thai national park management. This can support both the needs and values of villagers and those of ecological conservation...|$|R

40|$|Queensland University of Technology has radically {{restructured}} the top-level governance {{systems for}} information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> Additionally, QUT has integrated information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> with physical infrastructure <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> via the Asset Management Plan. To complete the approach, QUT has instigated a top-level governance committee for IT to ensure alignment with organisational goals and strategies. This {{is an unusual}} development for IT <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> at an Australian university and attracted attention from the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) {{as well as other}} universities in the Australian tertiary education sector and led to the research study. This research studies the redevelopment of the information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> approach. The survey research determines the level of integration of IT <b>and</b> university <b>planning,</b> <b>and</b> the correlation of this integration to effectiveness of IT planning. The case study documents the changes, highlights {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the new approach and provides a model for change in IT management at other Australian universities. It is evident from current literature on information technology <b>management</b> <b>and</b> strategic <b>planning</b> that these developments are validated as steps toward achieving best practice in information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> Through rigorous conduct of interviews, observations and review of documentation and through application of a survey questionnaire to a defined population, the research reviews the developments and ongoing implementation of the <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> infrastructure. Among the outcomes from the new approach are better alignment of information technology investment with QUT goals and objectives, better benefits realisation from information technology investment, better project management of information technology development and innovation, and increased flexibility and accountability in information technology expenditure. Finally, a comparison to other information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> methods in place at Australian universities demonstrates the uniqueness of the QUT approach. The thesis reports the benefits and difficulties associated with this approach, and provides a context for future development of IT <b>planning,</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> governance at QUT...|$|R
