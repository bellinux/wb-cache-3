Paz will stay overnight at Pappy's and Big Penguin will be home tomorrow. Paz thinks that sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> and runs and hides in his tree house. Big Penguin joins Paz in the tree house and they talk about why Big Penguin has to go on the overnight trip, about her work, and that Paz will have more fun with Pappy. Paz isn't convinced so Big Penguin comes up with an idea: they'll have a telephone rendezvous, a special time for them to talk on the phone. Big Penguin has another idea and they make a book of pictures that shows time passing: Paz and Pappy having fun together, eating dinner and playing Pappy's tuba, Paz talking on the phone to Big Penguin, Pappy tucking Paz into bed... Big Penguin adds one more picture to Paz's book: a picture of her coming home and giving Paz a big hug. While Big Penguin is on her business trip, Paz can open his book and find out where they are in the story. For her part, Big Penguin will wear a locket with Paz's picture inside - so Paz will always be with her.|$|E

If we could stay in WA then we would but we can't afford it - especially touring. We would get over to the east two or three times every year, and whatever buzz we could generate would dissipate before we could capitalise on it.

Singles released from this album were, [...] "Drink 'til You Drown", [...] "Occupation" [...] and [...] "Ashes". The release was followed by heavy touring by the band and by the beginning of 2008 they had clocked up over 250 shows. They commenced recording their fourth album in early 2008.

Although this seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> the saxophone is one of the newer instruments in the musical spectrum. It was invented by and named for Antoine-Joseph (Adolphe) Sax. He was an expert instrument maker and talented musician. The saxophone was patented on March 20, 1846. It has since become a necessity in every band due to its tonal beauty and versatility. Sax grew up in the trade of instrument making. His father was an expert in instrument making. By the age of six, Sax had already become an expert in it as well. Sax, being the musician he was, became aware of the tonal disparity between strings and winds: moreover, that between brasses and woodwinds. The strings were being overpowered by the winds and the woodwinds were being overblow...|$|E
