40|$|This paper {{uses the}} <b>License</b> <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> (LOR) {{provision}} implemented in Section 23 of the German Patent Act {{to answer the}} following questions: What is the distribution of the private value of the right to exclude others provided by a patent? What are the welfare implications of having a <b>License</b> <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> system? Section 23 of the German Patent Act grants a patentee a 50 % reduction on the annual renewal fees if he voluntarily allows anyone to use the invention only in return for reasonable compensation. We build a parametric discrete choice model of patent renewal and LOR declaration to exploit data on granted German patent applications from 1983 - 1988. Our estimates show that the distribution {{of the value of the}} right to exclude others is very skewed and its relative importance rises with patent age. For most patent owners the exclusion right is very valuable. Nevertheless, for a small fraction of patents a commitment to license non-exclusively may even increase the returns from patent protection. The welfare implications of the <b>License</b> <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> system in Germany are twofold. It increases the private value of patent rights but lowers the patent office's revenues. Furthermore, we are able to distinguish between two motives for declaring LOR, the cost-saving and the commitment motive. The fractio...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{economic}} rationale for compulsory <b>licensing</b> <b>of</b> needed medicines in developing countries. The patent system {{is based on}} a trade-off between the “deadweight losses” caused by market power and the incentive to innovate created by increased profits from monopoly pricing during the period of the patent. However, markets for essential medicines under patent in developing countries with high income inequality are characterized by highly convex demand curves, producing large deadweight losses relative to potential profits when monopoly firms exercise profit-maximizing pricing strategies. As a result, these markets are systematically ill-suited to exclusive marketing rights, a problem which can be corrected through compulsory licensing. Open licenses that permit any qualified firm to supply the market on the same terms, such as may be available under <b>licenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> or essential facility legal standards, can be used to mitigate the negative effects of government-granted patents, thereby increasing overall social welfare...|$|R

50|$|A {{transfer}} or licence {{may have}} to meet particular formal requirements {{in order to be}} effective, for example under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive <b>licenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> Thus exclusive <b>licenses,</b> to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under U.S. law. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a real estate transaction.|$|R

40|$|The new {{technologies}} of digitalization and the Internet threaten the market positions {{of artists and}} intermediaries. Artists because the technology of production of works may be readily accessible and craftsmanship {{may no longer be}} a defining characteristic of art. Intermediaries because their rents are linked to entry barriers in the distribution market. This curse of {{new technologies}} may be a blessing in disguise since it also increases the possibilities of production, of distribution and the emergence of new works of art. The system of intellectual protection gives market power to artists and the economic literature has analyzed the tradeoff between the dynamic inefficiency generated by this market power and the need to preserve the incentives for creation. We review this literature and some of its recent applications to artistic, and more generally intellectual, creation. Even if artists can capture perfectly the market value of the future home production by consumers, they may favor a strong copyright regime that prevents consumers from using their home production. Intermediaries and artists may want to limit competition in order to increase the rents brought by the indivisibility of creative ideas. The preferences of artists for strong or weaker form (e. g., <b>licensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> for home production) of copyright may be related to their creativity. ...|$|R

50|$|On October 2, 2006, the <b>license</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> for the Grand Slam of Curling {{was sold}} to Insight Sports Ltd. but was later sold again in August 2012 to Rogers Communications. The WCT naming rights were then sold to Asham, a long time {{contributor}} to the sport, until 2014 and because of this, the World Curling Tour was renamed Asham’s World Curling Tour. The Grand slam was originally simply called the Grand Slam of Curling until 2008 when the rights were sold by the CBC to Capital One bank which renamed the Grand Slam the Capitol One grand Slam of Curling. Unlike the other World Curling Tour events, these Grand Slams they are played in 8-end games {{as opposed to the}} usual 10 end games found in the other WCT events. Another new rule that was first put into practice at the men’s nationals in 2014 is the 5 rock rule which increased the 4 rock rule and free guard zone rule by another rock. This changed the starting strategy of the game as the team with the hammer was able to throw up two guards uncontested instead of the usual 1 allowed with the previously used 4 rock rule. Through the addition of the Grand slam events and the new rule changes, the WCT is rapidly becoming a well known series to sports fans worldwide.|$|R
