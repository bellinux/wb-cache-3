The ASA has authority to require publishers to remove offending advertising materials if they are found in violation of ASA standards. In the No Man's Sky complaints directed at Hello Games and Valve, the ASA specifically evaluated materials used on the Steam store page to promote the game that demonstrate features that {{do not appear to be}} a part of the final game, but has also reviewed other official promotional outlets including the game's official YouTube channel. Several game industry lawyers, speaking to PC Gamer, noted that while the ASA has successfully taken action in previous cases of false advertising, demonstrating such for a procedurally-generated game of No Man's Sky scope may be difficult since it is impossible to play the entire game to prove something does not exist. The lawyers also noted that most of what Murray and other Hello Games members said outside of any official promotional channels, such as interviews or through social media, cannot be taken as part of the game's advertising, further <b>limiting</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> that the ASA can act on. The ASA ruled in November 2016 that the Steam storepage advertising of No Man's Sky was not in breach of their standards, attributing the used footage and screenshots to be reasonable representative of the average player's experience with a procedurally-generated game, and dismissed the submitted complaints; the ASA further ruled that as Valve has no control over what Hello Games included on the store page, they were not liable for the material either.|$|E

The Southern Homestead Act opened up the transfer of public land in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, with the hope of providing land to freedmen by <b>limiting</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> to 80 acre for the first 2 years (Pope 1970:203).|$|E

Cognitively these actions involve generalizations of phenomena and situations, declaration of positions, abstraction of details and actions, summarization of various matters and the like ((Peled 2001): 81), {{all of which are}} produced by, among others, complex syntactic structures suchy as cause-effect, generalization, abstraction, contrast, comparison, condition or concession; in other words, these are complex main clauses possessing logico-semantic connectors, expressing high levels of subordination and cohesion with respect to the flow of information, thus leading the reader to create a coherent mental map of the text.|$|R

40|$|Some {{novel foods}} and {{ingredients}} provide significantly less energy than traditional fats and carbohydrates. The use of energy conversion factors existing in food labelling regulations {{to determine the}} labelling requirements of foods that contain them can mislead consumers. The requirement to use factors <b>limits</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> {{that can be made}} for such foods, even scientifically justifiable ones, and in turn inhibits the development of new products and processes to the ultimate detriment of both manufacturer and consumer. Where the energy value of a food ingredient lies outside the range of the variability for the traditional food ingredient, the scientifically determined value provides a more accurate description of the food ingredient energy value for nutrition labelling.

This volume offers a pan-European survey that encompasses Switzerland, Prussia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Britain. It explores how the conception of belonging changed over time and space from the 1500 s onwards, how communities dealt with the welfare expectations of an increasingly mobile population that migrated both within and between states, the welfare rights that were attached to those who “belonged,” and how ordinary people secured access to welfare resources. What emerged was a sophisticated European settlement system, which on the one hand structured itself to <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of <b>the</b> poor, and yet on the other was peculiarly sensitive to their demands and negotiations...|$|R

An unambiguous interpretation of how to apply EBM 2 ̆ 7 s hierarchy has not been provided in the clinical literature. However, {{as much as an}} interpretation is provided proponents suggest a categorical interpretation. The categorical interpretation holds that all the results of randomised trials always trump evidence from lower down the hierarchy when it comes to informing therapeutic decisions. Most of the critical replies to EBM react to this interpretation. While proponents of EBM can avoid some of the problems raised by critics by suitably <b>limited</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> made on behalf of the hierarchy, further problems arise. If EBM is to inform therapeutic decisions then a considerably more restricted, and context dependent interpretation of EBM 2 ̆ 7 s hierarchy is needed...|$|R

Notwithstanding the Codice del Processo Amministrativo (Administrative Procedural Code) failed to introduce the therefore mentioned azione di adempimento, the Court upholds that a general injunctive action, such as the one provided by art. 30 c. p. a., does include the order to issue an administrative decision.

40|$|Helios is {{a web-based}} {{end-to-end}} verifiable electronic voting system {{which has been}} said to be suitable for low-coercion environments.

In this work, we investigate how the issue of ballot stuffing can be addressed with minimum change to the current vote casting experience in Helios and we argue formally about the security of our techniques. Our ideas are intuitive and general enough to be applied in the context of other Internet voting scheme and they also address recent attacks exploiting the malleability of ballots in Helios...|$|R
