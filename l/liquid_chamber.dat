5000|$|The {{cartomizer}} {{was invented}} in 2007, integrating the heating coil into the <b>liquid</b> <b>chamber.</b> A [...] "cartomizer" [...] (a portmanteau of cartridge and atomizer.) or [...] "carto" [...] consists of an atomizer surrounded by a liquid-soaked poly-foam that acts as an e-liquid holder. They can have up to 3 coils and each coil will increase vapor production. The cartomizer is usually discarded when the e-liquid starts to taste burnt, which usually happens when the e-cigarette is activated with a dry coil or when the cartomizer gets consistently flooded (gurgling) because of sedimentation of the wick. Most cartomizers are refillable even if not advertised as such.|$|E

This is a mechanism that integrates the heating coil into the <b>liquid</b> <b>chamber.</b> They launched this new device in the UK in 2008 under their Gamucci brand, and the design is now widely adopted by most [...] "cigalike" [...] brands. Other users tinkered with various parts to produce more satisfactory homemade devices, and the hobby of [...] "modding" [...] was born. The first mod to replace the e-cigarette's case to accommodate a longer-lasting battery, dubbed the [...] "screwdriver", was developed by Ted and Matt Rogers in 2008. Other enthusiasts built their own mods to improve functionality or aesthetics.

When the work on the magnet finished the magnet group became the Nuclear Physics Apparatus Division in 1961. At this time they turned towards making the PS usable as an experimental device, and in the course of time a number of projects took shape: the heavy-liquid bubble chamber, enhanced neutrino beam, electrostatic separators. The bubble chamber has a volume of 500 litres, is still now to this day the largest heavy <b>liquid</b> <b>chamber</b> operating in a magnetic field at its time. Completed in 1960 it was used in CERN's first neutrino experiments. The electrostatic separators built by Colin’s division gave CERN some of the world’s highest-energy beams of separated particles, as well as leading to research into the basic principles of high-voltage breakdown.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{performance}} of <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chambers,</b> which {{may prove to}} be useful tools in the field of radiation dosimetry, is based on several <b>chamber</b> and <b>liquid</b> specific characteristics. The present work investigates the {{performance of}} the PTW microLion <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chamber</b> with respect to recombination losses and perturbations from ambient electric fields at various dose rates in continuous beams. Methods: In the investigation, experiments were performed using two microLion chambers, containing isooctane (C 8 H 18) and tetramethylsilane (Si(CH 3) 4) as the sensitive media, and a NACP- 02 monitor chamber. An initial activity of approximately 250 GBq 18 F was employed as the radiation source in the experiments. The initial dose rate in each measurement series was estimated to 1. 0 Gy min- 1 by Monte Carlo simulations and the measurements were carried out during the decay of the radioactive source. In the investigation of general recombination losses, employing the two-dose-rate method for continuous beams, the <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chambers</b> were operated at polarizing voltages 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 V. Furthermore, measurements were also performed at 500 V polarizing voltage in the investigation of the sensitivity of the microLion chamber to ambient electric fields. Results: The measurement results from the <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chambers,</b> corrected for general recombination losses according to the two-dose-rate method for continuous beams, had a good agreement with the signal to dose linearity from the NACP- 02 monitor chamber for general collection efficiencies above 70 %. The results also displayed an agreement with the theoretical collection efficiencies according to the Greening theory, except for the <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chamber</b> containing isooctane operated at 25 V. At lower dose rates, perturbations from ambient electric fields were found in the microLion chamber measurement results. Due to the perturbations, measurement results below an estimated dose rate of 0. 2 Gy min- 1 were excluded from the present investigation of the general collection efficiency. The perturbations were found to be more pronounced when the chamber polarizing voltage was increased. Conclusions: By using the two-dose-rate method for continuous beams, comparable corrected ionization currents from experiments in low- and medium energy photon beams can be achieved. However, the valid range of general collection efficiencies has been found to vary in a comparison between experiments performed in continuous beams of 120 kVp x-ray, and the present investigation of 511 keV annihilation photons. At very high dose rates in continuous beams, there are presently no methods {{that can be used to}} correct for general recombination losses and at low dose rates the microLion chamber may be perturbed by ambient electric fields. Increasing the chamber polarizing voltage, which diminishes the general recombination effect, was found to increase the microLion chamber sensitivity to ambient electric fields. Prudence is thus advised when employing the microLion chamber in radiation dosimetry, as ambient electric fields of the strength observed in the present work may be found in many common situations. Due to uncertainties in the theoretical basis for recombination losses in liquids, further studies on the underlying theories for the initial and general recombination effect are needed if <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chambers</b> are to become a viable option in high precision radiation dosimetry...|$|R

A statistical difference (P< 0. 001) was noted between the mean values of the liquids (CR, PGN, KMA), although the individual values had a wide spread. The powder variation was very small based on the spread. A statistical difference exist (P< 0. 0001) between the means of the recorded powder weights of CR (0. 45 g), PGN (0. 37 g) and KMA (0. 29 g).

Removal of the filter results in available dose rates up to 24 Gy min(- 1) (for nominal energy 10 MV in depth of maximum dose, a source-surface distance of 100 cm and a field size of 10 × 10 cm 2). To guarantee accurate relative and reference dosimetry for the FFF beams, we investigated the charge collection efficiency of multiple air-vented and one <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chamber</b> for dose rates up to 31. 9 Gy min(- 1). For flattened beams, the ion-collection efficiency of all air-vented ionization chambers (except for the PinPoint chamber) was above 0. 995. By removing the flattening filter, we found a reduction in collection efficiency of approximately 0. 5 - 0. 9 % for a 10 MV beam. For FFF beams, the Markus chamber showed the largest collection efficiency of 0. 994. The observed collection efficiencies were dependent on dose per pulse, but independent of the pulse repetition frequency. Using the <b>liquid</b> ionization <b>chamber,</b> the ion-collection efficiency for flattened beams was above 0. 990 for all dose rates. However, this chamber showed a low collection efficiency of 0. 940 for the FFF 10 MV beam at a dose rate of 31. 9 Gy min(- 1). All investigated air-vented ionization chambers can be reliably used for relative dosimetry of FFF beams. The order of correction for reference dosimetry is given in the manuscript.
