5|$|Among Western Europeans, {{there had}} long been rumors and {{expectations}} that a great Christian ally would come from the East. These rumors circulated {{as early as the}} First Crusade (1096–1099), and usually surged in popularity after the Crusaders lost a battle. A legend arose about a figure known as Prester John, who lived in far-off India, Central Asia, or perhaps even Ethiopia. This legend developed a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> and some individuals who came from the East were greeted with expectations that they might be forces sent by the long-awaited Prester John. In 1210, news reached the West of the battles of the Mongol Kuchlug (d. 1218), leader of the largely Christian tribe of the Naimans. Kuchlug's forces had been battling the powerful Khwarezmian Empire, whose leader was the Muslim Muhammad II of Khwarezm. Rumors circulated in Europe that Kuchlug was the mythical Prester John, again battling the Muslims in the East.|$|E
5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in , and yet another appears in , as well as in A Link Between Worlds.|$|E
5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often {{seems to have a}} <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own...</b> Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E

50|$|It {{was decided}} by the Sacred Congregation of Studies (1917), {{that it should be}} {{completely}} separated from the Venerable English College, and that it should have a corporate <b>life</b> entirely <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> under a rector and staff <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> and in <b>its</b> <b>own</b> premises. Pending the acquisition of a permanent home, temporary premises were rented in the Prati di Castello from the Polish Hospice. Mgr Mann was brought from England to be the new rector, and the Rev. J. C. Richards was appointed vice-rector. The Bede students took up their new quarters on 2 January 1918.|$|R
5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses {{end up in the}} possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E

50|$|According to the National Geographic, a group's culture defines <b>its</b> way <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and <b>its</b> <b>own</b> view <b>of</b> {{itself and}} other groups.

25|$|Swami Parijñānāshram III was {{one who had}} a keen {{thirst for}} knowledge-be it Vedic or technical.

6000|$|That great {{event was}} the Crusades. We have heard little of Alexandria lately. Its {{intellectual}} glory had departed westward and eastward, to Cordova and to Bagdad; its commercial greatness {{had left it}} for Cairo and Damietta. But Egypt was still the centre of communication between the two great stations of the Moslem power, and indeed, as Mr. Lane has shown in his most valuable translation of the [...] "Arabian Nights," [...] possessed a peculiar <b>life</b> and character <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b>|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time the team of Dow Chemicals, Nova and Dome put {{together}} the Alberta Ethane Project.

And the plan took on a political <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> since it offered the opportunity for value-added products to be manufactured in Alberta for export.

25|$|Asturias {{was one of}} {{the first}} Latin American novelists to realize the {{enormous}} potential of language in literature. He had a very profound linguistic style that he employed to convey his literary vision. In his works, language is more than a form of expression or a means to an end and can be quite abstract. Language does not give life to his work, rather the organic language Asturias uses has a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> within his work ("El lenguage tiene vida propia").|$|E
60|$|Suffice {{it to say}} that, {{like the}} oaks <b>of</b> <b>its</b> avenue, Outram was such a house as can only be found in England; no mere mass of bricks and mortar, but a thing {{that seemed to have}} {{acquired}} a <b>life</b> and individuality <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b> Or, if this saying be too far-fetched and poetical, at the least this venerable home bore some stamp and trace of the lives and individualities of many generations of mankind, linked together in thought and feeling by the common bond of blood.|$|R

25|$|Also in January 2001, Nupedia started Wikipedia as a side-project {{to allow}} {{collaboration}} on articles {{before entering the}} peer review process. This attracted interest from both sides, as it provided the less bureaucratic structure favored by advocates of the GNE encyclopedia. As a result, GNE never really developed, {{and the threat of}} competition between the projects was averted. As Wikipedia grew and attracted contributors, it quickly developed a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> and began to function largely independently of Nupedia, although Sanger initially led activity on Wikipedia by virtue of his position as Nupedia's editor-in-chief.|$|E

5000|$|Scored for baritone, male chorus and orchestra, {{the symphony}} {{could be argued}} to be a symphonic cantata or orchestral song cycle rather than a choral symphony. The music, while having a <b>life</b> and logic <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> remains closely welded to the texts. The chorus, used {{consistently}} in unison, often creates {{the impression of a}} choral recitation, while the solo baritone's passages create a similar impression of [...] "speech-song." [...] However, Shostakovich provides a solid symphonic framework for the work - a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale; fully justifying it as a symphony.|$|R
60|$|The {{chair in}} which Hilda sat {{was near the}} {{portrait}} of Beatrice Cenci, which {{had not yet been}} taken from the easel. It is a peculiarity of this picture, that its profoundest expression eludes a straightforward glance, and can only be caught by side glimpses, or when the eye falls casually upon it; even as if the painted face had a <b>life</b> and consciousness <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> and, resolving not to betray <b>its</b> secret <b>of</b> grief or guilt, permitted the true tokens to come forth only when it imagined itself unseen. No other such magical effect has ever been wrought by pencil.|$|R
25|$|One Franquin {{creation}} {{that went}} on to develop a <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> was the Marsupilami, a fictional monkey-like creature with a tremendously long prehensile tail.
