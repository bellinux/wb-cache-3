5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E

The women spent the first winter in Italy and studied printmaking with Carlo Raimondi, who taught engraving at the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma. Sartain {{spent the rest of}} the four-year stay in Paris and studied under Évariste Vital Luminais. She shared a studio with Jeanne Rongier. Florence Esté, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, when she ran out of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education. Emily believed Hattie was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> help with education expenses in Philadelphia where expenses were lower and she would more likely sell her works.|$|E

25|$|To {{put this}} into a {{biological}} systems context, some physiology is required. In the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells proliferate and die rapidly. The division of these cells occurs {{at the base of}} villi, and cells are pushed upwards by subsequent divisions to the tip where they enter apoptosis and shed off into the lumen. Netrin-1 is produced in the base of the villi, so a gradient of netrin is present that is weakest at the tip. In normal physiology, the presence of netrin-1 inhibits DCC-mediated cell death until the epithelial cell reaches the tip of the villus, where the now unbound DCC causes the cell to enter apoptosis. In a cancer state, the absence of DCC prevents the gradient from having an effect on the cell, making it more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> survive.|$|E
25|$|The ICD-11 and DSM-5 {{are being}} {{developed}} {{at the start of}} the 21st century. Any radical new developments in classification are said to be more likely to be introduced by the APA than by the WHO, mainly because the former only has to persuade its own board of trustees whereas the latter has to persuade the representatives of over 200 different countries at a formal revision conference. In addition, while the DSM is a bestselling publication that makes huge profits for APA, the WHO incurs major expense in determining international consensus for revisions to the ICD. Although there is an ongoing attempt to reduce trivial or accidental differences between the DSM and ICD, it is thought that the APA and the WHO are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> produce new versions of their manuals and, in some respects, to compete with one another.|$|E

2500|$|While it is {{difficult}} to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%.

Land transformation has increased rapidly over the last fifty years, and is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> increase. Beyond direct transformation of land area, humans have impacted the global biogeochemical cycles, leading to human caused change in even the most remote areas. These include addition of nutrients such nitrogen and phosphorus, acid rain, ocean acidification, redistribution of water resources, and increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and speciation events caused by formation of land bridges and colliding of continents.|$|E
