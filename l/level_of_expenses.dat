40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} whether the {{substitution}} of employee stock options (ESOs) for debt occurs for firms with different tax status classifications throughout the conditional distribution <b>of</b> interest <b>expense</b> {{before and after the}} implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123 R (SFAS 123 R). Design/methodology/approach – This study uses Censored Quantile Regression (CQR) to assess whether the substitution effect is dependent on firms 2 ̆ 7 position in the conditional distribution <b>of</b> interest <b>expense.</b> Our sample firms are categorized into two groups: one group (tax‐sensitive) that is sensitive to additional deductions due to a moderate income level and the other group (tax‐insatiable) that is not sensitive because of very high income level. Findings – The substitution effect is not present for firms with below medium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense.</b> Only tax‐sensitive firms substitute at medium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense</b> while both tax‐sensitive and tax‐insatiable firms substitute at high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense.</b> Tax‐insatiable firms with very high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense</b> also substitute; however, tax‐sensitive firms with very high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense</b> only substitute after SFAS 123 R required firms to report ESO expense in financial statements. We attribute the substitution patterns revealed by the CQR analysis to a positive relationship between interest <b>expense</b> and cost <b>of</b> debt. Originality/value – To the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze firms 2 ̆ 7 tax status classification impact on the substitution <b>of</b> ESO <b>expense</b> for interest <b>expense</b> across different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense.</b> Our application <b>of</b> CQR should benefit researchers who are interested in examining explanatory variables 2 ̆ 7 impact at various points in the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. This study also refines the conjecture that ESOs are substitutes for debt by demonstrating that such relationship is dependent on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>expense</b> and tax status. Furthermore, the finding of firms substituting ESOs for debt provides accounting standard setters a reason to begin requiring firms to re‐measure the value of ESOs after the grant date until the exercise date...|$|R

30|$|Using panel data {{including}} {{information related}} to the 26 Swiss cantons for the period 1980 – 2013, we estimate two different models {{in order to measure}} the likely impact of depreciations management on the government’s financial performance. AD is our main explanatory variable, and it is constructed {{on the basis of the}} amount of ‘additional depreciation charges’ that were recorded at the end of each of these years and that we identified in each canton’s financial reports. The first model is a single-equation model where the financial performance (deficit or surplus) is the dependent variable. Then, we perform a simultaneous-equation model where the level of revenues and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> are simultaneously estimated. The advantage of the second approach is that it disentangles the respective possible effect of depreciations management on revenues and expenses. The results show that a positive and significant correlation exists between previous additional ‘depreciation’ charges and the subsequent level of revenues, whereas a negative correlation exists with the level of subsequent expenses, with a similar order of magnitude. Consequently, depreciations management seems to produce a significant positive impact on the future balance.|$|E

Our approach precisely separates mutual funds into those having (1) unskilled, (2) zeroalpha, and (3) skilled fund managers, net of expenses, even with cross-fund dependencies in estimated alphas. This separation into skill groups allows several new insights. First, {{we find that the}} majority of funds (75. 4 %) pick stocks well enough to cover their trading costs and other expenses, producing a zero alpha, consistent with the equilibrium model of Berk and Green (2004). Further, we find a significant proportion of skilled (positive alpha) funds prior to 1996, but almost none by 2006, accompanied by a large increase in unskilled (negative alpha) fund managers—due both to a large reduction in the proportion of fund managers with stockpicking skills and to a persistent <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> that exceed the value generated by these managers. Finally, we show that controlling for false discoveries substantially improves the ability to find funds with persistent performance.

40|$|Copy cat {{investment}} strategies {{exist in}} the US, where copy cat funds profitably replicate the investing behaviour of larger more renowned funds, leveraging off research completed by the initial fund, without incurring the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses.</b> Funds, or unit trusts as they are known in South Africa, are mandated to disclose portfolio holdings quarterly, {{with the intention of}} enabling investors to track whether funds are meeting their stated objectives, through more frequent access to portfolio holdings. More frequent disclosure has lead to significant controversy internationally, with some researchers providing evidence that more frequent disclosure has lead to copy cat investing strategies. In contrast to the research completed in the US, copy cat funds in South Africa are able to generate similar returns, before costs, but once costs are included t-tests provided evidence that the copy cat fund was not able to generate significantly higher returns than the actual fund, particularly in the long run. These tests hold true when considering the whole general equity market, but interestingly do not hold statistically valid for every fund when considering them in isolation. Certain funds within the general equity classification offer potential for copy cat investing and have successfully proven outperformance in the last decade. Copy cat investors would need to seek out these funds based on the predicted outperformance of each fund, by considering the historical behaviour and then lastly by considering their own, already questionable, risk appetite.

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a theory and a model for {{assessing}} the financial health of public water systems. Using financial information from 25 water utilities in Georgia, the paper seeks to identify the causal relationships between the financial performance of a water utility and its fiscal position. The need for a theoretical understanding of water utility financial health is the result of the increasingly stringent performance requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The issue has become particularly important for small water systems which will be exposed to significant financial demands. A set of fmancial ratios was developed and tested in a model that was based on liquid asset theory. The model contained five variables designed to account for liquid assets, current debt, cash-flow, and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses.</b> The variables fit the need of water utilities to provide an adequate level of operation and maintenance to meet current and future system needs as well as SDWA standards.
