25|$|The {{decline in}} the value of the U.S. dollar {{corresponds}} to price inflation, which is a rise in the general <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. A consumer price index (CPI) is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households. The United States Consumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the United States. It reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses. A graph showing the U.S. CPI relative to 1982–1984 and the annual year-over-year change in CPI is shown at right.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, {{more than}} 100 cancer specialists {{published}} {{a letter in}} Blood saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, are so high {{that people in the}} United States couldn't afford them, and that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. [...] They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at $30,000 a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. [...] They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to $92,000 per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. [...] Other physicians have complained about the cost. By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to $120,000 a year, according to an analysis prepared for the Washington Post by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them.|$|E

The regulation, however, feeds back into firms' strategies, resulting in lower equilibrium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> comparison.

The average <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> distortions decreased in 1991 and 1992 after price and trade liberalization, but increased again in 1993 {{as many of these}} countries re-introduced protectionist price and trade policy measures.
