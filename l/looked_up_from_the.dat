2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stove and said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'" ...|$|E
