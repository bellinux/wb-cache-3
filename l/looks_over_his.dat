500|$|Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden's 1993 book, Trust Me: Charles Keating and the Missing Billions, also {{presents}} Keating {{as a complex}} individual with contradictory tendencies, and concludes:Charlie Keating built things, and, at some level that haunts anyone who <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> records, he thought his schemes would work. He did not simply rob a bank. He broke a bank with his dreams. If he is simply a thief, why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply {{trying to make a}} profit and create jobs, why the need for jets, fancy meals, big paychecks to his family? If he is such a devout communicant of his faith, why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy? ...|$|E
2500|$|Love Imprisoned {{features}} a nude woman, {{seated on the}} ground, who has bound Cupid between two trees with a garland of flowers. [...] The annoyed deity <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder at his captor, whose back is to the viewer.|$|E
2500|$|The image {{may be a}} relief, or free-standing, {{and side}} details may be present or omitted. [...] The centre-piece is Mithras clothed in Anatolian costume and wearing a Phrygian cap; who is {{kneeling}} on the exhausted [...] bull, holding it by the nostrils [...] with his left hand, and stabbing it with his right. As he does so, he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. A raven is flying around or {{is sitting on the}} bull. Three ears of wheat are seen coming out from the bull's tail, sometimes from the wound. The bull was often white. The god is sitting on the bull in an unnatural way with his right leg constraining the bull's hoof and the left leg is bent and resting on the bull's back or flank. The two torch-bearers are on either side, dressed like Mithras, Cautes with his torch pointing up and Cautopates with his torch pointing down. Sometimes Cautes and Cautopates carry shepherds' crooks instead of torches.|$|E

["After {{both sets}} of prayers, Farz and Sunnah, the Moslem <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> right shoulder, and says, 'The Peace (of Allah) be upon you and the ruth of Allah,' and repeats the words over the left shoulder.

Burton, 1887: Supplemental Nights, i. 14, note.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told you}} about the fat yellow dog that {{permeated}} the Tuxton's house, didn't I? The family thought a lot of that dog, though of all the ugly brutes I ever met he was the worst. Sniffing round and growling all the time. Well, this evening he comes up to Jerry just as he's going to sit down, and starts to growl. Old Pa Tuxton <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> glasses and licks his tongue. [...] "Rover! Rover!" [...] he says, kind of mild. [...] "Naughty Rover; he don't like strangers, I'm afraid." [...] Jerry looks at Pa Tuxton, and he looks at the dog, and I'm just expecting him to say [...] "No" [...] or [...] "Yes", same as the other night, when he lets out a nasty laugh--one of them bitter laughs. [...] "Ho!" [...] he says. [...] "Ho! don't he? Then perhaps he'd better get further away from them." [...] And he ups with his boot and--well, the dog hit the far wall.|$|E

60|$|You see, Peter's tail is, {{nothing but}} a funny little bunch of cotton, which doesn't look like a tail at all. The only time he ever sees it is when he is back to the Smiling Pool and <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} at {{his reflection in the}} water, and then, of course, he really doesn't see his tail itself. So sometimes when Peter sees the fine tails of his neighbors, a little bit of envy creeps into his heart for just a little while. Why, even little Danny Meadow Mouse has a real tail, short as it is. And as for Happy Jack Squirrel and Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk, everybody knows what beautiful tails they have. Once Peter thought about it so much that Grandfather Frog noticed how sober he was and asked Peter what the trouble was. When Peter told him that {{it seemed to him that}} Old Mother Nature had not been fair in giving him such a foolish little tail when she had given others such beautiful ones, Grandfather Frog just opened his big mouth and laughed until he had to hold his sides.|$|E

"It {{would be}} a crime against the public interest," [...] {{answered}} his friend; [...] "there can no mischief happen between two such originals, which {{will not be a}} positive benefit to society, and particularly to the Chevalier's establishment, as he calls it. I have been as sick of that captain's buff belt, and red doublet, for this month past, as e'er I was of aught; and now I hope this bold linendraper will cudgel the ass out of that filthy lion's hide. See, Nigel, see the gallant citizen has ta'en his ground about a bowl's-cast forward, {{in the midst of the}} alley--the very model of a hog in armour. Behold how he prances with his manly foot, and brandishes his blade, much as if he were about to measure forth cambric with it. See, they bring on the reluctant soldado, and plant him opposite to his fiery antagonist, twelve paces still dividing them--Lo, the captain draws his tool, but, like a good general, <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder to secure his retreat, in case the worse come on't. Behold the valiant shop-keeper stoops his head, confident, doubtless, in the civic helmet with which his spouse has fortified his skull--Why, this is the rarest of sport. By Heaven, he will run a tilt at him, like a ram." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{this kind}} of composition, of which the two years' product is now laid before the public, fail in art, as it {{constantly}} does and must, it at least {{has the advantage of}} a certain truth and honesty, which a work more elaborate might lose. In his constant communication with the reader, the writer is forced into frankness of expression, and to speak out his own mind and feelings as they urge him. Many a slip of the pen and the printer, many a word spoken in haste, he sees and would recall as he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> volume. It is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader, which must often be dull, must often flag. In the course of his volubility, the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses, vanities, peculiarities. And as we judge of a man's character, after long frequenting his society, not by one speech, or by one mood or opinion, or by one day's talk, but by the tenor of his general bearing and conversation; so of a writer, who delivers himself up to you perforce unreservedly, you say, Is he honest? Does he tell the truth in the main? Does he seem actuated by a desire to find out and speak it? Is he a quack, who shams sentiment, or mouths for effect? Does he seek popularity by claptraps or other arts? I can no more ignore good fortune than any other chance which has befallen me. I have found many thousands more readers than I ever looked for. I have no right to say to these, You shall not find fault with my art, or fall asleep over my pages; but I ask you to believe that this person writing strives to tell the truth. If there is not that, there is nothing.|$|E

60|$|But {{the case}} differs {{materially}} in the debtor {{side of the}} account; for here the tradesman, who with all his boasts of keeping his books exactly, has yet no ledger, which being, as I have said, duly posted, should show every man's account at one view; and being done every week, left it scarce possible to omit any parcel that was once entered in the day-book or journal--I say, the tradesman keeping no ledger, he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> day-book for the whole year past, to draw up the debtor side of his customer's account, and there being a great many parcels, truly he overlooks {{one or two of}} them, or suppose but one of them, and gives the chapman the account, in which he sums up his debtor side so much, suppose £136, 10s.: the chapman examining this by his book, as he did the cash, finds two parcels, one £7, 15s., and the other £9, 13s., omitted; so that by his own book his debtor side was £153, 18s.; but being a cunning sharp tradesman, and withal not exceeding honest, 'Well, well,' says he to himself, 'if Mr G. says it is no more than £136, 10s. what have I to do to contradict him? it is none of my business to keep his books for him; it is time enough for me to reckon for it when he charges me.' So he goes back to him the next day, and settles accounts with him, pays him the balance in good bills which he brought up with him for that purpose, takes a receipt in full of all accounts and demands to such a day of the month, and the next day comes and looks out another parcel of goods, and so begins an account for the next year, like a current chapman, and has the credit of an extraordinary customer that pays well, and clears his accounts every year; which he had not done had he not seen the advantage, and so strained himself to pay, that he might get a receipt in full of all accounts.|$|E
60|$|Among {{what may}} be called the Cubs or minor Lions of Rome, there was one that amused me mightily. It is always to be found there; and its den is on the great flight of steps that lead from the Piazza di Spagna, to the church of Trinita del Monte. In plainer words, these steps are the great place of resort for the artists' 'Models,' and there they are {{constantly}} waiting to be hired. The first time I went up there, I could not conceive why the faces seemed familiar to me; why they appeared to have beset me, for years, in every possible variety of action and costume; and how it came to pass that they started up before me, in Rome, in the broad day, like so many saddled and bridled nightmares. I soon found that we had made acquaintance, and improved it, for several years, {{on the walls of}} various Exhibition Galleries. There is one old gentleman, with long white hair and an immense beard, who, to my knowledge, has gone half through the catalogue of the Royal Academy. This is the venerable, or patriarchal model. He carries a long staff; and every knot and twist in that staff I have seen, faithfully delineated, innumerable times. There is another man in a blue cloak, who always pretends to be asleep in the sun (when there is any), and who, I need not say, is always very wide awake, and very attentive to the disposition of his legs. This is the dolce far' niente model. There is another man in a brown cloak, who leans against a wall, with his arms folded in his mantle, and looks out of the corners of his eyes: which are just visible beneath his broad slouched hat. This is the assassin model. There is another man, who constantly <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own shoulder, and is always going away, but never does. This is the haughty, or scornful model. As to Domestic Happiness, and Holy Families, they should come very cheap, for there are lumps of them, all up the steps; and the cream of the thing is, that they are all the falsest vagabonds in the world, especially made up for the purpose, and having no counterparts in Rome or any other part of the habitable globe.|$|E
