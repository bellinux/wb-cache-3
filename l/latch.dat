25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another <b>latching</b> region would allow for the <b>latching</b> of two input values at the two {{different}} outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added.

Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, <b>latching</b> regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to <b>latching</b> region 7. At this instant, <b>latching</b> region 7 will let the values <b>latched</b> on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the <b>latching</b> regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|R

5|$|Many parasites <b>latch</b> onto whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost {{all species}} of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles <b>latch</b> onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E

During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E
40|$|A {{gate drive}} <b>latching</b> circuit for an {{auxiliary}} resonant commutation circuit for a power switching inverter includes a current monitor circuit providing a current signal {{to a pair}} of analog comparators to implement <b>latching</b> of one of a pair of auxiliary switching devices which are used to provide commutation current for commutating switching inverters in the circuit. Each of the pair of comparators feeds a <b>latching</b> circuit which responds to an active one of the comparators for <b>latching</b> the associated gate drive circuit for one of the pair of auxiliary commutating switches. An initial firing signal is applied to each of the commutating switches to gate each into conduction and the resulting current is monitored to determine current direction and therefore the one of the switches which is carrying current. The comparator provides a <b>latching</b> signal to the one of the auxiliary power switches which is actually conducting current and <b>latches</b> that particular power switch into an on state for the duration of current through the device.

40|$|Various circuit topologies and FinFET {{technology}} {{options for}} implementing brute-force <b>latches</b> are explored in this paper. New low-power multi-threshold voltage (multi-V th) FinFET brute force <b>latches</b> based on gate-drain/source overlap engineering and independent-gate bias are proposed. Different brute-force <b>latches</b> are characterized and compared for active mode power consumption, propagation delay, setup time, leakage power consumption, layout area, and static noise margin. The clock power is minimized with the multi-V th <b>latches</b> that combine the independent-gate bias and gate underlap engineering techniques. Alternatively, the total active mode {{power and the}} leakage power are minimized with the multi-V th <b>latches</b> that combine the independent-gate bias and work-function engineering techniques. With the multi-V th <b>latches,</b> the total active mode power consumption, the clock power, and the average leakage power are reduced by up to 50. 3 %, 22 %, and 47 %, respectively, while maintaining similar speed and data stability {{as compared to the}} standard single-V th circuits. Furthermore, the area is reduced by up to 21 % with the multi-Vth <b>latches</b> as compared to the circuits with single-V th tied-gate transistors in a 32 nm FinFET technology.

40|$|<b>Latching</b> shock sensors are {{acceleration}} threshold {{sensors that}} trigger when the acceleration level exceeds the designed acceleration threshold.

American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance.

5|$|Charlton took {{advice from}} Celtic manager Jock Stein, who {{allowed him to}} sign right-sided midfielder Bobby Murdoch on a free transfer. Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a {{championship}} winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton {{had to work with}} some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and <b>latch</b> on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After <b>latch</b> control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top <b>latch,</b> after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

To explore how structural parameters like rewiring probability, threshold, noise and feedback connections affect the <b>latching</b> dynamics, two different connection schemes, K-nearest-neighbor network and modular network both having modular structure are considered. <b>Latching</b> chains are measured using two proposed measures characterizing length of intra-modular <b>latching</b> chains and sequential inter-modular association transitions.
