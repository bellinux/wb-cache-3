5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E

25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of a good wife, she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence is {{to turn away from}} Adam and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam that {{it would be good for}} them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E
25|$|The new duchess was adored by {{the poor}} and less {{fortunate}} tenants on her husband's estate, whom she visited and to whom she provided assistance. She later became involved with other philanthropic projects and was particularly interested in those that affected mothers and children. She was also a social success with royalty and the aristocracy of Britain. However, given the ill-fitting match between the duke and his wife, {{it was only a}} matter of time before their marriage was in name only. The duchess eventually was smitten by her husband's handsome cousin, the Hon. Reginald Fellowes (the liaison did not last, to the relief of Fellowes's parents), while the duke fell under the spell of Gladys Marie Deacon, an eccentric American of little money but, like Consuelo, dazzling to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> of considerable intellect. The Marlboroughs separated in 1906, divorced in 1921, and the marriage was annulled, at the duke's request and with Consuelo's assent, on 19 August 1926.|$|E
25|$|Rosa {{was exposed}} to comics {{at a very young}} age, as his 11-years-older sister was a comics hoarder, and had {{thousands}} of comics for Don to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> later read. Rosa began drawing comics before being able to write. Until he attended Saint Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky, his featured characters were a large cast of stick figures featured in comedy-adventures like the Barks comics and old movies Rosa enjoyed most. He never tried to draw more than stick figures, because the drawings, for him, were illustrations to get the story told. Only the story was important to him, not the actual drawings. His favorite comic books growing up were Uncle Scrooge by Western Publishing and Little Lulu comics from Dell Comics (Western Publishing), and his sister's collection of MAD comics and magazines. When he was 12 years old he also discovered and enjoyed the Superman titles by DC Comics of the editor Mort Weisinger period, drawn mostly by his favorite Superman artists Curt Swan and Kurt Schaffenberger. Shortly after starting to collect Superman comics he started to trade the collection of his older sister for Superman Comics. Since a comic book shop in his area traded two old comics for one new, he only had two Duck comics left from his sister's collection by the 1970s, one of them being The Golden Helmet. When he became a serious collector of older comics, he particularly enjoyed the classic E.C. horror and science fiction comics of the 1950s, Will Eisner's The Spirit, Walt Kelly's Pogo, and most comics of the 1940s onward.|$|E

25|$|Penniman {{had more}} than the {{ordinary}} intellectual endowment; bold, striking, and original in her conceptions, and of singular facility and clearness in her expression. She was educated from early life to disbelieve in the capacity or general intelligence of the masses for efficient self-government. All her prejudices were nurtured {{in favor of the}} British Constitution as developed by Magna Charta, and administered by a king and ministers responsible to the nation; which form of government she believed to be above all comparison the best in the world. Yet, in spite of all these deeply-rooted prejudices, with a grasp of thought that could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> examine questions of inherent right, on their original basis—with the abiding principles of the Christian faith to serve as a guide in judging of human duty in governments, and with the daily recurring practical examples of the conflicts of opinion between the Colonies and the mother country, which the American Revolution presented, she saw and acknowledged the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies—the justice of that cause in which they had, at length, banded for a higher measure of liberty, and the growing capacity of the people to maintain those rights. She was thus made an intellectual convert to the doctrines of the Revolution, and became a most useful and capable counsellor to Allen, in the subsequent critical periods of his life. Her mind was, indeed, a counterpart, in its boldness and originality, to that of her husband, whose intuitive mode of reaching conclusions enabled him to put into the shape of acts, what it might have sorely puzzled him sometimes to reason out; and what, indeed, if he could have reasoned ever so well, his bold and fiery zeal, and crushing rapidity of action, put him out of all temper to submit to the slow process of ratiocination. He also felt the happy influences of manners, opinions, and sentiments at once dignified and frank, yet mild and persuasive.|$|E
500|$|Northcote, while appreciating Boydell's largesse, also criticised {{the results}} of the project: [...] "With the {{exception}} of a few pictures by Joshua [...] and [...] Opie, and—I hope I may add—myself, it was such a collection of slip-slop imbecility as was dreadful to <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> <b>and</b> turned out, as I had expected it would, in the ruin of poor Boydell's affairs".|$|E

[...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> <b>and</b> they just give me a sense of awe.

[...] Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; [...] "I wanted [...] a film that gay people could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'" [...] Having enlisted the help of his lover, Peter Fisk, and another man, Poole first shot a ten-minute segment entitled Bayside.|$|E
500|$|Povenmire {{was born}} in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, {{and grew up in}} the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; {{by the time he was}} ten, his work was {{displayed}} in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that [...] "every drawing he [...] did was beautiful to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> had so much energy in it". Hayao Miyazaki was also an early influence.|$|E
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} received near-unanimous praise. Game Revolution {{said its}} [...] "brilliant" [...] graphics {{were among the}} best in gaming and Next Generation said the graphics were the best in any PC RPG. Computer Games said it was the most attractive PC game at the time, ArsTechnica said it was the best game to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>and</b> watch since The Last Express (1997), and PC Gamer said, [...] "there has never been a more beautifully created RPG". The level design and environments were praised for the level of detail, providing a brooding, atmospheric aesthetic with [...] "painstaking" [...] detail. Reviewers also made positive comments about the game's lighting effects. Conversely, Computer Gaming World (CGW) said that while the game was attractive, the visuals were superficial and failed to emphasize the game's horror elements. They were also critical of the third-person in-game camera positioning, claiming that it obscured the area {{directly in front of the}} player and did not allow the player to look upwards.|$|E
500|$|Derek Yu from The Indie Games Source {{compared}} {{the game with}} Portal and stated that Chung was able to develop [...] "an impeccable flair for graphic design" [...] while manufacturing Gravity Bone.

[...] Yu elaborated that it had [...] "enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit {{of the end of}} 2008." [...] An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with Gravity Bone and its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating, [...] "the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using your imagination to draw the connecting dots." [...] The editor commented that both games highlight story elements over graphics and technical innovations, saying each game's [...] "true strength comes from its ability to tell a story in the extremely short time frame." ...|$|E
