60|$|But not {{to remain}} long absent; for Cook, {{who has the}} {{reputation}} of being extremely good-hearted, says, whatever they do, let 'em stand by one another now, Towlinson, for there's no telling how soon they may be divided. They have been in that house (says Cook) through a funeral, a wedding, and a running-away; and let it not be said that they couldn't agree among themselves at such a time as the present. Mrs Perch is immensely affected by this moving address, and openly remarks that Cook is an angel. Mr Towlinson replies to Cook, far be it from him to {{stand in the way of}} that good feeling which he could wish to see; and adjourning in quest of the housemaid, and presently returning with that young lady on his arm, informs the kitchen that foreigners is only his fun, and that him and Anne have now resolved to take one another for better for worse, and to settle in Oxford Market in the general greengrocery and herb and <b>leech</b> <b>line,</b> where your kind favours is particular requested. This announcement is received with acclamation; and Mrs Perch, projecting her soul into futurity, says, 'girls,' in Cook's ear, in a solemn whisper.|$|E

50|$|The {{control lines}} (ropes) on the boom act in {{conjunction}} with the halyard and <b>leech</b> <b>line</b> to ensure that the sail is trimmed most effectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leech</b> <b>lines</b> {{are found}} on mainsails and large jibs {{to tighten the}} leech and prevent fluttering. They run through a sleeve on the leech from the head to the clew, where there is usually a clam cleat to tighten it. Occasionally, foot lines perform an {{analogous}} function on a loose-footed sail.|$|R
50|$|During reproduction, leeches use {{hypodermic}} injection of their sperm. They use a spermatophore, {{which is a}} structure containing the sperm. Once next to each other, <b>leeches</b> will <b>line</b> up with one's anterior side opposite the other's posterior. Each leech then shoots the spermatophore into the clitellar region of the other leech, where its sperm will make {{its way to the}} female reproductive parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{windward}} {{edge of a}} sail {{is called}} the luff, the trailing edge, the leach, and the bottom edge the foot. On symmetrical sails, either vertical edge may be presented to windward and, therefore, there are two leaches. On sails attached to a mast and boom, these edges may be curved, when laid on a flat surface, to promote both horizontal and vertical curvature in the cross-section of the sail, once attached. The use of battens allows a sail have an arc of material on the <b>leech,</b> beyond a <b>line</b> drawn from the head to the clew, called the roach.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of sail battens {{is in the}} roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the <b>leech</b> past the <b>line</b> that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have {{full-length}} battens, as well, that allow for better sail shape. Batten length near {{the head of the}} sail is limited by the need for the roach to pass ahead of the backstay, when tacking or jibing. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans.|$|R
50|$|A {{sail batten}} is a {{flexible}} insert in a fore-and-aft sail that provides added stiffness and definition to the sail's airfoil cross-section. The most common use of sail battens {{is in the}} roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the <b>leech</b> past the <b>line</b> that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have full-length battens, as well, that allow for better sail shape. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Most battens are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section.|$|R
