Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' <b>large</b> <b>ear</b> flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head8 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument61) stands [...] high; it {{measures}} [...] wide by [...] deep and weighs 13 tons. It {{is one of}} the finest examples of an Olmec colossal head. It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne. The monument was discovered at a depth of [...] during a magnetometer survey of the site in 1968; it has been dated to the Early Preclassic. After discovery it was initially reburied; it was moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa in 1986. The headdress is decorated with the talons or claws of either a jaguar or an eagle. It has a headband and a cover that descends from under the headdress proper behind the ears. Two short straps descend in front of the ears. The head sports <b>large</b> <b>ear</b> ornaments in the form of pegs. The face is that of a mature male with sagging cheeks and wrinkles between these and the nose. The forehead is gathered in a frown. The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth. Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner, the exception being the ears. These are stylised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another. The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Station {{scientists}} Edward M. East and Herbert K.

In 1906, East realized that steps to prevent self- and close-fertilization made it easier to select for desirable traits (such as <b>large</b> <b>ear</b> size) when breeding. Hayes and East later found described that a cross, or hybrid, between two inbred varieties of corn produced offspring that was more vigorous, larger and hardier that both of the parents, but this improvement was lost over successive inbred generations.|$|E

50|$|Head {{and body}} length is 5 in (13 cm), with tail length 4.5 in (11 cm). The body mass is about 1.5 oz (43 g). Upper {{parts of the}} small body are dark brown, while the under parts are orange-buff with gray bases, and shiny black with reddish {{streaking}} along the sides. It has a short snout, with <b>large</b> <b>ear</b> flaps. Prominent orange-brown rings exist around the eyes, with weakly marked facial streaks present on both side of the face, extending from the snout to ears. No shoulder streaks are present. The claws are notably sharp. The thin tail is covered with fine, smooth hair, with darkening towards the tip. D. m. melanura has darker colour above and more reddish below than D. m. baluensis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>ears</b> enhance {{perception}} of echolocation and prey generated sounds in bats. However, external ears likely impair aerodynamic performance of bats compared to birds. But <b>large</b> <b>ears</b> may generate lift on their own, mitigating the negative effects. We studied flying brown long-eared bats, using high resolution, time resolved particle image velocimetry, {{to determine the}} aerodynamics of flying with <b>large</b> <b>ears.</b> We show that the ears and body generate lift at medium to cruising speeds (3 - 5 m/s), but {{at the cost of}} an interaction with the wing root vortices, likely reducing inner wing performance. We also propose that the bats use a novel wing pitch mechanism {{at the end of the}} upstroke generating thrust at low speeds, which should provide effective pitch and yaw control. In addition, the wing tip vortices show a distinct spiraling pattern. The tip vortex of the previous wingbeat remains into the next wingbeat and rotates together with a newly formed tip vortex. Several smaller vortices, related to changes in circulation around the wing also spiral the tip vortex. Our results thus show a new level of complexity in bat wakes and suggest <b>large</b> <b>eared</b> bats are less aerodynamically limited than previous wake studies have suggested...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} phone's taco-shaped {{design was}} considered clumsy: to insert a game, users had {{to remove the}} phone's plastic cover and remove the battery compartment as the game slot was next to it. Another clumsy feature was the speaker and microphone being located on the side edge of the phone. This often resulted in many describing it as talking into a [...] "taco phone" [...] or [...] "Sidetalking", or simply that they had one very <b>large</b> <b>ear,</b> because the user held {{the edge of the}} phone against the cheek in order to talk into it. Usual for a phone, but unusually for a game system, it had a screen taller than it was wide, with a size of 2.1' and resolution of 176 X 208, giving an aspect ratio of 11:13; most televisions and portable game screens were 4:3.|$|E
50|$|Glossotherium had <b>large</b> <b>ear</b> ossicles, {{similar to}} those in elephants, which imply the loss of hearing acuity of higher frequencies, further {{implying}} an advantage for sensing low frequency sounds, infrasound, or bone-conducting seismic waves. Low frequency sound is useful for long range communication and it is possible that ground sloths used low frequency communication {{in much the same way}} that it is utilized by elephants. Sloths may have used low frequency sounds for communication in mating calls or other social interactions, or for long-range sound sensing as in predator-prey interactions or weather forecasting. Another possible explanation for hearing in low frequencies may be due to fossorial habits: low hearing frequencies coupled with a short interaural distance suggest that Glossotherium probably had very poor sound localization. This indicates evidence of an underground lifestyle since loss of high frequency hearing is common to fossorial mammals. Glossotherium’s huge nostrils were likely effective for sound emission, with expanded nares possibly related to emission of low frequency sounds up to 600 Hz.|$|E
