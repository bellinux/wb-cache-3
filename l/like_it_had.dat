5|$|An {{official}} 2-CD soundtrack album for the game, Mobius Final Fantasy Original Soundtrack, {{was released}} through Square Enix's music label on February 26, 2015 under the catalog number SQEX-10534-5. The {{music on the}} album covers Chapters 1 to 3. According to Suzuki, {{this was due to}} the music feeling <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> reached a natural transition point by that stage of the game.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Giro d'Italia {{began on}} 9 May, with Stage 11 {{occurring}} on 20 May. The first stage, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been since 2007, {{was a team}} time trial, a stage where {{each member of the}} team raced together against the clock. Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters. These stages were contested by Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish, among others, with Petacchi in victory becoming one of the only riders to defeat Cavendish in a sprint in the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked {{access to}} the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. The Allies had not {{negotiated}} a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved Ernest Bevin's plan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift, a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.|$|E
5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
25|$|Tierra Blanca {{is a large}} site {{which was}} a true city, not a {{ceremonial}} site, {{but most of the}} site had been sacked and practically destroyed when it fell and later as an archeological site although early photographs of it remain. There is evidence in Tula that this city, or one <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>had</b> had significant influence on the Tula civilization. For this reason, the time span for Tierra Blanca is placed at before 950 CE although there is little evidence at the site itself to date it.|$|E

25|$|When Network Ten paid $15million for {{the first}} season of Australian Idol they {{anticipated}} {{it to be a}} critical and financial success <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in other countries such as the UK and the USA. When the show aired {{for the first}} time in August 2003 it was a ratings bonanza attracting diverse ranges of viewers, from people wanting the crazy auditions to people who wanted to hear great voices. The audition process went through several major cities in Australia including Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Darwin. Australian Idol became the most popular TV show in the country with more ratings than major events such as the AFL Grand Final. The Grand Final at the Sydney Opera House attracted more than 3million viewers. It was listed as the ninth highest rating TV show in Australia in the past century in 2007. The eventual winner of the competition was Guy Sebastian with Shannon Noll finished in 2nd place.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Lehigh Gorge State Park is tied into the {{development}} of anthracite coal mining, which was once {{the center of the}} high-tech economy of northeastern Pennsylvania in its day. It is also tied into the early-to-middle period of the United State's Canal Era and the rapid development of pragmatic railroading technologies and consequent accelerated growth and use of railroadsall contributing factors in the Pennsylvanian and North American Industrial Revolution. By the 1790s deforestation of the American East, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in Britain a century earlier, was making the search for alternative fuels urgent and with England's experience of coal many were willing to invest in ventures to somehow mine and ship Anthracite east to the Delaware River where it could be barged to the cities of the east coast of the United States. England's technological lead was obvious and its extensive canal system was given much credit for the success of Britain's industries and its emergence as the sole world power {{at the end of the}} Seven Years' War.|$|E
25|$|February {{featured}} three Premier League encounters. Derby County were in {{real trouble}} in the Premier League, occupying 20th position, with 19th-place Fulham well {{out of reach for}} the East Midlands club. Their visit to St Andrew's also saw the return of Robbie Savage who left the Blues back in 2005. A Larsson goal looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> secured a valuable three points for the Blues before an 89th-minute Emanuel Villa goal secured a point for Derby. A trip to West Ham was next up for the Blues. Fredrik Ljungberg scored in the opening encounters for the Hammers, but a penalty from new signing McFadden made sure that the Blues would at least leave with a point. The last game of the month was a home match between the Blues and Arsenal. A 28th-minute free kick from McFadden opened the scoring, before two Theo Walcott goals within five minutes looked to have given the points to Arsenal, before an injury time McFadden penalty stole a point for the Blues. The game became highly controversial as within minutes of the kick off, a badly timed challenge by centre-back Martin Taylor broke the leg of Arsenal striker Eduardo. No one could complain about the automatic red card that referee Mike Dean showed Taylor, but comments after the game by Arsène Wenger campaigned for a much longer ban than the traditional three-match ban. Although Wenger later retracted his comments, his idea gained support with Sepp Blatter in particular, who campaigned for Taylor to be punished with a season-long ban. The defender also received death threats from supporters of the Croatia national team, as Eduardo would miss Euro 2008 in the summer.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg {{was used for}} the {{interior}} of Neville's home, while Greenwich Village {{was used for the}} exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, [...] "I don't think anyone's {{going to be able to}} do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{reactions}} were unfavorable. Artist Kenyon Cox, {{one of the}} invited artists to the 1891 competition, stated, [...] "I think it disgraceful that this great country should have such a coin as this." [...] Harper's Weekly proclaimed, [...] "The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse." [...] Saint-Gaudens was also interviewed, and as author Moran put it, [...] "injudiciously ranted": [...] "This is inept; this looks <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been designed by a young lady of sixteen, a miss who had taken only a few lessons in modeling. It is beneath criticism... There are hundreds of artists in this country, any of whom, {{with the aid of}} a designer, could have made a very respectable coin, which this is not." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Alex Rocha of TV Guide {{called it a}} [...] "pretty dull episode, but with some bright humorous spots [...] The episode looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> potential, but definitely did not perform to its best." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN called it [...] "far from perfect" [...] but [...] "definitely {{a lot better than}} the terrible O.J. Simpson episode from last week." [...] He called the Handi-Quacks scenes [...] "fantastic" [...] and called the episode overall [...] "definitely {{a step in the right}} direction." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic said: [...] "More purpose in the plot and more jokes related to the story than usual" [...] and gave the episode 40 out of 100. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "tonight's Family Guy was the best it's been in a looooong time". He stated that in both plotlines [...] "the game is established early [...] and the show escalates nicely", and graded the episode a B.|$|E
500|$|Mike Johnson, from PWInsider, {{said that}} the main event was [...] "Really good, hard hitting, well told story here. [...] Easily the best thing {{on the show and}} a really good main event." [...] However, he criticized the Magnus-Sting due to [...] "The idea here was to make Magnus by having Sting lose clean in a back and forth contest. [...] On paper, it made sense but the match didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> the spark needed for that sort of moment". Also, {{described}} Ethan's debut as [...] "pitch-perfect". He described the entire show as [...] "It was just a show - some good, some eh, but Bound for Glory should never be just a show, it's their Wrestlemania, except this year, it wasn't. Pat McNeill, from PWTorch, said Bound for Glory [...] "Wasn't a great event". Bob Kapur, from CANOE Slam, said that he enjoyed the event overall. Also, Matthew Asher, from CANOE too, enjoyed the PPV but said the ultimate success of this Bound for Glory rests on the future storylines this event sets up.|$|E
500|$|Rock Steady {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 15 reviews. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield wrote it was [...] "impressive to hear No Doubt summon the musical imagination {{to transcend the}} formula that used to imprison them". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to the album as [...] "a good, hooky, stylish mainstream pop record". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly remarked that there was [...] "something oddly flimsy" [...] about No Doubt that prevented it from becoming a milestone in pop music, but that the band's [...] "party-throwing skills improve with each new gathering." [...] Colleen of Delaney of Stylus Magazine commented that the band sounded <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> [...] "growing pains" [...] and was unsure of its place in mainstream rock, predicting that No Doubt would either become a singles band [...] "or go all Radiohead on us and make an album of avant-jazz-electro-acid-funk-polka." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} March 2011, {{the band}} {{returned}} to finish the record at 5150 with engineer Ross Hogarth. Most of the work at 5150 was for guitars and bass, as Eddie [...] "couldn't hear them at Henson the way I'm used to." [...] Both he and Hogarth felt that attempts at mixing there were not progressing due to sound quality issues. Eddie attributed this to the tape machines at Henson, claiming that: [...] "Everything ended up sounding <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a sock over it." [...] The final mix took place {{over a period of}} six weeks in the summer of 2011, with each song taking a day to mix. Hogarth indicated that because the process was done at a mixing console, [...] "We couldn't {{move on to the next}} song until a mix had been approved by everyone and could go off the desk." [...] Hogarth would start with the drums, adding bass and guitar to finish a backing track, which would be complemented with multing (hiving off different sections of a given part to different tracks) and parallel compression. It was then finished by bringing in Roth's vocals, backing vocals, and further details such as ad libs, screams and guitar solos.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{material}} was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Thayil's only contribution to the album was the song [...] "Never the Machine Forever", for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially {{came out of a}} jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that {{he had a lot of}} incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said, [...] "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar." [...] Cornell said, [...] "By the time we were finished, it felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." ...|$|E
500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, {{it is kind of}} hard to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E
