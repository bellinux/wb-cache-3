5|$|A second Navy <b>Law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> in 1912 {{named the}} Plan de la Segunda Escuadra (Second Squadron Plan). It called for, among several other ships, three dreadnoughts to {{supplement}} the España class. These dreadnoughts were named the Reina Victoria Eugenia class. They were to be in laid down in 1914 and 1915 and completed around 1920.|$|E
5|$|Civil War tokens became illegal {{after the}} United States Congress {{passed a law}} on April 22, 1864 prohibiting the issue of any one or two-cent coins, tokens or devices for use as currency. On June 8, 1864 an {{additional}} <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> that forbade all private coinage.|$|E

5|$|Existing laws banning {{abortion}} {{except for}} medical reasons were strictly {{enforced by the}} Nazi regime. The number of abortions declined from 35,000 per year {{at the start of}} the 1930s to fewer than 2,000 per year at the end of the decade, though in 1935 a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> allowing abortions for eugenics reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Indiana {{became the}} first state to adopt {{eugenics}} legislation, that allowed the involuntary sterilization of dangerous male criminals and the mentally defectives. It was never put in effect and in 1921 Indiana {{became the first}} state to rule such legislation unconstitutional when the Supreme Court of Indiana acted. A revised eugenics <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> in 1927, and it remained in effect until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 367 BC a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> which {{required}} {{the election of}} at least one plebeian aedile each year. Also in 366 BC, the praetorship and curule aedileship were created. Shortly after the founding of the Republic, the Comitia Centuriata ("Assembly of the Centuries") became the principal legislative assembly. In this assembly, magistrates were elected and laws were passed.|$|E

5|$|The bucentaur {{was used}} {{not only for}} the Marriage of the Sea ceremony, but also for other state {{functions}} such as festivals celebrating the Virgin Mary and the bearing of newly crowned dogaressas (the wives of doges) to the Doge's Palace. On 6 May 1401, a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> to prohibit the doge from making private use of the bucentaur.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed,</b> questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed,</b> {{questions}} arose {{about the legal}} status of marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|Joseph G. Wilson {{started in}} 1853 as the clerk {{for the court}} and was {{responsible}} for the Oregon Reports until 1870, though he also served as a justice on the court from 1862 to 1870. Later federal judge Charles B. Bellinger then took over editing the reports, and served as clerk until 1880. He was followed by T. B. Odeneal, J. A. Stratton, and W. H. Holmes, until 1889 when a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> that included a provision that the Chief Justice take over this responsibility. This arrangement only lasted a few years, as in 1891 a new law allowed the court to hire an official reporter, with later Chief Justice George H. Burnett serving as the first official reporter.|$|E
5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The later German monuments {{constructed}} by the Nazi government were substantial, but communicated a limited range of symbolic messages, focusing on German heroism, conservative nationalism sentiments and masculinity. Use of mass graves symbolised the sense of German community. When Paul von Hindenburg died in 1935, the Tannenberg Memorial was then used as his mausoleum, commemorating elite military leadership during the war. The Nazi government attempted to have the Jewish names removed from the war memorials, but this proved impractical and instead a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> forbidding their addition to any future memorials. The government also removed more experimental earlier war memorials which were felt to communicate an inappropriate message about the war, such {{as the work of}} Ernst Barlach.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the reign}} of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the {{educational}} structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree {{in one of these}} three fields of study. Six years later, a second <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building {{across the street from the}} mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.|$|E
5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program. Caixa Econômica Federal is the distributing agent.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1912 naval <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed,</b> Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its own terms, which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s Indiana's Republican party, whose adherents {{tended to}} favor the temperance movement, began {{challenging}} the state's Democrats, who supported personal freedom and a limited federal government, for political power. Early temperance legislation in Indiana earned only limited and temporary success. In 1853 Republicans persuaded the state legislature to pass a local option law that would allow township voters to declare their township dry, but it was later deemed unconstitutional. In 1855 a statewide prohibition <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed,</b> but it met the same fate as the local option. In the decades to come Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Quakers, and women's groups would continue to support temperance efforts and gave strong support to the mostly dry Republican Party. The Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans stood opposed and gave strong support to the wet Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{was taken}} by wagon and train to Jackson, Mississippi, then to Montgomery, Alabama, before finally being {{confined}} to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederacy's capital. In August, he was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, where Confederate officials investigated whether Dow had armed slaves {{to fight against the}} rebels, which the Confederate Congress had made a capital offense. Dow had done so, but his prosecutors could find no evidence of such an action after the <b>law</b> <b>was</b> <b>passed,</b> so the charges were dropped and Dow was returned to Libby Prison in October. He remained there until February 1864, when he was exchanged for captive Confederate General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, son of General Robert E. Lee. His health was damaged by his prison experience, and after spending several months convalescing in Portland, he resigned from the Army in November 1864.|$|E
