50|$|Funk {{always wanted}} to be an astronaut. Funk volunteered {{to be a part of}} the Women in Space Program in 1961, {{becoming}} one of the Mercury 13. Funk, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> in the program, was put through rigorous physical and mental testing. In one test, volunteers were placed in sensory deprivation tanks. Funk was in the tank, without hallucinating, for 10 hours and 35 minutes, a record. She passed her tests and was qualified to go into space. She scored higher than John Glenn did in his testing and was the third best in the Mercury 13 program. Due to sexism and other circumstances, the program was canceled before the women were to undergo their last test.|$|E
40|$|The authors present neuropsychological {{evidence}} distinguishing binding between form, color, {{and size}} (cross-domain binding) and binding between form elements. They contrasted conjunctive search with difficult feature search using control participants and patients with unilateral parietal or fronto/temporal lesions. To rule out effects of task difficulty {{or loss of}} top-down guidance of search, the authors made conjunction search easier than feature search. Despite this, parietal patients were selectively impaired at detecting conjunction targets in their contralateral field. In contrast, the parietal patients performed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> with form conjunctions, with form conjunctions being easier to detect than difficult feature targets. These data indicate a qualitative difference between binding in the form domain and binding across form, color, and size, consistent with theories that propose distinct binding processes in vision...|$|E

Participants completed a screen-based maze task with an alleged remote participant in a 2 (task characteristics: cooperative vs. competitive) by 2 (modality: haptic/force-feedback vs. visual) balanced, between-participants experiment.

In the competitive task, participants felt more powerful and more positively overall when interacting through force-feedback than when interacting visually. They also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participant</b> more and trusted them more. The opposite results were obtained for the cooperating participants.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize a chaos control method {{developed}} by Ott, Grebogi and Yorke (1990) to control saddle points in R 2 which are embadded {{in a strange}} attractor of a chaotic system. Our generalized method admits to control any unstable equilibrium in R 2. We apply our findings to control {{the dynamics of the}} chaotic asset pricing model of Brock and Hommes (1998). In this model chaotic price movements are caused by heterogenous market participants. We introduce a control authority which trades <b>the</b> risky asset <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> market <b>participants.</b> Using our control approach, it is possible for the authority to stabilize the market price with minimum effort...|$|R

However, Jay turned down the money and the mentorship, citing a contractual clause stipulating that the Project Runway production company would own a 10% stake of all his professional ventures in perpetuity. The company has since dropped this clause.|$|R

A common feature of most IFE dialogues is that they are cooperative, in the sense that both the IFE program and its users [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] During January of 2004, we {{attended}} the American Lodging Investment Summit (ALIS), a large hotel industry investment conference held {{each year in}} Los Angeles. We sat through several sessions about financing hotel companies and properties at the conference. During literally {{every one of these}} sessions, fairly lengthy, and sometimes active, discussions erupted about the effective use of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt for financing hotel investments. Our take away from the experience—floating-rate debt makes sense as a general proposition because hotels, unlike other commercial real estate, have pro-cyclical income streams unbridled by lease frictions that should resemble the time-series patterns of interest rates. However, we, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> panelists and <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> involved in these sessions, had views grounded in considerable ignorance because empirical work has never been done to confirm or refute the validity of financing strategies based on mixing fixed-rate and floating-rate mortgage debt...|$|R

[...] The objective of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> is to dismiss the batsman.

In a within-subjects design, students' behavior patterns were significantly correlated across the two rounds of decision-making; however, students allocated more optimally when the allocation involved real rather than hypothetical money, suggesting that both motivational context and individuals' personality and/or experience influence preference patterns.

40|$|In {{most of the}} triathlon races, the 10 km-run is {{critical}} to win and, just a few seconds, may separate the gold and the silver medal. To our best knowledge, no study has analyzed the biomechanical differences among the first qualified triathletes during a top-level competition. The aims {{of the present study}} were: (1) to examine the different responses to the previous cycling between the gold medal and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participants,</b> and (2) to compare the biomechanical profiles during the 10 km-run presented by the top-ranked triathletes. 16 women, participants at Madrid 2008 Triathlon World Cup, were analyzed. The first qualified triathlete (gold medal) showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> in many of the analyzed variables. A higher stride length, a smaller stride frequency, a higher and more consistent horizontal distance hip- toe cap and a more extended knee angle of the support-leg at toe-off could explain the differences in 10 km-run time between gold medal and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>participant...</b>|$|R
