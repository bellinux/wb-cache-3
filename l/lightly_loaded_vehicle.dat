40|$|In {{networks}} of workstations, running processes {{lead to a}} situation, in which some of the nodes are highly loaded whereas other nodes mayremain <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> or almost idle. It may lead to reduction in throughput and lot of computational power offered by the <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> or the idle processors. This computational power goes unused while the jobs are striving for the availability of processor-cycles. The issue of efficient utilization of computing resources is noteworthy in the networked workstations such as local area networks as well; which can be tackled by spreading the running processes among the connected workstations {{by means of the}} mechanism such as process migration. The application of process migrationmechanism may consequent into the proficient utilization of the overall networked computing environment through the utilization of the <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> workstations or the almost idle workstations.

40|$|Load sharing is a {{technique}} to improve the performance of distributed systems by distributing the system workload from heavily <b>loaded</b> nodes to <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> nodes in the system. Previous studies have considered two adaptive load sharing policies: sender-initiated and receiver-initiated. In the sender-initiated policy, a heavily loaded node attempts to transfer work to a <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> node and in the receiver-initiated policy a <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> node attempts to get work from a heavily loaded node. Most of the previous studies have assumed the first-come/first-served (FCFS) node scheduling policy; furthermore, analyses and simulations in these {{studies have been done}} under the assumption that the job service times are exponentially distributed and the job arrivals form a Poisson process. The goal {{of this paper is to}} fill the void in the existing literature. We study the impact of these assumptions on the performance of the sender-initiated and receiverinitiated policies.

40|$|Performance of {{distributed}} {{systems can be}} improved by distributing system workload from heavily <b>loaded</b> nodes to <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> nodes (i. e., by load sharing). Previous studies have considered two dynamic load sharing policies: sender-initiated and receiver-initiated. In the sender-initiated policy, a heavily loaded node attempts to transfer work to a <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> node and in the receiver-initiated policy a <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> node attempts to get work from a heavily loaded node. Almost all the previous studies have neglected the I/O requirements of the jobs in evaluating the performance of various load sharing policies. In addition, sensitivity to variance in job inter-arrival and service times has not been studied. The goal {{of this paper is}} to fill the void in the existing literature. This paper models job's I/O requirements and studies the impact of job I/O service demand on the performance of sender-initiated and receiver-initiated policies.

40|$|Meta-{{scheduler}}s {{such as the}} LSF MultiCluster scheduler and the Moab Meta-Scheduler (Silver) {{are being}} deployed on clusters interconnected over the grid. A primary goal of such meta-schedulers is to share jobs amongst the individual local sites, balancing the load and improving utilization and turnaround time. This work focuses on current methodologies used in implemented meta-schedulers, such as LSF MultiCluster and Silver. The benefits and disadvantages of both centralized and delegated modes are evaluated. Focusing on {{the negative impact of}} meta-schedulers to jobs originating from <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> sites, enhancements are proposed and evaluated via trace-driven simulation.

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded</b> and fully loaded, especially for the rear springs. When heavily loaded the springs could bottom out, and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops', there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when <b>lightly</b> <b>loaded,</b> which were often called 'shock absorbers'. Realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency, these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period, but were not {{a solution to the problem}} that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat.
