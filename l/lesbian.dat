5|$|The Latin American <b>lesbian</b> {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote <b>lesbian</b> issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first <b>lesbian</b> organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting <b>lesbian</b> issues have evolved; 13 <b>lesbian</b> organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, <b>lesbian</b> associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
50|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between <b>lesbians</b> and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for <b>lesbians</b> and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in <b>lesbians.</b> It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of <b>lesbians</b> tested by regular pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in <b>lesbians.</b> The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in <b>lesbians</b> than in heterosexual women, perhaps because many <b>lesbians</b> lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|R
50|$|In November 1984, a {{group of}} <b>lesbians</b> broke away from LGSM to form a {{separate}} group, <b>Lesbians</b> Against Pit Closures, although some <b>lesbians</b> remained active in the LGSM campaign rather than joining the women-only group.|$|R
5|$|<b>Lesbians</b> {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about <b>lesbians</b> {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about <b>lesbians</b> made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying <b>lesbians</b> written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of <b>lesbians</b> began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|R
5|$|A <b>lesbian</b> is {{a female}} homosexual: a female who {{experiences}} romantic love or sexual attraction to other females. The term <b>lesbian</b> {{is also used}} to express sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless of sexual orientation, or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same-sex attraction.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, <b>lesbian</b> {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used <b>lesbian</b> characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a <b>lesbian.</b> Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to <b>lesbian</b> literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative <b>lesbian</b> sadomasochism themes.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{also has}} large <b>lesbian,</b> gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} populations.

Greater Seattle also ranked second among major U.S. metropolitan areas, with 6.5% of the population identifying as gay, <b>lesbian,</b> or bisexual.

5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as <b>lesbian</b> or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol.

Many <b>lesbian</b> communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{compared}} {{the prevalence of}} health behaviors among <b>lesbians</b> and {{in the general population}} of women. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional community-based survey of 1010 self-identified <b>lesbians</b> 18 years or older. RESULTS: Compared with the general population of women, <b>lesbians</b> {{were more likely to report}} cigarette use, alcohol use, and heavy alcohol use. A higher percentage of <b>lesbians</b> were categorized as overweight, and <b>lesbians</b> were more likely to participate in vigorous physical activity. They were less likely to report having had a Papanicolaou test within the past 2 years but more likely to report ever having had a mammogram. CONCLUSIONS: While there may be differences in health behaviors between <b>lesbians</b> and the general population of women, how these differences influence the risk of subsequent disease is unknown...|$|R

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a <b>lesbian</b> union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, <b>lesbian</b> relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in <b>lesbian</b> and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E

5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969.

40|$|Growing up {{and living}} in a {{homophobic}} society, <b>lesbians</b> are exposed to numerous negative attitudes, assumptions, and messages concerning homosexuality. Internalized homophobia refers to the incorporation of these homophobic beliefs within the lesbian's self-image. Internalized homophobia is assumed to be associated with psychological distress and as presenting a significant threat to healthy self-esteem and identity development in <b>lesbians</b> The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the association between internalized homophobia and psychological distress in <b>lesbians.</b> Participants were self-identified <b>lesbians</b> residing in one of three cities: a small rural city; a mid-sized city; or a large metropolitan area. The data consisted of participant scores on the Symptom Checklist 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R) and the Internalized Homophobia Scale for <b>Lesbians</b> (IHSL). Results of this study indicated general internalized homophobia significantly correlated with overall psychological distress as well as with depression in <b>lesbians.</b> The findings also indicated that psychological distress was associated with younger age, medication usage, lower income, nega tive attitudes toward other <b>lesbians</b> and non-white ethnicity. In addition, results indicated participants from the smallest city in the sample displayed significantly higher levels of internalized homophobia compared to participants from the other cities. This research demonstrated internalized homophobia is a salient factor in the lives of <b>lesbians</b> and needs to be addressed when researching identity development and psychological functioning in <b>lesbians.</b> Additionally, this study pointed to the need for therapists who work with <b>lesbians</b> to have a clear understanding of internalized homophobia and skills in helping <b>lesbians</b> deal with this issue.

40|$|Confusion {{exists in}} {{clinical}} practice about whether <b>lesbians</b> {{should be offered}} routine cervical smears. We found cervical smear abnormalities {{in a sample of}} 624 <b>lesbians,</b> including those who had never been sexually active with men. These findings suggest that <b>lesbians</b> should be routinely offered cervical cytology as part of the national screening programme. Evidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in the 'exclusively lesbian' group indicates that sexual transmission of HPV may occur between women. The belief by some <b>lesbians</b> that they have less need for cervical smears, coupled with poor uptake of cervical screening by a significant proportion, demonstrates a need for education of <b>lesbians</b> and health service providers...|$|R
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with <b>lesbian</b> mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced <b>lesbian</b> mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and <b>lesbian</b> mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E
