40|$|Pharmacological {{blockade}} of the endocannabinoid system via rimonabant (SR 141716) induced a sustained reduction in weight and fatness. Rimonabant-treated mice exhibited reduced metabolizable energy intake and increased daily energy expenditure on days 4 - 6 of treatment. However, these {{on the energy}} budget had disappeared by day 22 - 24. Rimonabant treatment increased daily physical activity levels throughout the study. These data suggested that rimonabant caused a negative energy balance by acting on both energy intake and expenditure. Melanin-concentrating receptor 1 (MCHR 1) antagonism via GW 803430 produced similar effects on energy  budget. However, only physical activity during the dark phase was increased by GW 803430 treatment. MCHR 1 antagonism produced a persistent anti-obesity effect and the initiation of weight loss resulted from a decrease in energy intake {{and an increase in}} active energy expenditure. With respect to environmental interventions, non-genetic individual variability in weightgain when fed a high fat diet (HFD) was investigated. I found that weight gain induced by HFD was associated positively with fat mass and fast free mass and negatively with physical activity prior to HFD exposure. Furthermore, fat mass and fat free mass were influenced by lactation litter size via weaning weight and post-weaning growth rate. Finally I used intermittent starvation to test whether the risk of starvation determines the <b>lower</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> as suggested by the dual intervention pointmodel. Overall, mice exhibited different behavioural and physiological responses to intermittent starvation dependent of the duration of treatment. This work contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the regulation of energy balance and provide useful insights for the prevention and treatment of obesity.

Free Flight strives to move the current air traffic system into an age where space technology is used to its fullest potential. Self-separation is {{one part of the}} Free Flight system. Self-separation provides pilots the opportunity to choose their own route to reach a specified destination provided that they maintain the 'minimum required separation distance between airplanes. In the event that pilots are unable to maintain separation, controllers will need to have the aircraft separation authority passed back to them.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} and evaluate published data on cost effectiveness of cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>interventions,</b> {{and how this}} information could be interpreted in a rational approach of cholesterol management in general practice. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. SETTING: No restriction on setting. MATERIALS: Papers reporting on the cost effectiveness or cost utility of prevention of (recurrent) coronary heart disease by reduction of hypercholesterolaemia in adults. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty nine studies, most cost effectiveness analyses, were included. In 24 studies drug interventions only were analysed. Costs of screening to target cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>interventions</b> to persons with hypercholesterolaemia were considered in nine studies. Adjustments of {{the efficacy of the}} intervention for community effectiveness were described in seven studies. In four studies life years gained were adjusted for quality of life. Despite large variation in the outcomes, there is a constant tendency towards a less favourable cost effectiveness ratio for intervening in persons without coronary heart disease compared with persons with coronary heart disease and for women compared with men. CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of data on cost effectiveness of cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>interventions</b> in the general practice setting. The cost effectiveness of cholesterol lowering in general practice deteriorates when all relevant costs are taken into account and when efficacy is corrected for community effectiveness. Cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>intervention</b> is more cost effective in men compared with women and in patients with coronary heart disease compared with persons without coronary heart disease. Considerations from cost effectiveness analyses should be incorporated into {{the development and implementation of}} national cholesterol guidelines for general practitioners. Standardisation of cost effectiveness studies is important for future economic evaluations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Conceptual {{modeling}} is {{a decisive}} stage in any modeling process, but especially relevant {{for the analysis}} of complex, large systems. Here, researchers must filter out those processes that appear relevant, even before specific research questions can be posed. For this step of conceptual model reduction, we propose an explicit framework. Our research project assessed causes for biodiversity loss in German orchard meadows. A large conceptual model was assembled using literature review and expert interviews, creating an excessively large model. Then, two different approaches were applied to simplify this model and identify policy <b>intervention</b> <b>points.</b> Both approaches yielded different cause-effect explanations and pointed to very different research questions and <b>intervention</b> <b>points.</b> We found that combining an actor-centred approach with a macro-perspective greatly improved the relevance of our conceptual model with respect to policy advice...|$|R

The new bridge classification system is mainly to facilitate the implementation of novel Bridge Management System (BMS) which optimise the life cycle cost both at project level and network level while environment classification is mainly to improve accuracy of Remaining Service Potential (RSP) module of the proposed BMS. In fact, limited capacity of the existing BMS to trigger the maintenance <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> is an indirect result of inadequacies of the existing bridge and environmental classification systems.

40|$|We use {{probabilistic}} boolean {{networks to}} simulate the pathogenesis of Dengue Hemorraghic Fever (DHF). Based on Chaturvedi’s work, the strength of cytokine influences are modeled stochastically as inducement probabilities. Two basins of attractors are observed with synchronous updating; the Null Infection cycle attractor shows an expected cross-regulation of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines corresponding to the homeostasis of an uninfected person, while the DHF Infection attractor shows the onset of DHF. With asynchronous updating, our model remains valid with clinical comparisons against qualitative changes in signal durations. In order to find <b>intervention</b> <b>points</b> that could prevent DHF, we design a genetic algorithm to shift the DHF attractor to the DF attractor basin by using the DF final state as the fitness measure. Our simulation results identify TGF-β, IL- 8 and IL- 13 as the <b>intervention</b> <b>points</b> which are consistent with known clinical results to prevent DHF from occurring...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} are systemic, prevalent and often fatal; yet treatments remain scarce. Identifying molecular <b>intervention</b> <b>points</b> {{that can be}} therapeutically targeted remains a major challenge, which we confronted via a screening assay we developed. Using yeast models of mitochondrial ATP synthase disorders, we screened a drug repurposing library, and applied genomic and biochemical techniques to identify pathways of interest. Here we demonstrate that modulating the sorting of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria, mediated by the TIM 23 complex, proves therapeutic in both yeast and patient-derived cells exhibiting ATP synthase deficiency. Targeting ​TIM 23 -dependent protein sorting improves an array of phenotypes associated with ATP synthase disorders, including biogenesis and activity of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Our study establishes mitochondrial protein sorting as an <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> for ATP synthase disorders, {{and because of the}} central role of this pathway in mitochondrial biogenesis, it holds broad value for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} study of maternal serum alphafetoprotein (α-FP) screening of 9838 women {{in an area}} with low prevalence of neural tube defects and predominance of anencephalics revealed that an <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> of single serum α-FP level above 2 · 8 times the median was appropriate for this population. Ninety per cent of anencephalics and all fetuses with anterior abdominal wall defects were detected. There was no spina bifida among the population screened. Two per cent of the population screened had serum α-FP level above this cut-off level. Thirty-two per cent of twin pregnancies, 7 per cent of small-for-gestational age infants and 9 per cent of pregnancies which ended in either abortion or perinatal death in the population screened also had one serum α-FP level above this <b>intervention</b> <b>point.</b> The false positive rate was 66 per cent. This false positive rate was only reduced to 63 per cent if insted of one, two serum α-FP level above this <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> was considered abnormal. Using this strategy {{there was no significant}} reduction in the detection rate of fetal anomalies and other pregnancy complications. Because of the predominance of anencephalics in this population the diagnosis of fetas anomaly in women with abnormal serum α-FP level was made by ultrasound examination alone.

30|$|One of the {{concerns}} raised regarding the Dutch Perinatal Care System is whether the small additional risk on adverse perinatal outcome (perinatal mortality and intrapartum related neonatal morbidities) of home deliveries is of fact by the claimed advantage of <b>lower</b> <b>intervention</b> rates compared to planned hospital births (Ackermann-Liebrich et al. 1996; Hutton et al. 2009; Janssen et al. 2002; Lindgren et al. 2008; Olsen 1997; Wiegers et al. 1996; van der Kooy et al. 2011).
