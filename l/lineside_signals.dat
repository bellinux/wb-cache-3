25|$|Whereas <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> {{operated}} by a signaller would control train movements, ETCS will signal trains via a computer without lineside apparatus. In effect, the train creates its own 'buffer zone' through a digital signal transmitted from the cab. An onboard computer on the train will inform {{the driver of the}} 'allowable speed and movement of the train.' TMS allows delays to be minimised through a computer running algorithms and deciding how best to return traffic patterns to normal.|$|E
25|$|At high speed, {{the driver}} cannot see <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> reliably. With the TVM {{signalling}} {{used on the}} high-speed lines, the target speed {{for the end of}} the current block is displayed with a flashing indication for the next block if it is a different speed. Auxiliary signalling information, including the location of neutral sections in the overhead supply and pantograph adjustment zones, is displayed in cab and by the lineside. The operation of circuit breakers over neutral sections is handled automatically on TVM-signalled lines only, and pantograph adjustments must always be performed by the driver.|$|E
2500|$|The {{current system}} mostly uses two, three, and four aspect colour light signals using track circuit block signalling. It is a {{progression}} of the original absolute block signalling that can still be found on many secondary lines. The use of <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> in Britain is restricted to railways with a maximum permissible speed of up to [...]|$|E

50|$|While some railway {{systems have}} more signal boxes than others, most future {{signalling}} projects {{will result in}} increasing amounts of centralised control relegating the <b>lineside</b> <b>signal</b> box to niche or heritage applications.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, Loree, {{along with}} Frank PJ Patenall, {{received}} U. S. Patent #733,981, {{for the upper}} quadrant semaphore. This soon became {{the most widely used}} form of railroad <b>lineside</b> <b>signal</b> in North America. Railroads continued to install them until the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lineside</b> <b>signals</b> need to {{be mounted}} in {{proximity}} to the track which they control.|$|E
5000|$|February 2012: Full {{commissioning}} of West Dalarna Line (Repbäcken-Malung) under ETCS Level 3 without <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> or track detection devices.|$|E
5000|$|October 2010: The {{commercial}} {{deployment of}} ETCS Level 2 by passenger trains {{started on the}} Cambrian Line between Pwllheli and Harlech in Wales without <b>lineside</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other rail lines, the signal system on the Market–Frankford Line has progressed from the {{original}} <b>lineside</b> block <b>signals</b> using semaphores, to three-aspect Type D color light (green, over yellow, over red) signals, to cab <b>signalling,</b> eliminating the <b>lineside</b> block <b>signals</b> except at interlockings.|$|R
30|$|The use of ATO {{makes it}} more {{practical}} to implement moving block signalling [22, 32], and the two technologies are frequently implemented together on driverless metro systems around the world. Therefore, {{the replacement of the}} existing fixed block <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling</b> by a moving block signalling system was also considered for the simulation work described in this paper.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{assumptions}} in the timetable modelling was a nominal dwell time of 30  s at each station. The dwell time can potentially {{have a significant effect}} on the capacity of a metro system [24, 50]. As such, a second sensitivity test was carried out for the capacity in the baseline case of manual driving and <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling,</b> using dwell times of 15, 30, 45 and 60  s.|$|R
50|$|The Continuous Automatic Warning System (CAWS) {{is a form}} of cab {{signalling}} {{and train}} protection system used in Ireland to help train drivers observe and obey <b>lineside</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
50|$|Signalling {{would be}} based on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) with in-cab signalling, to resolve the {{visibility}} issues associated with <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> at speeds over 125 mph.|$|E
50|$|The PKM {{signal system}} is the most modern European Train Control System Level 2, which uses no <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> but {{operates}} instead by wireless transmission of signals to an onboard computer on the train, with signal information displayed on a monitor to the driver.|$|E
30|$|A {{specific}} issue arose where {{a set of}} consecutive stations {{had very}} similar station-to-station distances, {{with the last of}} these immediately followed by a longer station-to-station segment that included a <b>lineside</b> <b>signal</b> at a similar distance to the station-to-station distance shared by the preceding set. As a result, if a train stopped at this signal, the best matching group of reference distances found by the algorithm was for the train to reverse within the set, preventing the following segment from being identified correctly.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of the}} resignalling {{of much of the}} GCML, {{carried out}} in the early 1940s by Westinghouse to {{increase}} capacity, cable hangers were installed on the western walls of the viaducts, and the new <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling</b> and power cables required by the work were strung along them. This cable route was restored to work, albeit with new cables, during the recent resignalling of Swithland Sidings. As part of the same scheme a pair of mechanical signals (Swithland Sidings' Up Inner Distant and Up Outer Home) was installed on Brazil Island, between the two viaducts.|$|R
50|$|The Indian Pacific {{train was}} {{authorised}} {{to pass a}} red signal at Glenbrook and stopped at the next signal, also red. The driver alighted to use the <b>lineside</b> <b>signal</b> telephone to call the signaller for authority to pass the signal at danger; {{as a component of}} the phone was missing, he incorrectly believed it to be defective. A delay of approximately seven minutes resulted despite the locomotive having a radio (at that time it was not procedure for the National Rail Corporation to use radio to contact signal boxes).|$|R
50|$|On 29 August 2009 PKP {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Thales Rail Signalling to install European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 signalling on the CMK rail line, a very modern signalling system which is being installed throughout the European Union particularly on high-speed rail lines. ETCS replaces <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> by data transmission to an on-board computer on the train, with signal aspects, speed restrictions, and a safe braking curve displayed on a monitor in front of the driver. Level 1 retains <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> for trains operating at less than 160 km/h, while allowing ETCS-equipped trains to run at speeds above 160 km/h. ETCS satisfies the requirement of cab signalling for high speed trains, while also providing greatly increased safety. The ETCS signalling on the CMK was certified on 21 November 2013, allowing trains on the CMK to operate at 200 km/h.|$|E
50|$|ETCS is {{implemented}} with standard trackside equipment and unified controlling equipment within the train cab. In its advanced form, all lineside information is {{passed to the}} driver wireless inside the cab, removing the need for <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> watched by the driver. This will give {{the foundation for a}} later to be defined Automatic Train Operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{current system}} mostly uses two, three, and four aspect colour light signals using track circuit block signalling. It is a {{progression}} of the original absolute block signalling that can still be found on many secondary lines. The use of <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> in Britain is restricted to railways with a maximum permissible speed of up to 125 mph.|$|E
30|$|The {{services}} {{within the}} metro network in question stop at all stations and are manually driven with <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling.</b> An individual journey was therefore defined {{here as a}} single station-to-station run between adjacent stations, while the train was in service. Once the algorithm had determined such journeys from the dataset, the station-to-station distance was chosen {{to be the primary}} method of identifying the location within the network and hence classifying each journey. The use of speed limits, signal stops and the timetable to support this classification process would certainly have been possible, but ultimately was not required in this particular case.|$|R
25|$|Saltley ROC {{will become}} a remote {{signalling}} centre of Rugby. The facility at Saltley was opened as a bomb-proof signalling centre for the West Coast Route Modernisation. However, the inability to achieve a workable Traffic Management System (TMS) without <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling,</b> meant an increased budget of £1.4 billion and the building became a white elephant. The structure was slowly integrated into a ROC function with signalling upgrades transferring responsibility to Saltley starting in 2006. Because the interlocking mechanisms are in place, they will be left at Saltley and operated remotely from the Rugby ROC. What Saltley cannot do, that Rugby can, is host the human space needed for the signallers and train operating company (TOC) staff to work together.|$|R
50|$|The outer ends of {{the trains}} were not fitted with fully {{automatic}} couplers, so that in an emergency, two trains could be coupled together mechanically, but not electrically. Once the 1959 stock was delivered, the couplings were modified so that the two builds could work together. The electro-pneumatic brake was of a similar design to the 1938 stock, but the motor generator set was rather different, as it needed to supply alternating current at 110V and 850 Hz. The design was influenced by problems with the fluorescent lighting supply on the sub-surface R stock, which tended to generate a loud magnetic hum. The frequency was chosen {{to ensure that it}} could not interfere with <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling.</b>|$|R
50|$|The European {{railway network}} grew from {{separate}} national networks {{with little more}} in common than standard gauge. Notable differences include voltages, loading gauge, couplings, signalling and control systems. By the end of the 1980s there were 14 national standard train control systems in use across the EU, and the advent of high-speed trains showed that signalling based on <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> is insufficient.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., semaphores were {{employed}} as train order signals, {{with the purpose}} of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive a telegraphed order, and also as simply one form of block signalling. Mechanical signals worldwide are being phased out in favour of colour-light signals or, in some cases, signalling systems that do not require <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> (e.g. Radio Electronic Token Block or RETB).|$|E
50|$|The InterCity 225 has a top {{service speed}} of 140 mph; during a test run on Stoke Bank between Peterborough and Gratham an Intercity 225 reached 161.7 mph. However, except on High Speed 1, which is {{equipped}} with cab signalling, British signalling does not allow trains to exceed 125 mph in regular service, due to the impracticality of correctly observing <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> at high speed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lineside</b> light <b>signals</b> {{are also}} {{provided}} {{in case of}} HKT failures or the occasional visit of a non-S-train, but the lineside blocks are longer so capacity in this mode is reduced. Precise train positions are visible on all lines in Byens puls (see links below).|$|R
50|$|On a rail {{transport}} system, signalling control {{is the process}} by which control is exercised over train movements by way of railway signals and block systems to ensure that trains operate safely, over the correct route and to the proper timetable. Signalling control was originally exercised via a decentralised network of control points that were known by a variety of names including signal box (International and British), interlocking tower (North America), signal poste (France) and signal cabin (some railways e.g., GCR). Currently these decentralised systems are being consolidated into wide scale signalling centres or dispatch offices. Whatever the form, signalling control provides an interface between the human signal operator and the <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling</b> equipment. The technical apparatus used to control switches (points), signals and block systems is called interlocking.|$|R
30|$|The {{rolling stock}} {{deceleration}} {{specified in the}} OpenTrack model was then modified {{to examine the effects}} of ATO in accordance with Sect.  4.1, and the new maximum theoretical capacity obtained by the same compression method as before. This new maximum capacity value was then multiplied by the 76 % ratio for capacity utilisation derived above, and rounded down to the nearest integer value to provide an estimate of practical capacity (in tph). The OpenTrack model was also modified to replace the existing <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling</b> with a moving block signalling system. This capacity estimation process was repeated for all of the combinations of manual driving/ATO and lineside/moving block signalling. Low adhesion conditions were also tested for the ATO case, with both lineside and moving block signalling, again by modifying the deceleration value in accordance with Sect.  4.1.|$|R
50|$|With moving block, {{computers}} {{are used to}} calculate a 'safe zone', behind each moving train, which no other train may enter. The system depends on precise knowledge of where each train is and how fast it is moving. With moving block, <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> are not provided, and instructions are passed direct to the trains. It {{has the advantage of}} increasing track capacity by allowing trains to run much closer together.|$|E
50|$|Whereas <b>lineside</b> <b>signals</b> {{operated}} by a signaller would control train movements, ETCS will signal trains via a computer without lineside apparatus. In effect, the train creates its own 'buffer zone' through a digital signal transmitted from the cab. An onboard computer on the train will inform {{the driver of the}} 'allowable speed and movement of the train.' TMS allows delays to be minimised through a computer running algorithms and deciding how best to return traffic patterns to normal.|$|E
5000|$|Because TGVs on LGVs travel {{too fast}} for their drivers to see and react to {{traditional}} <b>lineside</b> <b>signals,</b> an automated system called TVM, [...] "Transmission Voie-Machine" [...] (track-to-train transmission) is used for signalling. Information is transmitted to trains by electrical pulses sent through the rails, providing speed, target speed, and stop/go indications directly to the driver via dashboard-mounted instruments. This high degree of automation does not eliminate driver control, though there are safeguards that can safely stop the train {{in the event of}} driver error.|$|E
50|$|A {{controllable}} balise {{is connected}} to a Lineside Electronics Unit (LEU), which transmits dynamic data to the train, such as signal indications. Balises forming part of an ETCS Level 1 signalling system employ this capability. The LEU integrates with the conventional (national) signal system either by connecting to the <b>lineside</b> railway <b>signal</b> or to the signalling control tower.|$|R
2500|$|Virgin Trains {{put forward}} plans in 2007 to {{increase}} the line speed in places on the WCML– particularly along sections of the Trent Valley Line between Stafford and Rugby from 125 to 135mph (200 to 217km/h) after the quadrupling of track had been completed. This would permit faster services and possibly allow additional train paths. [...] was claimed to be achievable by Pendolino trains while using existing <b>lineside</b> <b>signalling</b> {{without the need for}} cab signalling via the use of the TASS system (Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision) to prevent overspeeding. In practice, regulations introduced by the HMRI (now ORR) {{at the time of the}} ECML high-speed test runs in 1991 are still in force prohibiting this. Network Rail was aware of Virgin Train's aspirations; however, in November 2009 Chris Mole MP (then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Transport) announced that there were no plans for this to happen and thus for the foreseeable future the maximum speed will remain at [...]|$|R
5000|$|A 'Transparent Data Balise', {{or short}} 'controllable balise' is {{connected}} to a Lineside Electronics Unit (LEU), which transmits dynamic data to the train, such as signal indications.
