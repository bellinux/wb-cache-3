50|$|The Council for Colony Holidays for Schoolchildren {{was set up}} as an {{educational}} Trust in 1963, following initiatives {{by a number of}} young British people who had worked in the French national system of “colonies de vacances” (which catered for 5 million children a year) and who thought a similar system would have much to offer to children and young people in the UK. It was started with a <b>launching</b> <b>grant</b> from the then Ministry of Education, with a distinguished governing Council chaired by Sir John Wolfenden, and with Sir William Alexander as Secretary. In 1965 Chris Green and a colleague left teaching to work full-time for CCHS.|$|E
5000|$|Kung Fu Killers {{was shot}} in Hong Kong and {{featured}} clips from Golden Harvest movies. This developed contacts that Trenchard Smith later used to make The Man from Hong Kong (1975). He sold the film to Channel Nine for $18,000. Trenchard-Smith later commented that his intentions with the film [...] "were simple":Commence the process of <b>launching</b> <b>Grant</b> Page to local audiences as an Australian personality with an unique gift. Have him trigger a lot of Asian action sequences, which were really entertaining. Come in on budget. Turn a profit... Viewed 35 years later, KFK is a long trailer for Asian Cinema masquerading as a Documentary Special. Somewhat scrappy and heavy-handed in places too. But now, with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight, it is a really interesting time capsule. Grant is engaging as ever, and the kung fu combats are lively. Nine made a spectacular promo, and were rewarded with ratings and repeats for a while, particularly in Adelaide, Grant's home town. Mission accomplished.|$|E
