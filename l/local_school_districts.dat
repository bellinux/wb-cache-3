5|$|Lincolnshire {{is home to}} {{the public}} Adlai E. Stevenson High School and to the schools that compose the {{elementary}} Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103. It serves as the headquarters for corporations including the global outsourcing company Aon Hewitt, and was the base of operations for the Newman/Haas Racing team. The village of Lincolnshire hosts several annual festivals (including one mirroring the Taste of Chicago) in either commercial establishments such as City Park or the Village Green, or in one of its nine public parks. The village maintains a police department that closely collaborates with its <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts.</b> Lincolnshire manages a public works system at the direct expense of the village; it retrieves all of its water from the city of Highland Park, which derives its water from adjacent Lake Michigan. The village has a council–manager government and is a home-rule municipality. The mayor of Lincolnshire is Elizabeth J. Brandt.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts.</b> The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E

25|$|Public {{schools in}} Arizona are {{separated}} into about 220 <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> which operate independently, but are governed {{in most cases}} by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the Arizona State Board of Education (a division of the Arizona Department of Education) and the state Superintendent of Public Instruction (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when {{there is not a}} presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.|$|E

25|$|After a {{property}} revaluation {{was completed in}} 2013 and based on changes in tax levies by the municipality and the <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts,</b> the property tax rate increased by almost 50%, from $2.01 per $100 in assessed value in 2012 to $2.93 in 2013. A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the revaluation complied with all state legal requirements.|$|E

Gonzales worked as Program Manager for ten years at Hewlett-Packard where he led a national initiative to create partnerships with <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> and universities.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaigns of}} {{intelligent}} design proponents seeking curricular challenges have been disruptive, divisive and expensive for the affected communities. In pursuing {{the goal of}} establishing intelligent design {{at the expense of}} evolution in public school science classes, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> are costly, diverting funding away from education and into court battles. For example, {{as a result of the}} Dover trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of teaching the controversy.|$|E

25|$|Hawaii has {{the fewest}} local governments among U.S. states. Unique to this {{state is the}} lack of {{municipal}} governments. All local governments are generally administered at the county level. The only incorporated area in the state is Honolulu County, a consolidated city–county that governs the entire island of Oahu. County executives are referred to as mayors; these are the Mayor of Hawaii County, Mayor of Honolulu, Mayor of Kauai, and the Mayor of Maui. The mayors are all elected in nonpartisan elections. Kalawao County has no elected government, and as mentioned above there are no <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> and instead all local public education is administered at the state level by the Hawaii Department of Education. The remaining local governments are special districts.|$|E
25|$|Between 1940 and 1980, {{there were}} 5 more {{additions}} to the school. In 1959, Greer consolidated its schools with Eagar. In 1969 the consolidation of the <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> of Alpine, Nutrioso, and Springerville, led to the Eagar school being utilized for classes for 4th through 8th grade, while the younger students used the school building in Springerville. By the 1980s, {{the growth of the}} community created a need for a larger school. With {{the construction of a new}} school, the Eagar school was no longer utilized as a school building as of January 1984. That month it became the town hall for Eagar. At some point, the town hall was relocated to its current address at 22 W. 2nd Street, and the Eagar school became the home to the Eagar police department.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, he was {{appointed}} Assistant Attorney General {{in charge of the}} Office of Legal Counsel. In this capacity, Rankin may best be remembered for arguing in favor of the African-American plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), advocating that the doctrine of “separate-but-equal” facilities for blacks and whites was unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown, Rankin argued in a presentation before the Court that the effort to desegregate schools should take place gradually in an effort to avoid any violence that might arise from the decision. Accordingly, he suggested the plan by which <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> submitted desegregation plans to federal judges in their states. In addition, Rankin argued a great range of other important cases before the Supreme Court. He was instrumental in resolving conflicting claims among Western states to the Colorado River, and in establishing a balance of federal and state jurisdictions in offshore oil drilling.|$|E

25|$|The 1921 session saw {{a renewed}} {{struggle}} over public education. In the previous session, the far reaching, innovative legislation {{known as the}} “School Code of 1919” was enacted. This act completely reworked public education in Delaware by empowering a state superintendent to set standards, consolidated hundreds of tiny <b>local</b> <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> into countywide districts, established a 180-day school year, and provided for a County board of education to appropriate funding through the county property tax. It was hotly debated then, and only narrowly passed. The opponents were poised to repeal the whole legislation in 1921, but through much effort, proponents managed a compromise, the “School Law of 1921”. It lessened the standards, including the 180-day school year, but most importantly moved the funding from the counties to the state through an income tax. To manage that funding, it replaced the county boards of education with a State board of education and a State School Tax Commissioner. The whole effort was a personal mission of Pierre S. du Pont. He was prominent among those who persuasively argued its passage, {{not only in the}} General Assembly, but in hundreds of small gatherings around the state. And it was his personal $5,000,000 contribution, given over 20 years, which made possible much of the reconstruction of suitable buildings to meet the standards established.|$|E
