40|$|The {{belief that}} "moral {{experience}} is a puzzle and moral education is its stumbling interpreter" (Radest, 2000, p. II) continues to haunt us amidst the urgency of bringing the values dimension into education. Within the traditional analytic approach that tends to permeate curricula at both formal and "hidden" levels (Fraenkel, 1997) moral, or values, education is usually centered on clarifying values or inculcating particular virtues within character education programs. This chapter will consider a semiotic alternative to the problematic of moral education as grounded in the legacy of great American pragmatists, John Dewey and Charles Sanders Peirce. Peirce equated logic with triadic semiotics, that is, a relational process describing the quasi-necessary <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> Moral education will be posited as indeed stumbling and will be re-conceptualized against a model of reasoning that logically incorporates what I earlier called moral stuttering (2005 a) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present and assess Husserl's {{arguments}} against epistomological and psychological naturalism {{in his essay}} Philosophy as a Rigorous Science. I show that his critique is directed against positions that are generally more extreme than most currently debated variants of naturalism. However, Husserl has interesting thoughts to contribute to philosophy today. First, he shows {{that there is an}} important connection between naturalism in epistemology (which in his view amounts to the position that the validity of logic can be reduced to the validity natural <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking)</b> and naturalism in psychology (which in his view amounts to the position that all psychic occurrences are merely parallel accompaniments of physiological occurrences.) Second, he shows that a strong version of epistemological naturalism is self-undermining and fails to translate the cogency of logic in psychological terms. Third, and most importantly for current debates, he attacks Cartesianism as a form of psychological naturalism because of its construal of the psyche as a substance. Against this position, Husserl defends the necessity to formulate new epistemic aims for the investigation of consciousness. He contends that what is most interesting about consciousness is not its empirical fact but its transcendental function of granting cognitive access to all kinds of objects (both empirical and ideal). The study of this function requires a specific method (eidetics) that cannot be conflated with empirical methods. I conclude that Husserl's analyses offer much-needed insight into the fabric of consciousness and compelling arguments against unwarranted metaphysical speculations about the relationship between mind and body...|$|E

40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} among writers on slavery {{that there is}} an {{inherent}} contradiction or a necessary confusion in regarding slaves as both human beings and things. In law there is no such contradiction or confusion. Slaves are both property and human beings. Their humanity is not denied but (in general) they are refused legal personality, a very different matter. Things as property may be classed in various ways, and the classification may then have an impact on owners 2 ̆ 7 rights and duties. A thing may be corporeal or incorporeal, immoveable or moveable. Some moveables may be classed as res se moventes, things that move of their own accord, animate beings, such as horses and cattle; others, again, as inanimate property. A sub-division of res se moventes might be in Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s term [...] “thinking property,” that is, human beings. And the ownership <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> property may in the eyes <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> create rights and duties that are somewhat different from those arising from the ownership of other res se moventes. This Paper is devoted to an examination of some problems that occur when slaves are considered as “thinking property. ” I will not deal with the rather different issues that arise when slaves are to some extent accorded legal personality, such as when they may appear as witnesses, create a legally valid marriage, or be prosecuted for crime. The subject, therefore, concerns issues such as whether a person is liable for injuries caused by the negligence of a fellow worker to a slave whom he had hired, and whether a hirer of a slave is liable if he permitted the slave to do work forbidden by the contract, and the slave was injured. This Paper is restricted to Rome because it was there that the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> property was most developed. I will deal with only five examples, chosen because I have not examined them before, and because I think I have something new to say...|$|R

For example, the confusion surrounding previous "derivations" <b>of</b> the second <b>law</b> from energy dynamics can be resolved by noting that such derivations incorporate one or more assumptions that correspond to the loss of information.

Together they form {{an answer to the}} question: What does the superhero invented by the {{property}} professor do {{to make the world a}} better place? Well, she slices and lumps. Resources or entitlements are sometimes more valuable when sliced up, and sometimes more valuable when lumped together. It can be hard, at times, to know which way the balance tilts. Even when we think we know, getting to the optimal configuration can be difficult. Enter 2 ̆ 2 The Configurator, 2 ̆ 2 who unlike you or me, can costlessly sever or agglomerate entitlements whenever the reconfiguration yields more total social value than the original arrangement. In a zero transaction cost world—that parallel universe that Ronald Coase so skillfully rendered 1 —these feats (and others) could be accomplished effortlessly by all of us, sans capes. But in our world, we need a little more help. In this lecture, I hope to convince you not only that The Configurator would be an excellent superhero to have around, but also give you some tools for spotting and responding to configuration challenges in law and in life. The rest of the talk comes in four small slices. The first bit asks why we need to slice and lump in the first place. The second segment looks at why reconfiguration is so hard to accomplish and what we can do about it. The third piece examines some implications for <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> in slices and lumps.

40|$|Buildings, {{which are}} in fact {{ecosystems}} (living and inanimate organisms interacting together), are nowadays conceived and operated {{on the base of}} energy assessments underpinned by the first <b>law</b> <b>of</b> thermodynamics, and design strategies work towards energy conservation. Different approaches, based on the second <b>law</b> <b>of</b> thermodynamics, exist in research; they use the thermodynamic function called exergy - a measure of energy quality obtained from the combination of first and second law - and their scope is still centred on conservation strategies, optimised through irreversibility reduction. However, irreversibility {{plays a key role in}} nature, as entropy production dictates direction and modality of all processes and real phenomena are actually irreversible. The main problem related to the forefront of high-efficiency buildings is their high cost and complexity, which contrast stridently with the needs of the largest part of the built environment: effective low-budget sustainable solutions, easy to raise and control by non-specialised users. This research, through a pragmatic methodology, mixes practical experiences from low-budget construction sites with concepts from the relatively new discipline of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and proposes an alternative energy design approach based on the second <b>law</b> <b>of</b> thermodynamics. <b>Thinking</b> <b>of</b> buildings as evolving ecosystems, their ability to perceive and exploit useful gradients can be enhanced through a deeper understanding of the role of irreversibility as the driving force of spontaneous processes, and imperfection as an intrinsic characteristic of architecture...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} show that Aboriginal peoples' ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> have not been recognized by early colonial European political thinkers. I begin with an examination of Kymlicka's political theory of minority rights and show that, although Kymlicka is a strong advocate {{of the right of}} Aboriginal self-government in Canada, he fails to consider Aboriginal ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> within his own political system. From an Aboriginal perspective this is not surprising. However, I claim that Kymlicka opens the conceptual space for the inclusion of Aboriginal voices. The notion of "incorporation" means that Aboriginal peoples became included in the Canadian state and in this process their Aboriginal sovereignty was extinguished. Aboriginal peoples question the legitimacy of such a claim. A consequence of the Canadian government unilaterally asserting its sovereignty over Aboriginal peoples is that Aboriginal ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> are not recognized as valuable within the legal and political discourse of sovereignty. In chapters two through five, respectively, I examine the Valladolid debate of 1550 between the Spanish monk Bartolome de Las Casas and Juan Sepulveda, The Great <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Peace of the Iroquois Confederacy, Thomas Hobbes's distinction between the state of nature and a civil society, and Alexis de Tocqueville's account of democracy in America. Each of the examples, except for The Great <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Peace, generate a philosophical dialogue that includes judgments about Aboriginal peoples. However, none of these European thinkers considers the possibility that Aboriginal voices could play a valuable role in shaping their political thought. To show the value of an Aboriginal exemplar <b>of</b> political <b>thinking</b> I consider the Iroquois Great <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Peace. The Iroquois view of political sovereignty respects the diversity of voices found within a political relationship. This was put into practice and enforced in early colonial northeast America until the power dynamic shifted betw...|$|R
