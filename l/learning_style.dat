40|$|Abstract — It is {{important}} to study <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> because {{recent studies have shown}} that a match between teaching and <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> helps to motivate students ́ process of learning. That is why teachers should identify their own teaching styles as well as their <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> to obtain better results in the classroom. The aim is to have a balanced teaching style and to adapt activities to meet students ́ style and to involve teachers in this type of research to assure the results found in this research study. Over 100 students complete a questionnaire to determine if their <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> are auditory, visual, or kinesthetic. Discovering these <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> will allow the students to determine their own personal strengths and weaknesses and learn from them. Teachers can incorporate <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> into their classroom by identifying the <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> of each of their students, matching teaching <b>styles</b> to <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> for difficult tasks, strengthening weaker <b>learning</b> <b>styles.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to explain <b>learning</b> <b>styles,</b> teaching styles match or mismatch between <b>learning</b> and teaching <b>styles,</b> visual, auditory, and kinesthetic <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> among Iranian learners, and pedagogical implications for the EFL/ESL classroom.

40|$|Although current {{literature}} on <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> shows that matching a teacher’s instructional <b>style</b> with the <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> of students affects {{performance in a}} classroom environment, {{little is known about}} the influence of <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> in online interaction. The paper argues that students’ individual <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> influences how students interact online and that rather than adapt to user’s <b>learning</b> <b>styles,</b> online environments tend to force behavior change on users’ <b>learning</b> <b>styles.</b> The paper discusses a project in which students with varying <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> used an online consultation (DFAQ) tool for collaborative knowledge sharing, and reports on how <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> influenced online interaction and the use of DFAQ changed rather than adapted to users’ <b>learning</b> <b>styles.</b> The paper concludes that for online environments to be educationally efficacious, sensitivity to different <b>learning</b> <b>styles</b> is desirable though the implementation of such sensitivity is non-trivial.

500|$|Harris and Graeme-Evans based {{the series}} around an {{underlying}} educational structure, primarily using Howard Gardner's Theory of multiple intelligences. It is recognised that each child learns {{in a different}} way, and each cast member has a specific segment within the show which targets a different aspect of learning, ranging from logical-mathematical thinking to a focus on linguistic skills, to cater to a child's individual learning approach. Harris observed that most viewers had a favourite cast member, believing that children generally [...] "respond more favourably to the presenter who models the <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> they prefer". The use of multiple segments is also designed to hold the attention span of young children. The skills of pre-numeracy and pre-literacy are a focus of the educational theory, to prepare children for learning at school, while also encouraging self-confidence and expression. According to the show's website, Hi-5 also uses Piaget's theory of cognitive development, providing a learning experience that promotes individual growth.|$|E

Second, Japanese managers were more heterogeneous in <b>learning</b> <b>styles,</b> while American managers showed more homogeneity of <b>learning</b> <b>styles.</b> Third, in the aspect of balance and specialization on <b>learning</b> <b>styles,</b> American managers demonstrated more balanced learning abilities than did Japanese managers.
