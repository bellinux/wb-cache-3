25|$|While {{snow and}} ice act to {{insulate}} the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming {{in the spring and}} summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0°C). However, the strong static stability of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation. Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation feedback over the southwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E

For example, when {{liquid water}} starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a polycrystalline structure. In the final block of ice, {{each of the}} small crystals (called [...] "crystallites" [...] or [...] "grains") is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal {{does not have a}} periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the grain boundaries. Most macroscopic inorganic solids are polycrystalline, including almost all metals, ceramics, ice, rocks, etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as glass, are called amorphous solids, also called glassy, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> but forming a crystal does.|$|E

40|$|Materials {{that store}} {{the energy of}} warm days, to return that heat during cool nights, have been {{fundamental}} to vernacular building since ancient times. Although building with thermally rechargeable materials became a niche pursuit with the advent <b>of</b> fossil fuel-based <b>heating</b> and cooling, energy and climate change concerns have sparked new enthusiasm for these substances <b>of</b> high <b>heat</b> capacity and moderate thermal conductivity: stone, adobe, rammed earth, brick, water, concrete, and more recently, phase-change materials.

This investigation explores that potential, illustrating the correspondence between physical parameters and thermal storage-and-release patterns in direct-, indirect-, and isolated-gain passive solar configurations.

40|$|The {{multiphase}} Stefan problem {{describing the}} melting (freezing) of a material with two distinct phase-change temperatures is considered. The material is assumed initially to be uniformly {{at the lowest}} (highest) fusion temperature. For spherical, cylindrical and planar geometries an integral formulation is obtained which generalizes results for the idealized single-phase Stefan problem. From this integral formulation a new non-trivial integral relating the motions of the moving boundaries is deduced. Further, the enthalpy of the material is found to occur in this integral relation, allowing the result to be derived and extended to an n-phase material. The presence of the enthalpy makes it an extremely simple matter to evaluate the integral in a numerical enthalpy scheme so {{that it may be}} used as an independent gauge or check on the accuracy of the numerical scheme. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of a simple explicit enthalpy scheme. The pseudo steady-state approxima-tion for the problem is discussed, and the analytical difficulties inherent in obtaining the approximate boundary motions for cylindrical and spherical geometries are noted. An examination of the pseudo steady-state approximation for planar geometry reveals that it is valid in cases where the sensible <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> the phases are very small in comparison to their <b>latent</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews four {{aspects of}} crystal growth theory: {{the nature of}} the rate-controlling process, the {{mechanism}} controlling molecular attachment onto the growing crystal surface, {{the nature of the}} crystal-melt interface, and the stability of planar interfaces relative to cellular interfaces. The rate-controlling process may be diffusion in the melt, heat flow, or the reaction at the crystal-melt interface. Diffusion or heat-flow controlled growth generally leads to a cel-lular morphology. For most silicates, interface-controlled growth leads to a faceted morphology. If the rate-controlling process is the interface reaction, the mechanism at the in-terface may be either continuous, with molecular attachment occurring at all points on the crystal surface, or lateral, with attachment occurring only on steps of the surface. The mechanism actually occurring can be determined by the dependence upon undercooling of the growth rate corrected for the viscosity ofthe melt. The nature ofthe interface can be described in terms of the interface roughnegs, which may be considered to be the topographic relief on the surface. Materials with small <b>latent</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> such as quartz, should have molecularly rough interfaces and grow with a nonfaceted morphology, while materials with large <b>latent</b> <b>heats,</b> such as most other silicates, should have smooth interfaces and grow with a faceted morphology. The stability of planar interfaces relative to cellular interfaces can be dis-cussed in terms of diffusional, heat-flow, surface-energy, and kinetic effects. For a freely grow-ing crystal, such as in a magma chamber, only the surface-energy and kinetic effects aid in stabilizing planar interfaces.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{hypervelocity}} projectile (greater than 3 km/s) {{is a process that}} subjects both the impactor and the impacted material to a large transient pressure distribution. The resultant stresses cause a large degree of fragmentation, melting, vaporization, and ionization (for normal densities). The pressure regime magnitude, however, {{is directly related to the}} density relationship between the projectile and target materials. As a consequence, a high-density impactor on a low-density target will experience the lowest level of damage. Historically, there have been three different approaches toward achieving the lowest possible target density. The first employs a projectile impinging on a foil or film of moderate density, but whose thickness is much less than the particle diameter. This results in the particle experiencing a pressure transient with both a short duration and a greatly reduced destructive effect. A succession of these films, spaced to allow nondestructive energy dissipation between impacts, will reduce the impactor's kinetic energy without allowing its internal energy to rise to the point where destruction of the projectile mass will occur. An added advantage to this method is that it yields the possibility of regions within the captured particle where a minimum of thermal modification has taken place. Polymer foams have been employed as the primary method of capturing particles with minimum degradation. The manufacture of extremely low bulk density materials is usually achieved by the introduction of voids into the material base. It must be noted, however, that a foam structure only has a true bulk density of the mixture at sizes much larger than the cell size, since for impact processes this is of paramount importance. The scale at which the bulk density must still be close to that of the mixture is approximately equal to the impactor. When this density criterion is met, shock pressures during impact are minimized, which in turn maximizes the probability of survival for the impacting particle. The primary objectives of the experiment are to (1) Examine the morphology of primary and secondary hypervelocity impact craters. Primary attention will be paid to craters caused by ejecta during hypervelocity impacts of different substrates. (2) Determine the size distribution of ejecta by means of witness plates and collect fragments of ejecta from craters by means of momentum-sensitive mcropore foam. (3) Assess the directionality of the flux by means of penetration-hole alignment of thin films placed above the cells. (4) Capture intact the particles that perforated the thin film and entered the cell. Capture media consisted of both previously flight-tested micropore foams and aerogel. The foams had different <b>latent</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> and, accordingly, will capture particles over a range of momenta.

40|$|Objective: Zinc {{chloride}} is {{an important}} inorganic compound used {{as a source of}} zinc and has other numerous industrial applications. Unfortunately, it lacks reliable and accurate physicochemical, thermal, and spectral characterization information altogether. Hence, the authors tried to explore in-depth characterization of zinc chloride using the modern analytical technique. Materials and Methods: The analysis of zinc chloride was performed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), particle size distribution, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analytical techniques. Results: The PXRD patterns showed well-defined, narrow, sharp, and the significant peaks. The crystallite size was found in the range of 14. 70 – 55. 40 nm and showed average crystallite size of 41. 34 nm. The average particle size was found to be of 1. 123 (d 10), 3. 025 (d 50), and 6. 712 (d 90) μm and average surface area of 2. 71 m 2 /g. The span and relative span values were 5. 849 μm and 1. 93, respectively. The DSC thermogram showed a small endothermic inflation at 308. 10 °C with the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> (ΔH) <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> 28. 52 J/g. An exothermic reaction was observed at 449. 32 °C with the ΔH of decomposition 66. 10 J/g. The TGA revealed two steps of the thermal degradation and lost 8. 207 and 89. 72 % of weight in the first and second step of degradation, respectively. Similarly, the DTG analysis disclosed Tmaxat 508. 21 °C. The UV-vis spectrum showed absorbance maxima at 197. 60 nm (λmax), and FT-IR spectrum showed a peak at 511 /cm might be due to the Zn–Cl stretching.

This paper {{is concerned with the}} measurement <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> molten salts, which {{plays a key role in}} determining the storage capacity <b>of</b> <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> based thermal energy storage units. The focus of the work is on the effect of moisture content of molten salts on <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> measurements using a differential scanning calorimetry. The results reveal that, the change in the mass of the samples investigated is due to moisture content, and hence, this leads to a reduction in the value <b>of</b> the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> the phase change material. For instance, the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> for one <b>of</b> the wet samples (containing moisture) was determined to be 314. 29 J/g. However, the calculated <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> for the same sample without moisture is found to be 350. 029 J/g. This is associated with the methodology of the DSC analysis, which does not consider the mass of the moisture in the sample. It is found that, the deviation in the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> due to the effect of the moisture content in the investigated samples is proportional to the amount of moisture in the original sample. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the effect of the moisture content on the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> molten salts.
