5|$|The condor is {{primarily}} a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, {{such as those of}} deer or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to , generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually <b>laid.</b> <b>It</b> is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are <b>laid,</b> <b>it</b> is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E

50|$|Lincoln was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} named Mayfair High School, but opposition from other neighborhoods, including Holmesburg, meant that the school was instead named after Abraham Lincoln. Mayfair residents had a negative reception to this change. In 1949 the school's cornerstone was <b>laid.</b> <b>Its</b> current campus opened in 2009.|$|R

25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels agree that, as {{the evening}} came after the crucifixion, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus, and that, after Pilate granted his request, wrapped it in linen cloth and <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> in a tomb. This was in accordance with Mosaic Law, which stated that a person hanged on a tree must {{not be allowed to}} remain there at night, but should be buried before sundown.|$|E
25|$|With Foote's {{success in}} writing An Englishman in Paris, Irish playwright Arthur Murphy {{was moved to}} create a sequel, The Englishman {{returned}} from Paris. While Foote readily encouraged Murphy's plan, Foote secretly wrote his own version which opened at Covent Garden on 3 February 1756. While early biographers scorned Foote's plagiarism of Murphy's play, the 1969 discovery of that manuscript <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> to rest when it was proven that Foote's play was far superior. The play was successful at Covent Garden and played regularly until 1760.|$|E

25|$|Another time Saint Anthony was {{travelling}} in the desert, {{he found}} a plate of silver coins in his path. He pondered {{for a moment as}} to why a plate of silver coins would be out in the desert where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> out there to tempt him. Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him, but he ignored them and continued on his way.|$|E
25|$|Growth continued. The chancel of the {{new church}} was {{enlarged}} in 1901. It was still not large enough to handle the expanding congregation. In the late 1910s, the parish began planning for a new building. It bought the land south {{of the church in}} 1920 and began a fundraising campaign. Eventually it was able to accumulate enough money and on St. Andrew's Day, November 30, 1930, the cornerstone was <b>laid.</b> <b>It</b> was completed in time for dedication ceremonies the following Easter, at a cost of $250,000 ($ in modern dollars).|$|E
25|$|In {{the dying}} {{seconds of the}} game with Adelaide {{trailing}} by four points, McLeod raced into an open forward line while being hotly pursued by Hawk Ray Jencke. Swooping onto the loose ball, he calmly <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> on his foot under pressure, dribbling it through for a miraculous goal from a tight angle at the Northern End of the ground to give his side a remarkable 2-point victory after they had trailed by 34 points at half-time. The Crows were able to avenge their worst ever home loss in history the year before (Round 9 1994 by 97 points to Hawthorn).|$|E

50|$|It {{took six}} years after the king's gift for the first stone {{of the church to}} be <b>laid.</b> <b>Its</b> {{construction}} was carried out in two phases: the first (1590-1690) included the choir, the small cloister, the sacristy {{and a few of the}} monks' cells; the second (in the 18th century) involved the completion of the nave, the transept and the side chapels. Finally, renovations and extensions occurred during the 19th century, mainly affecting the chapels and façade.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notorious {{examples}} of impropriety {{on the part of}} the railroads surround the process of land acquisition and sales. Since the federal government granted to the companies alternate tracts of land that ran along the tracks they had <b>laid,</b> <b>it</b> was generally assumed that the land would in turn be sold at its fair market value at the time the land was subdivided; circulars distributed by the SP (which was at the time a holding company formed by the Central Pacific Railroad) certainly implied as much. However, at least some of the tracts were put on the market only after considerable time had passed, and the land improved well beyond its raw state.|$|E
25|$|In {{the region}} of pure mathematics, De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; {{but he was not}} so {{proficient}} in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, table-turning, etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know whether they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on Spiritualism, in which he <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan did not believe this.|$|E
25|$|Papantla is {{the heart}} of the Totonacapan region. When the Spanish refounded the town, they <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> out in Spanish style with a central plaza {{surrounded}} by the most important buildings, such as the main church and the main government building. The Municipal Palace still faces the main plaza, marked by the classic-style pediment over the main entrance. This building contains two murals: one about the Totonacs by Teodoro Cano Garcia and the other by Xolotl Martinez Hurtado de Mendoza. The construction of the building dates from 1810 although it was destroyed by forces associated with Pancho Villa in 1915. The building was reconstructed in 1929, with remodeling done in 1979 and 1999. The plaza is officially named the Israel C. Téllez Park, which contains grass and a number of trees. In this plaza are weekend events such as the Danzón Fridays as well as live music on Saturday and cultural events on Sundays. On the underside of the kiosk is a mural by Teodoro Cano Garcia which depicts the indigenous concept of creation, as a world with four suns.|$|E

25|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} {{laid out by}} William Emes {{in the style of}} Capability Brown. It has long been used for public events such as Heaton Park races, which were established by the second Earl in 1827. The races were run on a course {{on the site of the}} present day boating lake until 1839 when they moved to Aintree near Liverpool, now the venue for the Grand National. During the 19th century when the railway to Bury was being <b>laid,</b> <b>it</b> stopped short of Heaton Park, as Lord Wilton was not prepared to see his estate disfigured by a railway. As a compromise the line was run under the estate in a tunnel and a railway station opened adjacent to the Whittaker Lane/Bury Old Road entrance in 1879 (now Heaton Park Metrolink station). Consequently, the decision by Lord Wilton to put the hall and park up for sale was greeted with dismay, especially when it became known that the site was being eyed by a property developer. A pressure group was formed to persuade Manchester City Council to purchase it as a museum and municipal park. Alderman Fletcher Moss, a prominent antiquarian was a notable influence in this movement. The park was purchased and opened to the public in 1902. Unfortunately, the council was not prepared to purchase the contents of the hall, so the furniture and paintings were sold by auction. The hall was considered by the council to be of little architectural or historical significance and the saloon was initially used as a tea-room.|$|E
