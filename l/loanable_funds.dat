5|$|In economics, the <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> {{doctrine}} {{is a theory}} of the market interest rate. According to this approach, the interest rate {{is determined by the}} demand for and supply of <b>loanable</b> <b>funds.</b> The term <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> includes all forms of credit, such as loans, bonds, or savings deposits.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{and again}} during the 1950s, the {{relationship}} between the <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> doctrine and the liquidity preference theory were discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent but this issue is still unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> {{doctrine}} was {{formulated in}} the 1930s by British economist Dennis Robertson and Swedish economist Bertil Ohlin. However, Ohlin attributed its origin to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell {{and the so-called}} Stockholm school, which included economists Erik Lindahl and Gunnar Myrdal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an overlapping-generations {{model of}} finance and growth with intrinsic heterogeneity in <b>loanable</b> <b>fund</b> conversion ability, where agents make occupational choice between becoming entrepreneurs and becoming workers. For a given ability distribution, {{a decrease in the}} number of entrepreneurs may create an occupational choice effect, enhancing the rate of growth of the economy, as the average conversion ability of the remaining entrepreneurs is higher. A change in ability distribution parameters may generate a permanent growth effect. Due to the presence of an occupational choice effect, a scale effect and general-equilibrium wage adjustments, however, financial market thickness and income growth need not be positively correlated, in response to such distribution shifts. While both a reduction in the unit financial operation cost and an improvement in manufacturing productivity are growth enhancing, they have different effects on equilibrium prices and financial markup. Occupational Choice, financial market, distribution and growth...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{different}} ways of interpreting the phrase "what determines the rate of interest. " On the one hand, we can, as usual, interpret it as asking what determines the equilibrium rate of interest. This interpretation is of equilibrium analysis. On the other hand, {{there is an alternative}} interpretation. It is of dynamic analysis. According to it, the phrase is able to be considered as asking what the condition is only under which the rate of interest changes. Thus we have two ways of approaching the problem of interest. The attempt {{of this paper is to}} make it clear that the hot and prolonged debate between the two monetary theory of interest, i. e. Liquidity Preference theory and <b>Loanable</b> <b>Fund</b> theory, is pointless in the first approach, that the debate is meaningful in the second approach, and that these two approach stand not in an alternative relation, but in a complementary one. It goes without saying that there is not any other method to give more complete explanation as to various magnitudes in an economy than a general equilibrium analysis. But a general equilibrium system such as that of Hicks does not pay appropriate attention on the role of money. So we turn to Patinkin's system to know what a correct general equilibrium system of monetary economy is. But beyond a certain point in Patinkin's direction, gains in completeness of explanation seems to be offset by losses in clarity and manageability. If however we are engaged in a dynamic approach like F. H. Hahn, we can obtain a more clarity and manageability in spite of remaining in the framework of a general equilibrium analysis. Hahn has formulated Investment-Saving theory, Liquidity Preference theory, and <b>Loanable</b> <b>Fund</b> theory from the view-point of what the necessary and sufficient condition is for a change in the rate of interest. In Metzler's system we inquire into the relations among these conditions set up by three theories. As a result of this inquiry we can negatively conclude that any theory of them has only relative relevance under corresponding special assumptions, and not general relevance...|$|R
5|$|The <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> {{doctrine}} {{extends the}} classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

25|$|The second {{criticism}} is that savings represent <b>loanable</b> <b>funds,</b> particularly at banks, assuming the savings are held at banks, rather than currency itself being held ("stashed under one's mattress"). Thus {{an accumulation of}} savings yields an increase in potential lending, which will lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing. So a decline in consumer spending is offset {{by an increase in}} lending, and subsequent investment and spending.|$|E
25|$|Two caveats {{are added}} to this criticism. Firstly, if savings are held as cash, rather than being loaned out (directly by savers, or indirectly, as via bank deposits), then <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> do not increase, and thus a {{recession}} may be caused – but {{this is due to}} holding cash, not to saving per se. Secondly, banks themselves may hold cash, rather than loaning it out, which results in the growth of excess reserves – funds on deposit but not loaned out. This is argued to occur in liquidity trap situations, when interest rates are at a zero lower bound (or near it) and savings still exceed investment demand. Within Keynesian economics, the desire to hold currency rather than loan it out is discussed under liquidity preference.|$|E

500|$|The <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> doctrine, by contrast, {{does not}} equate savings and investment, both {{understood}} in an ex ante sense, but integrates bank credit creation into this equilibrium condition. According to Ohlin: [...] "There is a credit market ... {{but there is}} no such market for savings and no price of savings". An extension of bank credit reduces the interest rate {{in the same way as}} an increase in savings.|$|E
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's {{theory of money}} and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers are saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E

5000|$|The {{macroeconomic}} theory behind {{crowding out}} provides some useful intuition.

A higher real interest rate increases the opportunity cost of borrowing money, decreasing the amount of interest-sensitive expenditures such as investment and consumption.

50|$|The {{monetary}} {{system is not}} a source of disturbance when there is monetary equilibrium {{but at the time}} of monetary disequilibrium the system becomes a source of disequilibrium by distorting the sources generated during the process of turning time-preferences into the demand and supply for <b>loanable</b> <b>funds.</b> For ex-ante and ex-post quantities to be equal someone has to lose out.In addition the adjustment process entails significant social costs. Now, let us suppose there is an excess supply in the market. Banks will create more <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> than people's real willingness to save as determined by their time preferences. This will result in a fall in the market rate of interest as banks will try to lure new borrowers with their excess money supply, but the natural rate remains the same as no additional supply of <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> have come from the public.|$|E
50|$|Many economists believe {{government}} deficits {{influence the}} economy through the <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> market, whose existence Chartalists and other Post-Keynesians dispute. Government borrowing {{in this market}} increases the demand for <b>loanable</b> <b>funds</b> and thus (ignoring other changes) pushes up interest rates. Rising interest rates can crowd out, or discourage, fixed private investment spending, canceling out some or even all of the demand stimulus arising from the deficit—and perhaps hurting long-term supply-side growth. But increased deficits also raise the amount of total income received, which raises the amount of saving done by individuals and corporations and thus the supply of <b>loanable</b> <b>funds,</b> lowering interest rates. Thus, crowding out is a problem only {{when the economy is}} already close to full employment (say, at about 4% unemployment) and the scope for increasing income and saving is blocked by resource constraints (potential output). Despite a government debt that exceeded GDP in 1945, the U.S. saw the long prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. The growth of the supply side, it seems, was not hurt by the large deficits and debts.|$|E
