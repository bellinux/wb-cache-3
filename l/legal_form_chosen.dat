40|$|This article {{examines}} German direct {{investment in the}} United Kingdom between 1871 and 1918. It {{is based on a}} new databank encompassing 179 empirical cases of FDI in sales subsidiaries, production units and service sector companies during a period when Anglo-German trade was intensive. FDI was growing as well, due both to the increasing competitiveness of German companies and to rising British non-tariff barriers to trade. German FDI in Britain is put into perspective by comparing it with German FDI elsewhere and with other FDI in the UK. Against this background the article ascertains from a German home country perspective what shape and extent investments took. Investments originating from 14 different branches of the economy are analysed according to type of investment, capital invested, branch, products, <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> <b>chosen,</b> date of entry, and location in the UK. The determinants behind investments are examined, and German FDI in this period is shown to be multi-causal. ...|$|E

Urban fringes are typical spaces of contention, where neighbourhood activism can be observed frequently. Protests emerge spontaneously and {{in a variety of}} guises. Despite the research on how to design genuine participatory planning, we know little about what happens when citizens themselves decide to enter the planning process.

The hypotheses were derived from a selection of case studies found in the literature. Statistically significant relationships were found for neighbourhood activism and the level of education as well as region's population density.

40|$|ABSTRACTInnovation, {{especially}} {{the revolution in}} innovation, {{is linked to the}} creation of a favorable enabling environment. According to Sabato and Botana (1968), innovations are the result of multiple and coordinated actions between three elements: government, structure of production, and scientific-technological infrastructure. Technology parks are the institutions which, par excellence, combine these three elements. In Brazil, they take many different legal forms, the spectrum ranging from private to public. There are examples of parks established as joint stock companies, social organizations, foundations, OSCIPS (civil society organization of public interest), and also are directly linked to the administration itself. The difference in legal structure is reflected directly in legal regimes and different management models. Differences in management and legal form may play a role in the ability of the park to offer suitable conditions for innovation. Of all the existing models, three presented themselves as the main foundations, joint stock companies, and social organizations. This is due to both the number of parks that follow these models and their importance of its relevance, since currently the parks have been created based on these three different structures. The objective of this study is to analyze seven technology parks Brazilians made according to these three models, in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> <b>chosen,</b> and thus the conditions of each to foster innovation...|$|E
40|$|In {{international}} context, {{corporate taxes}} represent {{one of the}} major limiting factors of the international capital flows. High corporate tax rates might distort the investment decision on the international projects, and as a consequence, limit the international efficiency level. The corporate tax system can affect the company’s behavior in a number of ways: it might influence the choice of the sources of finance in favor of debt or retained earnings; high tax rates can trigger tax planning activities to shift taxable income from affiliates in high tax countries to affiliates in low tax countries; next, corporate tax can seriously affect market dynamics on mergers and acquisitions as well as the <b>legal</b> organizational <b>form</b> <b>chosen</b> by the firm; and it can also promote tax evasion as well as reduce the capital mobility, etc. In order to eliminate these negative effects, national countries might implement different tax measures, and therefore improve their corporate income tax efficiency level. These international tax efficiency considerations are part of the contemporary corporate income tax reform and they include some certain measures with great potential for this purpose such as: lower statutory tax rates, integration of corporate income and personal income taxation, introduction of the alternative corporate tax systems (the “Cash flow corporate tax system” and the “Сomprehensive business income tax system– CBIT”), implementation of the thin capitalization rules as well as the transfer pricing rules, etc. The article’s objective is to present the latest trends of the contemporary tax reform from an international corporate tax efficiency aspect. More precisely, the intention is to introduce the measures that might effectively decrease the possibilities for corporate income tax distortion in international context. Generally, the basic methodology is consisted of the analytical, comparative and the narrative method. For the purpose of better illustration on the conclusions, diagrams and scenario analysis will be used adequately...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{wishes to}} problematize the {{foundations}} of production governance and offer an analytical perspective on the interrelation between agents' preferences, strategic choice and the public sphere (defined by impacts of choices on "publics" {{who do not have}} an input in strategic choice, and by contextual conditions). The value is in the idea of preferences being social in nature and in the application both to the internal stakeholders of the organisation and its impacts on people outside. Using the concept of "strategic failure" we suggest that social preferences reflected in deliberative social praxis can reduce false beliefs and increase individual wellbeing. From this approach, the paper offers a taxonomy of production organizations, based on social preferences about two variables: (i) the governance form (i. e. ownership and control rights) (ii) other strategic decisions that characterize the management of a company at a more operational level, once its fundamental <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> has been <b>chosen.</b> Each dimension (governance and strategic decisions processes) is then categorised alongside two basic preferences: towards inclusion or exclusion of "publics" that have no substantial access to decision power about these variables. Our framework explains governance heterogeneity by contrasting exclusive and inclusive social preferences in cooperatives, social enterprises, as well as traditional corporations. A discussion of the evolution of social preferences and organizational forms is addressed through examples and regional experiences...|$|R

The thesis focuses not only on the valid regulation of the domestic law, but also on the basic relevant standards of the European law that make impact on the international taxation in the Czech Republic either directly or after their transposition into the domestic law. The scientific intent of the thesis is to show the basic principles and starting points of the real estate taxation and the yield from real estate, which determine the decision-making of the individual natural persons or legal entities, in which country these subjects will invest in real estate or in which country they will have their domicile and what <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> they will <b>choose</b> for the business activity related to the ownership and the disposition of the real estate.

30|$|In addition, {{it should}} be noted that even within the same {{national}} innovation jurisdiction, the same functional type of intermediary organisation may often be structured and domiciled through very different legal entity forms—simply because there are so many different <b>legal</b> <b>forms</b> to <b>choose</b> and adapt from ad hoc. To name a few options in this regard: should a particular triple helix intermediary organisation be an unincorporated association, a foundation, a trust, a non-profit corporation/company, a for-profit business corporation/company, a for-profit general partnership, a contractual joint venture or consortium (i.e. without separate legal personality), a cooperative or a for-profit/non-profit hybrid corporation/company (for example, in the United Kingdom, a community-interest company)? The current variety in legal organisation may be inevitable given the adaptation default strategy on the one hand and the fact that intermediary legal organisations are tasked with domiciling a wide spectrum of possible real-world triple helix intermediation activities on the other hand. However, even when ‘explored independently’, taking into account that ‘each type of intermediary organization … will have unique characteristics’ (Metcalfe 2010 : 507; see also Landry et al. (2013 : 431); Pollard (2006 : 150)), all of the above types of legal entities (and many more) are pre-existing and generic tools of private/public, for-profit/non-profit ordering for purposes of partitioning and recognising enforceable separations and legal spheres of rights, responsibilities and assets. It may, therefore, be concluded that the legal organisation of real-world triple helix intermediation projects still occurs in very early stages of ad hoc experimentation and improvisation. Thus, it may also be claimed that current triple helix collaborations and their intermediation are both under-planned and under-institutionalised and that matters would generally benefit from a more robust academic discussion as regards (i) the adoption of new, sui-generis types of blended, thus, hybridised private/public, for-profit/non-profit legal organisations in order to specifically and exclusively organise triple helix innovation and its intermediation and (ii) at a minimum, the adaptation of existing legal entity formats in order to allow for the specific creation and tailoring of custom-made triple helix intermediary organisations.|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies <b>legal</b> <b>forms</b> {{for social}} {{enterprises}} in the UK and Thailand. The {{reason for the}} focus on these two countries is that the recent development of social enterprise in Thailand has been significantly influenced by the UK. I will show how a <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> specifically designed to suit the nature of social enterprise is important to its operation {{as well as the}} fostering of the social enterprise sector. Given this importance of such a <b>legal</b> <b>form,</b> and its unavailability in Thailand, a question arises: does the country need such a specially designed <b>legal</b> <b>form?</b> My argument in favour of its need runs as follows. Although the UK and Thailand rely on several <b>legal</b> <b>forms,</b> the Thai social enterprise sector, unlike its UK counterpart, still does not enjoy the benefits and advantages of a <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> like the Community Interest Company (CIC), which is devoted to the social enterprise by being purportedly designed specifically with its needs in mind. The Thai social enterprise sector’s reliance on the existing traditional legal structures has been found to suffer from serious limits: not only do these <b>legal</b> <b>forms</b> not facilitate the functioning of social enterprises, but the unavailability of a specialised legal structure becomes a disincentive to social entrepreneurship. A legal blueprint designed to suit the nature of social enterprise has thus been proposed to meet Thailand’s need. To establish its practical relevance, the blueprint has been used to evaluate the CIC and the <b>legal</b> <b>forms</b> adopted by social enterprises in Thailand. On the basis of the results of this evaluation it {{has been used as a}} model for the development of a specialised <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> for social enterprises in Thailand...|$|R

The experiences of many countries leading {{in the development of}} the agrarian sector of economy show that one of the important ways to achieve competitive advantage of a farm, which will guarantee it a firm position on the market, is group cooperation. Functioning in a group, allows its members (the farmers), not only to take part in the production of goods, but also in the ensuing stages on their processing and turnover. In the following article depicted is the horizontal integration status of agricultural holdings of Pomerania Region. The article also discusses the quantitative development of the agriculture producer groups, their spatial system and breakdown due to <b>chosen</b> <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> and business structure. In the Pomeranian 48 farm producer groups arose the after integration with the European Union. Most of them, was localized in regions of intensive agriculture with high quality of agricultural producing space. The <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> most commonly <b>chosen</b> when creating a group was a limited liability company (74, 5 %). In business structure the first place was taken by groups producing grain and oilseeds (54, 1 %), the second place simultaneously the producers of poultry, animals and swine, milk and potatoes, fresh or chilled (8, 3 % respectively after). Should hope that this group organization form springing from the authentic rural cooperatives will help to solve if not all, then at least some of the problems facing Pomeranian agriculture. Moreover, a group of agricultural producers will have an influence on the further development of rural areas of Pomerania.

In our opinion this is sufficient to show the main effects of IDR on the choice of organizational form. In addition, we assumed that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization do {{not depend on the}} <b>legal</b> <b>form.</b> This neglects the fact that the <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> decision may affect risk taking and, therefore, cash flows. However, since our focus is on tax non-neutrality to the <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> decision, we believe our point gets clearer when holding all other decisions constant, including the investment decision, switching only the <b>legal</b> <b>form.</b> Moreover, the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>form</b> affects the risk taking of managers only if creditors cannot perfectly monitor the corporate activities which is in contrast to our assumption of symmetric information. In sum, it seems useful to expand the model to a multi-period setting in future research and maybe also to incorporate behavioral uncertainties resulting from information asymmetry.|$|R
