25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on it, something that horrified Law's constitutional <b>law</b> <b>adviser</b> A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E

There may also have been a feeling that some of the work of the <b>Law</b> <b>Adviser</b> was beneath the dignity of the ancient office of Serjeant.

50|$|He became <b>Law</b> <b>Adviser</b> to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (a deputy to the {{two senior}} law officers) in 1880. The office had become a very onerous one and had been criticised for its {{excessively}} political nature, since one of the Law Adviser's responsibilities was to advise magistrates {{on how to deal}} with proceedings with a political element. Naish is credited with having suggested that magistrates in their ongoing struggle with the Irish National Land League, should rely on an obscure medieval statute, 34 Edward III c.1, to imprison those who could not find sureties for their good behaviour. This was arguably an abuse of the law since the statute was clearly aimed only at cases of riot. These concerns about his obviously political role may explain why the office of <b>Law</b> <b>Adviser</b> was left vacant after his promotion to higher office.|$|E
