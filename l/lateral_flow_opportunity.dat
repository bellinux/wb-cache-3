40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 <b>Lateral</b> <b>flow</b> {{diagnostics}} are {{the most}} common and most commercially successful form of point-of-care diagnostic. The first and most prevalent <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay is the pregnancy test. <b>Lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assays are low cost, rapid, and simple to operate. However, <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> immunoassays have been limited in their success due to poor performance related to an inability to detect low analyte concentrations. In this thesis, we aim to create a high-performance point-of-care immunoassay by integrating sample concentration into a sandwich immunoassay. We use a method called isotachophoresis (ITP) to enhance the detection of low analyte concentrations in the <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> format. We present the performance characteristics for a <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> enhanced with ITP diagnostic (LID) assay for the detection of strep throat and the detection of chlamydia. We additionally put forth a method for investigating parameters that are important for the performance of LID assays. Lastly, we validate the LID format in clinically relevant samples. We show a limit-of-detection of strep throat cells in clean buffer to be 2000 CFU/mL, an improvement of more than 100 -fold over a commercial <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay. This assay also demonstrates an improvement in the analytical sensitivity when compared to the commercial assay. We also present the detection of chlamydia in the LID format demonstrating a 3 -fold improvement over a commercial <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay. The dramatic difference in improvement when comparing the streptococcus assay to chlamydia motivated an investigation into the parameters that are important when using isotachophoresis to enhance the performance of a <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay. For designing the chemistry of a LID assay, it is important to investigate the ionic strength (IS), pH and lysis chemistry. Each of these parameters affect the binding of antibody to antigen, as well as the performance of the ITP. Designing with both the binding and ITP performance in mind can be difficult. We present guidelines for obtaining and utilizing these parameter effects in the chemistry design. We develop a model to calculate the limit-of-detection for <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> and LID assays from antibody and assay parameters. This model shows that the benefit of a LID assay can be limited by non-specific binding between label and capture antibodies. The model finds that ITP is the most beneficial to antibody pairs with low non-specific affinities. Finally, we test the strep throat LID assay in contrived clinical samples to validate the compatibility of the format with clinical samples. Our assay is able to successfully differentiate positive from negative samples in these clinically relevant samples. Our assay identifies all positive samples in the expected clinical range...|$|R

The <b>lateral</b> <b>flows</b> of the Tarn River, which crosses the Grands Causses karst zone in Southern France, were investigated between several gauging stations along the river. First, through analysing the <b>lateral</b> <b>flows</b> on an event time scale of 30 floods, it was possible to identify the losing and gaining reaches, highlighting a highly variable attenuation/amplification role of karsts on flood generation. Second, the diffusive wave model was used to quantify the <b>lateral</b> <b>flows</b> on an hourly time step within a flood event. The simulations show a high variability of lateral outflows and inflows within a same reach according to the hydrometeorological conditions, with in some cases an inversion of the <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> direction during the flood. The results highlight complex surface/groundwater exchanges during a single flood event, with high river losses despite the concurrent flow of large springs feeding the stream. This spatio-temporal variability of the karst influence on flood generation was linked to the aquifer’s structure, which has improved the understanding of the hydro(geo) logical functioning of the Grands Causses massif.

Based on the novel probe-free labeling methods, we established a <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay to capture the specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification amplicons which were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and biotin. And the final detection time of this system was within 40  min. The false positive results of the <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay induced by primer dimer tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate and biotin were eliminated by Taq single strand DNA binding protein (4  ng/μL). Simultaneously, {{the efficiency of the}} fast loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay was achieved. By injection of Taq SSB into the amplification assay as a replacement for betaine, the novel probe-free method could detect Cronobacter species with high specificity and sensitivity at the detection limit in PIF of 101  cfu/g. Our overall strategy has excellent potential in the rapid diagnosis of Cronobacter species label-free by integrating loop-mediated isothermal amplification and <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> assay.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>flow</b> biosensors are {{a leading}} {{technology}} in point-of-care diagnostics {{due to their}} simplicity, rapidness and low cost. Their primacy in this arena continues through technological breakthroughs such as multiplexing: the detection {{of more than one}} biomarker in a single assay. Multiplexing capacity is critical for improving diagnostic efficiency, enhancing the diagnostic precision for specific diseases and reducing diagnostic cost. Here we review, for the first time, the various types and strategies employed for creating multiplexed <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> biosensors. These are classified into four main categories in terms of specific application or multiplexing level, namely linear, parameter, spatial and conceptual. We describe the practical applications and implications for each approach and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Importantly, multiplexing is still subject to limitations of the traditional <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> device, such as sensitivity and specificity. However, by pushing the limitations of the traditional medium into the multiplex arena, several technological breakthroughs are emerging with novel solutions that further expand the utility of <b>lateral</b> <b>flow</b> biosensing for point-of-care applications.
