25|$|The Swedenborgian {{church in}} nearby Cranbrook Road was erected in 1899 and has {{recently}} closed. The congregation {{was formed in}} 1791 and had a church in Terrel Street.

Neil Marchant wrote a book ' <b>Like</b> <b>A</b> <b>River</b> Flowing' covering the history of this church which can now be found in Bristol central library. The church is currently up for sale and likely to be redeveloped.|$|E

25|$|From the 1920s to the 1970s, {{the average}} Australian family aimed {{to own a}} 'weekender', in {{addition}} to their suburban dwelling. (In New Zealand, a weekender is known as a bach). On a block of land close to a beach, near a coastal village, or other place of recreation <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>river,</b> lake or mountain, a family might erect a 'shack', or , usually with their own hands, often using materials brought from their city residence, or obtained nearby. Shacks and cabins used as weekenders were sometimes built illegally, in remote or inaccessible areas, for example, within National Parks. Weekenders were not always constructed according to the local council's building code; they were often excellent examples of bush carpentry.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1960s, Gehry {{has made}} artistic use of scaled {{animals such as}} fish and snakes, which first {{appeared}} in his architectural designs in the 1980s. Many references to the bridge describe it as snakelike for its winding path, and some even refer to the stainless steel plates as scales with discussion of reptilian forms. Kamin calls it [...] "a bridge that resembles a giant silver snake, complete with a scaly skin", while Gehry {{said he thought the}} bridge looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>river,</b> but added he might be the only one who thought that.|$|E
500|$|Clayton {{called it}} part of a trilogy of songs on the album, along with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared", that decry the {{involvement}} of the United States in the Chilean coup. McGuinness stated that the imagery in the song described the sense of tragedy felt by the band over Carroll's death. Colm O'Hare of Hot Press believed the Edge's guitar riff personified the lyric [...] "run <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>river</b> runs to the sea". Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel felt the song reflected the seduction of a lover. Richard Harrington of the Washington Post acknowledged the tribute to Carroll, adding that it demonstrated U2's belief that music could spur change.|$|E

500|$|... "One Tree Hill" [...] was {{received}} favourably by critics. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes {{described it as}} one of U2's best tracks, calling it a [...] "fitting tribute" [...] to Carroll. The Toronto Star felt {{it was one of the}} best songs on the album. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe compared Bono's vocals at the song's conclusion to the passion of American soul singer Otis Redding, also noting that the coda was reminiscent of the hymn [...] "Amazing Grace". Steve Pond of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a soft, haunting benediction". Bill Graham of Hot Press said the song was [...] "hopeful, not grim", describing the lyric [...] "We run <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>river</b> to the sea" [...] as [...] " [...] metaphor recast in terms of eternal life and the Maori's own belief." [...] He described the Edge's playing as [...] "a loose-limbed guitar melody with both an African and a Hawaiian tinge", concluding by saying [...] "despite its moving vocal coda, 'One Tree Hill' isn't sombre. It celebrates the life of the spirit not its extinction." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Call the Shots" [...] is a dance-pop and pop rock track {{written in}} the key of D major and with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. Unlike previous singles released by the band, the song follows the verse–chorus form. The lyrics {{are concerned with the}} ending of a relationship, and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing, [...] "Static tone on the phone, I'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe". As the chorus begins, the five members of the group trade lines and sing, [...] "Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that [...] "only anterograde amnesia could wipe [...] from your brain". During the middle-eight, Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – Our Story, released in 2008: [...] "I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer, oh no / I've seen life flow by <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>river</b> / So full of twilight, dreams that glitter". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] was based on 1990s dance productions, and added that it incorporated [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ah ah ahs" [...] that [...] "reverberate around an infectious chorus," ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{starts out}} by admitting that Kenney chose a topic {{unfamiliar}} and more abstract than what people {{would normally be}} used to. Undercutting this idea, however, he argues that without doing so, the {{breadth and depth of}} Kenney's poetry {{as well as that of}} poetry in general, would be very limited. [...] "With its agreeable eddies of temperament, reflections that braid and shatter only to recompose downstream, this book moves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>river</b> in a country of ponds." [...] Then Merrill continues to illustrate Kenney's stylistic approach by praisefully describing the beautiful imagery that he creates by combining, or [...] "doubling," [...] select words. He goes further as to describe Kenney's stylistic approach as [...] "rendering a given scene in sound so artful and imagery so burnished by myth that words appear to have found their poet." ...|$|E

But once the mind has received (impressions of) natural things, they tend to remain and not to disappear, thus leaving traces in the mind. (These affect later seeing and thinking, so that the mind is not truly 'empty' and unbiased.)
