40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} three studies {{completed}} {{in the area of}} marine safety. The first study focused on the compatibility between the anthropometric characteristics of persons employed in the offshore oil industry in Newfoundland and liferaft and lifeboat evacuations systems employed in the offshore. Findings from this study suggest that manufacturers should consider shoulder breadth, rather than hip breadth measurements as a better criterion for determining seat design and <b>lifesaving</b> <b>appliance</b> occupancy capacities. Furthermore, the typical morphological features of a typical person employed in the Newfoundland offshore are considerably larger than the standards used in the type approval process. This study concludes that testing standards should be reconsidered. The second study assessed the requirements for measuring forces and accelerations acting on humans engaged in marine evacuation systems such as chutes and slides. While no subjects reported pain or injury due to these tasks, the upper limits of loading recorded might have the potential to injure a younger, older or less-fit person. The study concludes that manufacturers should be aware of human tolerance limits when developing evacuations systems. The third study consisted of the measurement of egress times for injured or physically challenged users of marine evacuation systems. Data from the study reported it takes on average 89. 3 s and a maximum of 129. 8 s for a mannequin loaded stretcher to descend through a slide and be placed into its final position in the raft. Throughout the trials, mannequins experienced head accelerations of approximately 2 Gs. There was a general trend that heavier stretchers seemed to better secure/restrain the mannequin and resulted in smaller accelerations during the descent. This thesis provides considerable guidance to regulatory bodies and manufacturers in the development, testing and deployment of marine evacuation systems...|$|R
40|$|Immersion {{suits are}} <b>lifesaving</b> <b>appliances</b> (LSA) {{designed}} to protect the wearer if they become accidently immersed in cold water by reducing the cold shock response and delaying the onset of hypothermia. Immersion suits are certified to both national and international standards; some of which require the thermal protective properties to be tested using humans or thermal manikins. The ethical nature of testing with humans has been questioned [1] due to the physically grueling nature of these tests, thus testing with manikins may be preferential. However, previous work has shown that discrepancies exist between thermal manikins and humans that could result in immersion suit selection that would benefit the former more than the latter who would ultimately use it [2]. This study investigated the thermoregulatory responses of humans and compared them to a thermal manikin while wearing immersion ensembles with insulation distributed in various configurations hypothesized to be beneficial to humans and manikins.

40|$|In {{a marine}} evacuation, {{passengers}} {{may find themselves}} in lifeboats, liferafts or in the water. Survival is more challenging in cold regions and a person’s ability to survive until rescue depends on many factors, including the amount of protection the evacuees have against the cold, {{as well as the}} quality of breathing air in liferafts and lifeboats that are enclosed. Currently, international regulations do not provide specific thermal protection and ventilation performance criteria for lifeboats or liferafts. In addition, methods for approval testing of immersion suits have not been standardised and there is resistance in certain jurisdictions to the use of thermal manikins because regulating authorities are unsure of the correspondence between manikins and human. This paper provides an overview of several projects that have been completed and one ongoing by the Maritime and Arctic Survival Scientific and Engineering Research Team (MASSERT) to address the knowledge gaps in these areas. The results contribute relevant knowledge to close these gaps and are being used to advance international standards. They also show the value of using thermal manikins in combination with numerical models to predict the performance of <b>lifesaving</b> <b>appliances</b> when it is impractical or ethically unacceptable to conduct experiments with humans. The tools developed are being applied to create performance criteria and evaluate the performance of Arctic survival gear. ...|$|E
40|$|Lifeboats {{are used}} as an {{evacuation}} system {{on a wide variety}} of offshore structures and marine vehicles. Currently, International Maritime Organization (IMO) <b>Lifesaving</b> <b>Appliances</b> (LSA) Code does not specify thermal protection and ventilation criteria for lifeboats. A test program was conducted to assess the system thermal protection and microclimate of SOLAS approved lifeboats for the Arctic environment. Some of the research findings of the first phase experiments are reported in this paper. In conducting experiments with a 72 -person SOLAS approved lifeboat, the study found that the lifeboat only had a ventilation rate of 2 litres per second with vents open only, which may not be adequate. Inadequate ventilation will result in high concentration of carbon dioxide, causing headache, dizziness, restlessness, breathing difficulty, sweating, and increased heart rate, cardiac output and blood pressure. All of these may adversely affect lifeboat occupants in performing survival tasks. Using a thermal manikin, only slight decrease in thermal resistance (less than 10 %) was observed in many test cases, when active ventilation was implemented (ventilation rate of 31 and 42 litres per second) and when side hatches were opened (ventilation rate of 95 litres per second). This suggests that reasonable increase in ventilation rate may be implemented without trading off much in thermal protection. However, a more noticeable decreases in thermal resistance (15 % to over 30 %) were observed when clothing was wet. This suggests it is critical to stay dry. A mathematical model was also developed to assess heat and cold stress of lifeboat occupants under different environment, lifeboat, occupant and ventilation conditions.

40|$|Lifeboats are {{the most}} used marine {{evacuation}} craft in both the shipping and offshore industries. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) <b>Lifesaving</b> <b>Appliances</b> (LSA) code does not have criteria for the manoeuvring performance of lifeboats nor for their habitability and effects on human subjects. During standard seakeeping exercises conducted with a SOLAS approved 20 -person lifeboat in Conception Bay, NL two NRC employees (coxswain and assistant) wearing certified immersion suit systems had their skin temperature, deep body temperature, and heart rate measured while performing their assigned duties. During the morning of July 24 th, 2009, the outside air temperature was 140 C and the water temperature was approximately 7. 60 C, with little to no cloud cover. While piloting the lifeboat with the hatches closed, the interior temperature of the lifeboat rose from 19. 40 C to 28. 50 C {{over the course of}} approximately two hours. With the immersion suits fully zipped, the coxswain experienced an increase in mean skin temperature of 3. 40 C, while the assistant 2 ̆ 019 s rose by 2. 70 C. The coxswain 2 ̆ 019 s mean body temperature rose by 0. 740 C, and the assistant 2 ̆ 019 s by 1. 00 C. After the two-hour time period, both the coxswain and assistant 2 ̆ 019 s clothing were heavily soaked with sweat, and both reported moderate levels of thermal discomfort due to the heat. In the afternoon of the same day, with little to no cloud cover, the outside air and water temperatures registered 150 C and 8. 780 C, respectively,. For the afternoon trials, the lifeboat hatches were left open, and the immersion suits were unzipped. Over a two-hour period, the interior temperature of the lifeboat rose by only 0. 20 C, the coxswain 2 ̆ 019 s mean skin temperature rose by 0. 50 C, and the assistant 2 ̆ 019 s by 0. 50 C. After the two hour afternoon session was completed, both the coxswain and the assistant reported little to no thermal discomfort with the interior temperature of the lifeboat. Based on these preliminary observations, prolonged occupancy of a sealed lifeboat {{with a high level of}} clothing insulation may lead to increased thermal stress on the evacuees.

40|$|Lifeboats {{are used}} {{as a means of}} {{evacuation}} from offshore structures and marine vehicles. Currently, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) <b>Lifesaving</b> <b>Appliances</b> (LSA) Code does not specify thermal protection and ventilation criteria for lifeboats. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the thermal protection and ventilation rate of lifeboats for the Arctic environment. Two SOLAS approved lifeboats were used for model development: a 72 -person lifeboat with engine off and a 20 - person lifeboat with engine on. The dilution experiments (where the rate of reduction of concentration in injected carbon dioxide was estimated, to determine ventilation rate) with the 72 -person lifeboat found that the lifeboat had a ventilation rate of 2 l/s with vents open, which is inadequate to maintain carbon dioxide level below 5000 ppm. The 20 -person lifeboat had 11. 6 l/s at full engine power and 7. 8 l/s at half power; both being inadequate ventilation rates. A thermal manikin and a mathematical model were used to assess heat and cold stress of lifeboat occupants under various lifeboat, occupancy and ventilation conditions in the Arctic summer environment. In a lifeboat with the engine running, the occupants are likely to suffer heat stress unless a ventilation rate of several hundred litres per second can be achieved. The effect of occupant heat loss with ventilation was also assessed in the 72 -person lifeboat with the engine off. When the lifeboat is carrying half the number of people for which it is rated and when these occupants are wearing dry reference clothing and lifejacket, the ventilation rate could be increased to 100 litres per second (minimum ventilation to keep carbon dioxide below 5000 ppm is 27 l/s) to achieve thermoneutral heat loss (51. 7 W/m 2). When the lifeboat is fully loaded, the ventilation rate can be increased to 300 l/s to achieve a similar microclimate (minimum ventilation rate to keep carbon dioxide level below 5000 ppm is 54 l/s). A higher ventilation rate is required if the engine is on. This suggests that an increase in ventilation rate needs to be implemented to avoid heat stress and provide adequate ventilation. In conclusion, the use of a thermal manikin supported by a simple heat loss model helped define the adequate ventilation rates in lifeboats under simulated Arctic summer conditions and showed that the current risks are mainly carbon dioxide toxicity and heat stress.
