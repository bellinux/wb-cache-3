'Good, I'll see you at the party.' I'm going, 'Oh my God, does she know she's all over my room?' So we go to the after-party. She comes up to me she goes, 'Will you dance with me?' I went, 'Yes.

5000|$|Subsequently, in an {{interview}} with Bertrand Coquoz of Wegweiser Magazin in Germany, Jaxon-Bear said of his affair, “My worst mistake thus far in this flawed life was allowing myself to be in an intimate relationship with two women at the same time. They were the two <b>loves</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and they both loved me deeply and truly. But it was an impossible situation for all three of us. I caused suffering to the two people that I loved most deeply. That first mistake led to my lying about my affair. This was a great mistake. I had never lied to my partner over our thirty years together and it was a terrible mistake. It was shocking to see that I was capable of this. Bearing having caused suffering and falling into the trap of lying was the greatest pain that I have ever experienced in <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It burned a holy fire in a place that had not yet burned. As I tried to satisfy my obligations to both my partner and my lover I continued to make many mistakes.” ...|$|R

You talk about my {{happiness}} before I met you--but oh, how empty it all was! I read, and played, and sang as you say, but what a void there was! I did it to please mother, but there really seemed no very clear reason why I should continue to do it. Then you came, and everything was changed. I read because you are fond of reading and because I {{wanted to talk about}} books with you. I played because you are fond of music. I sang in the hope that it might please you. Whatever I did, you were always in my mind. I tried and tried to become a better and nobler woman, because I wanted to be worthy of the love you bore me. I have changed, and developed, and improved more {{in the last three months}} than in all my life before. And then you come and tell me that you have darkened my life. You know better now. My life has become full and rich, for Love fills my life. It is the keynote of my nature, the foundation, the motive power. It inspires me to make the most of any gift or talent that I have. How could I tell you all this if I did not know that your own feeling was as deep. I could not have given the one, great, and only <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> in exchange for a half-hearted affection from you.

40|$|We {{approach}} {{the problem of}} active learning from a Bayesian perspective, working with a probability distribution over the solution space. In addition to the classical active selection of data points, we formulate the construction of minimum decision trees from noisy datasets as an active learning task. Building on the OASIS algorithm, we compare active learning score functions based on the EC 2 criterion with uncertainty sampling, two GBS approaches, and random selection by performing experiments on several standard datasets. While constituting a unique approach in its original online setting, according to our findings, the OASIS algorithm does not generally offer performance benefits in a classical offline setting. Furthermore, for active learning from noisy data samples, we introduce a new intrinsic EC 2 -based stopping criterion and show that in many cases, it outperforms a standard information gain based method paired with the χ 2 -test on the decision tree learning problem. In particular, our criterion enables the effective construction of small decision trees, and may provide the first effective method to learn a close-to-minimal tree classifier with bounded expected error rates from noisy data samples. i Acknowledgments I want to thank Andreas Krause for his caring supervision, in particular for all the time, effort and energy spent on providing guidance and explanations. Furthermore, I am indebted to Victor Candia for his support and helpful advice, and to Wito Traub for his comments. My parents, Josef and Madeleine Rupprechter, deserve special thanks {{along with the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family for their ongoing support, without which the writing of this thesis would have been impossible.

Often, human beings simplify the idea <b>of</b> <b>love</b> into a romantic ideal, but it is instead a constantly changing notion of how we should live our lives.
