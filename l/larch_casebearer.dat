50|$|Many insect {{species are}} known to be {{destructive}} to tamaracks. The larch sawfly is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across Canada and the northern United States and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota, however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> Coleophora laricella. The <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.|$|E
40|$|The <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> Coleophora laricella (Hbn.) is now {{established}} {{throughout all}} western larch stands in Region 1. Population levels {{have begun to}} fluctuate {{in some of the}} older infested stands; however, it is still on the increase in more recently invaded territory. During the past 2 years work was begun to develop a method to forecast defoliation and tg ollow trends of the <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> (Ciesla and Bousfield 1971). 111 / The purpose of these evaluations was to establish the relationship between the overwintering population and subsequent defoliation for prediction purposes...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{stands of}} western larch, Larix occidentalis, on the St. Joe, Coeur d'Alene, and Kaniksu National Forests, Idaho, {{show signs of}} gradual {{deterioration}} following repeated defoliation by <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer,</b> Coleophora Zaricella Hbn. (Tunnock et al. 1969). Stand deterioration can occur after 4 years of continued heavy defoliation. The main symptom is epicormic branching. Upon examination, many of these dead and dying larch have been infested by the western larch borer, Tetropium veZutinum LeConte, or infected by root rotting fungi. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if larch severely weakened by <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> feeding would die if they were not attacked by borers or root rots...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{during the}} summer of 1985 showed that parasites were still exerting control on the <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> on the Flathead NF. Parasitism ranged from 4 to 60 percent and averaged 25. 2 percent in the 12 areas surveyed. Four species of parasites were involved. The most abundant was Agathis pumila (Ratzeburg), an exotic wasp that was established within the Flathead NF from 1967 to 1969...|$|E

40|$|Disturbances have {{a strong}} impact on tree stand {{dynamics}} across the world. In North America, the larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii) and <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> (Cleophora laricella) are two non-native species of insects affecting tamarack across much of their native range. The majority {{of research on the}} effects of larch sawfly on tamarack (Larix laricina) has been conducted in Canada with very little dendrochronological work in the United States along the geographical boundary of tamarack or on the effects of <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> on radial growth. As a consequence, very {{little is known about the}} relationship between tamarack and these insects’ outbreaks in the United States. The traditional model of Ecological Amplitude in biogeography explains that species are limited along their southern border by species interaction, so it is very important to start to understand the relationship between predator and prey. At the Pigeon River State Fish and Wildlife Area in northern Indiana, tamarack are stressed and dying out on the landscape and local naturalists believe insect outbreaks are a potential factor. I use the traditional dendrochronological methods to develop and compare host and non-host chronologies from northern Indiana and central Michigan. I then compared these chronologies to each other, local climate variables, and insect outbreak information to better understand climate and outbreak signals in radial growth. I found that tamarack in Indiana showed a stronger negative response to temperature in Indiana than in Michigan which indicates warmer temperature play a role in limiting the southern margin of the species’ range. Tamarack also provided a good record of local insect outbreak events. Using outbreak information collected from local naturalists, I developed a tree ring outbreak signature for <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer.</b> Continued work along the southern boundary of the species will determine the combined impacts of multiple species specific predators as climate changes...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} the distribution of parasites of the <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer,</b> Coleophora laricelia, within crowns of western larch, Larix occidentalis. The most common parasites recovered in order of their abundance, were: Agathis pumila (Ratz.), Diciadocerus sp. near westwoodii, Spilochalcis albifrons (Walsh), and MesopoZobus sp. Parasitism by A. pumila was significantly higher in the outer limbs of the upper one-third of the crown. Diciadocerus sp. near westwoodii was highest on the inner branch portions regardless of crown level. S. albifrons parasitized more casebearers on the lower-outer portion of the crown. Parasitism by Mesopolobus sp. was uniform throughout the crown...|$|E
40|$|Defoliating {{insects are}} major {{disturbance}} agents affecting forest health and productivity in eastern Oregon and Washington, USA. Information {{on the four}} main defoliators of conifers in eastern Oregon and Washington is abundant. Because of concerns about growth suppression and mortality of trees during widespread defoliator outbreaks, much research effort {{has been focused on}} these species. They are western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis), Douglas fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata), pandora moth (Coloradia pandora), and <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> (Coleophora laricella). Various interactions of defoliators with other system components and natural regulatory processes have been described, as have monitoring and suppression techniques using pheromone traps. Large-scale suppression projects using both chemical and biological materials have been used in attempts to control some defoliator outbreaks. While such suppression projects have prevented some tree mortality and growth loss, they have been largely ineffective in changing the outbreak behaviour of these insects. Some suppression materials have undesirable side effects on non-target insects such as sensitive or endangered moths, butterflies, and skippers, or on other ecological processes. Successful control of <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> has been achieved by introduction of parasitic wasps. For most defoliators, the recommended strategy is preventative: silvicultural treatment to promote a diversity of tree species, stand structures, and moderate stocking levels. Decision-support tools UPEST and UTOOLS analyse insect and disease risks, and the Forest Vegetation Simulator models effects of insects and disease on stand growth.

40|$|Excerpt: The <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> Coleophora laricella (Hübner) is a {{defoliator}} of larch (Larix spp.). The insect {{was introduced}} into North America from Europe {{at some time}} prior to 1886, and since has spread steadily westward. It was causing heavy defoliation by the early 19202 ̆ 7 s near Ann Arbor in southern Michigan and was recorded in northeast Wisconsin in 1939, at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario in 1942, and Port Arthur, Ontario in 1947. Many native parasites attack the case bearer but seem to effect little control. Parasites were imported from Europe beginning in 1928, but the first attempts to establish them were unsuccessful. In 1932, the United States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine made releases of Agathis pumila (Ratz.) at Lynwood, Massachusetts, and Epilampsis laricinellae (Ratz.) in Lunenburg Township, Massachusetts. These two species were successfully established...|$|E
40|$|The <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer,</b> Coleophora laricella (Hubner) {{was first}} {{reported}} attacking western larch, Larix occidentalis, in Idaho in 1957 (Denton, 1958), 71 {{years after its}} introduction into Massachusetts from Europe. The apparent successful regulation of this insect in the eastern U. S. by introduced parasites prompted biological control attempts in the West. Introduction of Agathis pumila (Ratzeburg), {{considered one of the}} most significant parasites in the East, was emphasized following a period of laboratory and field evaluations. Between 1966 and 1969, Forest Insect & Disease Management released A. pumila at 378 locations in Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Most releases consisted of attaching parasitized casebearer-infested branches to lower branches of three infested trees at each release location. Evaluations made between 1967 and 1972 verified the presence of A. pumila on 127 plots out of 270 examined and percent parasitism ranged from 0. 1 to 90 percent...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{thinning}} to five growing-stock levels {{resulted in}} widely differing tree sizes and volumes per acre after 30 years. Largest trees but the least cubic-volume yield per acre were {{produced in the}} heaviest thinning level, whereas highest board-foot yields were found in intermediate thinning levels. partial defoliation by <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> (Coleophora Iaricella Hubner), drought, and top damage from ice occurred, and site trees grew less in height than expected during the 30 -year study. Curvilinear increases in periodic annual increments of both basal area and cubic volume generally occurred with increasing stand density, but increments dropped off at the highest stand densities for some periods. Anticipated patterns for these increments were found after fitting a model that included stand density index, height increments of site trees, and dummy variables for periods as independent variables. heavy thinning did not increase the age of culmination of cubic-volume means annual increment as expected. Thinning stands of larch to densities as low as 50 percent of 'normal' results in little loss of basal-area growth, a moderate loss in volume production, and a large increase in tree diameter. Thinning is necessary in many larch stands to maintain vigorous, rapidly growing trees...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of non-native insects are reaching our ports and beyond {{as a result of}} global travel and trade, but they may also arrive from other regions of USA. While historically, the forests east of the Cascade crest have experienced relatively few serious invaders, there is a growing concern over the increased potential for invasion by non-native insect species that may displace native species and/or cause significant economic and ecological damage to east-side forest resources. The threat posed by a non-native invasive species is that the forest may lack natural control mechanisms, and the species may become established, spread, and inflict substantial ecological and economic damage before eradication or mitigation measures can be identified and implemented. In general, treatments and practices that improve forest health reduce the risk or effects of widespread insect outbreaks for indigenous species, and have been prescribed to mitigate the effect of non-native species. However, the most effective management options focus on prevention and suppression efforts, which include investigating potential invaders and pathways of introduction, imposing regulatory restrictions, developing and implementing detection and monitoring strategies, and aggressive eradication efforts. Specific management strategies are likely to differ for each potential invader. Examples of east-side invaders include <b>larch</b> <b>casebearer</b> (Coleophora laricella), which has been successfully controlled by introduced parasitoids, the gypsy moth-both Asian and European strains-which has thus far been prevented from establishing in the Pacific Northwest through diligent surveillance and immediate eradication efforts, and the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges picea), a sap-feeding insect that appears to be an increasing problem in the east side without an immediate solution. An {{increasing number}} of introduced wood boring (Coleoptera and Hymenoptera) insects that have been discovered in Oregon and Washington, USA, including at least one east-side site, are also of growing concern.
