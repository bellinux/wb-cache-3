5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipase</b> (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipase,</b> USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

40|$|Sequence {{comparisons}} of vitellogenins {{from a wide}} range of organisms have identified regions of similarity not only to each other but also to vertebrate apolipoproteins (e. g. apoB- 100 and apoE). Furthermore, the chicken vitellogenin receptor, which also binds apolipoproteins receptor (LDLR) superfamily [Bujo, H., Hermann, M., Kaderli, M. O., Jacobsen, L., Sugawara, S., Nimpf, J., Yamamoto, T. & Schneider, W. J. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 5165 - 5175]. The yolk proteins of higher dipterans are exceptional, however, and instead show similarity to <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases.</b> The molecular characterization of the putative Drosophila melanogaster vitellogenin receptor gene, yolkless (yl), described in this report reveals that the protein it encodes (Yl), is also a member of the LDLR superfamily. The ovary-specific 6. 5 -kb yl RNA codes for a protein of approximately 210 kDa which contains all three motifs common to the LDLR class of proteins. Within this superfamily, Yl may be related more to the LDLR-related proteins (LRPs), which bind both apolipoproteins and <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases.</b> The similarity of Yl to the other LDLR proteins is restricted to the putative extracellular domain.

40|$|Abstract The plasma {{clearance}} of intestinally derived remnant lipoproteins by {{the liver}} {{is a process}} that likely involves three steps. Our model suggests that the initial rapid clearance by the liver begins with sequestration of the remnants within the space of Disse, where apolipoprotein E secreted by hepatocytes enhances remnant binding and uptake. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which are also abundant in the space of Disse, mediate this enhanced binding. Next, the remnants undergo further processing in the space of Disse by hepatic and <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases,</b> which may also serve as ligands mediating remnant uptake. The final step, endocytosis by hepatocytes, appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and by the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP).

40|$|AbstractA 106 -residue {{region of}} high {{similarity}} between lipoprotein/pancreatic/hepatic lipases and Drosophila vitellogenins encompasses four β-strands with all residues but one strictly conserved or conservatively replaced between the structures, and enclosing the putative active site Ser- 152. The properties suggest a common folding pattern but the region probably does not {{function as an}} ‘interface recognition site’ in the lipases, although it might well bind fatty acid esters of ecdysteroids or single lipid molecules in the vitellogenins. C-terminally of this 106 -residue region, a surface loop (‘flap’) covers the active site. No residue within this loop is conserved through all lipases, but adjacent segments exhibit 60 – 70 % residue identity, Hepatic and <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases</b> probably hydrolyze both soluble and emulsified substrates at the same site.

40|$|The angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL 3) is an {{important}} inhibitor of the endothelial and <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases</b> and a promising drug target. ANGPTL 3 undergoes proprotein convertase processing (RAPR 224 ↓TT) for activation, and the processing site contains two potential GalNAc O-glycosylation sites immediately C-terminal (TT 226). We developed an in vivo model system in CHO ldlD cells {{that was used to}} show that O-glycosylation in the processing site blocked processing of ANGPTL 3. Genome-wide SNP association studies have identified the polypeptide GalNAc-transferase gene, GALNT 2, as a candidate gene for low HDL and high triglyceride blood levels. We hypothesized that the GalNAc-T 2 transferase performed critical O-glycosylation of proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Screening of a panel of proteins known to affect lipid metabolism for potential sites glycosylated by GalNAc-T 2 led to identification of Thr 226 adjacent to the proprotein convertase processing site in ANGPTL 3. We demonstrated that GalNAc-T 2 glycosylation of Thr 226 in a peptide with the RAPR 224 ↓TT processing site blocks in vitro furin cleavage. The study demonstrates that ANGPTL 3 activation is modulated by O-glycosylation and that this step is probably controlled by GalNAc-T 2...|$|R
25|$|In {{the blood}} stream, nascent {{chylomicron}} particles interact with HDL particles resulting in HDL donation of apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent chylomicron. The chylomicron {{at this stage}} is then considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipase</b> (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (glycerol covalently joined to three fatty acids) that ultimately releases glycerol and fatty acids from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage.|$|E
25|$|Again, like chylomicrons, VLDL {{particles}} circulate and encounter <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipase</b> (LPL) expressed on endothelial cells. Apolipoprotein C-II activates LPL, causing hydrolysis of the VLDL particle and {{the release}} of glycerol and fatty acids. These products can be absorbed from the blood by peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle. The hydrolyzed VLDL particles are now called VLDL remnants or intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs). VLDL remnants can circulate and, via an interaction between apolipoprotein E and the remnant receptor, be absorbed by the liver, or they can be further hydrolyzed by hepatic lipase.|$|E
25|$|The chylomicrons {{circulate}} {{throughout the}} body, giving the blood plasma a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal. <b>Lipoprotein</b> <b>lipase</b> on the endothelial {{surfaces of the}} capillaries, especially in adipose tissue, but {{to a lesser extent}} also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into free fatty acids, glycerol and chylomicron remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes, but the glycerol and chylomicron remnants remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The free fatty acids released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using glycerol derived from glucose in the glycolytic pathway. These triglycerides are stored, until needed for the fuel requirements of other tissues, in the fat droplet of the adipocyte.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases</b> (LPL) {{isolated}} from rat cardiac muscle and bovine milk were each used as immunogens to produce polyclonal anti-LPL sera and two anti-LPL monoclonal antibodies. The immunological reactivities of these antibody sources with LPL purified from rat cardiac muscle, lung, adipose tissue, mammary gland and skeletal muscle were compared by an e. l. i. s. a. and by Western blotting. Differences between the immunoreactivities of LPL from the distinct tissue sources were revealed in both systems. A synthetic peptide with a sequence {{corresponding to the}} heparin-binding site of LPL (Ser-Arg-Thr-Asn-Thr-Lys-Val-Ser-Arg-Ile-Thr-Gly-Leu) was produced and used as an immunogen.

In use against the five tissue LPL preparations, this antiserum revealed only minor variations between the tissue sources, compared with the hierarchy of reactivity observed when antibodies raised against the whole molecule were used. In combination with the outcome of previous studies on some of the physical properties of these preparations [Soteriou and Cryer (1993) Int. J.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} useful model system in which to study the genetic basis of regulation of fat storage. One {{of the most frequently}} used methods for evaluating the levels of stored fat (triglycerides) in flies is a coupled colorimetric assay available as a kit from several manufacturers. This is an aqueous-based enzymatic assay that is normally used for measurement of mammalian serum triglycerides, which are present in soluble lipoprotein complexes. In this short communication, we show that coupled colorimetric assay kits cannot accurately measure stored triglycerides in Drosophila. First, they fail to give accurate readings when tested on insoluble triglyceride mixtures with compositions like that of stored fat, or on fat extracted from flies with organic solvents. This is probably due to an inability of the lipase used in the kits to efficiently cleave off the glycerol head group from fat molecules in insoluble samples. Second, the measured final products of the kits are quinoneimines, which absorb visible light in the same wavelength range as Drosophila eye pigments. Thus, when extracts from crushed flies are assayed, much of the measured signal is actually due to eye pigments. Finally, the <b>lipoprotein</b> <b>lipases</b> used in colorimetric assays also cleave non-fat glycerides. The glycerol backbones liberated from all classes of glycerides are measured through the remaining reactions in the assay. As a consequence, when these assay kits are used to evaluate tissue extracts, the observed signal actually represents the amount of free glycerols together with all types of glycerides. For these reasons, findings obtained through use of coupled colorimetric assays on Drosophil...|$|R

Pre-incubation with triglyceride lipase and cholesterol esterase caused a decrease of final light scattering in I but only minimal changes in the reaction with II. Non-ionic detergent not only decreased the original light scattering in hyperlipemic serum samples, but also accelerated the immunoreaction. Under standardized conditions, results of quantitative nephelometry correlated highly significantly with quantitative determination of apolipoprotein B by radial immunodiffusion, both for normolipemic and hyperlipo-proteinemic serum samples. The nonspecific light scat-tering caused by neutral lipids in intact lipoproteins could be minimized when samples were pre-incubated with Ii-polytic enzymes.

Herein, because furin and PC 5 / 6 complete KOs are lethal, we used mice lacking furin or PC 5 / 6 specifically in hepatocytes (hKO) or mice completely lacking PACE 4. In primary hepatocytes, ANGPTL 3 was processed into ANGPTL 3 intracellularly by furin only, and extracellularly mainly by PACE 4. In vivo, the absence of furin in hepatocytes reduced by ~ 50 % the circulating levels of cleaved ANGPTL 3, while the lack of PACE 4 had only a minor effect. Analysis of the EL processing in primary hepatocytes and in vivo revealed that it is essentially cleaved by furin. However, the lack of furin or PC 5 / 6 in hepatocytes and complete PACE 4 KO did not appreciably modify plasma HDL levels or EL activity.

PPAR-α activation was measured in bovine aortic endothelial cells following treatment with human plasma, VLDL lipolysis products, or oleic acid.

40|$|Introduction There is {{evidence}} that physical activity decreases the degree of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries in persons who are physically active by modifying the chemistry and metabolism of lipoproteins. The effect of physical activity on the lipid status is achieved by affecting the enzymes of lipoprotein metabolism including the <b>lipoprotein</b> and liver <b>lipase</b> and transport protein of cholesterol esters. Epidemiological investigations {{on the effect of}} physical activity in prevention of cardiovascular diseases point {{to the fact that the}} persons who have a higher degree of cardio-respiratory endurance have a much lower mortality rate than those with a lower degree. The positive effect of physical activity on the cardiovascular system is reflected on the improved aerobic capacity, metabolic function, amplification of lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, immunological functions; it increases the perfusion of myocardium and the fibrinolytic activity, and reduces the adherence of thrombocytes due to increased synthesis of prostaglandin (PGI 2), it also enhances the energy consumption, which is important in the maintenance of ideal bodyweight, prevention and treatment of obesity, and it has a positive effect on the control of stress. Conclusion With respect to the effects on the lipid status, aerobic physical exercises like running, swimming, cycling, with the intensity of training of a medium (65 % VO 2) load, have a positive effect on lipid status. The best form of physical activity is the one in which the endurance and power are increased...|$|R
