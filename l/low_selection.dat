50|$|Pathogens {{respond to}} the use of {{fungicides}} by evolving resistance. In the field several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. The evolution of fungicide resistance can be gradual or sudden. In qualitative or discrete resistance, a mutation (normally to a single gene) produces a race of a fungus {{with a high degree of}} resistance. Such resistant varieties also tend to show stability, persisting after the fungicide has been removed from the market. For example, sugar beet leaf blotch remains resistant to azoles years after they were no longer used for control of the disease. This is because such mutations often have a high selection pressure when the fungicide is used, but there is <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure to remove them in the absence of the fungicide.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of functional RNA molecules is important for our molecular understanding of biology. Here we tested experimentally how two evolutionary parameters, selection pressure and recombination, influenced {{the evolution}} of an evolvingRNApopulation. This was done using four parallel evolution experiments that employed low or gradually increasing selection pressure, and recombination events either at the end or dispersed throughout the evolution. As model system, a trans-splicing group I intron ribozyme was evolved in Escherichia coli cells over 12 rounds of selection and amplification, including mutagenesis and recombination. The <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure resulted in higher efficiency of the evolved ribozyme populations, whereas differences in recombination {{did not have a}} strong effect. Five mutations were responsible for the highest efficiency. The first mutation swept quickly through all four evolving populations, whereas the remaining four mutations accumulated later and more efficiently under <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure. To determine why <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure aided this evolution, all evolutionary intermediates between the wild type and the 5 -mutation variant were constructed, and their activities at three different selection pressures were determined. The resulting fitness profiles showed a high cooperativity among the four late mutations, which can explain why high selection pressure led to inefficient evolution.

40|$|We use {{mathematical}} {{models to}} explore the evolutionary implications of health interventions affecting age-dependent mortality schedules in two contexts, antihelminthics targeting parasitic nematodes, and programs directed against malaria vectors. We show that interventions targeting parasitic nematodes can exert selection pressure to either shorten. or extend the time to maturity, depending {{on the details of}} worm mortality functions with and without the intervention. Interventions may therefore generate selection favouring later-maturing, larger and more fecund worms, rather than inevitably favouring the evolution of smaller, less fecund and hence potentially clinically less damaging worms as previously assumed. The evolution of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes threatens conventional public health programs targeting malaria vectors. By exploiting the high mortality rates of wild mosquitoes and the delay between malaria infection and infectiousness in mosquito hosts, late-life-acting (LLA) insecticides which kill only older mosquitoes can in principle provide effective transmission control in combination with very <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> for resistance. We develop a novel mathematical model to evaluate the potential of such pesticides and find that theoretical LLAs which affect only mosquitoes above a specific age can offer transmission control comparable with conventional insecticides, combined with very <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> for resistance.

40|$|Selection between {{competing}} {{responses and}} stimulus-response association strength {{is thought to}} affect performance during verb generation. However, the specific contribution of these two processes remains unclear. Here we used fMRI to investigate the role of selection and association within frontal and BG circuits that {{are known to be}} involved in verb production. Subjects were asked to generate verbs from nouns in conditions requiring either high or <b>low</b> <b>selection,</b> but with constant association strength, and in conditions of weak or strong association strength, now with constant selection demands. Furthermore, we examined the role of selection and association during noun generation from noun stimuli. We found that the midpart of the left inferior frontal gyrus was more active in conditions requiring high compared with <b>low</b> <b>selection,</b> with matched association strength. The same left inferior frontal region activated irrespective of verb or noun generation. Results of ROI analyses showed effects of association strength only for verb generation and specifically in the anterior/ventral part of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Moreover, the BG were more active when weakly associated verbs had to be produced relative to weakly associated nouns. These results highlight a functional segregation within the left inferior frontal gyrus for verb generation. More generally, the findings suggest that both factors of selection between competing responses and association strength are important during single-word production with the latter factor becoming particularly critical when task-irrelevant stimuli interfere with the current task (here nouns during verb production), triggering additional activation of the BG...|$|E

40|$|Group I introns are {{catalytic}} RNAs (ribozymes) {{capable of}} catalyzing their self-excision from precursor RNAs through two consecutive transesterification reactions. Although the ribozyme has evolved to perform this cis-splicing reaction in nature, man-made {{modifications to the}} 5 ' end of the ribozyme have allowed it to catalyze a trans- splicing reaction, {{in which it is}} able to replace the 3 ' portion of a substrate RNA with it's own 3 ' tail. The trans-splicing group I introns used in this thesis were variants of the Tth. L 1925 IC 1 group I intron ribozyme found in Tetrahymena thermophila. The work contained in this dissertation aims to both utilize trans-splicing group I introns to further understand principles of RNA evolution, as well as develop and optimize a new trans- splicing variant of the ribozyme for future use in therapy. In the first study of this dissertation, a trans- splicing group I intron was used as a model system to examine the effect of selection pressure and recombination on evolving populations of RNA in a cellular environment. Four parallel evolutions were completed, two employing a <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure, and two employing a high selection pressure. Ribozyme populations with higher efficiency, measured by cellular growth conferred by the ribozyme, resulted from evolutions performed at a <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure. It was found that this increase in fitness {{was the result of a}} set of four mutations acting cooperatively. Fitness profiles of evolutionary intermediates revealed that a <b>low</b> <b>selection</b> pressure can increase the accessibility of evolutionary paths leading to the evolution of cooperative mutations. This finding not only adds to the understanding of natural RNA evolution, but also aids in the design of more efficient evolutions of RNA species. In the second study of this dissertation, a new trans-splicing variant of the group I intron was developed, capable of catalyzing the removal of internal sequences from pre-mRNA and joining the two flanking sequences, thereby generating a functional RNA. This group I intron has been termed the ̀spliceozyme' because its action is analogous to that of the spliceosome. The action performed by the spliceozyme give this system the ability to repair certain types of diseases caused by mis-splicing and therefore, the potential to be used therapeutically. To increase the efficiency and therapeutic potential of this system, the spliceozyme was evolved in E. coli cells, challenging it to more efficiently catalyze the removal of internal sequences. The most efficient variant contained a set of mutations resulting in increased product formation and decreased side product formation. This observed effect was seen in vitro, suggesting that this effect may increase spliceozyme efficiency in a range cell types. Future work will move this system into mammalian cells and optimize the spliceozyme for use in a mammalian system, thus developing it as a therapeutic too...|$|E

The absence of a response to selection for low recombination is attributed mainly to genetic random drift, and partially to directional dominance and directional gene frequencies. Natural selection was found to act against increases of recombination above a level of about twenty percent in the measured interval. High recombination tended to be recessive to low recombination.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2 (a), the <b>lowest</b> ETX parent <b>selection</b> without hop count {{consideration}} results in longer hop levels. The longest hop level is 7. Since each node uses the <b>lowest</b> ETX parent <b>selection,</b> {{the distance between}} the parent and the children nodes tends to be close and the number of hop levels increases. All possible direct links between adjacent hop level nodes by the random parent selection scheme with MHR are presented in Figure 2 (b). Each node randomly selects one among nodes that are connected with a direct link as its parent node. As the distance from the sink increases, the first-hop nodes have more direct links to the second-hop level nodes. With the link threshold 0.9, the MHR scheme significantly reduces the hop count as compared with the lowest ETX scheme in Figure 2 (a). Figure 2 (c) shows the connectivity graph of the <b>lowest</b> ETX parent <b>selection</b> with MHR. Since each node selects the lowest ETX neighboring nodes in the upper hop level, the selected parent nodes tend to be located {{at the edge of the}} hop level, closer to the second-hop level nodes.
