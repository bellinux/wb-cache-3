5000|$|The {{design of}} the USS Discovery {{is based on an}} unused Ralph McQuarrie design for the USS Enterprise from the unproduced film Star Trek: Planet of the Titans, which Fuller had noted in July 2016 was [...] "to a point that we can't legally comment on it until legal team figures out some things". McQuarrie's designs were based on the {{concepts}} created by Ken Adam to feature a vessel with a flattened secondary hull. Fuller wanted [...] "something distinct about what our Star Trek was going to look" [...] like, and after seeing McQuarrie's design [...] "saw sort of harder <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> and started talking about race cars and Lamborghinis in the '70s and James Bond cars and started working on the designs, taking those inspirations and coming up with something completely unique to us." [...] The design for the Discovery went through several revisions and refinements before the final version was approved in December 2016. The USS Shenzhou was designed to look older than the Discovery, and is a Walker-class starship, a ne designation created for the series that is named for test pilot Joe Walker. Separate sets for both ships' interiors were built for the series. Other Federation starships created for the show include the USS Europa.|$|E
50|$|The harp {{is driven}} by the von Kármán vortex street effect. The motion of the wind across a string causes {{periodic}} vortices downstream, and this alternating vortex causes the string to vibrate. Lord Rayleigh first solved the mystery of the aeolian harp in a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine in 1915. The effect can sometimes be observed in overhead utility lines, fast enough to be heard or slow enough to be seen. A stiff rod will perform; a non-telescoping automobile radio antenna can be a dramatic exhibitor. And of course the effect can happen in other media; in the anchor <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> in <b>a</b> river, for example.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the procedure developed at MARINTEK for the automatic optimisation <b>of</b> hull <b>lines</b> {{to reduce the}} ship resistance {{as well as the}} wake wash generated by <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> within the given constraints. The methodology, developed computer programs and used constraints are described. The methodology is exercised using <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fast <b>ship.</b> <b>A</b> numerical comparison is performed between the resistance and wash performance of the original hull and that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimised hull.

40|$|Stiffened panels at {{the water}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> {{experience}} in-plane loads due to ship bending and torsion, as well as out-of-plane loads due to wave impacts. Wave impacts weaken the panel with respect to in-plane loads, but are hard to predict because of complex physics. The in-plane strength of the panel supports the surrounding ship structure. Hence, {{it is important to}} know in what detail the wave impacts should be determined, while making minimum error in the in-plane ultimate strength. The importance of load details is evaluated as follows. First, the complex loading is applied to the structure and the ultimate strenght of the structure is evaluated. Then, details of the load are omitted, in this case by changing the resolution of the load. Finally the effect of omission of details becomes clear, by comparing the ultimate strength of different wave impact load resolutions. Non-linear finite element calculations are performed to assess the unloaded ultimate strength, as well as the ultimate strength for different load resolutions. The load is a breaking wave on a rigid wall. Applied resolutions range from 0. 1 m to uniform pressure over the stiffened panel. It is found that the ultimate strength under static loading either over- or underpredicts the ultimate strength of the panel independent of resolution. Further, the ultimate strength under a dynamic uniform loading is also not representative. Different resolutions are, again, of minor influence. Tests with a different panel confirm the findings. It is therefore concluded that, for the load and structure under investigation: there is little effect of load resolution, as long as it grossly resembles the pressure map. Dynamic calculations should be performed at all times. Ship and Offshore StructuresMaritime and Transport TechnologyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

On that day, while the ship was in the port <b>of</b> Cadiz, <b>a</b> fire started in {{the bow of the}} frigate that spread quickly {{throughout}} the rest of the ship. The crew tried desperately to fight the fire and when they could not contain it attempted to abandon ship on sloops. Karpfanger himself refused to abandon the ship while efforts continued to save it and commanded the crew to return to further fight the fire. Around midnight, the fire reached the ship's gunpowder magazine, causing the ship to explode. Admiral Karfanger was among the dead, alongside 22 soldiers and 42 crewmen. His body was found floating on the mooring <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English <b>ship</b> in the harbor the following morning. The cause of the fire was never discovered.|$|R

After providing logistic support for U.S. forces in the Arctic, in 1962, Point Barrow transported huge fixed array radar antennas for the USS Enterprise and USS Long Beach to the East Coast. After extensive modification in June, 1965 Point Barrow carried Saturn rockets from California to Cape Kennedy for NASA’s manned space flight program. T-AKD-1 also ferried LCMs to Southeast Asia in 1968 and 1969.

60|$|I call to mind {{a winter}} {{landscape}} in Amsterdam--a flat foreground of waste land, with here and there stacks of timber, like the huts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> camp <b>of</b> some very miserable tribe; the long stretch of the Handelskade; cold, stone-faced quays, with the snow-sprinkled ground and the hard, frozen water of the canal, in which were set ships one behind another with their frosty mooring-ropes hanging slack and their decks idle and deserted, because, as the master stevedore (a gentle, pale person, with a few golden hairs on his chin and a reddened nose) informed me, their cargoes were frozen-in up-country on barges and schuyts.

5000|$|Naval live fire {{exercises}} may use anti-ship {{missiles and}} torpedoes, although tests involving air-to-air and air-to-surface missile, guns and bombs are not uncommon. Navies conduct live fire exercises to test elements <b>of</b> <b>an</b> integrated defense system, {{such as the}} US Aegis; namely, its ability to track and destroy enemy anti-ship missiles. Tests can also include an integrated defense system's compatibility to fire new missiles or newer {{versions of the same}} missile. Live fire tests are also conducted with a CIWS system, which is designed as the last <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense for <b>a</b> <b>ship.</b> Surface ships also frequently test-fire the various guns kept and maintained aboard the vessel; these can range from sidearms and rifles up to the 16" [...] guns of the mothballed US s. This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon. In the case of aircraft carriers, the pilots assigned to the carrier may conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface missile exercises {{similar to those of the}} air force; additionally, these pilots may also conduct live fire exercises against derelict ships. Recent aircraft carriers have incorporated missile-launching systems, and have taken part in live fire exercises involving missiles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vessels {{are rarely}} {{subjected}} to accidental loads {{such as the}} collision, grounding and stranding. But these accidental loads cause <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> damages to hull structure including a large deformation, fracture, tearing and so on. In case of carrying dangerous goods such as crude oil, these accidents can induce a serious environmental pollution. All ocean-going vessels were made by welding. The welding residual stress is <b>a</b> significant shortcoming <b>of</b> welding remains at the hull structure, even though welding technology in shipbuilding field has provided <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> advantages, e. g. remarkable shortening of the shipbuilding time. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of the residual stress in a grounding accident. When <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> runs aground against a sea-obstacle like a rock, this accident can be classified as a grounding. Among parameters of grounding accident scenarios such as the ship speed, the initial striking point, and loading conditions of the ship, only ship speed varies from 10 to 15 knots under ballast condition with/without consideration of residual stress(this sentence is not clear to the read). The initial striking point is at the bow <b>of</b> the center <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>A</b> series <b>of</b> nonlinear numerical simulations with large deformation and fracture were carried out using LS-DYNA. As a result, two cases with residual stress have longer damage length. The difference seems to be relatively small, but not negligible...|$|R
50|$|Boscawen was {{promoted}} rear-admiral {{of the blue}} on 15 July 1747 and was appointed to command a joint operation {{being sent to the}} East Indies. With his flag in the Namur, and with five other <b>line</b> <b>of</b> battle <b>ships,</b> <b>a</b> few smaller men <b>of</b> war, and <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> transports Boscawen sailed from England on 4 November 1747. On the outward voyage Boscawen made an abortive attempt to capture Mauritius by surprise but was driven off by French forces. Boscawen continued on arriving at Fort St. David near the town of Cuddalore on 29 July 1748 and took over command from Admiral Griffin. Boscawen had been ordered to capture and destroy the main French settlement in India at Pondichéry. Factors such as Boscawen’s lack of knowledge and experience of land offensives, the failings of the engineers and artillery officers under his command, <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> secrecy surrounding the operation and the skill of the French governor Joseph François Dupleix combined to thwart the attack. The British forces amounting to some 5,000 men captured and destroyed the outlying fort of Aranciopang. This capture was the only success of the operation and after failing to breach the walls of the city the British forces withdrew. Amongst the combatants were a young ensign Robert Clive, later known as Clive of India and Major Stringer Lawrence, later Commander-in-Chief, India. Lawrence was captured by the French during the retreat and exchanged after the news of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had reached India. Over the monsoon season Boscawen remained at Fort St David. Fortunately, for the Admiral and his staff, when a storm hit the British outpost Boscawen was ashore but his flagship the Namur went down with over 600 men aboard.|$|R
