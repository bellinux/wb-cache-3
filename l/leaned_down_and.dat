25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{caught his}} hand; her touch was fiery hot.|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} shiver. Groves <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> tried to peer through the keyhole. He {{rose to his}} feet hastily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{you have}} let it down,' said Knight, already {{resuming}} his position of ruling power, 'go {{back from the}} edge of the slope, and over the bank as far as the rope will allow you. Then <b>lean</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> hold the end with both hands.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A salad, some sandwiches, {{a bottle}} of hock and plenty of strawberries. We shan't starve, at any rate," [...] Maraton declared. [...] "Lean back in your chairs, you {{children}} of the city, <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> look at your mother. Look at her smoke-hung arms, stretched out as though to gather in the universe; and the lights upon her bosom--see how they come twinkling into existence." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his memoir, President Reagan {{recounted the}} return to the U.S. of the St. George’s {{students}} as an event that affected him deeply. [...] "I was among many in our country whose eyes got a little misty when I watched their arrival in the United States on television and saw some of them <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kiss American soil the moment that they stepped off the airplanes that brought them home." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{picked up}} a sea-fishing rod. Jacob was terrified as he saw her swaying {{backwards}} and forwards.|$|E
6000|$|Nehushta {{stayed to}} help Anna to her feet. When she judged her {{mistress}} {{to be out}} of hearing she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the Captain, who nodded back. In a few moments the Doctor reappeared. He <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> whispered to the Captain.|$|E
6000|$|A {{touch of}} the spur made Sol lunge forward to head off the raider. Diablo was in his stride, but the {{distance}} and angle favored Sol. The raider had no carbine. He held aloft a gun ready to level it and fire. He sat the saddle {{as if it were}} a stationary seat. Gale saw Ladd <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> drop the [...] .405 in the sand. He would take no chances of wounding Belding's best-loved horse.|$|R
50|$|Agon {{begins to}} slowly {{make its way}} through a steel {{manufacturing}} plant, but before it reaches the furnaces, the helicopter manages to arrive and begins to circle it. The monster quickly turns toward the uranium being suspended overhead and begins to follow the helicopter as it is led away from the plant and back towards the ocean. Agon <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> drops the boat from its mouth as it begins to pursue after its food, freeing Monta from its grasp. Goro and the others quickly rush to him and find him unconscious, but otherwise uninjured.|$|R
60|$|Capper {{had taken}} Greensheve's {{position}} on the cope, <b>and</b> now he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> his hand, <b>and,</b> first one and then the other, pulled them up.|$|R
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> Hal {{held up his}} hand. The new-comer {{grasped the}} youth's wrist, {{and in a moment}} Hal was upon the cellar floor.|$|E
60|$|Mamma <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> whispered {{one word}} to the older girls; and {{suddenly}} they all took hands to dance round Effie, singing as they skipped.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the foot}} of the path the copper man <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> tossed aside with ease the rocks that {{encumbered}} the way. Then he turned to Dorothy and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You very, very foolish Englishwoman," [...] she said. [...] "A hand <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> from Heaven, <b>and</b> {{you liked}} better {{to stay where}} you were, but I am glad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A blunder, believe me, Immelan," [...] he {{continued}} thoughtfully. [...] "Death will not lower over my path till my task is accomplished. I am young--many {{years younger than}} you, Immelan--and the greatest physicians marvel at my strength. Against the assassin's knife or bullet I am secure. You have been brought up and lived, my terrified friend, {{in a country where}} religion remains a shell and a husk, without comfort to any man. It is not so with me, I live in the spirit as in the body, and my days will last until the sun <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> lights me to the world where those dwell who have fulfilled their destiny." ...|$|R
6000|$|A plain {{man like}} Godfrey Cass, {{speaking}} under some embarrassment, necessarily blunders on {{words that are}} coarser than his intentions, and {{that are likely to}} fall gratingly on susceptible feelings. While he had been speaking, Eppie had quietly passed her arm behind Silas's head, and let her hand rest against it caressingly: she felt him trembling violently. He was silent for some moments when Mr. Cass had ended--powerless under the conflict of emotions, all alike painful. Eppie's heart was swelling at the sense that her father was in distress; and she was just going to <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> speak to him, when one struggling dread at last gained the mastery over every other in Silas, and he said, faintly-- ...|$|R
60|$|Thorne {{smiled at}} them and then, calling to Kristine, who was {{standing}} near the door, he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> handed her a bottle which he took from an open case.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> unlaced her shoes, {{but found}} {{she could not}} pull her feet out of them. The Glass Cat, which was walking around as {{naturally}} as ever, now said: ...|$|E
60|$|Gys <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> put {{his ear to}} {{the heart}} of the patient. For two minutes he {{remained}} motionless. Then he straightened up and a smile spread over his disfigured features.|$|E
50|$|The next day, the gracious Sir Basil {{takes the}} narrator {{on a tour}} around the vast estate. Stopping to rest, the two men sit on a bench that overlooks the garden and begin chatting, at which time the narrator notices a woman {{wandering}} in the garden. She is soon joined {{by a man who}} is carrying in his hand a small camera. The two figures approach a piece of sculpture (a wooden piece by Henry Moore) and appear to be laughing at it. The man begins to take pictures while the woman strikes ludicrous poses beside the piece, at one point sticking her head through one of its holes. The man takes more pictures and, from the narrator's perspective, <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kisses the woman, her laughter filling the air.|$|R
50|$|Spike leads Buffy {{into a dark}} {{basement}} and tries to show her what he remembers about killing the girls. The fake Spike is there as well, but Buffy can't see him. While the real Spike tries to show Buffy where he buried the bodies, the fake Spike starts to sing the hypnotizing tune. This causes Spike to vamp out and attack Buffy, cutting her arm {{with a piece of}} broken glass. As the two battle the bodies of those Spike recently killed rise from the ground beneath them as newly turned vampires. Buffy struggles with the fledglings while the real Spike gets a pep talk from his morphing version about tasting Buffy's blood. As two vampires hold Buffy still, Spike <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> tastes Buffy's blood from the cut on her arm. It reawakens all of his memories of killing and he falls to the ground, horrified.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{opens with}} Ladyhawke {{in a bed}} with a man. She looks {{out of the window}} at a ghost, next she runs downstairs, where she starts to get haunted by monsters. She then gets circled by monsters, each wearing a mask with a {{corresponding}} T-shirt. She tries to awake her boyfriend, but as it fails, she tries to call someone but is tracked down by the monsters and runs away. She then starts to dance with the monsters. She then wakes up and pulls the cover off her boyfriend and realizes in fear that he is dead. She goes into the bathroom, washes her hands <b>and</b> then <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> when she arises she has a mask which resembles her face and a T-shirt which says [...] "Ladyhawke", she then starts dancing again. The video finishes when she wakes up in the daytime.|$|R
60|$|Then Toby lay {{right down}} on the ground and cried so hard that the monkey acted as if it were frightened, and tried to turn the boy's face over, and finally <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> licked Toby's ear.|$|E
6000|$|Margaret <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{touched him}} gently. [...] "You keep your rules, and your rules are good. Perhaps it's strange, but I think a woman will break {{conventions}} {{where a man}} will not. Still, you see, I'm proud----" ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>leaned</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> her calm {{face was}} like a statue's. [...] "Now," [...] said Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, [...] "you are to take care that I have some tea, and you are {{to take me to}} Richmond." ...|$|E
5000|$|The cutscene then flashes {{forward to}} many years later, {{the town has}} grown into a city, and mutant {{vegetable}} monsters are seen chasing after and kidnapping the residents of the city. One of them stops while passing by a television store window, which is playing the evening news, and watches curiously as Dr. Knarf is mentioned, revealing him to be alive and the mutant vegetables his doing. The news then goes on to mention [...] "mysterious sightings of the legendary Jersey Devil", as a figure suddenly appears behind the mutant and pulls of the mask he is wearing, revealing him to be Dennis, who also survived the explosion. The figure, revealed to be Jersey Devil, <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> says [...] "Boo!" [...] scaring Dennis away, when he picked up by Knarf as he drives past in his car. The scene then pans back towards Jersey Devil, finding instead only empty streets, before revealing Jersey Devil up on the rooftops, looking down over the city as the title screen appears.|$|R
50|$|Dying {{of colon}} cancer in a {{hospital}} bed, William Andrews' wife <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> to him <b>and</b> sees {{a smile on his}} face, which she wrongly perceives as being for her. In fact, he is merely ecstatic at the sensation of leaving his body, and therefore all of his pain, behind. At the centre of his vision he sees a pinprick of white light which steadily expands.|$|R
60|$|Sakr-el-Bahr laughed, and he mocked now in earnest. He set {{his left}} foot upon the rowers' stretcher, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> forward <b>and</b> <b>down</b> his elbow upon his raised knee so that his face was close to Lionel's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo! {{some kind}} friend has {{brought me a}} new door-mat as a present," [...] and he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> stroked the soft hair with much pleasure. Then he wiped {{his feet on the}} new mat and went into the palace to tell the Queen.|$|E
60|$|Another, {{a cowboy}} who evidently {{had just left}} the gaming-table, <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pulled open Bain's shirt. He had the ace of spades in his hand. He laid it on Bain's breast, and the black figure on the card covered the two bullet-holes just over Bain's heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what a {{wonderful}} piece of luck!" [...] he cried; [...] "here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name"; and he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> plucked it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but it comes--it must come!" [...] Selingman interrupted. [...] "You {{have the}} instinct--I am sure of that. Use your power a little. It {{will be for}} his good. Every man who neglects his passions, weakens. You have the gifts, Julia. I tell you that--I, Selingman, who know much about woman and more about love and life. You've felt it, too, {{yourself}} sometimes in the quiet hours. Haven't you lain in your bed with your eyes wide open, and seen the ceiling roll away <b>and</b> the skies <b>lean</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> felt the thoughts come stealing into your brain, till {{all of a sudden}} you found that your pulses were beating fast, and your heart was trembling, and there was a sort of faint music in your blood and in your ears? Ah, well, one knows! Suffer yourself to think of these hours when he is with you sometimes. Don't make an ice maiden of yourself. You've done good work. I know all about you. You could do more splendid work still if you could weave that little spell which you and I know of." ...|$|R
50|$|Co-produced by Cooper and his bassist at the time, Erik Scott, Zipper Catches Skin is musically {{known for}} its dry and {{energetic}} hard rock style, with pop punk and post-punk influences and less emphasis on hard riffs, carrying on a similar musical direction of the preceding Special Forces with sonically slicker and clearer results. Lyrically, Cooper employed a much stronger focus on comical sarcasm and on avoiding using clichéd subject matter. Erik Scott has stated the album “was meant to be <b>lean,</b> stripped <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> low on frills. Punkish and bratty.” However, although it saw the return of guitarist Dick Wagner to Cooper’s band, Zipper is generally {{not considered to be}} up to the same standard as his previous works.|$|R
60|$|Backed {{against the}} door of the hall stood Ben Chase, for once {{stripped}} of all authority and confidence and courage. Gale confronted him, and now Gale's mien was in striking contrast to the coolness with which he had entered the place. Though sweat dripped from his face, it was as white as chalk. Like dark flames his eyes seemed to leap and dance and burn. His <b>lean</b> jaw hung <b>down</b> <b>and</b> quivered with passion. He shook a huge gloved fist in Chase's face.|$|R
