5000|$|The {{operation}} of a <b>linear</b> <b>planimeter</b> can be justified by applying Green's theorem onto {{the components of the}} vector field N, given by: ...|$|E
5000|$|The images {{show the}} {{principles}} of a linear and a polar planimeter. The pointer M {{at one end of}} the planimeter follows the contour C of the surface S to be measured. For the <b>linear</b> <b>planimeter</b> the movement of the [...] "elbow" [...] E is restricted to the y-axis. For the polar planimeter the [...] "elbow" [...] is connected to an arm with its other endpoint O at a fixed position. Connected to the arm ME is the measuring wheel with its axis of rotation parallel to ME. A movement of the arm ME can be decomposed into a movement perpendicular to ME, causing the wheel to rotate, and a movement parallel to ME, causing the wheel to skid, with no contribution to its reading.|$|E
50|$|The {{working of}} the <b>linear</b> <b>planimeter</b> may be {{explained}} by measuring the area of a rectangle ABCD (see image). Moving with the pointer from A to B the arm EM moves through the yellow parallelogram, with area equal to PQ&times;EM. This area is also equal to the area of the parallelogram A"ABB". The measuring wheel measures the distance PQ (perpendicular to EM). Moving from C to D the arm EM moves through the green parallelogram, with area equal to the area of the rectangle D"DCC". The measuring wheel now moves in the opposite direction, subtracting this reading from the former. The movements along BC and DA are the same but opposite, so they cancel each other with no net effect on the reading of the wheel. The net result is the measuring of the difference of the yellow and green areas, which is the area of ABCD.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} moment planimeters, {{which are}} mechanical devices with {{which is it}} possible to locate the centre of mass of an irregular plane shape by mechanical and graphical methods. They are a type of analogue computing device. In addition to this they may be used to find the static moment (first moment) and moment of inertia (second moment) of a shape about a fixed line. Moment planimeters, sometimes called integrometers or integrators, are direct developments of the planimeter which is a mechanical device used to directly measure the area of a plane shape. While planimeters are reasonably well known, linear planimeters are less common than the polar planimeters of Amsler. Hence in this article we explain how planimeters work through the example of a <b>linear</b> <b>planimeter,</b> and then consider how these may be adapted to find the centre of mass. More detailed comparisons between other types of area measuring planimeters may be found in the comprehensive survey article of [2]. 1 Area and centre of mass Consider the region enclosed by the closed curve in Figure 1, through which we have drawn the x-axis. We consider the area to be split into two regions by this axis, and these regions are described by the the two functions, f 1 (x) and f 2 (x). Since a general plane shape cannot be described in thi...|$|E
