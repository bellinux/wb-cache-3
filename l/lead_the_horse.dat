5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E

25|$|When on the {{incorrect}} <b>lead,</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{is usually}} left unbalanced. In this case, correct riding {{can make the}} difference in the horse's performance. Good riding can keep the legs positioned correctly enough so that the horse is still able to perform the turn. Poor riding will hinder rather than help the horse, and in extreme situations such as a tight turn at speed, the horse may lose its legs footing and fall.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yea, my kind lord,' {{said the}} glad youth, and went, [...] Held his head high, and thought himself a knight, [...] And up the rocky pathway disappeared, [...] <b>Leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> {{and they were}} left alone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Argemone's {{safe enough}} with Smith; <b>the</b> {{servants}} will <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> behind them. It's only three miles home, and I {{should like to}} see any one speak to her twice while Smith's fists are in the way.' ...|$|R
25|$|Aids: To {{ask for a}} {{specific}} lead while in the air, the rider should look in the intended direction of travel, not down. The rider should <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{in the direction of}} the turn by applying the opening rein aid without pulling backward, while the other hand releases as usual. The outside leg is moved slightly back, and the rider adds slightly more weight to the inside knee. However, the rider should not shift weight so much that he or she becomes unbalanced or has the heels come up.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "lead" [...] of a canter {{refers to}} {{the order in which}} the footfalls occur. If the left hind leg is placed first (beat one), which would then be {{followed}} by the right hind and left foreleg (beat two), before the right foreleg (beat three), the horse is said to be on the [...] "right lead". If the right hind leg is beat one, then the left foreleg will be the last leg to ground, and the horse will be said to be on the [...] "left lead". Therefore, a person on the ground can tell which <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> is on by watching the front and rear legs and determining which side the legs are literally [...] "leading", landing in front of the opposing side.|$|E
2500|$|At Epsom on 25 May Merry Hampton {{started at}} odds of 100/9 (11/1) {{in a field}} of eleven. The race was run on a [...] "cloudy, cold and raw" [...] day in front of the {{customary}} vast crowd which included the Prince of Wales {{and other members of the}} Royal Family. The 2000 Guineas winner The Baron started 5/4 favourite, and was picked as the winner by eighteen of the nineteen newspaper [...] "prophets", while Martley, trained by William Stevens was also well fancied and started on 10/1. Ridden as he would be in all his races by Jack Watts, Merry Hampton was held up in the early stages as the running was made by Porcelain and the unnamed Shannon colt, before Blanchland and Eiridspord took over and led the field into the straight. Watts had moved Merry Hampton forward into third, just ahead of The Baron on the turn for home and made his challenge as the leaders began to tire. He took the lead two furlongs out, quickly went clear and was never in danger of defeat, winning by an official margin four lengths (some observers thought it was more like seven) from The Baron with Martley two lengths further back in third. Although the winning time of 2:43 equaled the race record, it was widely agreed that the 1887 Derby had been a sub-standard one. For reasons he chose not to explain, Baird, who reportedly won £40,000 in bets on the race, refused to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in. Shortly afterwards, it was reported that Merry Hampton had wrenched off a shoe and received a minor injury due to [...] "the prick of a nail", but he recovered quickly and resumed training.|$|E
6000|$|A swift {{suspicion}} flashed upon me, and I {{glanced at}} Adams; {{but his face}} was serene enough, and, when the question remained unanswered, another thought struck me. [...] "Did you see him <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> out?" [...] I asked.|$|R
50|$|A {{storm is}} coming so Joseph <b>leads</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> into <b>the</b> barn. When {{he goes to}} the well to get some water, he gets pulled in by one of the spirits. The others try to find him but fail to do so.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} after they had made four such {{mistakes}} that they heard George's voice in reply, and then he and Pete came out to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> in through <b>the</b> thicket of bushes that screened {{the entrance of the}} road.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} the easiest {{plan would be}} to make {{a gap in the}} sandbags in the breach, <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> till fairly outside, and then mount." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] said Kit and {{indicated}} the watercourse. [...] "You see, {{for a few}} yards there's nothing but the channel. You couldn't walk across the cinders and <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> The pitch is very steep." ...|$|E
60|$|Emett {{examined}} the leg and pronounced it badly strained, and advised Jim to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> back to camp. Jones and I stood a moment over {{the remains of}} the yellow pup, and presently Emett joined us.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is well done, Zaki. Let us {{mount and}} be off, at once. We will <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> It is {{too dark to}} gallop among these bushes, {{and the sound of}} the hoofs might be heard. We will go quietly, till we are well away." ...|$|R

60|$|Jane Clayton saw <b>the</b> raiders <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> from <b>the</b> corral, {{and drive}} the herds in from the fields.

6000|$|Chorus. [...] Up {{against the}} arches {{of the crystal}} ceiling, [...] From the horse's {{nostrils}} shall steam the blurting breath: [...] Up between the angels pale with silent feeling [...] Will the Tamer calmly <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> of Death.|$|E
60|$|They {{had made}} a cache of most of their {{provisions}} the previous night, after searching in vain for a route by which they could <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> over the range in front of them; but Weston shook his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Waste no more time," [...] {{cried the}} {{impatient}} earl. [...] "We {{must be very}} near the hill now. You will have to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> McKenzie, in this darkness; the dog may find {{the way through the}} broom for us." ...|$|E
60|$|Bidding Abdon and Michelot <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> {{and still}} {{speaking}} in my assumed voice, I desired Mademoiselle and the Chevalier--who {{had not yet}} sufficiently recovered from his bewilderment to have found his tongue--to follow me. I led {{the way up the}} gentle slope to the spot where our first victims were pinioned.|$|R
50|$|Blocked tails can be {{recognized}} by experienced <b>horse</b> judges, as <b>the</b> tail hangs lifelessly, rather than swaying slightly with the movement of <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> <b>The</b> animal may also be seen to defecate without raising its tail. In some cases, the discomfort of <b>the</b> injection <b>leads</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to move stiffly in the hindquarters. Some show-sanctioning organizations have strict penalties for participants who are found to have horses with nerve-blocked tails.|$|R
60|$|George rode away shortly afterward, and Grant waited {{some time}} before he secured the team, after rather {{determined}} opposition. Finding nobody willing to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> home, he hitched them {{to the back of}} his light wagon and set off at a leisurely pace. When he had gone a little distance, he overtook a man plodding along the trail. The fellow stopped when Grant came up.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've got Louise figured wrong, cowboy," [...] {{returned}} Pan. [...] "I'll {{prove it}} to you sometime.... Now let's get down to business, and plan Blake's release from jail. I want to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> round about, so I won't be seen by anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was very}} anxious to change the conversation, and {{suggested}} that I <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> into the shade, for the sun was blazing down upon us. The horse submitted to be led {{to the side of}} the road, but he was very nervous, and looked everywhere for the approach of shaggy bears.|$|E
60|$|Olivia {{gave him}} a quick glance; {{it looked as if}} he were willing to let her go. He was dull, but his {{dullness}} was intriguing. In fact, since Olivia knew her charm, it was something of a challenge. She said she would walk across the maize field and signed Kit to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{that carried}} <b>the</b> {{exhausted}} {{woman with the}} utmost care, and yet with wonderful rapidity, down the paths which they had so recently ascended, the men in a short space of time reached {{the place where the}} army had halted, and displayed to Goisvintha, in all the majesty of numbers and repose, the vast martial assemblage of the warriors of the North.|$|R
60|$|They shog on side by side--not home, {{but to the}} Doctor's house. For every hunting evening Mark's groom meets him at the Doctor's door to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> home, while he, {{before he}} will take his bath and dress, brings to his blind friend the gossip of the field, and details to him every joke, fence, find, kill, hap and mishap {{of the last six}} hours.|$|R
60|$|Harry now gave orders, to {{the native}} officer who was {{standing}} beside him, to order these men to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> through <b>the</b> opening. When he had been gone a minute or two, he sent all the men, except four, to {{follow the example of}} their comrades; while those left with him redoubled their fire, so that their assailants should not know that any of the defenders had been withdrawn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Briefly, then. I avoid pine-trees, high houses, lonely barns, upland pastures, running water, {{flocks of}} cattle and sheep, {{a crowd of}} men. If I travel on foot--as to-day--I do not walk fast; if in my buggy, I touch not its back or sides; if on horseback, I {{dismount}} and <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> But of all things, I avoid tall men." ...|$|E
60|$|Bob {{volunteered to}} <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{around the track}} several times, hoping he would become so {{accustomed}} to it as {{to be able to}} go by himself after a while; and Toby made his preparations by laying his hat on the ground with a stone on it, so that he should be sure to find it when his rehearsal was done.|$|E
60|$|Early {{in the day}} Dakon's {{horse had}} cast a shoe. The {{delicate}} hoof had split, and by noon the animal was limping. Dakon refused to ride it farther, and refused to desert it. So, on his solicitation, we went on. He would <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and join us at my place. That was the last we saw of him; nor did we ever learn his end.|$|E
25|$|In popular {{literature}} {{firefighters are}} sometimes depicted with Dalmatian dogs. This breed originated in southern Europe and was {{primarily responsible for}} herding livestock and running alongside carriages drawn by <b>horses.</b> In <b>the</b> days of horse-drawn fire vehicles, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were usually released on arrival at the fire and <b>the</b> Dalmatians would <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> through traffic and to {{a safe place to}} wait until the fire was out. Dalmatians also filled the role of protecting the horses' feet from other dogs as equipment was being transported to the fire scene.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the Colonel and Jonathan were {{standing}} in the shallow water waiting to grasp <b>the</b> reins and <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> up <b>the</b> steep bank. Attracted by the unusual sight of a wildly gesticulating group on the river bluff, the settlers from the Fort hurried down to the scene of action. Capt. Boggs and Alfred Clarke joined the crowd. Old Sam came running down from the barn. All were intensely excited and Col. Zane and Jonathan reached for the bridles and led <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> up <b>the</b> slippery incline.|$|R
50|$|Gibson's chief {{excellence}} however lay in basso rilievo. His thorough {{knowledge of}} <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> and his constant {{study of the}} Elgin Marbles, casts {{of which are in}} Rome, resulted in the two bassi rilievi, the size of life, which belonged to Lord Fitzwilliam: <b>The</b> Hours <b>Leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horses</b> of <b>the</b> Sun, and Phaethon driving the Chariot of the Sun. Most of his memorial works are also in basso rilievo. Some of these are of a truly refined and pathetic character, such as the monument to the Countess of Leicester, or that to his friend Mrs Huskisson in Chichester Cathedral, and that of the Bonomi children. Passion, either indulged or repressed, was the natural impulse of his art: repressed as in <b>the</b> Hours <b>Leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horses</b> of <b>the</b> Sun, and as in the Hunter and Dog; indulged as in the meeting of Hero and Leander, a drawing executed before he left England. Gibson was the first to introduce colour on his statues, first as a mere border to the drapery of a portrait statue of the queen, and by degrees extended to the entire flesh, as in his so-called Tinted Venus and in Love tormenting the Soul, both now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.|$|R
