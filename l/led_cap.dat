40|$|The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America {{reports that}} an {{underground}} mine {{is the most}} difficult environment to illuminate (Rea, 2000). Researchers at the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) are conducting ongoing studies designed to explore different lighting technologies for improving mine safety. Underground miners use different visual cues to escape from a smoke-filled environment. Primary and secondary escapeways are marked with reflective ceiling tags of various colors. Miners also look for mine rail tracks. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} compare different lighting types and ceiling tag colors to differentiate what works best in a smoke-filled environment. Various cap lamps (LED and incandescent) and lasers (red, blue, green) were compared to see which options resulted in the longest detection distances for red, green and blue reflective markers and a section of mine rail track. All targets advanced toward the human subject inside of a smoke-filled room to simulate the subject walking in a mine environment. Detection distances were recorded and analyzed to find the best cap lamp, laser color and target color in a smoke environment. Results show that cap lamp, laser color and target color do make a difference in detection distances and are perceived differently based on subject age. Cap lamps were superior to lasers in all circumstances of ceiling tag detection, with the exception of the green laser. The incandescent cap lamp worked best in the simulated smoke compared to the <b>LED</b> <b>cap</b> lamps. The green laser was the best color for detecting the tags and track compared to the red and blue lasers. The green tags were the easiest color to detect on the ceiling. On average, the track was easier for the subjects to detect than the ceiling tags. YLH 8 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 07 - 31 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26236146 PMC 452199...|$|E

The effects of Ca and N doping on the phase purity, morphology and optical properties of Ba 2 −xCaxSiO 4 −yN 2 / 3 y:Eu 2 + phosphors were also systematically investigated. The optical results show that Ba 2 −xCaxSiO 4 −yN 2 / 3 y:Eu 2 + phosphors can be actively excited over a broad range from 250 to 430 nm. With the adding of different concentrations of Ca 2 + ions in phosphors, the emission color wavelength can be tailored from 501 to 441 nm by a 375 nm NUV LED excitation source.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} calix[6]arene tris-carboxylic acid {{derivatives}} to include ammonium guests {{has been investigated}} both in solution and in the solid state. NMR studies and crystallographic data showed that the highly flexible calix[6]arene structures can be shaped in a well defined cone conformation thanks {{to the formation of}} an ion-paired cap between the carboxylate groups of the calixarene and their ammonium counter-ions. The resulting supramolecular edifices exhibit remarkable host-guest properties toward ammonium ions even in polar and protic solvents. The recognition process has been rationalized in the solid state by the combination of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and CH-Π interactions, and a remarkable C 3 -complementarity between the well-organized binding carboxylates of the host and the ammonium guest. Very interestingly, the endo-cavity complexation of large polycyclic ammonium ions as well as bioactive ammonium ions has been clearly demonstrated through NMR spectroscopy. Finally, the tuning {{of the nature of the}} ammonium ions involved in the supramolecular <b>cap</b> <b>led</b> to highly responsive molecular receptors...|$|R
