This study demonstrates the feasibility of using radar precipitation data with a distributed water-shed model to obtain increased <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> peak flow forecasting. The CASC 2 D watershed model {{is applied to the}} Hassyampa River watershed in central Arizona using radar-based rainfall estimates from the National Weather Service WSR- 88 D weather radar. An application of radar rainfall data as input to the CASC 2 D model is then presented by which precipitation forecasts are generated by extrapolation of precipitation patterns from radar images. The calibrated model is run for two rainfall events: with and without linear precipitation forecasts. Results of this study confirm that the precipitation forecasts based on extrapolation of rainfall patterns from radar can produce increases in the forecast <b>lead-time.</b> <b>For</b> the two events presented, the forecast lead-time was increased by four to five hours, which can be significant when issuing flood warnings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a deterministic model {{to plan the}} physician requirements for outpatient clinics to achieve service targets <b>for</b> the appointment <b>lead-times</b> of patients. The Ministry of Health of Singapore has established targets for the median, 95 th percentile, and 100 th percentile of appointment <b>lead-times</b> <b>for</b> patients, since long appointment postponements are regarded as being unacceptable for health care services. The study is to match {{the capacity of the}} healthcare providers to the patient demand for a re-entry system, subject to restrictions on the appointment <b>lead-times</b> <b>for</b> patients. We propose a mixed-integer programming model for planning capacity with the minimization of the maximum required capacity as its objective. In the model we assume a finite planning horizon, deterministic arrivals, multiple types of patients, identical physicians, and dependent demand between types of patients. We solve this model with a Branch and Cut algorithm. We test the model with numerical experiments using real data from the chosen specialty at the outpatient clinic of the studied hospital. The results show the value of the proposed model via a systematic push-pull mechanism in scheduling patients’ requests to minimize the objective. The clinic should use one of the appointment lead-time targets to determine the patients’ appointment dates. Finally, from the sensitivity analyses we demonstrate that the objective is negatively correlated with first-visit patients’ appointment lead-time targets, the discharge rates, and the re-visit patients’ mean appointment lead-time; we find a positive correlation between the first-visit patients’ mean appointment lead-time and the appointment lead-time targets...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{detection}} of microalbuminuria in diabetic patients {{using a new}} urinary albumin assay. BackgroundMicroalbuminuria {{is regarded as the}} most important predictor of high risk for the development of diabetic nephropathy. Early detection may allow treatment to prevent progression to persistent albuminuria and renal failure. Recent studies have shown that conventional immunoassays underestimate urinary albumin concentration, as albumin in urine may exist in two forms, immuno-reactive and immuno-unreactive. The present study examines the differential <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> the development of microalbuminuria as measured by both conventional radioimmunoassay (RIA; measures immuno-reactive) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; measures total albumin = immuno-reactive plus immuno-unreactive) analysis in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. MethodsAnalysis was performed on 511 stored urine samples collected over the last 13 years from type 1 diabetic patients who either progressed from normo- to microalbuminuria (progressors, N = 17), or who remained normoalbuminuric (nonprogressors, N = 25) as defined by RIA, and on 634 urine samples collected from patients with type 2 diabetes defined as either progressors (N = 24) or nonprogressors (N = 25). ResultsFor type 1 progressors, the mean <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> the HPLC assay versus the RIA was 3. 9 years, with a 95 % CI of 2. 1 to 5. 6 years. For type 2 progressors, the mean lead-time was 2. 4 years with a 95 % CI of 1. 2 to 3. 5 years. There {{was no significant difference between}} the lead-time analysis between type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.

Several predictive monitoring techniques have been proposed in the past.

Based on empirical evidence from an industrial case study in the area of transport and logistics, we assess those techniques with respect to five accuracy indicators. We further determine the dependency of accuracy on the point in time during process execution when a prediction is made in order to determine <b>lead-times</b> <b>for</b> accu...|$|R
