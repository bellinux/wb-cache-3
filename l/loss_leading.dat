25|$|The English Springer Spaniel has {{a typical}} {{lifespan}} of 10.5 to 15 years. As in most breeds, {{there are some}} health problems that {{are more likely to}} occur. Hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) (a degeneration of the retina causing vision <b>loss</b> <b>leading</b> to blindness) are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on genetic markers to determine carriers. Another problem can be elbow dysplasia. Retinal dysplasia (RD), which can cause blindness and Phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFK), which is genetic deficiency which impairs the ability of cells using carbohydrates for energy are two other hereditary conditions for which both lines of the English springer spaniel should be screened prior to breeding. Health issues are usually similar in both types of English Springer however phosphofructokinase deficiency in particular can appear more in field lines, however carriers in show lines have been identified.|$|E

500|$|In 2001 the Bristol Community Festival {{temporarily}} {{relocated to}} Hengrove Park {{in the south}} of the city. Ashton Court Estate, which includes a deer park, was closed as a quarantine measure due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease that affected the United Kingdom that year. The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial <b>loss,</b> <b>leading</b> to debts which hung over the organisation. This, along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements, led to a more commercial style of organisation, with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the perimeter fence.

40|$|Although {{diffusive}} shock acceleration (DSA) {{could be}} simulated by some well-established models, {{the assumption of}} the injection rate from the thermal particles to the superthermal population is still a contentious problem. But in the self-consistent Monte Carlo simulations, because of the prescribed scattering law instead of the assumption of the injected function, hence particle injection rate is intrinsically defined by the prescribed scattering law. We expect to examine the correlation of the energy injection with the prescribed multiple scattering angular distributions. According to the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, the energy injection and the losses in the simulation system can directly decide the shock energy spectrum slope. By the simulations performed with multiple scattering law in the dynamical Monte Carlo model, the energy injection and energy loss functions are obtained. As results, the case applying anisotropic scattering law produce a small energy injection and large energy <b>losses</b> <b>leading</b> to a soft shock energy spectrum, the case applying isotropic scattering law produce a large energy injection and small energy <b>losses</b> <b>leading</b> to a hard shock energy spectrum.
