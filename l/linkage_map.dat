25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic <b>linkage</b> <b>map.</b> Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The need to {{integrate}} information from multiple <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> is a long-standing problem in genetics. One way {{to visualize the}} complex ordinal relationships is with a directed graph, where each vertex in the graph is a bin of markers. When there are no ordering conflicts between the <b>linkage</b> <b>maps,</b> {{the result is a}} directed acyclic graph, or DAG, which can then be linearized to produce a consensus map. Results New algorithms for the simplification and linearization of consensus graphs have been implemented as a package for the R computing environment called DAGGER. The simplified consensus graphs produced by DAGGER exactly capture the ordinal relationships present in a series of <b>linkage</b> <b>maps.</b> Using either linear or quadratic programming, DAGGER generates a consensus map with minimum error relative to the <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> while remaining ordinally consistent with them. Both linearization methods produce consensus maps that are compressed relative to the mean of the <b>linkage</b> <b>maps.</b> After rescaling, however, the consensus maps had higher accuracy (and higher marker density) than the individual <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> in genetic simulations. When applied to four barley <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> genotyped at nearly 3000 SNP markers, DAGGER produced a consensus map with improved fine structure compared to the existing barley consensus SNP map. The root-mean-squared error between the <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> and the DAGGER map was 0. 82 cM per marker interval compared to 2. 28 cM for the existing consensus map. Examination of the barley hardness locus at the 5 HS telomere, for which there is a physical map, confirmed that the DAGGER output was more accurate for fine structure analysis. Conclusions The R package DAGGER is an effective, freely available resource for integrating the information from a set of consistent <b>linkage</b> <b>maps.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Human Genome Project. the ability to rapidly {{construct}} comprehensive and accurate <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> based on genetic marker data from family studies is an absolute necessity. In addition to their usefulness in localizing genes for both simple and complex disorders, <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> are invaluable tools for genetic counseling using linked marker genes. Several computer program packages are publicly available which aid in the construction of <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> by computing multipoint likelihoods for specified locus orders.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{number of}} linkage disequilibrium (LD) -based {{methods have been}} {{developed}} to describe recombination and infer hotspots. We determine the correspondence between LDMAP and LDhat, and between LDMAP and LDhot by comparison with <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> and hotspots that have been verified by sperm typing. METHODS: Regression and variance analyses were used to compare LDMAP and LDhat with <b>linkage</b> <b>maps.</b> The location and intensity of hotspots inferred by LDMAP and LDhot were compared with fifteen verified hotspots. RESULTS: Despite different methodologies and assumptions, LDMAP, LDhat, and <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> are highly concordant. Closer inspection shows that LDMAP corresponds more closely with <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> across the genome and on sixteen chromosomes compared with LDhat. LDhot identified fourteen and ten of the verified hotspots using high and low density maps. In comparison, LDMAP identified all fifteen hotspots at high and low density. However, some significant discrepancies between sperm and LD-based recombination rates remain. CONCLUSIONS: Combining information from linkage and LDMAP to construct sex-specific high resolution <b>linkage</b> <b>maps</b> suggests that some of these discrepancies may be due to female recombination while others may relate to the age of hotspots.

50|$|Molecular mapping aids in {{identifying}} the location of particular markers within the genome. There {{are two types of}} maps that may be created for analysis of genetic material. First, is a physical map, that helps identify the location of where you are on a chromosome as well as which chromosome you are on. Secondly there is a <b>linkage</b> <b>map</b> that identifies how particular genes are linked to other genes on a chromosome. This <b>linkage</b> <b>map</b> may identify distances from other genes using (cM) centiMorgans as a unit of measurement. Co-dominant markers can be used in mapping, to identify particular locations within a genome and can represent differences in phenotype. Linkage of markers can help identify particular polymorphisms within the genome. These polymorphisms indicate slight changes within the genome that may present nucleotide substitutions or rearrangement of sequence. When developing a map it is beneficial to identify several polymorphic distinctions between two species as well as identify similar sequence between two species.|$|E

50|$|Genetic Linkage is the {{tendency}} of alleles, which are located closely together on a chromosome, to be inherited together {{during the process of}} meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. During the process of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up, and can exchange corresponding sections of DNA. As a result, genes that were originally on the same chromosome can finish up on different chromosomes. This process is known as genetic recombination. The rate of recombination of two discrete loci corresponds to their physical proximity. Alleles that are closer together have lower rates of recombination than those that are located far apart.The distance between two alleles on a chromosome can be determined by calculating the percentage or recombination between two loci. These probabilities of recombination can be used to construct a <b>linkage</b> <b>map,</b> or a graphical representation of the location of genes and gene in respect to one another. If linkage is complete, there should be no recombination events that separate the two alleles, and therefore only parental combinations of alleles should be observed in offspring. Linkage between two loci can have significant implications regarding the inheritance of certain types of diseases.|$|E

We examined the number, size, and distribution of allelic effects influencing eight types of traits using 30 published <b>mapping</b> studies (<b>linkage</b> and association <b>mapping)</b> in forest trees. The sizes of allelic effects, measured as the phenotypic variance explained, generally showed a severely right-skewed distribution. We estimated the numbers of underlying causal effects (n(qtl)) for different trait categories by improving a method previously developed by Otto and Jones (Genetics 156 : 2093 - 2107, 2000). Estimates of n(qtl) based on association mapping studies were generally higher (median at 643) than those based on <b>linkage</b> <b>mapping</b> (median at 33). Comparisons with simulated <b>linkage</b> and association <b>mapping</b> data suggested that the lower n(qtl) estimates for the <b>linkage</b> <b>mapping</b> studies could partly be explained by fewer causal loci segregating within the full-sib family populations normally used, but also by the cosegregation of causal loci due to limited recombination. Disease resistance estimates based on <b>linkage</b> <b>mapping</b> studies had the lowest median of four underlying effects, while growth traits based on association mapping had about 580 effects. Theoretically, the capture of 50 % of the genetic variation would thus require a population size of about 200 for disease resistance in <b>linkage</b> <b>mapping,</b> while growth traits in association mapping would require about 25, 000.
