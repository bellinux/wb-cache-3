40|$|Ankylosing {{spondylitis}} (AS) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease, which typically begins in {{early decades of}} life with primarily axial joints involvement. This disease rarely affects patients older than 50 years of age. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare and evaluate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of late onset and early onset AS patients who were followed up in a single rheumatology center. A total of 339 patients who have been diagnosed with AS according to modified New York criteria were included in the study. The patients whose initial symptoms were observed after 50 years of age were accepted <b>as</b> <b>late</b> onset <b>AS.</b> Out of 339 patients, 27 (7. 9 %) were diagnosed <b>as</b> <b>late</b> onset <b>AS</b> and 312 (92. 3 %) patients were evaluated as early onset <b>AS.</b> Of 27 <b>late</b> onset patients, 10 were male and 17 were female. Delay in the diagnosis was 5. 8 years for early onset AS, while it was 3. 8 years for <b>late</b> onset <b>AS</b> (p = 0. 001). Higher levels of acute phase reactants and more methotrexate (MTX) use were detected in early onset AS patients compared to <b>late</b> onset <b>AS</b> (p = 0. 001, p = 0. 007, respectively). Statistically, there was no difference between these two groups, with regard to disease clinical activity indexes, anthropometric measurement parameters, uveitis and peripheral joint involvement. In this study, we showed that early and <b>late</b> onset <b>AS</b> patients may present with different clinical, genetic, and laboratory features. <b>Late</b> onset <b>AS</b> patients are characterized with lower human leukocyte antigen-B 27 sequence, less inflammatory sign, delayed diagnosis, and less MTX and anti- tumor necrosis factor alpha drug usage. </p...|$|R
