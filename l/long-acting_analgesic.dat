Above and beyond correct diagnosis the radiologist can also be implicated in the clinical management of these conditions. Treatment with ultrasound-guided aspiration and local injection of <b>long-acting</b> <b>analgesic</b> and steroid may relieve symptoms and represent the optimal therapy in cases of bursitis [43 – 46]. Percutaneous-guided treatments have been used successfully for pain management in bursitis and have been proven effective, thus obviating the need for surgical therapy [43 – 46].|$|E

40|$|Sustained {{analgesia}} {{is crucial}} for patients suffering from long-acting pain. Ester derivatives of morphine could enhance the lipophilicity of morphine; consequently its transdermal delivery {{as well as its}} duration of action are also increased. Therefore, twenty-one 3 -O-, 6 -O-, and 14 -Obenzoate esters of morphine and their derivatives were synthesized in order to elaborate different synthetic methods suitable for esterification of these widely used compounds. Schotten-Baumann reaction was applied with sodium hydrogen carbonate, triethylamine, or pyridine in methylene chloride or 1, 2 -dichloroethane as solvents. The presence of 4 -dimethylaminopyridine catalyst was also successfully utilized mainly in the case of tertiary alcohols. A novel synthesis of dihydromorphine via diacetyl morphine free of by-products is also presented. Structures of all synthesized compounds were elucidated by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13 CNMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and electron ionizationmass spectrometry (EI-MS). The log D (pH 7. 4) values of the synthesized compounds were determined by a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -MS-based method, and calculated hydrolysis rate constants are also provided. The synthesized benzoate esters are potential prodrugs of the parent morphine with enhanced lipophilicity, derivatives which can also be used in transdermal drug delivery as prospective <b>long-acting</b> narcotic <b>analgesics.</b> © Springer-Verlag 2012...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that many veterinarians may not use analgesics in livestock for routine surgical procedures or painful disease states. To investigate this, we conducted a national mail survey of {{a random sample of}} 1431 Canadian veterinarians (response rate, 50. 1 %). Questions primarily concerned veterinarians' analgesic usage for common surgeries and medical conditions in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, and horses, and attitudes toward pain management. More than 90 % of veterinarians used analgesic drugs for equine surgeries, for cesarean section in sows and cows, and for bovine claw amputation and omentopexy. However, in these and other categories, the analgesics used were often inadequate, and many veterinarians did not give analgesics to young animals. When castrated, 6 mo of age, and 95. 8 % of horses. Respondents largely agreed that there are no <b>long-acting,</b> cost-effective <b>analgesics</b> available for use in livestock (median rating 8 / 10; interquartile range 4 - 9), and that the long or unknown withdrawal periods of some drugs outweighed the benefits of using them (median rating 7 / 10; interquartile range 4 - 9). The results indicate an urgent need for veterinarians to manage pain in livestock better. Continuing education would help, as would {{an increase in the number}} of approved, cost-effective analgesic drugs with known withdrawal periods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{utilization}} of prescription opioids has {{increased over the}} last 2 decades. Associated with this is the misuse of prescription opioids for nonmedical purposes. Medicaid programs have struggled with developing strategies that balance best practice models, appropriate utilization, and reduction in {{costs associated with the}} opioid medication class. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a 2 -year stepwise initiative to reduce utilization and therapy costs of <b>long-acting</b> opioid <b>analgesics</b> (LAOA) by addressing issues of high dose, daily dose, and preferred therapeutic alternatives. METHODS: Utilization data from the Massachusetts Medicaid pharmacy program for LAOAs were reviewed and compared for 2 time periods. The calendar year prior to the initiative, 2002, was used as a base year and represents a time period when there were no restrictions in place for members to obtain long-acting opioids. The calendar year 2005 was the comparison year representing a time period after the multiple steps of the initiative had been implemented. A retrospective claims-based analysis was performed to determine the impact of restrictions on LAOAs, defined as brand and generic versions of oxycodone ER, morphine ER, methadone, and fentanyl transdermal system. The primary measure was the percentage of change of unique utilizers, paid claims, and average daily dose for each LAOA following the implementation of the opioid management initiative. Secondary measures included a cost analysis. RESULTS: Compared with 2002, the overall number of LAOA unique utilizers declined 17. 8...|$|R
40|$|Two recent {{developments}} of opioid peptide-based analgesics are reviewed. The {{first part of}} the review discusses the dermorphin-derived, cationic-aromatic tetrapeptide H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 ([Dmt 1]DALDA, where Dmt indicates 2 ′, 6 ′-dimethyltyrosine), which showed subnanomolar μ receptor binding affinity, extraordinary μ receptor selectivity, and high μ agonist potency in vitro. In vivo, [Dmt 1]DALDA looked promising as a spinal analgesic because of its extraordinary antinociceptive effect (3000 times more potent than morphine) in the mouse tail-flick assay, long duration of action (4 times longer than morphine), and lack of effect on respiration. Unexpectedly, [Dmt 1]DALDA also {{turned out to be a}} potent and <b>long-acting</b> <b>analgesic</b> in the tail-flick test when given subcutaneously (s. c.), indicating that it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, little or no cross-tolerance was observed with s. c. [Dmt 1]DALDA in morphine-tolerant mice. The second part of the review concerns the development of mixed μ agonist/δ antagonists that, on the basis of much evidence, are expected to be analgesics with a low propensity to produce tolerance and physical dependence. The prototype pseudopeptide H-Dmt-TicΨ[CH 2 NH]Phe-Phe-NH 2 (DIPP-NH 2 [Ψ], where Tic indicates 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline- 3 -carboxylic acid) showed subnanomolar μ and δ receptor binding affinities and the desired μ agonist/δ antagonist profile in vitro. DIPP-NH 2 [Ψ] produced a potent analgesic effect after intracerebroventricular administration in the rat tail-flick assay, no physical dependence, and less tolerance than morphine. The results obtained with DIPP-NH 2 [Ψ] indicate that mixed μ agonist/δ antagonists look promising as analgesic drug candidates, but compounds with this profile that are systemically active still need to be developed...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{extradural}} analgesia {{by means}} of repeated doses of local analgesic drugs through a catheter placed in the extradural space is now widely used in this country, both for the pro-duction of surgical analgesia and for the relief of pain. Using the caudal route, labour can be con-ducted painlessly, and by simply increasing the dosage the analgesia can be extended to cover a Caesarean section should this be necessary (Hing-son, Cull and Benzinger, 1961). Using the thoracic approach, Simpson (1961) produced a segmental extradural block which allowed patients with upper abdominal operations to have a completely pain-free post-operative course. Segmental block has been used with success {{in the treatment of}} chest injuries. Extradural analgesia will produce complete relief of pain compared with the relative analgesia of narcotic analgesics. The ability to cough without pain is of great value to the patient after operation and to the patient with a chest injury. The principal disadvantage of the method {{in the absence of a}} <b>long-acting</b> <b>analgesic</b> drug is the necessity for frequent "topping-up " doses. Many attempts have been made to simplify the tech-nique of "topping-up". Simpson and Salt designed the Oxford chuck (1961) whose inner chamber into which the extradural catheter was fed is protected by a sterile replacement cap. Cole described a 50 -ml sterile syringe filled with analgesic solution, and enclosed in a plastic envelope., through which the plunger of the syringe could be depressed. Bum (1963) used a sterile polythene bag containing analgesic, which was fed into the extradural space by gravity. This paper describes the use of a plastic dis-posable syringe for the production of continuous extradural analgesia. APPARATUS This is basically a 20 -ml graduated disposable plastic syringe which has been modified in three ways. Firstly, the nozzle has been replaced by a chuck device which will allow a 0. 020 -inch polyvinyl catheter to be threaded through its centre into the barrel of the syringe. The cathete...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient had}} a {{prolonged}} block after continuous extradural analgesia in labour. The block was unilateral, but 60 min {{after a second}} block there was bilateral sensory and motor loss. The original unblocked side did not recover fully until more than 60 hr. The local anaesthetic agent was 18 ml of bupivacaine 0. 5 % plain. Extradural analgesia for the relief of pain in labour has become widely practised in recent years especi-ally since {{the introduction of the}} <b>long-acting</b> local <b>analgesic</b> bupivacaine. As neurological complica-tions are the most feared consequence of this tech-nique, {{it is a matter of}} concern should the nerve block outlast its expected duration. CASE REPORT A 26 -year-old patient who had been pregnant twice previously presented in labour. During her first delivery she had pethidine for the relief of pain; a vacuum extraction was necessary under general anaesthesia. In her second labour she had a spon-taneous vaginal delivery with nitrous oxide in oxy-gen (Entonox) for analgesia. However, she was not satisfied with the pain relief obtained from either pethidine or nitrous oxide in her previous labours, and after an explanation of extradural block and its possible complications she decided upon this method. Her pregnancy had been normal and physical examination revealed no abnormality. The patient was positioned on her left side. Using a Tuohy needle and an air-filled syringe, the extradural space was located at the L 2 -L 3 inter-space by the loss of resistance method. About 4 ml of air was injected. During insertion of a Portex catheter to 15 cm, she complained of a mild cramp-like pain down her right leg. The catheter was withdrawn to 10 cm from the skin, leaving 4 - 5 cm in the extradural space. A Millipore filter unit (Swinnex 13) was connected, and after ensuring that no blood or c. si. could be aspirated 5 ml of bupivacaine 0. 5 % plain was injected. Five min later she was turned on to her right side and another 5 ml of bupivacaine 0. 5 % plain was injec...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>long-acting</b> opioid (LAO) <b>analgesics</b> for the {{treatment}} of chron-ic cancer and noncancer pain has expand-ed considerably in recent years. Drug uti-lization and distribution data indicate that the use of opioids has increased substan-tially in the last 20 years. 1 - 3 These trends are likely due to the increased recognition of chronic pain as an important and treat-able phenomenon, as well as increased familiarity by prescribers about the clini-cal use of opioid analgesics. 4 While abuse and dependence remain a concern among prescribers, professional organizations have stressed the need to address untreat-ed or undertreated chronic pain. 4 LAOs, like other opioids, are associat-ed with a number of well-known adverse effects such as respiratory and central ner-vous system depression, constipation, and physical dependence. Despite the prolifer-ation of LAO use, evidence that compares the available products is either lacking or clinically equivocal. A systematic review found very few high-quality data compar-ing the effectiveness and safety of LAOs for {{the treatment}} of chronic noncancer pain. 5 One randomized trial included in that review found less constipation with transdermal fentanyl compared with ex-tended-release (ER) morphine. 6 However, this study was deemed of poor quality {{because of a lack of}} blinding and previous exposure to morphine in most patients prior to study entry. Less constipation with transdermal fen-tanyl has also been reported in trials of patients with cancer, as well as in a claims-based observational study. 7, 8 The widespread use of opioid analgesics is also con-cerning given recent reports highlighting safety issues.
