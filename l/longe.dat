5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a <b>longe</b> line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E
5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the <b>longe</b> line and a physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E
25|$|The <b>longe</b> line (or <b>longe)</b> {{is about}} 30 feet (10 m) long, so the longeing circle {{can have a}} {{diameter}} of 60 feet (20 m). It is usually a flat woven webbing made of nylon, cotton, or Dacron. In the natural horsemanship tradition, the <b>longe</b> line is usually made of round cotton rope, and is often much shorter, as short as 15 or 20 feet. In general, cotton <b>longe</b> lines {{are less likely to}} burn the trainer's hands than nylon, but nylon is more durable and less likely to break.|$|E

50|$|A <b>longeing</b> cavesson (UK: lungeing) is {{a special}} type of halter or noseband used for <b>longeing</b> a horse. <b>Longeing</b> is the {{activity}} of having a horse walk, trot and/or canter in a large circle around the handler {{at the end of}} a rope that is 25 to 30 ft long. It is used for training and exercise.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>longeing</b> and {{glucosamine}} supplementation on known biological markers of joint disease was studied in yearling quarter horses. Twenty-one yearling quarter horses {{were randomly assigned}} to one of 4 treatments: 1) <b>longeing</b> (<b>longeing</b> 20 min daily) supplement control (LN); 2) longeing/glucosamine (LG); 3) walking (mechanical walker for 120 min daily (WN)); and 4) walking/glucosamine (WG). Oral glucosamine was administered at 5. 5 g b. i. d. weeks 1 - 4, 3. 5 g b. i. d. during weeks 5 - 6, and 2. 0 g b. i. d. during weeks 7 - 8. Serum was obtained weekly for 8 wk and analyzed for keratan sulfate and osteocalcin concentrations. Walked horses receiving glucosamine showed slight elevation in serum keratan sulfate compared to controls (P = 0. 04). Glucosamine or <b>longeing</b> exercise had no significant effect (6 > or = 0. 08) on serum osteocalcin concentrations. Under these conditions, <b>longeing</b> and/or glucosamine supplementation did not significantly alter serum concentrations of keratan sulfate or osteocalcin...|$|R

25|$|It is safest to <b>longe</b> in an {{enclosed}} area. If the horse escapes, {{it will be}} easier to catch, and {{an enclosed}} area will make him easier to control on the <b>longe.</b> Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20–25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used. For safety, it is best if there is no one riding in the longeing area.|$|E

2500|$|The {{voice is}} used {{in the same manner as}} when riding. It is used mainly for transitions, praise, or to express displeasure. Although the voice is not {{commonly}} used for riding, it is very important in <b>longeing.</b> However, overuse of voice to encourage impulsion will cause a horse to ignore the trainer. [...] Voice commands used in <b>longeing</b> are identical to voice commands used when leading or riding the horse, but more voice commands are used when <b>longeing</b> than at other times. [...] All words used in transitions for <b>longeing</b> are spoken slowly, clearly and each command should be phonetically distinct from and others. [...] For upward transitions the voice might raise to a higher pitch, downward transitions should lower the pitch. [...] A trainer may cluck or make another type of chirping or kissing sound to increase speed or impulsion.|$|R

25|$|Today renowned {{as one of}} Gamla stan's most picturesque {{and busy}} tourist magnets, Västerlånggatan was for many centuries {{one of the major}} streets of Stockholm {{together}} with Österlånggatan, both of which ran outside the city walls. During the 15th century, they were both called Allmänningsgatan ("The Common Street") or Långa gatan ("The long street"), occasionally in combination, like Allmenninx <b>longe</b> gathen or <b>longe</b> Almenninx gathen in 1514, and/or with a suffix such as västan till ("to the west") appended. The current name was officially established in 1885.|$|E
25|$|The <b>longe</b> line {{traveling}} from {{the horse to}} the hand is held in the hand in which direction the horse is moving (so if the horse is working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra <b>longe</b> line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If the horse were to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught on something.|$|E

25|$|A <b>longeing</b> cavesson may be {{used with}} or without a bridle. When used with a bridle {{containing}} a snaffle bit, the noseband of the bridle is removed, and the bridle goes over the <b>longeing</b> cavesson, to prevent pinching. The bridle cheekpieces sometimes need to be lengthened so that the bit still rests correctly in the mouth.|$|R

25|$|The <b>longe</b> line {{takes the}} place of the rein aids while longeing. It can be held in a rein hold (coming out the bottom of the hand) or a driving hold (coming out the top of the hand), and the extra line is folded back and forth rather than coiled, as coiled line can tighten and trap the trainer's hand or fingers if the horse bolts.|$|E
25|$|The whip {{usually has}} a stock of 6 feet (1.8 m), with a lash of 56 feet (1.51.8 m) (although some are longer). The whip is light, easy to handle, and well balanced. It is not {{safe to use}} a riding or driving whip for longeing because they are too short to reach the horse without {{bringing}} the handler {{close enough to the}} horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The <b>longe</b> whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment.|$|E

25|$|For a {{young or}} green (inexperienced) horse, longeing {{is used to}} teach a horse to respond to voice {{commands}} and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to {{the feel of a}} saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the <b>longe</b> to nearly everything {{it is going to be}} asked to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E
25|$|The correct {{method is}} to run the <b>longe</b> line through the inside bit ring, over the poll, and attach it to the outside bit ring. This method of {{attaching}} the line requires it to be changed each time the horse changes direction. This method has a slight gag effect, raising the bit up and applying pressure on {{the corners of the}} mouth and placing pressure on the poll, but puts less lateral pressure on the bit. It is best for horses that pull, or when the trainer is longeing a rider, to ensure maximum control of the horse.|$|E
25|$|The <b>longe</b> whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse.|$|E

500|$|Under Abbot David (1216–1234) {{there was}} a new phase of building, notably the {{construction}} in around 1220 of a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, abutting the northern side of the choir. This building, which still stands, was to become known as the [...] "Elder Lady Chapel". The architect, referred to in a letter as 'L', is thought to have been Adam Lock, master mason of Wells Cathedral. The stonework of the eastern window of this chapel is by William the Geometer, of about 1280. Abbot David argued with the convent and was deposed in 1234 to be replaced by William of Bradstone who purchased land from the mayor to build a quay and the Church of St Augustine the Less. The next abbot was William <b>Longe,</b> the Chamberlain of Keynsham, whose reign was found to have lacked discipline and had poor financial management. In 1280 he resigned and was replaced as abbot by Abbot Hugh who restored good order, with money being given by Edward I.|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a case of lung cancer in a 48 -year-old male horse trainer. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first such case report to include an {{exposure}} assessment of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) as a quartz. The trainer had no family history of lung cancer. Although he had a 15 pack/year cigarette-smoking history, he had stopped smoking 12 years prior to his diagnosis. For the past 23 years, he had performed <b>longeing,</b> and trained 7 - 12 horses per day on <b>longeing</b> arena surfaces covered by recycled sands, the same surfaces used in race tracks. We investigated his workplace RCS exposure, and found it to be the likely cause of his lung cancer. The 8 -hour time weight average range of RCS was 0. 020 to 0. 086 mg/m 3 in the <b>longeing</b> arena. Horse trainers are exposed to RCS from the sand in <b>longeing</b> arenas, and the exposure level is high enough to have epidemiological ramifications for the occupational risk of lung cancer...|$|R
2500|$|On horses {{of any age}} or {{level of}} experience, <b>longeing</b> is used to {{exercise}} a horse when it cannot be ridden, or when additional work is needed to develop balance, rhythm, and to improve the horse's gaits. It is also useful to help settle a horse before riding, especially a high-strung horse, a young horse, or a horse that has been confined more than usual. However, <b>longeing</b> for long periods or {{with the intent to}} tire a horse out can cause joint strain. It can be used [...] to [...] "blow off steam" [...] or [...] "get the bucks out" [...] before a rider gets on, though proper turnout or liberty work is a better alternative, because a <b>longeing</b> session is training time, not play time.|$|R
