Though they were best used as dyes {{to show off their}} brightness, this proved to be problematic. Where traditional pigment based inks would lie on a paper's surface, these thinner watery dyes had a tendency to be absorbed into a paper's fibers, where it lost its advantage of higher color density, leaving behind a dull blurry finish. To experience the rich colors of dyes light must be able to pass through them to excite their electrons. A partial solution was to combine these dyes with petroleum distillates, leading to faster drying heatset inks. But it was Curt Teich who finally solved the problem by embossing paper with a <b>linen</b> <b>texture</b> before printing. The embossing created more surface area, which allowed the new heatset inks to dry even faster. The quicker drying time allowed these dyes to remain on the paper's surface, thus retaining their superior strength, which give Linens their telltale bright colors. In addition to printing with the usual CYMK colors, a lighter blue was sometimes used to give the images extra punch. Higher speed presses could also accommodate this method, leading to its widespread use. Although first introduced in 1931, their growing popularity was interrupted by the outbreak of war. They were not to be printed in numbers again until the later 1940s, when the war effort ceased consuming most of the country’s resources. Even though the images on linen cards were based on photographs, they contained much handwork of the artists who brought them into production. There is of course nothing new in this; what it notable is that they were to be the last postcards to show any touch of the human hand on them. In their last days, many were published to look more like photo-based chrome cards that began to dominate the market. Textured papers for postcards had been manufactured ever {{since the turn of the}} century. But since this procedure was not then a necessary step in aiding card production, its added cost kept the process limited to a handful of publishers. Its original use most likely came from attempts to simulate the texture of canvas, thus relating the postcard to a painted work of fine art.|$|E

The applications Calendar, Contacts and Notes respectively lost their leather, book and notepad appearance (all introduced in Lion). <b>Linen</b> <b>textures</b> in Notification Center and Launchpad were removed {{as well and}} replaced with simple gray backgrounds.|$|R
5000|$|Textiles in a <b>linen</b> weave <b>texture,</b> {{even when}} made of cotton, hemp and other non-flax fibers, are also loosely {{referred}} to as [...] "linen". Such fabrics generally also have their own specific names, for example fine cotton yarn in a linen-style weave is called Madapolam.|$|R
50|$|Another {{equivalently}} famous apparel is the Xhubleta-clothing. A xhubleta is a bell wavy skirt {{which is}} held by two straps on the shoulders, worn {{on top of a}} long sleeved white <b>linen</b> shirt. It’s <b>texture</b> consists of long suspended long black straps etched in the material, which was usually chestnut velvet. The socks and shoes were the same as the pështjellak clothing. In the Rugova region (Kosovar West) the xhubleta clothing was worn especially after the Second World War.|$|R
6000|$|Nettle and Fern.--There are two {{moderately}} nutritious plants--nettle and fern--that {{are found}} wild in very many countries: and, therefore, the following extract from Messrs. Hue and Gabet's 'Travels in Thibet' {{may be of}} service:--"When the young stems of ferns are gathered, quite tender, before they are covered with down, and while the first leaves are bent and rolled up in themselves, you have only to boil them in pure water to realise a dish of delicious asparagus. We would also recommend the nettle, which, in our opinion, might be made an advantageous substitute for spinach; indeed more than once we proved this by our own experience. The nettle should be gathered quite young, when the leaves are perfectly tender. The plant should be pulled up whole, with {{a portion of the}} root. In order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting liquid which issues from the points, you should wrap them in <b>linen</b> of close <b>texture.</b> When once the nettle is boiled, it is perfectly innocuous; and this vegetable, so rough in its exterior, becomes a very delicate dish. We were able to enjoy this delightful variety of esculents for more than a month. Then the little tubercles of the fern became hollow and horny, and the stems themselves grew as hard as wood while the nettle, armed with a long white beard, p 203 presented only a menacing and awful aspect." [...] The roots of many kinds of ferns, perhaps of all of them, are edible. Our poor in England will eat neither fern nor nettle: they say the first is innutritious, and the second acrid. I like them both.|$|R
