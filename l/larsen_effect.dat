50|$|Drum {{percussion}} {{instruments are}} usually the instruments with the shortest sustain; a drum beat begins to fade almost instantly. Instruments with the highest possible sustain often involve the passage of air, such as brass or the pipe organ, which have theoretically unlimited sustain. Feedback created using the <b>Larsen</b> <b>effect</b> also provides virtually unlimited sustain, but only to electronically amplified instruments. Resonating instruments such as the piano and guitar also have fairly long sustain for string instruments.|$|E

30|$|Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} acceptance in the developed world of the need for ALMPs to strengthen the link between social protection, labour market policies and employment. Today, these policies are widely regarded as an important tool in fighting unemployment. As a result, expenditure in ALMPs is sizeable in most advanced economies and continues to increase. Success of ALMPs, however, has not been invariably positive. Although some empirical evidence exists that points to a positive effect on the probability of finding employment (e.g. Layard et al. 2009; Lalive et al. 2005; <b>Larsen</b> 2002), the <b>effects</b> tend to be relatively small, making it unclear whether the positive outcomes are enough to compensate for the costs. Moreover, a central concern that remains is whether ALMPs are suitable to address longer-term matters such as skills and employability, especially among the least employable jobless individuals.|$|R
40|$|Summary. -A tumour {{initiating}} dose of {{ethyl carbamate}} {{was administered to}} mice by subcutaneous injection together with a dose {{of one of the}} homologous esters or an ethyl N-alkyl derivative. The homologues used were the methyl, n-propyl and n-butyl esters, and the derivatives were the N-methyl, N-ethyl and N-n-propyl ethyl esters. The mice were then given promoting treatment with croton oil for 28 weeks. Neither the homologous esters nor the N-substituted derivatives of ethyl carbamate had any influence on the yield of tumours in the skin, lung, or liver. However, increasing the dose of ethyl carbamate increased the yields of tumours. THE administration of ethyl carbamate (urethane) to mice by any route leads to the production of tumours in a variety of tissues (Tannenbaum, 1964). Adenomata of the lung (Nettleship et al., 1943; Shimkin, 1955) are very common. Lymphomata with or without leukaemia (Pietra et al., 1961), haemangiomata of the liver (Trainin, 1963), and hepatomata are less commonly found; tumours of lacrimal gland, skin and of other sites are observed infrequently and only after a long latent period. For skin its carcinogenic action is mainly that of an initiator, that is, tumours usually appear only when the skin is subsequently painted repeatedly with a promoting agent such as croton oil (Graffi et al., 1953; Salaman and Roe, 1953; Berenblum and Haran, 1955). The tumour initiating property of carbamates for skin appears to be limited to the ethyl ester and a few of its N-substituted derivatives (Berenblum et al., 1959 b; Pound, 1967, 1969). The tumour producing property for lung also appears to be restricted to ethyl, ethyl N-methyl and N-hydroxy carbamates although propyl carbamate was considered to have a doubtful <b>effect</b> (<b>Larsen,</b> 1947, 1948; Berenblum et al., 1959 b). However, because of the common chemical structure it might be thought that the homologues, or the N-substituted derivatives, of ethyl carbamate might affect or be affected by similar metabolic systems within the cells of animals injected with them. Some related compounds appear to produce similar abnormalities of the chromosomes during mitosis in the cells of animals, some eggs and plant...|$|R
30|$|The {{prediction}} of tree height is of central importance, {{not only for}} the calculation of growing stock from sample inventories, but also in the prognosis of middle and long-term forest development for forest planning and in the analysis of timber supply. The estimation of single tree volume and assortment is made using species-specific taper functions which use tree height and the diameter at breast height (dbh) (and occasionally other stem diameters) as input parameters. Single tree volumes are then the basis for expanding total timber volume from sample forest inventories for any given evaluation and planning unit. With respect to dbh, information from fully documented experimental plots, or at least from concentric sample plots, can frequently be relied upon for tree height imputation in sample forest inventories and for generating realistic start values to initialize forest growth simulators. Measurements of tree height, however, are considerably more costly to obtain, so that often little or no data is available. If one to several height measurements are available in a stand or sample plot, height-dbh curves based on simple mixed models are applied which allow for local calibration of a mean population relationship and thus local prediction (e.g. Corral-Rivas et al. 2014). These models that employ exclusively diameter as predictor are purely data imputation tools and do not, for example, describe explicitly the effects of site or competition on the height-dbh relationship. Generalized height curves describe these <b>effects</b> (<b>Larsen</b> and Hann 1987; López et al. 2003; Temesgen and Gadow 2004). However, frequently the information on measured height-dbh pairs is not used for local calibration of the height predictions. A combination of both model approaches leads to generalized height-diameter (h-d) models, which can be locally and temporarily calibrated. Hence, these models are developed using either linear or non-linear mixed models in which site, stand, competition variables but also regional units or geographic coordinates are used as covariates (Lappi 1997; Eerikäinen 2003; Calama and Montero 2004; Mehtätalo 2004; Nanos et al. 2004; Hökkä, 1997; Schmidt et al. 2011). From a more general point of view mixed models also provide {{a solution to the problem}} of correlated errors that results from grouped data structures and they quantify the variability between groups via random effects (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). This is highly relevant in h-d modeling since in most forest growth and yield data bases several measurements origin from the same sample plot or trial and measurement occasion.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{feedback}} (also {{known as}} acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the <b>Larsen</b> <b>effect)</b> {{is a special}} kind of positive feedback which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup) and an audio output (for example, a loudly-amplified loudspeaker). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small PA systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.|$|E
50|$|SASER's central idea {{is based}} on sound waves. The set-up needed for the {{implement}} of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation is similar to an oscillator. An oscillator can produce oscillations without any external feed-mechanism. An example is a common sound amplification system with a microphone, amplifier and speaker. When the microphone {{is in front of}} the speaker, we hear an annoying whistle. This whistle is generated without extra contribution from the sound source, and is self-reinforced and self-sufficient while the microphone is somewhere in front of the speaker. This phenomenon, known as the <b>Larsen</b> <b>effect,</b> {{is the result of a}} positive feedback.In general, every oscillator consists of three main parts. These are the power source or pump, the amplifier and the positive feedback leading to the output. The corresponding parts in a SASER device are the excitation or pumping mechanism, the active (amplifying) medium, and the feedback leading to acoustic radiation. Pumping can be performed, for instance, with an alternating electric field or with some mechanical vibrations of resonators. The active medium should be a material in which sound amplification can be induced. An example of a feedback mechanism into the active medium is the existence of superlattice layers that reflect the phonons back and force them to bounce repeatedly to amplify sound.|$|E

40|$|Reactive motion {{planning}} and local navigation of robots remains a significant {{challenge in the}} motion control of robotic vehicles. This thesis presents new results on vision guided navigation using optical flow. By detecting key image features, calculating optical flow and leveraging time-to-transit (tau) as a feedback signal, control architectures can steer a vehicle {{so as to avoid}} obstacles while simultaneously using them as navigation beacons. Averaging and balancing tau over multiple image features successfully guides a vehicle along a corridor while avoiding looming objects in the periphery. In addition, the averaging strategy deemphasizes noise associated with rotationally induced flow fields, mitigating risks of positive feedback akin to the <b>Larsen</b> <b>effect.</b> A recently developed, biologically inspired, binary-key point description algorithm, FReaK, offers process speed-ups that make vision-based feedback signals achievable. A Parrot ARDrone 2 {{has proven to be a}} reliable platform for testing the architecture and has demonstrated the control law's effectiveness in using time-to-transit calculations for real-time navigation...|$|E
40|$|Program abstracts of the 162 nd {{meeting of}} the Acoustical Society of America. International audienceUsing the {{feedback}} effect, we experimentally detect a wavelength-sized target in a shallow ultrasonic waveguide between two source-receiver transducers on acoustic feedback. The waveguide represents a 1 -km-long, 50 -m-deep ocean acoustic channel at the 1 / 1000 scale. The feedback phenomenon, or <b>Larsen</b> <b>effect,</b> occurs when a source and a receiver are connected both acoustically through the propagation medium and electrically through an amplifier {{in such a way}} that the received signal is simultaneously and continuously added to the emitted signal. A resonance is obtained when the emitter and the receiver are in phase. This resonance is very sensitive to any change in the medium which makes it a good observable for target detection. In presence of a target in the waveguide, the numerical gain of the feedback effect has to increase in order to compensate the scattering of the acoustic field from the target. In a separate experiment, the scattered field may also be recorded in a transmission configuration from the same couple of emitter/receiver with an impulse as a source signal. A comparison is made between the two different approaches...|$|E
