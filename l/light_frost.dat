5|$|The {{morning of}} 27 February 1814 saw a <b>light</b> <b>frost,</b> but {{the ground was}} not frozen. At 8:30 am the 4th Division {{assaulted}} Taupin's soldiers at Saint-Boès. The initial rush seized the church which stood on a separate hill. The brigade of Robert Ross swept through Saint-Boès but was repulsed by the battery on the Plassotte knoll. When his soldiers fell back into the village, Cole brought up a KGL battery to duel with Taupin's guns. The battery immediately became {{the target of the}} French batteries on the Plassotte and Luc knolls; two guns were knocked out and Captain Frederick Sympher was killed. Cole deployed José Vasconcellos' Portuguese brigade on Ross' right and sent his line forward again. The result was a second repulse in which Ross went down with a wound. The subsequent counterattack by Taupin's troops recovered part of Saint-Boès. For a time there was a lull as the two sides fired away at each other from the houses, but Vasconcellos' men had no cover and began to edge backward. Wellington sent over the 1st Caçadores Battalion from the Light Division. Cole's line collapsed just as the reinforcement arrived. Taupin recovered the entire village and drove the Allies back to their starting point. Ross' brigade suffered 279 casualties and Vasconcellos' brigade lost 295.|$|E

2500|$|Upton has a {{temperate}} {{maritime climate}} (Köppen: Cfb), similar {{to much of}} the rest of the United Kingdom. Being close to the sea and sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly wind by Snowdonia, the area has relatively warm summers. The winters are generally mild and wet, mornings with <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> are common, and there are few days of snow. The nearest official weather station, as the crow flies, is at Hall Road in Crosby, which is about [...] away.|$|E
50|$|It is also hardy to European Zone H4. It may survive mild winters or endure <b>light</b> <b>frosts,</b> with {{temperatures}} {{as low as}} -16C °, especially if the plants have been mulched.|$|R
50|$|Barrydale has a {{temperate}} climate of warm, dry summers with averages of 25°C occasionally up to 35°C, and mild, wet winters {{when the temperature}} occasionally dips to around -1°C accompanied by <b>light</b> <b>frosts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cyathea dregei is {{relatively}} common in cultivation as an ornamental plant, especially in South Africa and Australia. Plants should be sheltered and grown in rich humus, with a constant supply of moisture. This species can survive <b>light</b> <b>frosts</b> with little damage.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} to see him off, you'll have to wait an hour; and, on the whole, I think you'd better. He seems {{to have made a}} number of acquaintances in the bar. Anyway, with this <b>light</b> <b>frost,</b> the roads will be good and hard." ...|$|E
60|$|The black {{mass of the}} {{mountain}} rose {{between him and the}} east with a flush of pink above its sloping shoulder; the rolling country to the west was shadowy, and dry tufts of wild cotton glimmered a ghostly white among the dark-peat-hags. There had been <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> for a few days, but it had gone, and a raw wind blew in Williamson's face. The ground was getting soft, the rushes he brushed through were beaded with moisture, and now and then half-thawed ice crackled beneath his wet boots. Still, as he did not wish to loiter about Dumfries, he went on leisurely.|$|E
50|$|Cyathea hancockii {{has entered}} {{cultivation}} {{although it is}} still very rare. This species may survive <b>light</b> <b>frosts,</b> but should ideally be grown in rich humus and under shelter. Plants need to be watered well and provided with a consistent supply moisture.|$|R
50|$|Subspecies brevifolia {{has proven}} to be easier to {{propagate}} and grow than stirlingensis and has been cultivated for more than eight years where it is a small shrub with brightly coloured flowers. Propagation from cuttings is usual, and the plants are tolerant of <b>light</b> <b>frosts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Passion {{fruit is}} widely grown in {{tropical}} and semitropical {{regions of the}} world. Within the United States, it is grown in Florida and California. Certain cultivars are resilient against <b>light</b> <b>frosts,</b> and thus can survive perennially, even in more temperate climates {{such as that of}} Great Britain.|$|R
60|$|They took a sleeping-car for Frankfort {{and they}} woke early as people do in sleeping-cars everywhere. March dressed {{and went out}} for a cup of the same coffee of which sleeping-car buffets have the awful secret in Europe as well as America, and for a glimpse of the {{twilight}} landscape. One gray little town, towered and steepled and red-roofed within its mediaeval walls, looked as if it would have been warmer in something more. There was a heavy dew, if not a <b>light</b> <b>frost,</b> over all, and in places a pale fog began to lift from the low hills. Then the sun rose without dispersing the cold, which was afterwards so severe in their room at the Russischer Hof in Frankfort that in spite of the steam-radiators they sat shivering in all their wraps till breakfast-time.|$|E
60|$|Crash! Why, {{what was}} this? I still lived. I was in water, for I could feel its chill, and going down, down, till I thought I should never rise again. But rise I did, though my lungs were nigh to {{bursting}} first. As I floated up towards the top I remembered the crash, which {{told me that}} I had passed through ice. Therefore I should meet ice at the surface again. Oh! to think that after surviving so much I must be drowned like a kitten and beneath a sheet of ice. My hands touched it. There it was above me shining white like glass. Heaven be praised! My head broke through; in this low and sheltered gorge it was but a film no thicker than a penny formed by the <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> of the previous night. So I rose from the deep and stared about me, treading water with my feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "When the blossom's leaves dropped off, and {{a little}} pumpkin began to grow on in its place, the vine did {{everything}} it could for it; just gave itself up to it, and put all its strength into it. After all, {{it was a pretty}} queer-looking pumpkin, though. It had to grow hanging down, and not resting on anything, and after it started with a round head, like other pumpkins, its neck began to pull out, and pull out, till it looked like a gourd or a big pear. That's the way it looked in the fall, hanging from the vine on the fence, when the first <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> came and killed the vine. It was the day when the farmer was gathering his pumpkins in the cornfield, and he just happened to remember the seeds he had planted in the home-patch, and he got out of his wagon to see what had become of them. He was perfectly astonished to see the size of the good little pumpkin; you could hardly get it into a bushel basket, and he gathered it, and sent it to the county fair, and took the first premium with it." ...|$|E
50|$|This shrub has {{not often}} been grown in gardens and its {{requirements}} are not currently well known. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. It {{is growing in}} full sun in well drained soil, is drought tolerant and tolerates <b>light</b> <b>frosts.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{the days}} slipped by. June came, with more leisure for the shepherds, better grazing for the sheep, heavier dews, <b>lighter</b> <b>frosts,</b> snow-squalls half rain, and {{bursting}} blossoms on the prickly thorns, wild-primrose patches in every shady spot, and bluebells lifting wan azure faces to the sun.|$|R

60|$|Pausing in her troubled march, {{she swept}} away the curtain swaying {{in the wind}} and looked out, as if imploring help from Nature, the great mother of us all. A summer moon rode high in a {{cloudless}} heaven, and far as eye could reach stretched the green wilderness of a Cuban cafetal. No forest, but a tropical orchard, rich in lime, banana, plantain, palm, and orange trees, under whose protective shade grew the evergreen coffee plant, whose dark-red berries are the fortune of their possessor, and the luxury of one-half the world. Wide avenues diverging from the mansion, with its belt of brilliant shrubs and flowers, formed shadowy vistas, along which, on the wings of the wind, came a breath of far-off music, like a wooing voice; for the magic of night and distance lulled the cadence of a Spanish contradanza to a trance of sound, soft, subdued, and infinitely sweet. It was a southern scene, but not a southern face that looked out upon it with such unerring glance; there was no southern languor in the figure, stately and erect; no southern swarthiness on fairest cheek and arm; no southern darkness in the shadowy gold of the neglected hair; the <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> of northern snows lurked in the features, delicately cut, yet vividly alive, betraying a temperament ardent, dominant, and subtle. For passion burned in the deep eyes, changing their violet to black. Pride sat on the forehead, with its dark brows; all a woman's sweetest spells touched the lips, whose shape was a smile; and in the spirited carriage of the head appeared the freedom of an intellect ripened under colder skies, the energy of a nature that could wring strength from suffering, and dare to act where feebler souls would only dare desire.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{the frontiers}} of the fading Empire lay that outer land, as loose and {{drifting}} as a sea, which had boiled over in the barbarian wars. Most of it was now formally Christian, but barely civilized; a faint awe {{of the culture of}} the south and west lay on its wild forces like a <b>light</b> <b>frost.</b> This semi-civilized world had long been asleep; but it had begun to dream. In the generation before Elizabeth a great man who, with all his violence, was vitally a dreamer, Martin Luther, had cried out in his sleep in a voice like thunder, partly against the place of bad customs, but largely also against the place of good works in the Christian scheme. In the generation after Elizabeth the spread of the new wild doctrines in the old wild lands had sucked Central Europe into a cyclic war of creeds. In this the house which stood for the legend of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, the Germanic partner of Spain, fought for the old religion against a league of other Germans fighting for the new. The continental conditions were indeed complicated, and grew more and more complicated as the dream of restoring religious unity receded. They were complicated by the firm determination of France to be a nation in the full modern sense; to stand free and foursquare from all combinations; a purpose which led her, while hating her own Protestants at home, to give diplomatic support to many Protestants abroad, simply because it preserved the balance of power against the gigantic confederation of Spaniards and Austrians. It is complicated by the rise of a Calvinistic and commercial power in the Netherlands, logical, defiant, defending its own independence valiantly against Spain. But on the whole we shall be right if we see the first throes of the modern international problems in what is called the Thirty Years' War; whether we call it the revolt of half-heathens against the Holy Roman Empire, or whether we call it the coming of new sciences, new philosophies, and new ethics from the north. Sweden took a hand in the struggle, and sent a military hero to the help of the newer Germany. But the sort of military heroism everywhere exhibited offered a strange combination of more and more complex strategic science with the most naked and cannibal cruelty. Other forces besides Sweden found a career in the carnage. Far away to the north-east, in a sterile land of fens, a small ambitious family of money-lenders who had become squires, vigilant, thrifty, thoroughly selfish, rather thinly adopted the theories of Luther, and began to lend their almost savage hinds as soldiers on the Protestant side. They were well paid for it by step after step of promotion; but at this time their principality was only the old Mark of Brandenburg. Their own name was Hohenzollern.|$|E
50|$|It can {{withstand}} a <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> {{if it is}} completely dry.|$|E
50|$|Ground frosts {{are rare}} {{due to the}} region being encircled by the moderating Pacific and Tasman waters; however, <b>light</b> <b>frosts</b> do occur {{infrequently}} around Dargaville in the lowlands. The hottest months are January and February. In January 2009, excessive sunlight hours and below-average rainfall resulted in the region being declared a drought zone.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} seldom seen in cultivation. As it is {{difficult}} to propagate from both seed and cuttings, grafting on to rootsock of Myoporum species is often undertaken to produce new plants. It is slow growing and prefers a dry, well-drained sunny position. It can withstand <b>light</b> <b>frosts</b> and is very drought tolerant.|$|R
50|$|It {{enjoys a}} {{temperate}} climate, with slightly {{above the national}} average sunshine (2100 hours per annum), and about 900 mm of annual rainfall. Several <b>light</b> <b>frosts</b> are normally experienced in winter. The river is prone to flooding after heavy rain in the catchment, and in June 2015 record flooding occurred with 100 households evacuated.|$|R
50|$|Rhus crenata, {{the dune}} crow-berry, is {{a species of}} Rhus that is native to South Africa, where it grows in {{frost-free}} and <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{cultivated}} as an ornamental for its showy foliage and purple flowers. It {{is sensitive to}} cold but can tolerate a <b>light</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{sold as a}} hardy {{evergreen}} shrub {{that can}} be used for edging, a groundcover or as a border. G. hirtella can tolerate full sun and <b>light</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|E
50|$|This eremophila has {{not often}} been grown in gardens but has interesting, {{serrated}} leaves and colourful flowers. It {{is difficult to}} propagate from seed or from cuttings {{and is one of}} the few of its genus that will not graft onto Myoporum rootstock. It prefers well-drained soil in a sunny location and tolerates <b>light</b> <b>frosts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tagetes lemmonii blooms from {{fall into}} spring and can {{sometimes}} be blooming for up to 10 months. It can get up to 8 feet tall by across. The foliage is pungent when disturbed.The species is very drought tolerant in a Mediterranean climate and much used in California gardens where it tolerates <b>light</b> <b>frosts</b> without damage.|$|R
50|$|Waterhousea floribunda 'Sweeper' is a {{cultivar}} with a weeping {{habit and}} lush green new growth and a ripple in the leaves. It grows to {{a height of}} 10m x 5-8m wide and produces clusters of white flowers in summer. It will grow in full sun to part shade and has and will tolerate <b>light</b> <b>frosts</b> in cool climates.|$|R
50|$|Thomasia pygmaea is an {{attractive}} small shrub, useful for edging, container growing or in rockeries. It requires a light soil with good drainage and tolerates some shade and <b>light</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{has little}} {{resistance}} to frost conditions, but may endure a sporadic <b>light</b> <b>frost</b> where it occurs at its altitudinal limits. Usually {{the climate is}} rather humid in these mountains of northeastern Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The rain {{appears to}} have been {{saturated}} with salt. The leaves on trees which were not blown away were covered with a white salt coating that resembled a <b>light</b> <b>frost.</b> Even houses turned white.|$|E
50|$|G. spinosa {{is found}} around Wiluna from the Canning Stock Route to the Little Sandy Desert {{and as far}} south as Yeelirrie Station. It grows on stony ridges and in gravelly, sandy or loamy soils often over sandstone.The plant is used in gardens as an {{informal}} screen, informal hedge or barrier that is able to tolerate dry soils and <b>light</b> <b>frosts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cyathea brownii {{requires}} good {{light but}} does best when shaded during the hottest {{parts of the}} day. It responds well to fertilization but can be intolerant of some commercial fertilizers producing malformed fronds and a larger but weaker plant. It is able to withstand only <b>light</b> <b>frosts.</b> Larger plants may survive overnight temperatures as low as minus three degrees Celsius.|$|R
