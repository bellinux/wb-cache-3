40|$|A {{homogeneous}} dynamic reservoir {{model has}} been build for the Delft Sandstone Member, but geological formations are never completely homogeneous. The objective {{of this study is}} to increase knowledge about the heterogeneity of the Delft Sandstone Member for the construction of a future heterogeneous dynamic reservoir model of the Delft Sandstone Member. The present study comprises a core study presented in a core log; this core log is linked to a GR log, a porosity log and a permeability log. In the core log a description of the core is given. It contains the lithofacies, sandstone/silty sandstone /siltstone, the grain size, other features such as the presence of coal pieces and fractures and clay clasts. The Delft Sandstone Member is divided in 5 sandstone bodies, at the bottom three single sandstone bodies, in the middle a multiple stacked sandstone body and at the top a single sandstone body. The sandstone bodies have a fining upward trend. By linking the core log to the petrophysical logs it can be seen that there are five zones. At the bottom of the Delft Sandstone Member there is a low porosity and permeability zone, but the porosity and permeability increases towards the top of the Delft Sandstone Member with a small decline in both properties near the top of the formation. From the link between the permeability log and the core log it is interpreted that fractures and <b>laminated</b> <b>coal</b> are responsible for a decrease in permeability in the Delft Sandstone Member. The results can be put in a new dynamic reservoir model to make a better prediction of the fluid flow in the Delft Sandstone Member. Section Applied GeologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
