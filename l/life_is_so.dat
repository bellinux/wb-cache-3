25|$|An {{absolute}} pacifist {{is generally}} {{described by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation as one who believes that human <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available {{as a tool to}} aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her {{dilapidated}} Belgrade apartment. [...] "I don't know know what to say when people say I was lucky... <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> hard today," [...] she remarked. Vulović said she was [...] "tired" [...] of discussing her fall. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović's friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade's New Cemetery on 27 December.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{he had very}} {{little in common with}} Russian {{literary}} aristocrats. According to D. S. Mirsky, Leskov was [...] "one of those Russian writers whose knowledge of life was not founded on the possession of serfs, to be later modified by university theories of French or German origin, like Turgenev's and Tolstoy's, but on practical and independent experience. This is why his view of Russian <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> unconventional and so free from that attitude of condescending and sentimental pity for the peasant which is typical of the liberal and educated serf-owner." [...] Mirsky expressed bewilderment at how Leskov, after his first novel No Way Out, could have been seriously regarded as a 'vile and libelous reactionary', when in reality (according to the critic) [...] "the principal socialist characters in the book were represented as little short of saints." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1943, Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Roger Bushell {{conceived}} a {{plan for}} a mass escape from the North Compound, which occurred on the night of 24/25 March 1944. He was being held with the other British and Commonwealth airmen and he was in command of the Escape Committee that managed all escape opportunities from the north compound. Falling back on his legal background to represent his scheme, Bushell called a meeting of the Escape Committee to advocate for his plan. He said: [...] "Everyone here in this room is living on borrowed time. By rights we should all be dead! The only reason that God allowed us this extra ration of <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> we can make life hell for the Hun... In North Compound we are concentrating our efforts on completing and escaping through one master tunnel. No private-enterprise tunnels allowed. Three bloody deep, bloody long tunnels will be dug – Tom, Dick, and Harry. One will succeed!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks in}} advance of the filming, the real Henry Hill was paid $480,000. The film was shot on {{location}} in Queens, New York, New Jersey, and parts of Long Island during {{the spring and summer of}} 1989, with a budget of $25 million. Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout. According to the filmmaker, he [...] "wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [...] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out." [...] He claims that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of Jules and Jim (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, freeze frames, and multiple locale switches. It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, [...] "So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?—That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show". He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information. He also put plenty of detail in every frame because the gangster <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> rich. The use of freeze frames was done because Scorsese wanted images that would stop [...] "because a point was being reached" [...] in Henry's life.|$|E
