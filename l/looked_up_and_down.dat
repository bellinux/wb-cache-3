2500|$|President Abraham Lincoln asked Barnum and Nutt {{to come to}} the White House in November 1862. When the two arrived, Lincoln left {{a cabinet}} meeting to welcome them. Nutt asked Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, if he was the man who was {{spending}} so much of Uncle Sam's money. [...] Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, interrupted {{to say that he was}} the man. [...] "Well," [...] said Nutt, [...] "It is in a good cause, anyhow, and I guess it will come out all right." [...] As Barnum and Nutt were on their way out, President Lincoln shook Nutt's hand. He told the Commodore that he should [...] "wade ashore" [...] if his [...] "fleet" [...] was ever in danger. Nutt <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> Lincoln's long legs. [...] "I guess, Mr. President", he said, [...] "You could do that better than I could." ...|$|E

60|$|Spike {{went to the}} door, opened it, and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the passage.|$|E
60|$|All {{the white}} men turned quickly, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the cave. It was useless. Yellow Elk had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|They {{remained}} {{out on the}} road, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> {{for five}} minutes, {{and then returned to}} the house.|$|R
60|$|Billy couldn't {{think of}} {{anything}} to say. He turned to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the canyon in search of the enemy.|$|R
60|$|Annabel <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{the empty}} street, {{and then turned}} to her sister.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> anxiously, {{and then}} ran down {{the steps to the}} pavement.|$|E
60|$|The boy <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> with {{a guilty}} air, and a cunning, cynical reserve.|$|E
6000|$|Larry King {{staggered}} {{out into}} an empty street, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> [...] "Wal, I reckon--thet's--aboot--all!" [...] he drawled, with low, strangled utterance.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's two of ye," [...] {{says the}} man with the nose, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> for the sight of a policeman. [...] "I've enjoyed your company immense. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah well," [...] said Isabel, {{standing}} before her uncle {{with her hands}} clasped about the belt of her black dress <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the lawn--"that will suit me perfectly!" ...|$|R
60|$|Fogerty <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{the roads}} {{and shook his head}} with a puzzled expression.|$|E
60|$|Hal {{was soon}} {{out of the}} house. Once in the street, he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once down in {{the street}} again, Hal <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> but could see nothing of Ferris.|$|E
50|$|The Jedi Engine also {{included}} {{the ability to}} jump and crouch, the ability to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> atmospheric effects (achieved by careful manipulation of 256-color palette files). The engine is limited in its rendering capabilities, however, and used two-dimensional sprites (pre-rendered in different angles) {{for most of its}} object graphics.|$|R
6000|$|... [Thereupon Napoleon's face blackens as if {{the shadow}} of a winter [...] night had fallen upon it. Resentful and threatening, he stops the [...] {{procession}} <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the benches.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Dor. Why {{could he}} not find more of us? Pray, sister, [...] Let you <b>and</b> I <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> one day, [...] To find some little ones for us to play with.|$|R
60|$|Ralph <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{to see if}} any one {{was coming}} across, and, {{sighting}} none, followed.|$|E
60|$|Then she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the Westminster Bridge Road {{to see if}} he was in view.|$|E

5000|$|All of {{the walls}} in Doom are drawn vertically; {{it is because of}} this that it is not {{possible}} to properly <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> It is possible to perform a form of look up/down via [...] "y-shearing", and many modern Doom source ports do this, as well as later games that use the engine, such as Heretic. Essentially this works by moving the horizon line <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> within the screen, in effect providing a [...] "window" [...] on a taller viewable area. By moving the window <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> it is possible to give the illusion of <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> However, this will distort the view the further <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the player <b>looks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'As dutiful as sons in general, I suppose,' {{returned}} Jonas, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> once more. 'I don't brag to {{have been}} any better than other sons; but I haven't been any worse, I dare say.' ...|$|R
60|$|While he was waiting, Ralph <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{the street}} for the bootblack, but Mickety had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|The bear {{advanced}} {{to the center of}} the gully and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> suspiciously. Then he sniffed the air.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the stream. Nothing was {{in sight}} but the boats and {{here and there a}} mass of driftwood.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ave {{you been}} on the look-out?" [...] he ses. [...] "I don't suppose a nice gal like that would come and shove her 'ead in at the gate. Did you <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the road?" ...|$|R
60|$|And he <b>looked</b> {{the other}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{as a man}} would <b>look</b> a horse <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|Guy {{attempts}} to use operatives {{to put down}} the growing insurrection and also arranges for French agents to look for Camille and Jean-Baptiste in the north. They <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the Gulf of Tonkin with no success.|$|R
6000|$|... “No, I don’t,” {{returned}} Dave. He had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{the sandy}} strip {{in vain for}} a sight of the Englishmen and Jasniff.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{the side}} streets, {{and tried to}} peep into the curtained windows of several saloons that were close at hand.|$|E
60|$|The two {{students}} {{walked to the}} river and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the stream. A rowboat and a sailboat were in sight, but that was all.|$|E
60|$|At a {{few minutes}} before eleven Laverick left the place and drove to the stage-door of the Universal Theatre. Zoe came out among the first and paused upon the threshold, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the street eagerly. When she {{recognized}} him, her smile was heavenly.|$|R
60|$|The window {{looked out}} upon the quay, and Rollo {{could see the}} men at work getting out hogsheads and bales of goods from a steamer that was moored there. Besides looking across to the quay, Rollo could also <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the street without putting {{his head out of}} the window. The way in which he was enabled to do this, was by means of looking glasses placed outside. These looking glasses were {{attached}} to an iron frame, and they were placed in an inclined position, so as to reflect the whole length of the street in through the window. Thus a person sitting at his ease within the room, could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the street, as well as across it, at his pleasure.|$|R
5|$|Dark Forces {{uses the}} Jedi game engine, which was {{developed}} {{specifically for the}} game. The engine adds gameplay features to the first-person shooter genre which were uncommon {{at the time of}} release, including level designs with multiple floors and the ability to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
