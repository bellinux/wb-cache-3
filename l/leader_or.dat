5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the <b>leader</b> <b>or</b> a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political <b>leader</b> <b>or</b> party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

30|$|The {{second step}} taken to avoid {{conflict}} is engaging with <b>leaders</b> <b>or</b> influential individuals in these villages (Manguvo and Mafuvadze 2015). These <b>leaders</b> <b>or</b> influential individuals sometimes include chiefs, village headmen, church pastors, mosque imams, religious leaders, spiritual leaders and even healers. The term healer can also relate to diviners, traditional healers, spiritual healers, traditional doctors, witch doctors, sorcerers or medicine men/women, among others.

Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's <b>leader</b> <b>or</b> help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The 435 {{members of}} the House of Representatives elect a Speaker by {{majority}} rule {{at the beginning of}} each session of the United States Congress, who serves until the end of the Congress. Typically, the election is a formality, as the majority party's members vote as a bloc for their party's previously-chosen Speaker-designate (such as the speaker, majority <b>leader,</b> <b>or</b> minority leader from the previous term). Open elections are uncommon but have occurred. The last Speaker election to require multiple ballots occurred in 1923.|$|E
5|$|From 1924 until 1928, Lent {{attended}} the local public primary school at Pyrehne. His father and oldest brother Werner then tutored {{him at home}} {{in preparation for the}} entrance examination at the public secondary school at Landsberg. In February 1933, Helmut joined the Jungvolk, the junior branch of the Hitler Youth. From 1933 to 1935, he acted as a youth platoon <b>leader,</b> <b>or</b> Jungzugführer (1 March 1933– 1 April 1935) and flag-bearer, or Fähnleinführer (1 April 1935– 9 November 1935) until he left the Jungvolk to prepare for his diploma examination. Helmut passed his graduation examinations at the age of seventeen on 12 December 1935. On 2 February 1936, he began the eight-week compulsory National Labour Service at Mohrin. He joined the military service in the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker on 1 April 1936, against the wishes of his father.|$|E

5|$|In late July 1943, No.1 Wing's {{headquarters}} was disbanded to make {{it easier}} to deploy the Spitfire squadrons to different areas as the need arose. Under the new command arrangements, the squadrons reported directly to the North-Western Area's headquarters for administrative purposes and No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters controlled all fighter operations. This change also aimed to end the confusion which existed at the time between whether the wing <b>leader</b> <b>or</b> senior ground controller in the fighter sector headquarters was responsible for directing the Spitfires during battle. No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was redesignated No.1 Wing on 25September when Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey assumed command from Caldwell, who had been appointed No.2 Operational Training Unit's chief flying instructor. The headquarters' role remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the death}} of the last chief, in the 18th century, the MacAulays of Ardincaple have ceased to exist as a clan. There is {{currently}} no clan chief, and no member of the clan has been granted the undifferenced arms of the MacAulays of Ardincaple. However, with a revival of Scottish interest in the 20th century several MacAulays unsuccessfully attempted to prove a genealogical link to the last chief, and a movement was organised to revive the clan. In 1997 Iain McMillian MacAulay was made interim <b>leader,</b> <b>or</b> clan commander. Later in 1998, during its first assembly, the organisation's objectives were determined: to unite three unrelated groups of MacAulays under one chief – Clan MacAulay (the MacAulays of Ardincaple), the Macaulays of Lewis, and the Macaulays of Wester Ross; this new chief would then, in effect, be chief of all MacAulays. In 1999 MacAulay intended to petition the Lord Lyon King of Arms to be recognised as chief but was challenged by Iain Davidson MacAulay, originally a native of Helensburgh who claimed a direct bloodline to the chiefs of the clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} is gregarious in nature. No {{distinct}} <b>leader</b> <b>or</b> any hierarchy is {{noted in the}} social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, {{at the age of}} four to five years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four or five bulls may share the same home range. Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.|$|E
