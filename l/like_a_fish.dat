5|$|When {{moving through}} a fluid, {{rotating}} systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) {{such as those}} experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas oscillating systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered Gossamer Condor), much higher efficiencies, {{in the range of}} 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> tail or bird wing.|$|E

A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish,</b> which took journalists {{on a tour of}} London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times liked the track's use of instrumentals, perceiving that Usher [...] "holds onto his crown" [...] by doing this, and by combining [...] "Ibiza club music". PopMatters' Matt Cibula lauded Usher's vocals, writing that he [...] "absolutely rips [...] "Climax" [...] and [...] "What Happened to U", nails party anthems like [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] to the wall". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy depicted [...] "Scream" [...] to be [...] "a seductive club number of chest-popping beats and sex-fuelled lyrics". DJ Booth viewed that Usher [...] "takes {{to the track}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> to water" [...] by portraying confidence and sex-appeal to {{a woman in a}} club. Rap-Up depicted the song as an [...] "adrenaline-fueled record" [...] comparing it to Usher's [...] "OMG" [...] and [...] "DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love" [...] (2010).

500|$|In 2000, Innherredsferja {{started to}} work on {{proposals}} to purchase a new ferry. The following year, it chose to buy Torghatten for NOK19.2 million from Torghatten Trafikkselskap, and renamed it Ytterøy II. It was taken into service on 9 November 2002, andInnherredsferja II was sold. At the same time, Innherredsferja and Fosen Trafikklag amended their agreement, whereby [...] Ytterøy, stationed at Levanger, became the shared reserve ferry. This meant that if a reserve vessel was needed for the Flakk–Rørvik Ferry, Ytterøy II would be sent there, and Ytterøy used for the Levanger–Hokstad service. From 1 January 2003, the Levanger–Hokstad Ferry was one of six services which {{were part of a}} national test project where the fees for cars were increased, while passengers traveled free. The project included larger discounts for large users. The scheme was terminated in 2006. A new ferry quay at Levanger was opened in 2003, with a larger waiting area and ramp. The ramp also had separate sections for walk-on passengers and cars. A terminal building was built with a waiting room and toilets, as well as offices for Innherredsferja. The terminal was [...] in two stories and cost NOK1.8 million. From the ground, the building was built to symbolize a lighthouse, while from above it appears shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
500|$|The dolphin's {{search for}} food is {{aided by a}} form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by {{producing}} sounds and listening for the echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam {{in front of the}} dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an [...] "echoic image" [...] or sound picture of their targets.|$|E
500|$|Several {{aspects of}} the episode had to be {{compromised}} due to budget constraints. The true form of the aliens could only be shown {{for a few seconds}} each as it was very expensive to do, and these shots were spread throughout the episode. In the original script a big monster rose out of the water in Isabella's death scene, but this would have been too expensive and Moffat was forced to ask Whithouse to make it [...] "invisible". Many of the costumes in the episode were taken from artwork from the 15th and 16th centuries. This included veils that women wore, which were used for the vampire girls. Guido trades clothes with Rory when Rory must disguise himself as a Venetian to enter Amy into the school; this was an idea of Moffat's which Whithouse was against as he thought Guido was a [...] "tragic character", but he eventually thought the sight of the character in Rory's stag party T-shirt was funny. McCrory's costume was designed to be similar to her alien creature to make the transition smooth. McCrory was coached to move <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish,</b> which she pursued diligently. Each pair of teeth for the vampires was unique and moulded to their mouths. They were hard to speak with and Alex Price's lines were re-voiced, though he commented he got [...] "quite good" [...] at speaking with them.|$|E

50|$|The first {{reference}} to Deauville was in 1060. At {{this time the}} village was called A Enilla and looked more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> hamlet than <b>a</b> village.

500|$|Ghost in the Shell {{gained an}} {{aggregate}} rating of 78.50% at GameRankings, {{which would be}} a mostly positive metascore. AllGame praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, [...] "Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not." [...] GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as [...] "simple... most people will take to them <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> to water" [...] and praising the animation sequences. GameFan reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that [...] "the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb," [...] but adding that [...] "the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay." [...] Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, Velikij Drakon lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, [...] "The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation." ...|$|E
500|$|My Name Is My Name was {{met with}} {{universal}} acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 27 reviews. Mike Powell of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "He's still a witty, quietly vicious rapper, capable of tearing apart spare street tracks like [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and [...] "Numbers on the Board" [...] while barely raising his voice. But set in the more commercial contexts of Kelly Rowland features and the-Dream's fluorescent R, he can sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> out of some pretty expensive water. Who Pusha was is gone, but who he is still sometimes unclear." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "With Pusha's pen at full force and his performance a proper combination of cold and tense, the album is as if Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury were atom-smashed into something more artful and unstable. My Name Is My Name is a remarkable and vital solo debut." [...] Jesse Cataldo, writing for Slant Magazine, said, [...] "Yet despite its pedigree, the album puts too much overall emphasis on guest spots and not enough on establishing a distinctive identity for the rapper. Full of retrograde lyrical conceits, seemingly at odds with its futuristic backdrops, My Name Is My Name {{is a reminder that}} Pusha T hasn't changed, and his stubborn reliance on maintaining his brand is probably not the wisest strategy in today's shifting hip-hop climate." [...] Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "A few poor production choices and uneven sequencing do slow the album, but it shows flashes of real brilliance. The best tracks here are produced by Kanye and Pharrell, and they're concentrated at the beginning and end. The smattering {{in the middle of the}} tracklist is handled by host of collaborators, not all of them effectively complimenting Pusha's rawness. While not the defining statement it could’ve been, My Name Is My Name shows different sides of Pusha T as he becomes a more multidimensional rapper." ...|$|E
