It is possible to <b>look</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> carriage through its windows at any time. But public entry to the carriage is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4).

Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E
