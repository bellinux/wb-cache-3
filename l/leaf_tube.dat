Also {{the intensity of}} 28 sensory attributes was determined in these sections by a trained quantitative, descriptive panel. The sections differed in their mouth-feel attributes â€“ centre and basis were juicier and crisper than the tips, which were strawy/fibrous and drier. At higher pyruvic acid and SSC concentrations in the tips, more punceny and sweetness was expected, but no increased values were found. Very low juiciness to convey pungent and sweet compounds and very low fresh matter related to leaf length were identified as possible reasons for this inconsistency...|$|E
40|$|The social {{structure}} of banana bats (Neoromicia nanus) was studied in relation to reproductive events over an annual cycle in banana plantations in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Banana plantations were visited at monthly periods over a year, and social group composition was investigated. Group composition varied considerably over the annual cycle, and was linked to reproductive status. Mixed-sex groups began to form during February, lasted until October, and were most frequent during mid winter (July). During the lactation period (Oct-Jan), females formed maternity colonies composed of lactating females and juveniles. Three kinds of <b>leaf</b> <b>tubes</b> were identified according {{to the size of}} the opening: small (0 - 20 mm), medium-sized (21 - 115 mm) and large (115 mm-unfolded leaf). Bats occupied mainly medium-sized <b>leaf</b> <b>tubes.</b> Average daily temperatures were high, even during the winter period (Jun-Aug), with humidity in the <b>leaf</b> <b>tubes</b> > 80 % throughout the year. Although high humidity may play a role during hibernation to restrict dehydration, low ambient temperatures are important to sufficiently lower their body temperatures in order to lower metabolic rate and thus reduces energy requirements...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} landuse on benthic macroinvertebrate {{community}} structure was assessed in 35 streams draining four different landuse activities (native (Beech and Broadleaf/Podocarp) forest, exotic (Pinus radiata) forest, hill country pasture and scrubland) around Lake Taupo, North Island, New Zealand, between January and March 1997. Ephemerotera (mainly Deleatidium sp.) were abundant in all landuse types. Diptera (Chironomidae), Coleoptera (Elmidae) and Trichoptera (Pycnocentrodes aureola) dominated invertebrate communities in open canopy pasture streams, where higher algal biomass existed. Native forest and exotic forest stream communities were considerably different. Native forest streams had higher water velocities, substrate stability and overhead cover, whereas exotic forest streams had low bed stability and high sand levels. In {{response to the}} higher sand levels in exotic streams, invertebrate communities had higher abundance of molluscs (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) and Coleoptera (Elmidae). Native stream communities were dominated by Ephemeroptera (Deleatidium sp. and Colorburiscus humeralis), Coleoptera (Elmidae) and Trichoptera (Aoteapsyche colonica). Landuse effects on invertebrates are different throughout New Zealand and will depend on local conditions, especially geology. In December 1997 and January 1998, leaf litter decomposition and invertebrate colonisation were examined in 12 streams draining four different landuse activities around Lake Taupo. Mesh leaf tubes (0. 2 mm) and mesh leaf bags (3 mm) containing dried Rangiora (Brachyglottis repanda) leaves were immersed into streams draining the four landuse types. Leaf tubes and bags were removed from streams after 14 days, 28 days and 42 days to measure the percentage of leaf weight lost from each <b>leaf</b> <b>tube</b> and bag and to assess the invertebrate colonisation of the leaf litter bags. Open canopy streams processed leaf litter in the tubes faster than closed canopy streams {{and it is likely}} that the increased temperatures and nutrient levels in open streams contributed to this phenomenon. Leaf bags were decomposed more rapidly in exotic streams where invertebrate densities in bags were highest among the landuse types. The low abundance of quality food available in exotic sites is likely to have contributed to the higher numbers of invertebrates feeding on the limited food resource. Invertebrate communities in all landuse types were distinctly different from each other, in contrast to benthic communities which were more similar. It appears that landuse does affect invertebrate communities in leaf bags, and this in turn influences leaf litter decomposition rates.

40|$|Planting rice further apart {{reduces the}} risk of attacks by the rice gall midge which is a serious pest in Asia and many African countries. The larvae feed on the young rice shoots which then develop the {{characteristic}} hollow leaf galls, called onion <b>leaf</b> <b>tubes</b> or silver shoots, which prevent panicle development and thus reduce yield. Over the last two years, researchers at the National Cereals Research Institute in Nigeria have been conducting trials with varying planting distances and nitrogen levels. The yields from areas planted in rows 30 cm x 30 cm apart were about 10 % higher than those planted at 10 cm x 10 cm {{due to the fact that}} there were more silver shoots and less mature panicles at the closer planting distance. It appears that the closer spacing provides a micro-climate more favourable to this pest and that the base of the plants receive less light. The percentage of silver shoots with closer spacing was about 55 % over two years compared to 45 % at a wider spacing. In the first year, higher nitrogen applications increased pest damage but did not affect the gall midge infestation. In the second year, extra nitrogen seemed to increase both the number of insects and the extent of gall midge damage.

40|$|Brassinosteroids (BRs) are {{plant hormones}} that {{regulate}} many processes including cell elongation, <b>leaf</b> development, pollen <b>tube</b> growth and xylem differentiation. GSK 3 /shaggy-like kinases (GSK) are critical regulators of intracellular signalling {{initiated by the}} binding of BR to the BRI 1 receptor complex. Three GSKs have already been shown to relay BR responses, including phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator BES 1. However, recent studies indicate that one or more yet unidentified protein kinases are involved in BR signalling. Here, we show that the in vivo protein kinase activity of the group-III GSK, ASKh, was negatively regulated by BRI 1. Arabidopsis thaliana plants with enhanced ASKh activity displayed a bri 1 -like phenotype. ASKh overexpressors accumulated high levels of brassinolide, castasterone and typhasterol, and were insensitive to BR. ASKh localized to the nucleus and directly phosphorylated BES 1 and BZR 1. Moreover, the BES 1 /BZR 1 -like transcription factor BEH 2 was isolated as an ASKh interaction partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen. ASKh phosphorylated BEH 2 both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, these data provide strong evidence that ASKh is a novel component of the BR signalling cascade, targeting the transcription factors BES 1, BZR 1 and BEH 2...|$|R
40|$|This {{protocol}} {{can be used}} {{to inhibit}} the biosynthesis of polyamines, specifically putrescine, in tomato plants grown with NH 4 + as a solely N source. In general, polyamines are positively charged small metabolites implicated in physiological processes, including organogenesis, embryogenesis, floral initiation and development, <b>leaf</b> senescence, pollen <b>tube</b> growth, fruit development and ripening and participate in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses (Tiburcio et al., 2014). Polyamines are synthesized from amino acids by decarboxylation of ornithine or arginine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) or arginine decarboxylase (ADC), respectively (Walters, 2003). Tomato plants grown with NH 4 + as the sole N source presented an increase of putrescine content in leaves (FernÃ¡ndez-Crespo et al., 2015). To assess the importance of putrescine accumulation, DL-Î±-(Difluoromethyl) arginine (DFMA) and DL-Î±-(Difluoromethyl) ornithine (DFMO), inhibitors of putrescine synthesis, were used as irreversible inhibitors of ADC and ODC enzymes, respectively (Fallon and Phillips, 1988), with the purpose of reducing cellular putrescine accumulation induced by NH 4 + nutrition.

40|$|Abiotic {{conditions}} within streams, {{especially those}} conditions impacted by human activities, often influence the community structure and ecosystem function. While coastal regions have been strongly impacted by urban development and agriculture, {{little research has}} focused on characterizing the biotic community structure and function in these Coastal Plain streams. Such watersheds are characterized by low gradient, blackwater streams with sandy and silty substrate, coupled with large amounts of human disturbance. The objectives of this research were 1) to characterize the macroinvertebrate community and the chemical and physical characteristics of two Coastal Plain watersheds with differing landuse practices, 2) to examine appropriate macroinvertebrate sampling protocol comparing leaf pack and Maryland Biological Stream Sampling (MBSS) methods, 3) to compare these community structure measures with the functional measure of leaf decomposition, and 4) to investigate potential mechanisms for shifts in decomposition due to elevated nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in mesocosms. Results of three years of monthly sampling showed differences between watersheds in a number of chemical parameters, including nutrient concentrations. However, structural differences between the macroinvertebrate communities, using both three years of leaf pack sampling and a MBSS survey, were only identified for certain taxa and depended on the taxa resolution used. Also, two in situ leaf decomposition experiments using <b>leaf</b> decomposition <b>tubes</b> showed no differences in the macroinvertebrate or microbial contribution to detrital processing. Correlation analyses demonstrated that rates of decomposition were negatively associated with macroinvertebrate predator abundance and positively associated with the abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa in the community. Lastly, a laboratory mesocosm experiment illustrated the strong effect of DOC from blackwater streams in reducing rates of leaf decomposition and processing efficiency by a macroinvertebrate shredder. While abiotic measurements of Coastal Plain stream sites varied greatly both spatially and temporally, and the field experiments yielded little consistent pattern with the macroinvertebrate community, the mesocosm experiment demonstrated the strong inhibitory effect of DOC on detrital processing and processing efficiencies of a macroinvertebrate shredder. Thus, while measuring rates of decomposition may not be suitable as a biomonitoring tool to differentiate already nutrient enriched Coastal Plain streams, it can add to stream assessments by providing a measure of ecosystem function where impacts are less subtle...|$|R

After 2 h of incubation on water agar, some A-group ascospores had germinated at 10 - 20 degreesC and some B-group ascospores had germinated at 5 - 20 degreesC. The percentages of both A-group and B-group ascospores that had germinated after 24 h of incubation increased with increasing temperature from 5 - 20 'C. The observed time (Vo(50)) which elapsed from inoculation until 50 % of the spores had germinated was shorter for B-group than for A-group ascospores. Germ tube length increased with increasing temperature from 5 - 20 degreesC for both ascospore groups. Germ tubes from B-group ascospores were longer than germ tubes from A-group ascospores at all temperatures tested, but the mean diameter of germ tubes from A-group ascospores (1. 8 mum) {{was greater than}} that of those from B-group ascospores (1. 2 mum) at 15 degreesC and 20 degreesC.

40|$|Specialised plant {{pathogens}} are in {{many ways}} adapted to exploit their host plants. Infective propagules should reach the appropriate plant tissue, {{gain access to the}} tissue and negate or suppress various kinds of constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms. The resistance type most frequently deployed in plant breeding is the race-specific resistance, where a hypersensitive response of plant tissue is elicited by an avirulence factor produced by the pathogen. The great disadvantage of this type of resistance is, that it is often ephemeral. Detailed screening of germplasm may result in the discovery of alternative defence mechanisms not associated with hypersensitivity, that may be durable. Avoidance mechanisms may reduce the chance of infection. Upright plant habit has been reported to decrease spore deposition in cereals. Crop architecture may also affect aspects such as humidity and aeration in the crop, and hence the chances for successful infection by pathogen propagules. Other examples of avoidance are leaf surface properties that interfere with <b>leaf</b> wettability, germ <b>tube</b> orientation and finding of stomata to enter the leaf. Stomata in some accessions of Hordeum chilense are excessively covered by cuticular wax that prevent rust fungal germ tubes from perceiving the stomata, resulting in failure of penetration of the pathogen into the leaf. There is evidence that in compatible host species, biotrophic pathogenic fungi induce basic compatibility by suppressing defence mechanisms. Failure of this induction results in abortion of the infection attempt. Several cases of apparently durable resistance are discussed that are based on failure of haustorium formation, and are not associated with hypersensitivity. They may represent cases where the pathogen has problems in establishing basic compatibility...|$|R

Even though these field studies demonstrated the potential insecticidal use of this relationship, the manner in which B. bassiana colonizes Zea mays L. was not known;The following study was initiated to elucidate the methods of adhesion, penetration and colonization of maize by B. bassiana. Light and electron microscopic techniques were utilized to investigate the interactions between these two species. Understanding this unique relationship will be invaluable in further development and utilization of this fungus to manage insect pests of food plants;The adhesion and subsequent growth and penetration on maize leaves by B. bassiana is very similar to the germination and penetration by B. bassiana on insect cuticles. The hydrophobic conidia attach to the <b>leaf</b> surface, germ <b>tubes</b> form, and hyphal elongation occurs along the leaf surface. The hyphae appear to penetrate directly the maize leaf cuticle and enter the airspace and/or mesophyll cells. Apparently B. bassiana does not require specific topographic signals at an appropriate entry site as do some phytopathogenic fungi;Long hyphal structures were observed to follow the leaf apoplast in any direction from the point of penetration. Hyphae were observed to penetrate the vascular tissue. Because vascular bundles are interconnected throughout the maize plant, this may explain how the fungus travels within the plant and ultimately provides overall insecticidal protection.
