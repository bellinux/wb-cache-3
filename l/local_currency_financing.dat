While MDBs have traditionally provided financing in foreign currency to their borrowers, greater sensitivity by borrowers to potential currency mismatches, political decentralization, {{and the development of}} local capital markets have recently led MDBs to consider providing financing in local currency. While still small in comparison to MDBs' foreign currency financing, this paper argues that <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> <b>financing</b> will evolve into an increasingly important financing mode for MDBs. The paper addresses the key benefits and challenges, and provides an overview of the current policies and experience of the major MDBs in this rapidly growing area...|$|E

Until the eve of the financial crisis, many emerging economies were able to reduce the vulnerabilities of their debt portfolios and debt management was being carried out under favorable circumstances. Average maturities increased, reflecting increases in the maturities of new debt issuances, and rollover risks declined. Moreover, the increased availability of <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> <b>financing,</b> reflecting the development of domestic capital markets, and the globalization of the corporate sector in emerging economies underscored the changing landscape of development financing. debt, management, macroeconomic, debt relief, developing countries, low-income countries, bubble, portfolio, risks, maturities, financing...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} infrastructure investment activity, capital market development, the role of public institutions and economic development in the Asia Pacific. It adopts a review approach drawing on empirical evidence over recent decades. Infrastructure is shown {{to be an important}} asset class playing a central role in a nation’s output, growth, productivity and microeconomic performance. Infrastructure investment also requires investment and predictions of a widening gap in the future supply of infrastructure in the Asia Pacific will require new forms of capital from both traditional and new sources including wider use of private participation, institutional investment, asset recycling and revenue bonds. Capital market development is also necessary to raise long-term <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> <b>finance</b> and evidence suggests that progress with regional capital market integration is slow and a continuing reform agenda is required. The dividend for regional countries is the prospect of higher levels of economic growth with infrastructure investment, capital market development, and foreign direct investment shown to have a strong and positive association with growth. A crucial link in this association identified in the review is the part played by national and regional institutions in improving the efficiency with which infrastructure is managed and providing promising ground for further research where the importance of these links can be researched in greater depth...|$|R
50|$|A new {{currency}} {{called the}} real (plural reais) was introduced on 1 July 1994, {{as part of}} a broader plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, substituting the short-lived cruzeiro real in the process. Then, a series of contracting fiscal and monetary policies was enacted, restricting the government expenses and raising interest rates. By doing so, the country was able to keep inflation under control for several years. In addition, high interest rates attracted enough foreign capital to finance the current account deficit and increased the country’s international reserves. The government put a strong focus on the management of the balance of payments, at first by setting the real at a very high value relative to the U.S. dollar, and later (in late 1998) by a sharp increase on domestic interest rates to maintain a positive influx of foreign capitals to <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> bond markets, <b>financing</b> Brazilian expenditures.|$|R
40|$|Investment in {{infrastructure}} for increasing trade and connectivity in South Asia and Southeast Asia has been impacted by {{a reduction in}} commercial bank participation in project financing, which has significantly increased the role of multilateral financial institutions and export credit agencies. The financing model needs to change to more sustainable local market and <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> <b>financing</b> by harnessing domestic savings, {{and this will be}} crucial if the region is to procure investments of an estimated $ 3. 6 trillion by 2020 for financing of its infrastructure and connectivity projects. Increased connectivity between South and Southeast Asia can {{play an important role in}} improving efficiency and productivity by having more efficient industries based on comparative advantage, enlarging the overall market size, and increasing market access. However, such economic integration faces a multitude of challenges relating to cross-border infrastructure links, weak trade facilitation, shortages of infrastructure financing, non-tariff barriers, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and weak institutional coordination. Improvement in these issues would require large-scale public and private sector investment, supplemented by commercially viable credit. This study analyzes the means and constraints in funding cross-border connectivity projects. Using the most recent data from sources including the World Bank, ADB, and other financing and research institutions, barriers in financing cross-border projects are explored and analyzed with the help of case studies. This research brings to the fore the potential benefits of regional funding platforms and the role of multilaterals in resolving such barriers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationships}} between foreign currency debt, macroeconomic volatility, and risk premia in {{a model of a}} small open emerging market economy. The external value of the <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> is counter-cyclical, so that foreign currency debt requires larger repayments than <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> debt in bad states of nature. The level of foreign currency-denominated debts, therefore, affects the volatility of aggregate demand and by extension of the exchange rate. Exchange rate volatility is in turn an important determinant of the risk premium on <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> debt. Finally, this risk premium is {{a major factor in the}} choice of <b>local</b> versus foreign <b>currency</b> for emerging market borrowers. The mutual endogeneity of foreign currency debt, risk premia, and macroeconomic volatility creates important feedback effects in the economy: small increases in international risk aversion may entail large amplification effects on macroeconomic volatility since domestic borrowers substitute towards cheaper but riskier foreign <b>currency</b> debt <b>finance.</b> Foreign <b>currency</b> debt Volatility Risk premia Amplification...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of why a government would default on debt denominated in its own currency. Using a newly constructed dataset of 14 emerging markets, we document that the private sector continues to borrow from abroad in foreign currency while sovereigns increasingly borrow from foreigners in <b>local</b> <b>currency.</b> Because depreciation can be very costly for a corporate sector with a currency mismatch due to foreign currency liabilities, emerging market sovereigns may still prefer to default on <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> sovereign debt rather than inflate the debt away. Using our cross-country dataset, we show that a higher reliance on external foreign <b>currency</b> corporate <b>financing</b> is associated with a higher default risk on sovereign debt. We quantify the effects of corporate balance sheet mismatch on sovereign credit risk by introducing <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> sovereign debt and private currency mismatch into a standard sovereign debt model. The model demonstrates how the currency composition of corporate borrowing affects the sovereign’s incentive to inflate or default in times of fiscal stress. Reductions in the share of private external debt in foreign currency can lead to significant reductions in sovereign default risk. A calibration of the model generates the empirical patterns of currency and credit risk in <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> sovereign debt documented in Du and Schreger (2015) ...|$|R

40|$|I {{found that}} during booming years {{national}} policy makers were strongly constrained to decrease or effectively manage {{the risks of}} unhedged foreign currency lending (FCL) to households due to the economic characteristics of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Strong FCL growth was mainly driven by private sector consumption and investment. Foreign banking groups easily intermediated international financing into open CEE markets. International measures, which could have limited FCL, were not taken. I found an inconsistency: FCL was primarily a result of macroeconomic imbalances, but macroeconomic policies mostly proved inefficient to downsize it. Administrative measures {{seemed to be the}} most effective, however, only for a short period due to the high degree of financial liberalisation. Regulatory measures proved less efficient, while relatively frequently used supervisory actions did not have any notable effects. Financial education, moral suasion, and market development measures (with the exception of long-term, fixed rate <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> (LC) housing <b>finance)</b> were not efficient at all. Out of 12 investigated countries 6 had some success to limit FCL. Others did not have any efficient policy mix.

40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} {{risk mitigation}} {{is a key}} task in Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects in emerging markets. The economic foreign exchange (FX) exposure exists because PPP projects typically sell their outputs domestically and generate revenues in <b>local</b> <b>currency,</b> while their <b>financing</b> costs and O&M costs are denominated in hard currencies. Governments frequently implement risk mitigation instruments (RMIs) to compensate FX loss. However {{the value of a}} RMI depends on the affordability and the willingness of the government to compensate unforeseen FX fluctuation. Therefore the overall objective in this paper is to analyze possible RMIs and to design a methodology to value RMIs by simulating country risk. The paper aims to establish a foreign exchange exposure model to analyse the value of a RMI. Acting as an assessment system, the model includes a country reliability risk (CRR) index. The CRR index is developed and simulated in a Conditional Credit Rating Transition Matrix (CCRTM). The methodology is illustrated in a case study of a PPP power plant in South East Asia. As a result, the model can be used to calculate economic FX exposure on selected risk mitigating instruments, to allocate capital, and to evaluate selected RMIs. Similarly, it can also help sponsors to apply financial strategies and to estimate the necessary FX protection in PPP infrastructure projects...|$|R

40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>currency</b> debt {{represents}} {{the bulk of}} emerging market sovereign borrowing and a rapidly growing share of foreign holding of emerging market debt. We introduce a new measure of sovereign risk based on <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> debt, the <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> credit spread, defined as the yield spread of a <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> bond over the <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> risk-free rate implied from cross currency swaps. From a dollar investor’s perspective, this measure gives the synthetic dollar spread on holding a <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> bond after fully hedging the currency risk of promised cash flows. Compared with the traditional measure of sovereign risk based on credit spreads on foreign currency denominated debt, we find that <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> credit spreads have lower means, are less correlated across countries and less sensitive to global risk factors. We develop a model of partially segmented domestic and external sovereign debt markets and test the model’s differential predictions for the risk premium and the term structure of credit spreads on {{the two types of}} debt.

Based on a sample of 13 Asia-Pacific countries, we find that the characteristics of foreign currency bonds issued by residents and <b>local</b> <b>currency</b> bonds issued by non-residents differ in ways that are consistent with these issuers overcoming market limitations and arbitraging cost differentials.
