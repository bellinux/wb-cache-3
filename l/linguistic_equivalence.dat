40|$|Various {{scholars}} from different {{schools of thought}} have proposed criteria and/ or models or translation assessment. Surprisingly, almost {{none of them are}} tai­lor-made for a manageable summative evaluation of student translation. That is why most translation teachers still draw on holistic and traditional methods of translation evaluation in their exams. These methods are either too holistic or too detailed (and complex) for translation evaluation purposes in educational settings. The holistic approaches that verge on subjectivity are quite managea­ble for a teacher who is to evaluate of a score of students, whereas the detailed and quantitative models, which are highly demanding on the limited resources of a classroom teacher, are considered highly objective. Feeling the need for a model, which is both manageable and objective, this study aims at reaching a compromise between the subjectivity and the complexity of these approaches to translation evaluation. Our proposed model draws on and combines the five <b>linguistic</b> <b>equivalences</b> introduced by Koller (1979) and the five-leveled holistic scheme for translation evaluation proposed by Waddington (2001) ...|$|R

40|$|As {{the task}} of the {{translator}} is still at times summoned under the conventional notion that it is constrained by purely <b>linguistic</b> and <b>equivalence</b> based methodologies, this study intends to address this misconception by proposing dethronement and divorcement as translation approaches. The intention is herein to examine these approaches from a legal translator’s perspective by focusing particularly on texts belonging to Common Law and Civil Law Tradition legal systems currently in place in English and Spanish speaking countries. The effect of each approach and how the overall translation function is fulfilled is delved into thus producing results that set these two approaches apart. Consequently, dethronement is proposed as the optimum translation approach to be applied in order to bridge the gap in the field of legal translation. According to the criteria established for dethronement and divorcement reliant on the various translation theories that served as a basis for this study, dethronement proves to supersede divorcement in bridging the gap between the target text recipient and the foreign, judicial realm at stake. Dethronement succeeds in mirroring the effect of the source text while fulfilling the overall translation process function. It manages to bring the reader closer to the source text by emphasizing its foreign peculiarities. Nevertheless, dethronement, despite the shift of importance from the source text to the target text, respects the source text’s legal considerations that must at all times prevail. In the end, the intention is to provide new grounds for research in Translation Studies to adapt similar approaches as dethronement and divorcement whether it is to bridge the gap or to duplicate the world in an effort to fulfill the function translation is meant to achieve...|$|R

40|$|Background: Assessed {{dimensions}} of {{low back pain}} (LBP) vary in prevalence studies. This may explain the heterogeneity in frequency estimates. To standardize definitions of LBP, an English consensus with 28 experts from 12 countries developed the “Delphi Definitions of Low Back Pain Prevalence ” (DOLBaPP). The optimal definition and the shorter minimal definition with the related questionnaires for online, paper, and face-to-face use and telephone surveys are suitable for population-based studies. The definitions have to be adapted to different languages and cultures to provide comparable frequency estimates. The objective was to culturally adapt and pre-test the English definitions and corresponding Delphi DOLBaPP questionnaire forms into German.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{awareness}} in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) that research into some of the outstanding questions on language development is contingent upon the use of appropriate corpora (Housen & Kuiken, 2009; Larsen-Freeman, 2009; Verspoor et al., 2011; Verspoor et al., 2012; Vyatkina 2012). Previous studies in SLA have too often relied on cross-sectional corpora and are frequently biased towards English (Myles, 2005). Whereas cross-sectional corpora rely on group means to approximate developmental trajectories, longitudinal corpora allow for a more direct examination of linguistic development.

On the other hand, irony {{is so hard to}} define because it always seems to include some type of subjective feeling. In this respect, issues involved in translating irony present a great challenge to theatre translators. This paper employs the pragmatic approach and translation strategies to analyze irony examples in Sunrise. According to the findings, the context is vital for the understanding of irony in all examples. Victims and audiences’ knowledge and ideologies also influence their abilities to recognize irony. Literal translation strategy is most frequently used to translate irony examples in Sunrise. The context and relevant knowledge of the source language’s culture is important for the translator and target audiences to understand the ST’s irony.

We performed cross-cultural {{adaptation of the}} DASH to Swedish, using a process that included double forward and backward translations, expert and lay review, as well as field-testing to achieve <b>linguistic</b> and conceptual <b>equivalence.</b> The Swedish version's reliability and validity were then evaluated in 176 patients with upper-extremity conditions. The patients completed the DASH and SF- 12 generic health questionnaire before elective surgery or physical therapy. Internal consistency of the DASH was high (Cronbach alpha 0. 96). Test-retest reliability, evaluated in a subgroup of 67 patients who completed the DASH on two occasions, with a median interval of 7 days, was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0. 92). Construct validity was shown by a positive correlation of DASH scores with the SF- 12 scores (worse upper-extremity disability correlating with worse general health), stronger correlation with the SF- 12 physical than with the mental health component, correlation of worse DASH scores with worse self-rated global health, and ability to discriminate among conditions known to differ in severity. The Swedish version of the DASH is a reliable and valid instrument that can provide a standardized measure of patient-centered outcomes in upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions...|$|R
50|$|In spatial {{comparative}} {{election campaign}} communication research “comparability {{and the maintenance}} of equivalence {{can be seen as the}} major problems”. Research objects are not always equivalent, since they are integrated into different culture-specific contexts (e.g. in “social, political, economic, legal, and media contexts”). To conduct comparative research the regarded objects, e.g. newspaper reports on election campaigning, have to be at least equivalent in their functionality. Functional equivalence of the research objects should be tested on different levels of analysis, i.e. on the level of the construct (construct equivalence), on the item level (item equivalence) and on the level of the method (method equivalence). Item equivalence, e.g., refers to equally verbalizing items in a survey, i.e. exact culture-specific wording in questionnaires. To avoid item bias questionnaires need to be pretested, e.g. by using a translation procedure to deal with <b>linguistic</b> diversity. Construct <b>equivalence</b> does exist, if the object of investigation is equivalently embedded into the higher system level in all countries. Method equivalence summarizes three further levels of equivalence: sample equivalence, instrument equivalence, and administration equivalence. If the units of analysis or interview partners, e.g. campaign consultants, are equivalently selected in every considered country, sample equivalence exists. One aspect of instrument equivalence, e.g., refers to whether participants in an online survey are familiar with using computers and filling in online questionnaires. Administration equivalence, e.g., refers to attitudes of interviewers, not varying culture-specifically in a survey, which would lead to culture-specific statements.|$|R
40|$|The few {{psychological}} assessment measures commercially {{available for the}} assessment of Spanish-speaking populations lack empirical foundation (Fernandez et al., 2007). This is concerning given the rising numbers of Spanish speakers entering the forensic/correctional systems for whom valid assessment is difficult without appropriate measures. In this study, the Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST; Miller, 2001) was translated and adapted into Spanish, with permission from the test publisher. The general purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the psychometric, <b>linguistic,</b> and conceptual <b>equivalence</b> of the English and Spanish language versions of the M-FAST in a sample of 102 bilingual Hispanic incarcerated men. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions (honest, uncoached, or coached) and completed the M-FAST in both English and Spanish on two separate occasions. Psychometrically, identical alpha coefficients were found for the English and Spanish M-FAST total scores (α =. 97). Across language versions, uncoached participants obtained significantly higher scores than honest and coached responders. Similarly, coached participants scored significantly higher than genuine responders. Overall, very large effect sizes were observed on the total scores of the English (eta-squared =. 87) and Spanish (eta-squared =. 87) language versions. A cutoff score of total ≥ 5 generated optimal utility rates, with the English and Spanish versions of the M-FAST correctly classifying 94 % and 93 % of the sample, respectively. Concerning language equivalence, significant correlations were found between English and Spanish M-FAST total scores. The ability of the Spanish M-FAST to discriminate feigners from honest responders, as well as the high correlations indicative of language equivalence, suggest that both language versions are conceptually equivalent. Acculturation did not significantly influence total scores on either language version. Together, the results indicated that both language versions of the M-FAST are highly similar. If used appropriately in conjunction with multiple sources of information, then the Spanish M-FAST can assist in the determination of malingering among bilingual/bicultural populations. This is significant given the increasing numbers of Hispanic inmates entering correctional settings, the high prevalence of mental illness among inmates, and the limited amount of resources typically available to correctional practitioners...|$|R
