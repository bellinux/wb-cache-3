50|$|Ocean racing surf skis {{differ from}} spec skis {{in that they}} are longer, have sharply pointed bows and under stern rudders. The front of the modern lifesaving type surf ski is often flared to prevent nose diving on {{returning}} to shore when surfing down large steep waves. Ocean racing surf skis are also usually longer than long distance racing kayaks; they have more <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> (rocker); they typically have less transverse primary and secondary stability but more longitudinal stability because the paddler is seated more towards the centre of the craft to enhance wave riding ability. An ocean racing surf ski must have enough volume in the bow to provide buoyancy when punching through surf, a long waterline to make use of ocean swells, a sleek, narrow shape to reduce water resistance, as well as enough stability to make paddling in rough conditions feasible.|$|E
5000|$|Xenastrapotherium is an extinct genus of astrapothere, {{a type of}} hoofed herbivorous mammal, {{native to}} South America, which lived in the mid-Miocene period, during the Laventan stage. It {{is a member of}} the family Astrapotheriidae in the {{subfamily}} Uruguaytheriinae, large astrapotheres, equipped with a trunk-like nose and protruding teeth, similar to the elephants, but their tusks were the canine teeth, not the incisors. Xenastrapotherium (named after the Greek word xenos [...] "strange" [...] add to the genus Astrapotherium, [...] "lightning beast") was a genus widely distributed in northern South America, in contrast to other species of astrapotheres which lived in the area of the Southern Cone of the continent. It differed from other astrapotheres by having two lower incisors on each side of the jaw and the tusks have a pronounced <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature,</b> although their general shape and size are probably very similar to Astrapotherium, whose weight would be 900 to 1,500 kilograms, comparable to the current black rhino.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>longitudinal</b> surface <b>curvature</b> on the {{turbulent}} correlations of a supersonic {{turbulent boundary layer}} was studied experimentally in an axisymmetric channel. Upstream of the interaction, the nominal freestream Mach number was 3. 78, the Reynolds number based on boundary layer momentum thickness was 5778, and the boundary layer thickness was 0. 9 cm. For the flow with the <b>longitudinal</b> surface <b>curvature,</b> the overall turning angle was approximately 10. 2 degrees, and maximum delta-j/kappa approximately 0. 09.

The net drag reductions achievable by both riblets and OLDs are noted to be a rather modest 10 percent. Boundary layers exhibit asymmetric response to streamwise surface curvatures, with the response being slower for {{the case of a}} concave than a convex curvature...|$|R
40|$|Although {{surgical}} treatment of nail conditions {{can be traced}} back centuries to the writings of Paul Aegineta (625 – 690 AC), {{little is known about the}} physical laws governing nail growth. Such a poor understanding together with the increasing number of nail salons in the high street should raise legitimate concerns regarding the different procedures applied to nails. An understanding of the physics of nail growth is therefore essential to engage with human medicine and to understand the aetiology of nail conditions. In this context, a theory of nail plate adhesion, including a physical description of nail growth can be used to determine the transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> of the nail plate that are so important in the physical diagnosis of some nail conditions. As a result physics sheds light on: (a) why/how nails/hooves adhere strongly, yet grow smoothly; (b) why hoof/claw/nail growth rates are similar across species; (c) potential nail damage incurred by poor trimming; (d) the connection between three previously unrelated nail conditions, i. e. spoon-shaped, pincer and ingrown nails and; last but not least, (e) why ingrown nails occur preferentially in the big toes...|$|R

The major effect of curved ducts on the fluid flow involves the strong secondary flow due to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> in the geometry [7 – 9]. The presence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> generates centrifugal force (which is perpendicular to the main flow along the axis) and produces so-called secondary flow on the cross sections of ducts...|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental investigation of circulation control on a circular cylinder {{by means of}} tangential blowing (Coanda effect) is presented. The analytical method developed has also been used to estimate the blowing coefficients required for achieving potential flow on airfoils with flaps. The analysis is presented for conditions for which the flow in the boundary layer ahead of the jet exit is turbulent. The turbulent boundary layer and the jet layer on the upper surface, and the turbulent boundary layer on the lower surface are computed by a multi-strip integral method. The region of integration is between the correponding transition and separation points on each surface. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> effects, which {{give rise to a}} radial pressure gradient across the jet layer and to an additional adverse tangential pressure gradient just upstream of the separation point, are included in the jet layer analysis in an approximate manner.

40|$|Three {{areas are}} discussed: oscillatory <b>{{longitudinal}}</b> <b>curvature,</b> large eddy breakup devices, and small longitudinal surface striations. The first two concepts produced sizable local turbulent skin friction reductions, but {{further research is}} required to optimize the effect, reduce parasitic device drag, and provide a net increase in vehicle performance.

From this survey several methods have been identified with potential for altering the turbulence production process in the outer region of the boundary layer and reducing the turbulent skin-friction drag over relatively long downstream distances; these include convex <b>longitudinal</b> surface <b>curvature,</b> large-eddy breakup devices, and Emmons spot alteration.

The basic partial differential equations for the problem, derived by {{the method of}} matched asymptotic expansions, are found to possess similarity solutions {{for a family of}} surface curvatures and pressure gradients. The similarity equations obtained by this anaylsis have been solved numerically on a computer, and show a definite decrease in skin friction when the surface has convex curvature in all cases including zero pressure gradient.

We maintain coherence at high momentum separation due {{to both the}} transverse confinement provided by the guide, and our use of optical delta-kick cooling on our cold-atom cloud.

Laser Doppler velocimetry {{was used to}} measure the mean velocity components, turbulence levels and shear stresses. The boundary layers at the inlet and exit of the transition were approximately 13 percent and 20 percent of the hydraulic diameter respectively, becoming thicker near the corner fillets. The development of secondary flow, of magnitudes up to 7 percent of the bulk velocity is shown.

The influence of the middle curve and {{the magnitude of the}} roll gap on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> of formed parts is investigated. Wrinkling {{is one of the most}} important defects for the formed parts in continuous roll forming process. A simplified model was established for analyzing the wrinkling of saddle-shaped part and torus-shaped part.

40|$|When tubular {{members are}} in bending, {{they tend to}} flatten towards the axis of bending, thus {{reducing}} their second moment of area. Eventually, a limit point is reached whereupon the initial stability {{of the system is}} lost and unstable equilibrium prevails, thus reducing the load carrying capacity of the member. This effect was originally described by Brazier (1927) for circular tubular members. In the present study, the analysis of Brazier is adapted for elliptical hollow section members, taking into account the additional geometric complexities inherent in ellipses. An analytical method is presented whereby the initial geometry and the displacement functions of the system are replaced by Fourier series, thus reducing the analytical complexity of the problem. After formulating the potential energy functional, use of a variational method allows for the amplitudes of the constituent harmonics of the Fourier approximations of the displacement functions to be solved for, providing estimates of the deformed geometry of the cross-section and the associated moment. In keeping with the analogy of Brazier for circular sections, a limit point is observed. These analytical predictions are then compared with the results of a complementary finite element analysis, whereupon it is found that for smaller <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvatures</b> there is close agreement between the analytical and numerical methods. For larger curvatures and moments beyond the limit point some divergence is observed between the predictions of the two methods, which {{can be attributed to the}} lower-order approximations assumed in formulating the potential energy functional in the analytical metho...|$|R

The program can generate laminar initial conditions such as Falkner-Skan similarity solutions (so that initial wedge flows can be simulated including Blasius or stagnation point flow) or approximate equilibrium turbulent profiles. Alternatively, initial profile input data can be utilized...|$|R

The beams {{of two of the}} derived forms were made {{the same as that of}} the parent and the lengths changed by increasing and decreasing the spacing of stations. The lengths of the two others of the derived forms were made the same as that of the parent while the beams were changed by increasing and decreasing the spacing of buttocks, all other widths being changed in proportion. The remaining derived form has the same length and beam as the parent, but the lines of the forebody were altered to give a planing bottom with no <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> forward of the step. The test data were analyzed to determine the minimum resistance and the angle at which it occurs for all speeds and loads. The results of this analysis are given in the form of non dimensional curves for each model. The effect of variation in over-all size, as indicated by a "complete" test on any given hull, is pointed out. The effect of changing length alone by the spacing of buttocks, as well as the effects of the changes in length-beam ratio and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>curvature</b> that result from these operations are discussed.

However, for small curvature, only the coupling of quasi-modes with a neighbouring poloidal wave number remains in first order. In addition, the quasi-mode frequencies are unchanged up to first order in the curvature. The imaginary part of the frequency, however, does change in first order, and quasi-modes are slightly more damped in realistically curved coronal loop configurations. status: publishe...|$|E

The symmetric geometry provides a much lower magnetic field curvature per fixed length that promises longer coherence time for atom interferometers. A double-tape design of each coil allows a smooth translation of guided atoms without addition of an external bias field.
