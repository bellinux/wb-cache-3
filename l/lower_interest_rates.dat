5|$|The {{government}} took majority {{control of the}} company after the election of its new board on 10 November 2009. In January 2010, when accumulated losses already exceeded NT$70billion, THSRC signed a government-guaranteed refinancing deal in which eight government-dominated banks provided NT$382billion at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and longer maturity. The government also approved the company's new variable depreciation charge.|$|E
5|$|The state faced a $400million revenue {{shortfall}} when Jones took office. Shortly after his election, Jones created the Quality and Efficiency Commission to study ways to streamline state government. Among the enacted recommendations were refinancing state bonds at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> cutting the state workforce by 2,000 employees (mostly through attrition), and spurring local economic growth through tax incentives. By {{the end of}} Jones' term, the state enjoyed a $300million budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> after FairTax passage.|$|E
50|$|Example: An {{lowering}} {{of the federal}} funds target would shift the MP curve leftwards, resulting in a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> and higher inflation. This <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> results in a downward movement along the IS curve, increased output.|$|R

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> than was historically {{the case when}} denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden. THSRC signed a NT$382 billion refinancing contract with a consortium of 8 domestic banks led by Bank of Taiwan in January, 2010; and utilized the new loan {{to pay off the}} previous syndicated loan which with higher interest. As of 30 June 2011, the long-term debts totaling NT$385 billion include NT$26 billion corporate bonds and NT$359 billion bank loans. In comparison with the terms and conditions of previous loans, the newly signed refinancing debts carried <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and longer tenors up to 22 years. The Company’s financial burden is therefore largely reduced.|$|E
25|$|Stimulus may {{increase}} {{the rate of inflation}} or <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which helps debtors (mainly the middle and lower classes) while hurting creditors (mainly the wealthy), as they are paid back with cheaper dollars or through lower variable rate loans.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{early in}} 1932 with {{positive}} results, it raised <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> again in late 1932, causing a further {{collapse in the}} U.S. economy.|$|R
50|$|Monetary {{stimulus}} {{refers to}} <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> quantitative easing, or {{other ways of}} {{increasing the amount of}} money or credit.|$|R
50|$|The assets {{demand for}} money is {{inversely}} related to the market <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> This is because at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> more people will expect a rise in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (and thus a fall in aftermarket bond prices). As a result, more people will hold their wealth in money rather than bonds, i.e. the speculative balances will be greater at a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> It also depends on investors' aversion to risk, the relative demand for and the supply of other financial assets and real assets, and the change in expectations of the economic climate.|$|R
25|$|Countries that {{abandoned}} the gold standard, allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their Balance of payments to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{and act as}} lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} {{districts are}} used to provide local government services (mostly zoning, building inspection, etc.) to unincorporated areas, sub-regional services (e.g. street bridge over a border) between two or more members, regional parks, and regional services (e.g. funding the regional hospital district) required for the entire area. Also, {{as a collection of}} municipalities they are able to borrow funds for capital projects at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second {{criticism}} is that savings represent loanable funds, particularly at banks, assuming the savings are held at banks, rather than currency itself being held ("stashed under one's mattress"). Thus {{an accumulation of}} savings yields an increase in potential lending, which will <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and stimulate borrowing. So a decline in consumer spending is offset {{by an increase in}} lending, and subsequent investment and spending.|$|E
50|$|A lien {{issued in}} error of state law is repaid, but usually at a far <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> than had the lien been valid.|$|R

5000|$|Banks: Banks can tend {{to change}} the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> to either slow down or speed up economy growth. This {{involves}} either raising <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to slow the economy down, or <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to promote economic growth.|$|R
25|$|Advocates of BAPCPA {{claimed that}} its passage would reduce losses to {{creditors}} such as credit card companies, {{and that those}} creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers {{in the form of}} <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Critics assert that these claims turned out to be false, observing that although credit card company losses decreased after passage of the Act, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.|$|E
25|$|The issuers of the {{obligations}} or securities may be companies, special purpose entities, {{state or local}} governments, non-profit organizations, or sovereign nations. A credit rating facilitates the trading of securities on a secondary market. It affects the interest rate that a security pays out, with higher ratings leading to <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Individual consumers are rated for creditworthiness not by credit rating agencies but by credit bureaus (also called consumer reporting agencies or credit reference agencies), which issue credit scores.|$|E
25|$|Effects on the {{quantity}} of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the third}} party {{is dealing with}} a lender who uses risk-based pricing, then their artificially {{inflated}} credit score may translate into a substantially <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
25|$|Banks can {{be assured}} that Fannie and Freddie have funds to {{purchase}} conforming loans, so they can increase such lending. This improves liquidity in the mortgage market, <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{platinum}} {{credit card}} {{has a higher}} credit limit and a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> than a regular credit card; it is only available to someone with a good credit rating.|$|R
25|$|These {{gains were}} {{not just a matter}} of renewed access on {{favorable}} terms to the Iberian market, or greater efficiency. Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations). The combination of these factors enticed Iberian wool exporters to opt for the Dutch market, and allowed Dutch merchants to prefinance Spanish dyestuff exports (like they also prefinanced Baltic grain exports and French wine exports).|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} {{was the primary}} transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Under the {{gold standard}}'s price–specie flow mechanism, countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Krugman {{repeatedly}} criticized the Bush tax cuts, {{both before and}} after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening income distribution in the US. Krugman advocated <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit. In addition, he was against Bush's proposal to privatize social security.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the central}} bank has <b>lowered</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to zero, {{it can no longer}} further stimulate demand by <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> This is the famous {{liquidity}} trap. When deflation takes hold, it requires [...] "special arrangements" [...] to lend money at a zero nominal <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> (which could still be a very high real <b>rate</b> of <b>interest,</b> due to the negative inflation rate) in order to artificially increase the money supply.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Rev. John E. Massey (Parson Massey) and Harrison H. Riddleberger, populists {{representing}} heavily taxed {{farmers in}} the state's Piedmont and northwestern regions, proposed to reorganize the state's debt at a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
25|$|Under {{the gold}} standard, the United States kept the Dollar {{convertible}} to gold. The Federal Reserve {{would have had}} to execute an expansionary monetary policy to fight the deflation and to inject liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling—but <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> would have led to a gold outflow. Under the gold standards price–specie flow mechanism countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation). As long as the Federal Reserve had to defend the gold parity of the Dollar it had to sit idle while the banking system crumbled.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomplete}} {{success in}} stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which would favor increased investment, depreciation {{of the currency}} to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation {{and the fear of}} accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over the question of {{what to do about the}} exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.|$|E
25|$|When the Depression {{struck in}} 1930, the Scullin {{government}} split over its response. Lyons became the leading advocate {{within the government}} of orthodox finance and deflationary economic policies, and an opponent of the inflationary, proto-Keynesian policies of Treasurer Ted Theodore. Theodore {{was forced to resign}} over accusations of corruption in June 1930, and Scullin took over the Treasury portfolio in addition to the Prime Ministership. Lyons served as acting Treasurer from August 1930 to January 1931 while Scullin was in Britain for the Imperial Conference. In October 1930 Lyons announced his plan for recovery, insisting on the need to maintain a balanced budget and cut public spending and salaries, although also advising <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and the provision of greater credit for industry.|$|E
50|$|For instance, {{suppose the}} current {{prevailing}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is 6%, and {{the property was}} purchased for $500,000. The borrower puts down $100,000 {{and takes out a}} mortgage of $400,000 amortized over 30 years. The lender and the borrower agree to a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of 5%, and to a contingent interest of 20% of appreciated value of the property. Because of the <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> the monthly payment is reduced from $2,398 to $2,147. However, this saving in monthly payments comes with a trade-off. Suppose the property is later sold for $700,000. Because of the agreement on the contingent interest, the borrower must pay the lender 20% of the profit, namely, $40,000.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, the Taj Mahal {{went through}} a {{prepackaged}} bankruptcy, resulting in Trump giving a 50 {{percent stake in the}} business to its bondholders in exchange for <b>lowered</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and a longer payoff schedule.|$|R
5000|$|In economics, {{stimulus}} {{refers to}} attempts to use monetary or fiscal policy (or stabilization policy in general) {{to stimulate the}} economy. Stimulus can also refer to monetary policies like <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and quantitative easing.|$|R
