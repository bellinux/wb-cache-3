5|$|Julien (Radziwilowicz) is {{a middle-aged}} clockmaker who lives {{alone with his}} cat in a large house in the Paris suburbs. Julien is blackmailing 'Madame X' (Brochet) who is {{importing}} fake antique Chinese silks, and may have murdered her sister. By chance, he meets Marie (Béart), {{a beautiful young woman}} he <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> a year ago, and they begin a passionate relationship. Though elusive, Marie agrees to move in with him; she acts strangely at times and appears absent. A mystery connects Marie to Madame X's dead sister and in uncovering Marie's secret Julien risks losing her. The film is separated into four parts, named to reflect the narrative perspective.|$|E
5|$|Laurer had a {{strained}} {{relationship with her}} family. She <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> her mother {{at the age of}} 16, and she claimed that her father was never able to get over her decision not to pursue a career in law enforcement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She also alleged that her father took out several student loans in her name without her knowledge, leaving her with $40,000 in debt. On an episode of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew in 2008, Laurer claimed to have a bad relationship with all of her family members, including her siblings. In September 2010, Laurer was hospitalized after overdosing on sleeping medication. As of February 2015, Laurer had re-established a good relationship with her mother; her father died in May 2014.|$|E

5|$|The T-26 and BT {{were the}} main tanks of the Red Army's {{armoured}} forces during the interwar period. The T-26 {{was the most important}} tank of the Spanish Civil War and played a significant role during the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, {{as well as in the}} Winter War in 1939–40. Though nearly obsolete by the beginning of World War II, the T-26 was the most numerous tank in the Red Army's armoured force during the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The T-26 fought the Germans and their allies during the Battle of Moscow in 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus in 1942–1943; some tank units of the Leningrad Front used their T-26s until 1944. Soviet T-26 light tanks <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> use in August 1945, during the defeat of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Ethel & Millie then {{abandoned}} their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion {{at the time was}} that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.|$|E
5|$|The graphic {{novel was}} the first Batman story to be written by Morrison before {{becoming}} a regular writer in future Batman titles. Inspired by previous works like The Dark Knight Returns, Morrison conceived the story to be his own different approach to the character, using heavy symbolical references and the deconstruction of many iconic Batman villains. The story follows the vigilante Batman, who is called upon to quell a maddening riot {{taking place in the}} infamous Arkham Asylum, a psychiatric hospital housing the most dangerous supervillains in Gotham City. Inside, Batman confronts many of his enduring rogues gallery, such as the Joker, Two-Face, and Killer Croc, many of them having changed since he <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> them. As Batman ventures deeper, he discovers the origin of how the asylum was established, the history of its builder Amadeus Arkham, and the supernatural and psychological mystery that has been haunting the area.|$|E

25|$|Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa {{were thus}} hemmed in and {{looking down the}} barrels of the British guns when Bam Shah’s letter arrived, announcing the fall of Almora. Although the old {{commander}} was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> the hopelessness of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh.

He returned to Montreal in June 2009, after Federal Court justice Russel Zinn ruled that the Canadian government must cease violating his rights by failing to facilitate his return.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March he {{accompanied}} LaRouche {{members to}} Frankfurt {{to hand out}} LaRouche literature in the streets, then to see the Rembrandt collection at the Städel museum. When one member asked {{what he thought of}} it, he started crying. The woman invited him to step outside for some air. He kept repeating that he did not trust LaRouche, and said he {{wanted to go back to}} England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30pm.|$|E
25|$|Paul Wilson, {{chair of}} the Department of Criminology at Bond University, headed a pro bono team of lawyers making appeals on Stafford's behalf. Graeme Crowley, a private {{investigator}} and former police officer, led {{an investigation into the}} murder. Investigation revealed a possible sighting of Holland alive the day after Stafford said that he <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> her, other unsolved murders in the neighborhood, and two potential suspects not interviewed by police, one of them a mentally ill resident of a nearby caravan park who was found guilty of murdering another girl, Julie-Ann Lowe, a few weeks after Holland's killing. The DNA expert who had testified at the trial, Angela van Daal, also provided a statement that she believed the blood evidence inadequate for a conviction. With Wilson, Crowley published Who Killed Leanne? in 2005, and the investigation was featured on the ABC network series Australian Story in August 2007.|$|E

25|$|Santa Rosa Junior College art student Kim Wendy Allen, 19, {{was given}} a ride by two men on March 4, 1972, from her job at Larkspur Natural Foods to San Rafael. They <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> her at {{approximately}} 5:20 pm hitchhiking to school near the Bell Avenue entrance to Highway 101, northbound, carrying a large wooden soy barrel with red Chinese characters on it. Her body was found the following day down an embankment in a creek bed twenty feet off Enterprise Road in Santa Rosa. The victim had been bound at the ankles and wrists, raped and slowly strangled with a cord for an estimated thirty minutes. Semen was recovered from the body and a single gold loop earring was found at the site. Markings {{at the top of}} the embankment and a possible leg impression in the loam indicated the assailant likely slipped or fell while throwing or transporting the body. The two men who gave her a ride, one of whom {{was given a}}nd passed a polygraph test, were ruled out as suspects.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February Lark {{was still}} in company with the two guarda costas when they {{encountered}} two gunboats and an armed schooner escorting a Spanish convoy of several small market boats. Lark was able to drive the vessels of the convoy ashore, but the escorts took refuge under the guns of a 4-gun battery in a creek in Bahia Cispata, Colombia. Lark silenced the battery. Nicholas then took his entire crew, less the 20 men he left to guard the two guarda costas, {{and put them in}} boats with the aim of capturing the gunboats and the armed schooner. The Spanish gunboats rowed towards the British boats but then retreated as the British drew nearer. Nicholas and three of his men then were wounded while they were capturing the rearmost vessel, a gun boat with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. Later, Lark had three more men wounded in the continuing action. Nicholas then attempted to pursue the remaining Spanish vessels up a creek but while {{he was trying to do}} so, the pilot ran Postillon and Carmen ashore. This forced Nicholas to order their prize crews to burn them, which they did. Postillion blew up and Carmen was solidly aflame when the British <b>last</b> <b>saw</b> her.|$|E
