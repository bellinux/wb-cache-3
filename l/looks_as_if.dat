5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E
25|$|The 'pseudoscope' (Wheatstone {{coined the}} term from the Greek ψευδίς σκοπειν) was {{introduced}} in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope, since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust {{appears to be a}} mask, and a tree growing outside of a window <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were growing inside the room. Its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology.|$|E

25|$|Superficially, {{the ceiling}} is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman {{dimension}} and, {{in the case}} of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} {{used to construct}} the church are of importance {{in the history of}} construction in Puerto Rico. Reinforced concrete, the principal material, was seldom, if at all, used at this early date in Puerto Rico. Contemporary concrete buildings exhibited a lack of understanding of the then-new material, evidenced by extremely thick walls and excessive use of iron beams (traditional means of construction were applied to modern materials). These characteristics are not found in the construction of this building. Nechodoma used the concrete in an elegant and even decorative fashion, demonstrating his knowledge of North-American construction techniques and his distance from the local building customs. The building <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is made of stone and not concrete.|$|E
25|$|Weta can bite with {{powerful}} mandibles. Tree weta bites are painful but not particularly common. Weta can inflict painful scratches, {{with the potential}} of infection, but their defence displays consist of looking large and spiky, and they will retreat if given a chance. Tree weta arc their hind legs into the air in warning to foes, and then strike downwards, so the spines could scratch {{the eyes of a}} predator. Pegs or ridges {{at the base of the}} abdomen are struck by a patch of fine pegs at the base (inner surface) of the legs and this action makes a distinctive sound. These actions are also used in defence of a gallery by competing males. The female weta <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she has a stinger, but it is an ovipositor, which enables her to lay eggs inside rotting wood or mossy wood or soil. Some species of Hemiandrus have very short ovipositors, related perhaps to their burrowing into soil and laying their eggs in a special chamber at the end of the burrow.|$|E

Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since {{returning}} from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her {{what would happen if}} there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E

500|$|Like other baboons, {{the olive}} baboon has an elongated, dog-like muzzle. In fact, {{along with the}} muzzle, the animal's tail (...) and four-legged gait can make baboons seem very canine. The tail almost <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is broken, as it is erect for the first quarter, after which it drops down sharply. The bare patch of a baboon's rump, famously seen in {{cartoons}} and movies, {{is a good deal}} smaller in the olive baboon. The olive baboon, like most cercopithecines, has a cheek pouch with which to store food.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she might take {{a bite out of}} the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|According to the New York Post critic, Elisabeth Vincentelli, {{the show}} {{improved}} with its transfer from Off-Broadway to Broadway, especially Weaver's performance, which Vincentelli deemed the weakest. Weaver portrayed {{a movie star}} who was [...] "overindulgent, self-centered, and unaware she’s on the decline." [...] Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post suggested Durang, with whom Weaver graduated from the Yale School of Drama in 1974, may have written the role for her. Both Hyde Pierce and Nielsen exhibited mastery of their monologues, according to Vincentelli: [...] " [...] Hyde Pierce {{is a master of}} the slow burn, while Nielsen’s wild-eyed Sonia often <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her train of thought has a loose caboose." [...] Vincentelli also noted that Weaver's character had [...] "turned her life into a performance." ...|$|E

500|$|Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E
500|$|The rabbi's {{defenders}} strongly {{objected to}} the decision. His primary supporter, synagogue vice president Louis Jackson, who had broken the story to the press, described the congregation as a [...] "collection of jackasses", with the [...] "chief jackass" [...] being the president Louis Schwartz, who Jackson accused of eating ham himself, and of stealing from the synagogue's charity boxes. Jackson was expelled from the congregation, and subsequently convicted of libel and fined $100 (today $) for making the accusations, while Rosenberg sued the synagogue for his salary. Rosenberg died of pneumonia in April 1893, {{at the age of}} 43, his [...] "health and spirits", according to a contemporary New York Times report, [...] "broken" [...] by the expulsion. At the funeral, Jackson berated the congregation's members, who, he charged, had [...] "hounded, hunted, driven [...] to a grave of misery", and allegedly threatened to kill one of them with a stone taken from the newly dug grave. [...] Charges were again brought against Jackson, but this time were dismissed, with the Justice stating [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were an even thing all around." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} critical acclaim. David Segal from The Washington Post {{noted that the}} [...] "difference between this show and the last, the Drowned World Tour of 2001, was striking. That show seems standoffish compared with this one, in part because Madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits. [...] Madonna {{has created a new}} performance hybrid." [...] Segal's view was shared by Elizabeth Smith from The New York Times who also commented that [...] "Unlike 2001's Drowned World Tour, which was dark, often hostile, Re-Invention returns Madonna to the light. She <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she is having a good time." [...] Edna Gunderson of USA Today gave the concert four out of four stars and said [...] "Madonna seems to be having a jolly good time. Whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth, Reinvention finds Madonna reinvested emotionally. The show doesn't have the degree of flesh, carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered, but this time Madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity." [...] Joshua Klein from Chicago Tribune commented that Madonna's show displayed more spectacle than substance.|$|E

500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she is still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E
500|$|Minority Report is {{a futuristic}} film which portrays {{elements}} of a both dystopian and utopian future. The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick's story. From a stylistic standpoint, Minority Report resembles Spielberg's previous film A.I., but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he [...] "wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. Asphalt Jungle. Key Largo. The Maltese Falcon." [...] The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son's kidnapping at the pool {{is the only one}} shot in [...] "normal" [...] color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film's colors, {{to the point that it}} nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by [...] "about 40%" [...] to achieve the [...] "washed-out" [...] appearance. Elvis Mitchell, formerly of The New York Times, commented that [...] "he picture <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late '70s car." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Hara {{made her}} screen debut in Walter Forde's Kicking the Moon Around (1938), {{although}} she did not consider it {{a part of her}} filmography. Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical My Irish Molly (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film she plays a woman named Eiléen O'Shea who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: [...] "One could argue that O'Hara never looked as enticing as she does in Little Miss Molly, even if she isn't 'Maureen O'Hara' quite yet. She wears no makeup, and there's no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn't mention the film much. It also <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters". Malone added that though the lot was [...] "ham-fisted", it is a [...] "quaint film which O'Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation".|$|E
