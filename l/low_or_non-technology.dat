40|$|Effects of breed, sex {{and diet}} and their {{interactions}} on carcass composition and tissue weight distribution of broiler chickens The effects of breed (Hubbard and Anak), sex and diet ({{two levels of}} protein (high <b>or</b> <b>low)</b> with two levels of crude fiber (<b>low</b> <b>or</b> high) at each level of protein) on carcass composition and distribution of tissues over the carcass were studied. Carcass composition and ratios of muscle: bone, muscle: fat and meat: bone in the carcass {{did not differ significantly}} between breed groups. Male carcasses had more muscle, more bone, more fat-free carcass, higher ratios of muscle: bone, muscle: fat but less fat, less meat and lower meat: bone ratio than female carcasses. Carcasses of chicks fed high protein (with either <b>low</b> <b>or</b> high fiber) diet had more muscle than carcasses of chicks fed low protein (with either <b>low</b> <b>or</b> high fiber) diet. Carcasses of chicks fed high fiber (with either <b>low</b> <b>or</b> high protein) diet had more bone but less meat than carcasses of chicks fed low fiber (with either <b>low</b> <b>or</b> high protein) diet. Increasing both protein and fiber in the diet resulted in lowering carcass fat, consequently raising muscle: fat ratio. Breed and sex did not influence the distribution of muscle and meat throughout the carcass parts. Breed differences in fat weight distribution were not significant. Anak had significantly higher proportions of bone i...|$|R
