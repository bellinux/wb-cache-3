This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.|$|E

These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants.

Some critics regarded Stanford, together with Hubert Parry and Alexander Mackenzie, as responsible for a renaissance in music from the British Isles. However, after his conspicuous success as a composer in the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> of the 19th century, his music was eclipsed in the 20th century by that of Edward Elgar as well as former pupils.|$|E

Also during this time, the Zahiri Revolt, a conspiracy to overthrow Barquq, was discovered at the Citadel.|$|E
