5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance,</b> only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even {{in numbers}} for both sides, the Austrians fielded a significantly larger fighting force of nearly 55,000at Ostrach, with another 60,000stretched along {{a line between}} <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> and Ulm. French casualties amounted to more than 12percent of their force, and Austrian, approximately four percent. The French were forced back to Stockach, where on 25March the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and a decisive Austrian victory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even on both sides, the Austrians had {{a significantly}} larger fighting force, both on the field at Ostrach, and stretched along a line between <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> and Ulm.

The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach, where {{a few days later}} the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and an Austrian victory.|$|E
5|$|But the Three Leagues {{had already}} called upon the Swiss {{for help and}} troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon {{learning}} about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers {{on their way back}} home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the Swiss, the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, Swiss troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance,</b> pillaging and plundering along the way. On February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the battle of Hard on the shores of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other Swiss troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the Swiss retreated after a few days.|$|E

5|$|By 23March, Jourdan had his {{headquarters}} {{in the vicinity of}} Stockach. He had recalled Barthélemy Ferino from the far right flank; Ferino had retreated along the coast of the Überlingen Lake, the northwestern finger of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance,</b> to be in position at the close right flank, adjacent to Souham's division. Lefebvre, wounded at Ostrach, was unable to take the field himself, and Laurent Saint Cyr commanded the left flank. When Jourdan considered his position, he felt it too extended, so he drew back further behind Stockach, toward Engen, where he could concentrate his force. The first division camped near the Hohentwiel, the 11th-century fortress overlooking the marshes at the westernmost point of the <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance.</b> The second division, the advanced guard, and a cavalry division were camped on the heights above Engen. The third division was camped by Leibtengen (Liptingen, the French called it), and Neuhausen. Vandamme and his small corps worked themselves discreetly into a position behind the Austrian right flank. Jourdan established {{his headquarters}} at Engen.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol.

5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front {{to send them to}} the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance.</b> The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E

5|$|An {{attack by}} sea across <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 {{was one of}} the few {{successful}} Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was taken by surprise, the villages plundered and burnt. A much larger attack of an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long and hard battle. Their general Heinrich von Fürstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Anton Graf {{was born}} on 24 October 1912 in Engen {{in what was then}} the Grand Duchy of Baden near <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> and the Swiss border, the son of Wilhelm Graf (1878–1937), a farmer, and his wife Maria, née Sailer (1877–1953). He was the third of three children, with two older brothers, Wilhelm Wilhelm (1904–1981) and Josef Wilhelm (1909–1981). His father fought in and survived World War I as an {{artillery}} soldier, being awarded the Iron Cross. Postwar, the Weimar Inflation crisis of 1923 wiped out virtually all the family savings, and as a result, from a very early age, Graf had to work.|$|E
5|$|Ostrach {{was a small}} village, with a {{population}} of 300. The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance.</b> The village was largely dedicated to farming, although a stretch of the imperial post road connected it and Pfullendorf. A wide, flat plain, marshy in places, stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village; low lying hills ringed the valley, which was creased by a small stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small and, at that time of that year, very soggy valley.|$|E

Adalbert had holdings from his great-grandmother’s inheritance in the Nahegau, among which was Dill. Adalbert’s daughter Mechtild von Mörsberg wed Menginhard von Sponheim, thus bringing Dill into the County of Sponheim.|$|R

5|$|The Army of the Danube {{advanced}} on Pfullendorf and Ostrach, {{the former}} an imperial city in Upper (southern) Swabia, {{and the latter}} a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance.</b> Jourdan's objective was simple and direct: cut the Austrian line at {{the border of the}} southwestern German states and Switzerland, preventing the Coalition's use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. Isolation of the two theaters would prevent the Austrians from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use these routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube {{crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little {{resistance}} as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking {{position on the}} north shore of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance.</b> Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|Jourdan's {{orders were}} to take the army into Germany and secure {{strategic}} positions, particularly on the roads through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the western-most border of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance.</b> Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia, André Masséna would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above Feldkirch, particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around Zürich and Winterthur. These positions would prevent the Allies of the Second Coalition from moving troops {{back and forth between}} the northern Italian and German theaters, and insure French access to these strategic passes. Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna. Finally, to complete Vienna's isolation, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Swabian League had {{completed}} its recruitment, and undertook {{a raid on}} Dornach on March 22, but suffered a defeat against numerically inferior Swiss troops {{in the battle of}} Bruderholz that same evening. In early April, both sides raided each other's territories along the Rhine; the Swiss conquered the villages of Hallau and Neunkirch in the Klettgau west of Schaffhausen. A larger attack of the Swabian League took place on April 11, 1499: the Swabian troops occupied and plundered some villages on the southern shore of <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance,</b> just south of Constance. The expedition ended in a shameful defeat and open flight when the Swiss soldiers, who had their main camp just a few miles south at Schwaderloh, arrived and met the Swabians in the battle of Schwaderloh. The Swabians lost more than 1,000 soldiers; 130 from the city of Constance alone; and the Swiss captured their heavy equipment, including their artillery.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of what they {{suspected}} would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from <b>Lake</b> <b>Constance</b> to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, {{with the possible exception}} of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.|$|E
5|$|The army {{advanced}} in four columns.

This column eventually became the left flank. It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, further south via the valley at Freiburg im Breisgau, where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.|$|E
