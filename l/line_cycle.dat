50|$|By using a square-wave output {{that is not}} {{referenced}} to the <b>line</b> <b>cycle</b> rate, a flicker-free output can be produced.

The square wave nature of the output results in a straight-line power output from the lamp. The time where cathodes aren't emitting electrons of high enough energy is very short, meaning that safe (flicker-free) filming can occur at camera framerates up to 10,000 frame/s on most electronic ballasts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In typical home power-line {{communication}} (PLC) networks using contention-based access methods, providing Quality-of-service (QoS) to high-priority users {{often comes}} {{at the expense of}} reducing the throughput of low-priority users. This paper proposes a cross-layer protocol which involves in-teraction between the Physical (PHY) and the Medium-access-control (MAC) layers, for ensuring politeness of the high-priority users toward the low-priority users for uplink transmission in home PLC networks. This protocol modifies the contention-based CSMA protocol of the MAC layer to exploit the cyclostationarity of the noise in home PLC networks. The PLC noise spectrum has been shown in literature to be periodic with the period of AC <b>line</b> <b>cycle.</b> Using this periodicity, the proposed protocol allows longer medium-access times for low-priority users in every AC <b>line</b> <b>cycle,</b> while meeting the high throughput requirements of the high-priority users. The proposed cross-layer protocol, termed Opportunistic CSMA, improves the throughput of the low-priority users by as much as 300 % compared to the current CSMA protocols in home PLC networks.

40|$|The {{balancing}} of weld {{work load}} between executing stations and its robots {{has a significant}} influence on achievable production rate and equipment utilization. However, no automatic simulation based method for line balancing has been formulated up to this point. In practice, it is still manually conducted. Therefore in this work we propose two novel methods for load balancing of welds in multi station sheet metal assembly lines to minimize <b>line</b> <b>cycle</b> time. The methods are based on superimposition of the scenes/geometries of all line stations, with maintained robot positioning relative to the work piece, creating a "multi station". The weld load is balanced between all multi station robots, whereupon the individual robots are combined into stations and coordinated station wise for simultaneous operation. Furthermore one of the proposed methods reduces the subsequent need for robot coordination, by introducing some restrictions on the load balancing: Firstly, for each robo t, the weld load is balanced over the other station robots such that the working envelopes are maximally separated. Secondly, for each robot, the weld load is balanced over equivalently positioned robots in other line stations, based on previous station load balancing techniques. The proposed line balancing methods are applied on two industrial case studies which each involves the balancing of about 200 automotive stud welds between 3 stations, each of 4 robots. One of the proposed methods produces <b>line</b> <b>cycle</b> times close {{to that of the}} slowest uncoordinated robot, which can be considered a theoretical optimum of the <b>line</b> <b>cycle</b> time.

40|$|Sheet metal {{assembly}} is investment intense. Therefore the equipment {{needs to be}} efficiently utilized. The balancing of welds has a significant influence on achievable production rate and equipment utilization. Robot line balancing is a complex problem, where each weld is to be assigned to a specific station and robot, such that <b>line</b> <b>cycle</b> time is minimized. Industrial robot line balancing has been manually conducted, based on experience and trial and error rather than mathematical methods. However, recently an automatic method for robot line balancing was proposed by the authors. To reduce robot coordination cycle time losses, this method requires identical reach ability of all line stations. This limits applicability considerably since in most industrial lines, reach ability differs over the stations to further line reach ability and flexibility. Therefore, in this work we propose a novel generalized simulation-based method for automatic robot line balancing that allow s any robot positioning. It reduces the need for robot coordination significantly by spatially separating the robot weld work loads. This is furthermore achieved at a cost neglectable to <b>line</b> <b>cycle</b> time. The proposed method is furthermore successfully demonstrated on an automotive stud welding line. Moreover, algorithm CPU-times is a mere fraction of corresponding manual optimization times.
