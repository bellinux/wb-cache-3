5000|$|High Level Assembler (HLASM), {{announced}} in 1992 as a licensed program [...] "becomes the default translator for System/370 (TM) and System/390 (TM) operating environments." [...] The assembler supports the MVS, VSE, and VM operating systems and successors. As of Release 6 {{it now is}} able to run under Linux on zSeries and generate ELF or COFF object files. [...] It features {{a long list of}} mostly usability enhancements, and incorporates the SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator) modifications to Assembler H. Among features added were an indication of CSECT/DSECT for <b>location</b> <b>counter,</b> a list of [...] "using" [...] registers currently active, an indication of whether a variable is read or written in the cross-reference, and allowing mixed-case symbol names. The RSECT directive (Read-only Control Section) allows the assembler to check reentrancy on a per-section basis. RSECT was previously [...] "undocumented and inconsistently implemented in Assembler H." [...] HLASM is the current assembler for IBM mainframe systems as of 2012.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{interoperation}} and data exchange through the Internet has made Extensible Markup Language (XML) a dominant standard language. Much work {{has already been}} done on translating relational data into XML documents and vice versa. However, there is not an integrated method to combine them together as a unifying technology for database interoperability on the Internet. Users may not be familiar with various query language syntax. We propose database gateways built {{on the top of a}} Relational Database (RDB) and an XML Database (XMLDB). Users can access both databases at the same time through the query language SQL or XQL (an XML query language) to access data stored in either RDB or XMLDB. The translation process adopts query graph translation between a RDB and an XMLDB. Thus, a stepwise procedure of query translation is devised and amenable to implementation. The procedure also provides an XML interface to a RDB as well as a relational interface to XMLDB. A <b>location</b> <b>counter</b> sequence number is used to position tuples in a RDB for subsequent transforming the tuples into the corresponding positioning element instances in the XML documents. As a result, both XMLDB and RDB can co-exist, and be accessible by the users. ...|$|E

40|$|Broadcasting {{also called}} as {{flooding}} {{is one of}} the earliest research interests in mobile ad hoc networking. The main objective of broadcasting scheme is to avoid broadcast storm problem, provide good network performance and scalability. Existing probabilistic scheme consider only one parameter such as network density, node <b>location</b> or <b>counter</b> value in calculating probability value for broadcasting. These probability scheme cannot change their broadcasting approach even though the objectives of the system may change based on node characteristics or network conditions. There is no probabilistic broadcasting schemes which consider multiple parameters for determining the probability to broadcast. The parameters that greatly affect broadcasting is the network density, node location, etc. in this paper a new probabilistic broadcasting algorithm has been proposed that aims to utilize up to date local topological characteristics of intermediate nodes such as network density and node location. As we are using multiple values to calculate probability for broadcasting there is a need of optimization technique (such as Fuzzy Logic). With the use of fuzzy logic the proposed algorithm can keep good balance between rebroadcast efficiency, reachability and throughput...|$|R
40|$|Transportation and {{telecommunications}} networks have profound effects on location decisions of households, firms and of public facilities. Increasingly, such decisions depend {{on more than}} one network. Yet, most analyses focus on the land use implications of single networks. This paper suggests that in a multi-network setting' network flexibility is a significant factor in determining the relative importance of a network for the organization of space. To this end, the paper defines node and link flexibility and demonstrates the implications that differences in network flexibility have on <b>location</b> decisions. <b>Counter</b> to some expectations, the spatial effects of the most flexible network, namely telecommunications, may not be substantive, as location decisions seem to be most constrained by the least flexible networks. In response to growing congestion on existing networks, high capacity upper tier networks are increasingly developed. Such networks are generally inflexible. As a result the emerging map is more differentiated than the current one, changing the trend of that prevailed during the last fifty years toward greater equalization of space. ...|$|R
40|$|For many {{threatened}} species the rate and drivers of population decline {{are difficult to}} assess accurately: species’ surveys are typically restricted to small geographic areas, are conducted over short time periods, and employ {{a wide range of}} survey protocols. We addressed methodological challenges for assessing change in the abundance of an endangered species. We applied novel methods for integrating field and interview survey data for the critically endangered Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), allowing {{a deeper understanding of the}} species’ persistence through time. Our analysis revealed that Bornean orangutan populations have declined at a rate of 25 % over the last 10 years. Survival rates of the species are lowest in areas with intermediate rainfall, where complex interrelations between soil fertility, agricultural productivity, and human settlement patterns influence persistence. These areas also have highest threats from human-wildlife conflict. Survival rates are further positively associated with forest extent, but are lower in areas where surrounding forest has been recently converted to industrial agriculture. Our study highlights the urgency of determining specific management interventions needed in different <b>locations</b> to <b>counter</b> the trend of decline and its associated drivers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{selective}} aperiodic checkpointing approach for VLR (Visitor Location Register) failure restoration in wireless mobile networks. In this approach, the VLR data are backed {{up in the}} non-volatile storage whenever the <b>location</b> update <b>counter</b> for that VLR exceeds the pre-determined threshold. It restores the backed up VLR data after {{the failure of the}} VLR and sends location confirmation request messages only to the selected Registration Areas (RAs) whose information is updated between the time period of back up and failure of the VLR. This is necessary as this information is obsolete in the backed up VLR for this reason and needs to be updated in the restored VLR. However, previous work on aggressive restoration based on periodic and aperiodic checkpointing also provide solutions for VLR database failure recovery. But these solutions are not feasible as they broadcast the location confirmation request messages to the RAs whose location information is found to be obsolete during the restoration. The analytical model and experimental results also show that the proposed method outperforms other previous approaches as it selectively sends the location confirmation request messages instead of broadcasting to the RAs during VLR restoration process...|$|R
5000|$|The Mysterons {{threaten}} {{to destroy the}} Triumvirate of Europe, whose three members are the most powerful politicians on Earth after the World President. Captain Black murders an electronics professor, Gabriel Carney, at his rural home and the Mysterons resurrect the expert to realise their plan. Spectrum has moved {{each member of the}} Triumvirate to a separate <b>location</b> to <b>counter</b> the Mysteron threat. The Carney reconstruction travels to Vandon Maximum Security Base, which contains President Conrad Olafson, and activates a loudspeaker system to blare out recorded sound effects of machine guns and tanks to distract the guards, who are led to conclude that Vandon Base is under attack. While the Angels bomb the surrounding woodland, the reconstruction infiltrates the compound and slips an explosive device into a vent which it mistakenly believes leads to Olafson's underground suite. The vent is in fact an imitation which goes no further than ground level. Although the explosion obliterates the complex above him, Olafson survives along with Captain Ochre. Soon, the original Carney's body is discovered, although a second Carney has only recently been sighted. Colonel White dispatches Captains Scarlet and Blue to search Carney's residence, where the officers discover a note left by the reconstruction: [...] "123 OHM".|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{has been}} a major {{contributing}} factor (20 % in the last 10 years) to fatal crashes on State Highway 1 south of Whangarei. Whangarei is located 160 km north of Auckland in Region 1 of New Zealand. An analysis of fatigue related crashes along the route from Maunu Road to Ross Road were undertaken. Research was undertaken through the analysis of Land Transport New Zealand's Crash Analysis System and a review on literature from New Zealand and other countries on fatigue counter measures. This research sets out to determine driver fatigue issues along the route and provide recommendations for fatigue countermeasures with locations. The crash data was analysed by crash costs versus crash severity for each grouped site. These sites were then prioritised to obtain the <b>locations</b> for fatigue <b>counter</b> measures...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{substantial}} interest in how to determine the optimal number and <b>locations</b> of traffic <b>counters</b> for origin-destination (OD) trip matrices estimation. On the contrary, the optimal allocation of plate scanning devices has received very limited attention, even though several authors have demonstrated that plate scanning (route identification) techniques are much more informative than those based on traditional link count information. This paper provides techniques for obtaining the optimal number and location of plate scanning devices for a given prior OD distribution pattern under different situations, i. e. maximum route identifiability or budget constraints. Two rules analogous to the counting location problem are developed, and several integer linear programming models fulfilling these rules are proposed. The proposed methods are finally illustrated by their application into Nguyen-Dupuis and Cuenca networks.
