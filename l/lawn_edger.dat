50|$|The {{gasoline}} <b>lawn</b> <b>edger</b> {{was invented}} by Louis Faas Sr. of King o' Lawn Inc in the 1940s. The first gasoline edgers used a Briggs & Stratton 1.5 horsepower (1.1 kW) engine.|$|E
50|$|An {{edge trimmer}} or <b>lawn</b> <b>edger</b> is a tool, either manual or motorised, to form {{distinct}} boundaries between a lawn, typically {{consisting of a}} grass, or other soft botanical ground cover, and another ground surface feature such as a paved, concreted or asphalted area, or a granular material such as sand or gravel, or simply uncovered soil, for example an unbounded garden.|$|E
50|$|Purpose {{designed}} <b>lawn</b> <b>edgers</b> {{are single}} purpose machines for longer lawn edging distances.|$|R
50|$|Powering {{motorised}} <b>lawn</b> <b>edgers</b> can {{be either}} by battery or mains electricity, or by petrol two stroke or four stroke engines.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{situations}} {{for the use}} of <b>lawn</b> <b>edgers</b> are {{to define}} clean boundaries, and stop grass incursion, between lawns and walkways or gardens in private properties and public areas, and between sand traps and greens or fairways on golf courses.|$|R
5000|$|Purpose {{designed}} manual spade based lawn edgers are a half moon shaped, semicircular, broad blade {{attached to}} an elongated handle {{and are used}} in a downwards and rocking motion. [...] The blade may have a flat top to allow the operator {{to step on the}} blade to apply more force. The blade is driven through the lawn and into the lawn substrate parallel to and adjacent to the hard boundary feature bordering the lawn, cutting any protruding lawn material. This type of <b>lawn</b> <b>edger</b> is also known as an edging iron.|$|E
5000|$|Purpose {{designed}} <b>lawn</b> <b>edgers</b> {{are more}} time efficient for long even edges and string trimmers are more efficient for angular edges and around interrupting {{features such as}} rocks. [...] Spade based, roller based, and adaptable string trimmer designs may all be known as stick trimmers.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of roller based manual <b>lawn</b> <b>edgers.</b> Both are driven by pushing a roller wheel along a hard surface {{adjacent}} to the lawn edge. One type causes a solid steel cutting disc to cut {{the edge of the}} lawn. The other type causes two star spoked discs to rotate against each other shear cutting the edge of the lawn.|$|R
