25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class 66 and later the Vossloh Euro, CargoNet's need for the uneconomical and underdimensioned Di 8 fell through. The Euro was put into service on the Nordland Line and the Rauma Line, and NSB started looking for a possibility to sell the locomotives. In October 2011, GB Railfreight was awarded the contract for {{the operation of the}} railway after Sahaviriya Steel Industries had bought and reopened Teesside Steelworks in Redcar, United Kingdom. They were thus in need for locomotives to haul the internal torpedo trains with <b>liquid</b> <b>steel</b> between the steelwork's blast furnaces and continuous casters. Ten Di 8s were thereby sold, of which the first five were shipped on 12 December 2011, and arrived on 20 December, and the last were delivered in January 2012. Eight of the ten locomotives will be used in revenue service; the other two will be used for parts. At that point, seven Di 8s remained in service with CargoNet, with one having been retired and one used for parts. No. 714 was, as the first Di 8, scrapped on 10 July 2013.|$|E

50|$|Deoxidized {{steel is}} steel {{that has some}} or all of the oxygen removed from the melt during the {{steelmaking}} process. <b>Liquid</b> <b>steels</b> contain dissolved oxygen after their conversion from molten iron, but the solubility of oxygen in steel decreases with cooling. As steel cools, excess oxygen can cause blowholes or precipitate FeO. Therefore, several strategies have been developed for deoxidation. This may be accomplished by adding metallic deoxidizing agents to the melt either before or after it is tapped, or by vacuum treatment, in which carbon dissolved in the steel is the deoxidizer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The seismic {{response}} of <b>liquid</b> storage <b>steel</b> tanks with the variable frequency pendulum isolator (VFPI) is {{compared with that}} of the same <b>liquid</b> storage <b>steel</b> tanks isolated using the linear elastomeric bearings under real earthquake ground motion. In order to measure the effectiveness of isolation system, the seismic {{response of}} isolated steel tanks is {{compared with that of}} the non-isolated steel tanks. Two types of isolated tank models are considered in which the bearings are placed at the base and top of the steel tower structure. The seismic response is obtained by the Newmark’s step-by-step method. The response of two types of tanks, namely slender and broad tanks, is obtained and a parametric study is carried out to study the effects of important system parameters on the effectiveness of seismic isolation. The various important parameters considered are the tank aspect ratio, the time period of tower structure, damping and the time period of isolation system. Further, a parametric study has been carried out to examine the behavior of <b>liquid</b> storage <b>steel</b> tanks isolated with VFPIs. The important parameters considered are the friction coefficient of the VFPI, the Frequency Variation Factor (FVF) of the VFPI and the tank aspect ratio. It is observed from proposed analysis that the seismic response of elevated steel tanks accurately with significantly less computational efforts. It is concluded that seismic response, viz. the base shear, the sloshing displacement and the impulsive displacement, of <b>liquid</b> storage <b>steel</b> tanks during earthquake ground motions can be controlled with the installation of the VFPI. The linear elastomeric bearings and VFPI isolators has almost the same effect in the tank to the far-field ground motions. MATLAB software has been used for analysis and solving all dynamic equations of motion. The isolation is very effective in reducing the seismic response of elevated liquid storage tanks.

40|$|Nitrogen is {{an element}} with both {{positive}} and negative effects on the properties of carbon steel and it is therefore essential to control the nitrogen content in steel during the manufacturing process, with respect to the requirement of final product characteristics. The ability to control the final nitrogen content are heavily influenced by progress in the LD-process, i. e. the process step where hot metal is converted into crude steel, mainly through the addition of pure oxygen. Both carbon and oxygen have a strong impact on nitrogen solubility in molten steel. A number of planned experiments with sampling under running LD-process and analysis with LECO® were the subject of a survey of the nitrogen cycle, especially with regard to the conversion of steel that is recycled in the process, the so-called <b>liquid</b> return <b>steel.</b> The results of the trials show that the carbon in the charged hot metal controls how long the conversion process will take, which in turn determines how much nitrogen can be degassed. Normally the conversion process provides a highly effective gas development which degasses hot metal with high nitrogen level to crude steel with very low nitrogen level. Reblowing of crude steel which does not meet the specified requirements does not generally lead to higher nitrogen content, except in a few cases where high nitrogen gains has been observed. When charging with low-carbon <b>liquid</b> return <b>steel</b> the result is a faster conversion process with less time for the degassing of nitrogen, resulting in higher nitrogen content in the crude steel. Taking these results into account, it is recommended to control the use of <b>liquid</b> return <b>steel</b> to produce steel with requirements for low nitrogen content.
