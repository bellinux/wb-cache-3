Most of these methods involve a series of equations to determine first whether low-speed or high-speed conveying condition apply, then the material discharge angle for <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions</b> and finally the X and Y coordinates of the trajectory profile. There are also simplified methods which rely on graphical determination of the trajectory profiles.

Previous research has shown that the magnitude of temporal distortion caused by movement depends on objects' speed, although those studies have not taken into account the possible interference of the environment in which objects are embedded. On the basis of the results obtained in a psychophysical task in which the constant-stimuli method was used, we suggest that high-speed conditions produce an overestimation of the duration of an static object whilst, in contrast, <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions</b> do not show an appreciable effect.

40|$|The {{variability}} {{of the basic}} solar wind flow parameters in highand low-speed flows is submitted to a statistical analysis. Particular attention {{is given to the}} uniformity of solar wind high-speed flow conditions by comparing them with those of the low-speed so-called quiet solar wind. With the exception of the solar wind bulk velocity, the average fractional variation of each of a selected sample of basic solar wind parameters is found to be substantially larger during low-speed flow conditions than during high-speed flow conditions at 1 AU. As a statistical ensemble of events, the only thing steady and uniform about <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions</b> is the bulk velocity. In all other respects, high-speed flows form a much more uniform ensemble of solar wind conditions than do the low-speed flows.

40|$|Abstract â€” It is {{generally}} expected from intuition that the electromagnetic force exerted on a charged particle should be invariant as observed in different inertial frames. In the spe-cial relativity, this invariance {{is achieved by}} invoking the Lorentz transformation of space and time. In this investigation, an entirely different interpretation of this force invariance is presented by proposing a Galilean-invariant model of the electromagnetic force. In this new classical model, the electromagnetic force is {{expressed in terms of}} the augmented scalar po-tential. This new potential is a modification of the electric scalar potential by incorporating an ordinarily small velocity-dependent part. Each of the position vectors, time derivatives, and velocities involved in the proposed force law is referred specifically to a respective refer-ence frame. By virtue of this feature, the electromagnetic force is endowed with the unique property of Galilean invariance. The velocity-dependent parts of the proposed force look quite different from their counterparts in the Lorentz force.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the optimized supersonic configurations at supersonic off-design, at transonic as well as <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions</b> shows: The alternate supersonic load case {{found to be more}} realistic by other partners in this work package generates higher aerodynamic loads. Although the flow needs to produce higher lift coefficients no significant flow separations are found. Therefore such flows can still be predicted using inviscid method keeping the numerical effort within the MDO process low. The lower fidelity aerodynamic performance estimations implemented in the MDO process for transonic cruise is found to slightly under predict the configurations performance estimated by viscous methods. Meeting the aerodynamic low-speed performance estimated by the lower fidelity model in the MDO process is found to be quite adequate for the approach flight phase. During climb out the stated performance values are viewed as very challenging and the empirical model is assessed as too optimistic for the analysed configuration. This holds even if the low-speed performance of the implemented high-lift system could be increased mainly by increasing the leading edge flap size...|$|E

Although health monitoring methodologies have been thoroughly developed for rotating machinery, <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions</b> often pose a challenge due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. To this aim, sophisticated algorithms that reduce noise and highlight the bearing faults are necessary to accurately diagnose machines undergoing this condition.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the possible structural transition of a planar Au 10 cluster during its soft landing on a TiO 2 (110) surface with or with no oxygen defects. The collision between the gold cluster and the oxide surface is simulated using the Carâ€“Parrinello quantum molecular dynamics method. Both high-speed and <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions</b> typically implemented in soft-landing experiments are simulated. It is found that under a high-speed condition, the gold cluster Au 10 can undergo {{a sequence of}} structural transitions after colliding with a defect-free TiO 2 (110) surface. When the TiO 2 (110) surface possesses oxygen vacancies, however, chemical bonds can form between gold and Ti atoms if gold atoms contact directly with the vacancies. As a consequence, one oxygen vacancy is capable of trapping one Au atom, and thus can split the Au 10 into two parts while bouncing back from the surface. In addition, we study reaction pathways for the CO oxidation based on three isomer structures of Au 10 observed in the soft-landing simulation: (1) the precollision two-dimensional structure, (2) a postcollision three-dimensional (3 D) structure, and (3) an intermediate (transient) 3 D structure {{that appeared in the}} midst of the collision.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analytical}} study to investigate internal and external surface Mach numbers on several inlet geometries for possible application to the nacelle of the Quiet Clean Short-Haul Experimental Engine (QCSEE) are presented. The effects of external forebody geometry and internal lip geometry were illustrated at both low-speed and cruise conditions. Boundary-layer analyses were performed on several geometries to determine if lip flow separation might exist. The results indicated that inner-surface Mach number level and gradient could be reduced with inlets at a 50 deg incidence angle by blunting the external forebody geometry. The external Mach numbers at cruise conditions indicated that a compromise in the external forebody bluntness might be required to satisfy both low-speed and cruise conditions.

Traditionally, extensive attention has been given to accidents in the view of safety when studying occurrence frequency. The regularity of incident frequency, however, deserves equal attention by practitioners and researchers, especially on urban expressways with dense ramps and high traffic volume. The objective {{of this study was to}} have a thorough exploration of environmental and traffic-related causative factors of incident rate on three urban expressways in central Shanghai City, including disability incidents and crash incidents. Incident data obtained by CCTV-monitoring system were used, which contain large quantities of minor and short-duration incidents. The disaggregation of expressway sections and time intervals of this study was rare in its scope: disability frequency is analyzed on an hourly basis and segment-hour aggregation is applied for crash frequency. To account for temporal correlation among different time intervals, Generalized Estimation Equation procedure was used in this paper. In particular, the effects of traffic interaction features on incident occurrence were analyzed by considering segment length, merging and diverging volume. Results showed that temporal correlation of crash incident occurrence was larger than that of disability occurrence. There is a significant relationship of disability rate with rain and temperature, and there was more risk of vehicle disability in dense-traffic and <b>low-speed</b> <b>condition.</b> It also pointed out that the regularity of crash incident occurrence is quite different from that of accidents on highways or rural freeways: Environmental factors exert little impact on crash occurrence except from visibility; Short segment, high merging and diverging volume increased crash rate remarkably...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel technique of active roll damping in marine vessels by the sole use of conventional thrusters. Many marine operations, such as crane operation and helicopter landings, should {{be carried out}} in small and steady roll motions. However, active roll damping devices such as fins and rudders lose their efficiency in <b>low-speed</b> <b>conditions.</b> This thesis provides a new methodology for roll reduction by adjusting the shaft speed and pitch of the propellers, by use of already installed thrusters. In order to develop a simulation environment suitable for representing realistic roll damping scenarios and validate the damping contribution from the thrusters, systematic experimental trials were {{carried out in the}} large towing tank at MARINTEK. The simulation model is based on the MSS Toolbox, with additional modifications added to represent roll motions more realistically, i. e. 4 -quadrant open water results and non-linear sway and roll damping. The numerical simulations and experimental trials, presented in the thesis, are compared with ship operations that require low roll motions, and shows promising results with significant roll reduction. Seakeeping trials related to roll motions are carried out to quantify the damping contribution. Decay tests showed average damping ratio 250 % higher using the proposed anti-roll system compared to the undamped case. Furthermore, regular waves showed 40 % damping in the area around resonance. Additionally, statistical values from irregular wave trials showed damping in the regime 30 - 64 %. Lastly, operability diagrams were created using numerical simulations and was compared with helicopter landing criteria. It was shown that helicopter landings could take place 34 % more often using the active roll damping system for oblique waves and 20 % more often for beam waves. Based on the results, it is concluded that the system works very well for moderate sea states, and that the damping contributions, that is to say in moderate sea state conditions, is comparable to that of currently available anti-roll system...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{competition}} among airlines seriously {{depend upon the}} saving operating costs, with the premise that not to degrade its services quality. Especially {{in the face of}} increasingly scarce oil resources, reducing fleets operational fuel consumption, is an important means to improve profits. Aircraft fuel economy is determined by operational management strategies and application technologies. The application of technologies mainly refers to airplaneâ€™s engine performance, Weight efficiency and aerodynamic characteristics. A market competitive aircraft should thoroughly consider to all of these aspects. Transport aircraft aerodynamic performance mainly is determined by wingâ€™s properties. Wings that are optimized for efficient flight in cruise conditions need to be fitted with powerful high-lift devices to meet lift requirements for safe takeoff and landing. These high-lift devices {{have a significant impact on}} the total airplane performance. The aerodynamic characteristics of the wing airfoil will have a direct impact on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing, and the wingâ€™s effective cruise hand high-lift configuration design has a significant impact on the performance of transport aircraft. Therefore, optimizing the design is a necessary airfoil design process. Nowadays engineering analysis relies heavily on computer-based solution algorithms to investigate the performance of an engineering system. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is one of the computer-based solution methods which are more widely employed in aerospace engineering. The computational power and time required to carry out the analysis increases as the fidelity of the analysis increases. Aerodynamic shape optimization has become a vital part of aircraft design in the recent years. Since the aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) process with CFD solution algorithms requires a huge amount of computational power, there is always some reluctance among the aircraft researchers in employing the ASO approach at the initial stages of the aircraft design. In order to alleviate this problem, statistical approximation models are constructed for actual CFD algorithms. The fidelity of these approximation models are merely based on the fidelity of data used to construct these models. Hence it becomes indispensable to spend more computational power in order to convene more data which are further used for constructing the approximation models. The goal of this thesis is to present a design approach for assumed wing airfoils; it includes the design process, multi-objective design optimization based on surrogate modelling.

Reynolds number effects were generally small and the drag data followed established trends of skin friction as a function of Reynolds number.

Convergence in highly-directed regions was shown to be faster than in more-open regions. Velocity and total deformation fields in the stator slots and the shear gap were examined for both operating scenarios. Differences in the fluid behaviour between the two scenarios are discussed...|$|R
