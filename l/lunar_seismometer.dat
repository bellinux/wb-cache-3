40|$|International audienceThe {{interior}} of Mars is today poorly known, {{in contrast to}} the Earth interior and, to a lesser extent, to the Moon interior, for which seismic data have been used for the determination of the interior structure. This is one of the strongest facts motivating the deployment on Mars of a network of very broad band seismometers, in the framework of the 2007 CNES-NASA joint mission. These seismometers will be carried by the Netlanders, a set of 4 landers developed by a European consortium, and are expected to land in mid- 2008. Despite a low mass, the seismometers will have a sensitivity comparable to the present Very Broad Band Earth sensors, i. e. better than the past Apollo <b>Lunar</b> <b>seismometers.</b> They will record the full range of seismic and gravity signals, from the expected quakes induced by the thermoelastic cooling of the lithosphere, to the possible permanent excitation of the normal modes and tidal gravity perturbations. All these seismic signals will be able to constrain the structure of Mars' mantle and its discontinuities, as well as the state and size of the Martian core, shortly after for the centennial of the discovery of the Earth core by Oldham (Quart. J. Geol. Soc. 62 (1906) 456 – 475) ...|$|R
40|$|The Moonquakes {{were first}} {{detected}} by the sensitive seismometers placed during the Apollo missions at four relatively densely spaced locations on the lunar surface. Because winds, sea waves, and road traffic do not shake the Moon, the <b>lunar</b> <b>seismometers</b> can detect quite weak Moonquakes even at 1000 km depth. The sheer existence of moonquakes is somewhat surprising, since the Moon {{is believed to}} be geologically inactive by today. In contrast to the Earth, were plate motions cause dislocations and build up stresses, which are released through earthquakes, the Moon’s interior is significantly less active. However, if no interior processes were going on, no moonquakes could be detected. The physical cause of both deep and shallow moonquakes remains unresolved today because it is difficult to reconcile them with models of the lunar thermal evolution and mantle flows. The monthly and bi–weekle periods in quake frequency hint to a connection to tidal deformation, may be as a cause, or just a trigger. The depth range of 930 to 960 km, which is compatible with most of the deep quakes, should also gibe a hint. We have set up a three dimensional thermal convection model to investigate the thermal evolution of the Moon. We find that the Moons history is dominated by the growth of a massive lithosphere, which constricts the effective transport of heat through convection due to its stiffness. Heat can then only be transported through thermal conduction. Henceforth the lithosphere serves as an insulating shell and keeps the lunar interior relatively warm. Although the hot thermal boundary at the core mantle boundary breaks down after about 0. 5 Ga, the Moon’s lower mantle is being heated internally due to radioactive heat sources. The convection velocities become smaller with ongoing time, but even today a slight movement in the lower mantle is present. Although the strain rate build up due to convection might not be efficient enough to release moonquakes from the detected magnitude, the addition of monthly tidal forces from the Earth might be sufficient. The slow convection in the present lunar interior could then be understood as ’baseline’ strain for tidally triggered moonquakes...|$|R
40|$|Lunar seismograms are {{distinctly}} {{different from their}} terrestrial counterparts. The Apollo <b>lunar</b> <b>seismometers</b> recorded moonquakes without distinct P- or S-wave arrivals; instead waves arrive as a diffuse coda that decays over several hours making the identification of body waves difficult. The unusual character of the lunar seismic wavefield is generally tied to properties of the megaregolith: it consists of highly fractured and broken crustal rock, the result of extensive bombardment of the Moon. The megaregolith extends several kilometers into the lunar crust, possibly into the mantle in some regions, and is covered by a thin coating of fine-scale dust. These materials possess very low seismic velocities that strongly scatter the seismic wavefield at high frequencies. Directly modeling {{the effects of the}} megaregolith to simulate an accurate lunar seismic wavefield is a challenging computational problem, owing to the inherent 3 -D nature of the problem and the high frequencies (greater than 1 Hz) required. Here we focus on modeling the long duration code, studying the effects of the low velocities found in the megaregolith. We produce synthetic seismograms using 1 -D slowness integration methodologies, GEMINI and reflectivity, and a 3 -D Cartesian finite difference code, Wave Propagation Program, to study the effect of thin layers of low velocity on the surface of a planet. These codes allow us generate seismograms with dominant frequencies of approximately 1 Hz. For background lunar seismic structure we explore several models, including the recent model of Weber et al., Science, 2011. We also investigate variations in megaregolithic thickness, velocity, attenuation, and seismogram frequency content. Our results are compared to the Apollo seismic dataset, using both a cross correlation technique and integrated envelope approach to investigate coda decay. We find our new high frequency results strongly support the hypothesis that the long duration of the lunar seismic codes is generated by the presence of the low velocity megaregolith, and that the diffuse arrivals are a combination of scattered energy and multiple reverberations within this layer. The 3 -D modeling indicates the extreme surface topography of the Moon adds only a small contribution to scattering effects, though local geology may play a larger role. We also study the effects of the megaregolith on core reflected and converted phases and other body waves. Our analysis indicates detection of core interacting arrivals with a polarization filter technique is robust and lends the possibility of detecting other body waves from the Moon...|$|R

40|$|The present]day {{internal}} {{structure of the}} Moon provides insight not only into its own formation and evolution, but also that of all rocky planetary bodies. The most direct way to probe a planet fs interior structure is through seismology. As part of the Apollo <b>lunar</b> missions, four <b>seismometers</b> were deployed on the nearside surface of the Moon between the years 1969 and 1972. These instruments operated continuously until 1977, forming the only substantial extraterrestrial seismic data set in existence. These data {{have been used to}} constrain various aspects of the seismic velocity and density structure of the Moon. Typical 1 -D models recognize a 30 - 60 km thick crust overlying a nearly constant]velocity mantle, and extend to a depth of approximately 1000 km, below which the lack of penetrating moonquake ray]paths precludes the seismic determination of deeper structure. Previously, the lack of observed moonquakes from {{the far side of the}} Moon has been used to infer the presence of a highly attenuating (possibly molten) core. Indirect geophysical measurements such as moment of inertia, magnetic induction, lunar laser ranging, and elemental abundances of mare basalts also place varying constraints on core size and state. In combination with seismic studies, these indirect measurements have been used to arrive at a commonly accepted model of the Moon's deepest interior that includes a solid inner and fluid outer core, overlain by a partial melt boundary layer. We recently applied modern array seismology techniques to the Apollo data and revealed detailed core structure, including the first direct confirmation of the presence of a solid inner core. Our study focused on the identification of core]reflected phases in deep moonquake seismograms. The resulting model of the Moon fs innermost structure was found to be consistent with the commonly accepted model. However, the modeled layer radii may vary by tens of kilometers, as is expected when accounting for uncertainties such as moonquake location, timing errors, and potential seismic heterogeneities. In addition, the modeled velocities may vary with a 1 -to- 1 trade]off with the modeled reflector depth. The GRAIL (Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory) mission, launched in Sept. 2011, placed two nearly identical spacecraft in lunar orbit. The two satellites make extremely high-resolution measurements of the lunar gravity field, which can be used to constrain the interior structure of the Moon using a "crust to core" approach. GRAIL fs constraints on crustal thickness, mantle structure, core radius and stratification, and core state (solid vs. molten) will complement seismic investigations in several ways. Here we present a progress report on our efforts to advance our knowledge of the Moon fs {{internal structure}} using joint gravity and seismic analyses. We will focus on methodology, including 1) refinements to the seismic core constraint accomplished through array processing of Apollo seismic data, made by applying a set of travel time corrections based on GRAIL structure estimates local to each Apollo seismic station; 2) modeling deep lunar structure through synthetic seismograms, to test whether the seismic core model can reproduce the core reflections observed in the Apollo seismograms; and 3) a joint seismic and gravity inversion in which we attempt to fit a family of seismic structure models with the gravity constraints from GRAIL, resulting in maps of seismic velocities and densities that vary from a nominal model both laterally and with depth...|$|R
