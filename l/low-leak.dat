40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of current leads for an orbiting superconducting magnetic spectrometer that were required to achieve a zero-current heat leak of 0. 03 W with a total coolant flow rate as low as 0. 011 g/sec cooling only the coldest third of the length of a lead. Analysis of heat flow phenomena in an insulated current lead in thermal contact with cryogenic gas flow is given for prediction of lead performance. A basic lead design was then tested and modified by such techniques as tapering, adding superconducting sections, and operating above the optimum current, until a lead satisfying the <b>low-leak</b> requirements was obtained. Operating the insulated leads at well above their optimum current for short periods at high mass flow is possible, and instability behavior is predictable...|$|E
30|$|The {{traditional}} and high-performance SRAM {{technology has been}} widely used in the on-chip caches due to its standard logic compatibility, high endurance, and fast access time features [20]. However, low-density SRAM technology dissipates high leakage power by its six-transistor implementation [21] {{and has become a}} bottleneck for energy-efficient designs. By increasing demand of larger memories in computing systems, using conventional SRAM-based caches becomes more expensive. DRAM technology has become a viable alternative for implementing on-chip caches due to its high density, high capacity, low leakage, and high write endurance features. It is possible to have large reliable last-level caches with high bandwidth by stacking <b>low-leak</b> and high-density DRAM as an on-die cache. However, conventional eDRAM technology tends to be slow compared with SRAM technology and consumes a significant amount of energy in the form of refresh energy to retain stored data which have negative impact on performance.|$|E
