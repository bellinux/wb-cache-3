A new magazine release lever (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a <b>lanyard</b> <b>attachment</b> loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|E
