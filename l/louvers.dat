The study has considered for three different <b>louver</b> angle case, two different <b>louver</b> lengths for better <b>louver</b> angle case and finally two different <b>louver</b> pitches for better <b>louver</b> angle and <b>louver</b> length case. The study indicates that the pressure drop will depends upon the <b>louver</b> angle and pitch. The <b>louver</b> angle i. e. 25 deg provides reasonable pressure drop and high heat transfer rate. Thus by changing the length of <b>louver</b> can increase the pressure drop in MCHX. The case ie., 1. 2 mm <b>louver</b> length have more heat transfer rate. But when comparing to 1 mm <b>louver</b> length case Net Heat Transfer rate is high. So the study further continued by having the <b>louver</b> length 1 mm and changing the <b>louver</b> pitch.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fin pitch, <b>louver</b> angle and thickness, and flow depth on the onset, propagation, and {{characteristic}} frequencies of instabilities in multilouvered fins is investigated. The initial instability {{appears in the}} wake of the exit lo. uver. Subsequently, instabilities are established in the interior of the <b>louver</b> bank which spread upstream as the Reynolds number increases. It is shown that the interior instabilities are completely independent of the exit wake instability. On the other hand, the exit wake instability is not only dependent on the exit <b>louver</b> geometry but also on the internal geometry of the <b>louver</b> bank. Increasing <b>louver</b> thickness and angle increases the propensity of the flow to become unstable. Increasing fin pitch, <b>louver</b> angle, and thickness enhances the propagation of instabilities into the array.

Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with <b>louvers</b> and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed.

With the <b>louver</b> spacing increasing and the distance between neighbouring outdoor AC units decreasing, the working temperature increases.

40|$|In this study, {{the flow}} {{characteristics}} of Geldart A {{particles in the}} bubbling fluidized bed with <b>louver</b> baffles were simulated by CFD method for the first time. A new drag model for bubbling fluidized bed with <b>louver</b> baffles was developed after our early work [Yang et al. Chem. Eng. J. 259 (2015) 338 - 347]. In this drag model, the baffled fluidized bed {{was treated as a}} series connection of freely bubbling fluidized beds with the <b>louver</b> baffle as the gas distributor. The hydrodynamics of each freely bubbling fluidized bed were simulated using the structure-based drag model with the modification of the bubble diameter equation to adapt the change of bubble size after passing each <b>louver</b> baffle. Through analyzing bubble diameters measured by double optical fiber probe, {{it was found that the}} averaged diameter of bubbles regenerated from baffles was nearly equal to the distance between two adjacent vanes in the <b>louver</b> baffle. By this method, the bubbling fluidization can be correctly predicted and the simulation results showed good agreements with the experimental data of the radial and axial solid volume fraction distributions. In the simulation results, it can be seen that the variation of axial solid volume fraction across the <b>louver</b> baffle was fluctuant, which was different from other types of baffles. Meanwhile, the lower particle concentration at the position of <b>louver</b> baffle indicates the particles back-mixing inhibited by <b>louver</b> baffles. The guiding effect of <b>louver</b> baffles on the gas and solid flow can be captured in the gas and solid velocity profiles as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{thermal resistance}} for most compact heat exchangers occurs {{on the gas}} side and as such {{an understanding of the}} gas side flowfield is needed before improving current designs. Louvered fins are commonly used in many compact heat exchangers to increase the surface area and initiate new boundary layer growth. For this study, detailed flowfield measurements were made in the entry region of several louvered fin geometries whereby the <b>louver</b> angle, ratio of fin pitch to <b>louver</b> pitch, and Reynolds number were all varied. In addition to mean velocity measurements, time-resolved velocity measurements were made to quantify unsteady eects. The results indicated larger fin pitches resulted in lower average flow angles in the <b>louver</b> passages and longer development lengths. Larger <b>louver</b> angles with a constant ratio of fin pitch to <b>louver</b> pitch resulted in higher average flow angles and shorter development lengths. As the Reynolds number increased, longer development lengths were required and higher average flow angles occurred as compared with a lower Reynolds number case. Time-resolved velocity measurements indicated some flow periodicity behind the fully developed <b>louver</b> for a range of Reynolds numbers. The Strouhal number of these fluctuations was constant for a given <b>louver</b> geometry, but the value increased with increasing fin pitch. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{evaluation}} of a <b>louver</b> facility in the Lemhi River, Idaho. The <b>louver</b> facility was designed to guide juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead trout into a trap in order to sample downstream migrant populations. The {{study was designed to}} determine: (1) if the catch in the <b>louver</b> facility was a reliable index of emigrant population size, and (2) if an accurate estimate of the number of emigrants could be obtained through a mark-and-recapture program utilizing <b>louver</b> catches. The <b>louver</b> guidance facility provided a reliable method of estimating numbers of salmon and steelhead smolts that were emigrating from the upper Lemhi River. The <b>louver</b> facility collected a consistent proportion of the migrating chinook salmon and steethead trout smolts from the Lemhi River. Approximately 3 percent of the chinook smolts and 21 percent of the steelhead smolts were captured in the trap. Estimates of smolt numbers for both species were derived by expanding the louver-captured proportion. During 1965, an estimated 325, 020 chinook smolts and 9, 830 steelhead smolts emigrated from the upper Lemhi River. No estimates could be made for chinook fry emigrants.
