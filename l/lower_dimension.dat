5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} <b>lower</b> <b>dimension.</b> Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

We then compute the Assouad and <b>lower</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the limit set, which involves controlling local doubling properties. Unlike the Hausdorff, packing, and box-counting dimensions, we show that the Assouad and <b>lower</b> <b>dimensions</b> are not necessarily given by the Poincaré exponent.
