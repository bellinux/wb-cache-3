Our algorithms for extracting useful metadata from the overhead court camera are described and evaluated. We track the tennis ball using motion images for ball candidate detection and then <b>link</b> <b>ball</b> candidates into locally linear tracks. From these tracks we can infer when serves and rallies take place. Using background subtraction and hysteresis-type blob tracking, we track the tennis players positions. The performance of both modules is evaluated using ground-truthed data. The extracted metadata provides valuable information for indexing and efficient browsing of hours of multi-camera tennis footage and we briefly illustrative how this data is used by our tennis-coach playback interface. ...|$|E

40|$|The 2011 Cricket World Cup final {{match was}} watched by around 135 million people. Such a huge viewership demands a great expe-rience for users of online cricket portals. Many portals like espn-cricinfo. com host {{a variety of}} content related to recent matches in-cluding match reports and ball-by-ball commentaries. When read-ing a match report, reader {{experience}} can be significantly improved by augmenting (on demand) the event mentions in the report with detailed commentaries. We build an event linking system Crick-etLinking which first identifies event mentions from the reports and then links them {{to a set of}} balls. Finding linkable mentions is chal-lenging because unlike entity linking problem settings, {{we do not have a}} concrete set of event entities to link to. Further, depending on the event type, event mentions could be linked to a single ball, or to a set of balls. Hence, identifying mention type as well as linking becomes challenging. We use a large number of domain specific features to learn classifiers for mention and mention type detec-tion. Further, we leverage structured match, context similarity and sequential proximity to perform accurate linking. Finally, context based summarization is performed to provide a concise briefing of <b>linked</b> <b>balls</b> to each mention...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} scale-free degree {{distributions}} {{in the context}} of networks is addressed through an analogous non-network model in which the node degree corresponds to the number of balls in a box and the rewiring of <b>links</b> to <b>balls</b> moving between the boxes. A statistical mechanical formulation is presented and the corresponding Hamiltonian is derived. The energy, the entropy, as well as the degree distribution and its fluctuations are investigated at various temperatures. The scale-free distribution is shown to correspond to the degenerate ground state, which has small fluctuations in the degree distribution and yet a large entropy. We suggest an implication of our results from the viewpoint of the stability in evolution of networks. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures. To appear in Europhysics lette...|$|R

The journal's website is at: [URL] aim {{of this study was to}} identify the key aspects of technique that characterize the fastest bowlers. Kinematic data were collected for 20 elite male fast bowlers with 11 kinematic parameters calculated, describing elements of fast bowling technique that have previously been <b>linked</b> to <b>ball</b> release speed. Four technique variables were identified as being the best predictors of ball release speed, explaining 74 % of the observed variation in ball release speed. The results indicate that the fastest bowlers have a quicker run-up and maintain a straighter knee throughout the front foot contact phase. The fastest bowlers were also observed to exhibit larger amounts of upper trunk flexion up to ball release and to delay the onset of arm circumduction. This study identifies those technique variables that best explain the differences in release speeds among fast bowlers. These results are likely to be useful in both the coaching and talent identification of fast bowlers. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc...|$|R

The mechanism linkage couples three coplanar rotary electric motor shafts to the endpoint grasped by the human operator. The linkage permits all motor housings to be supported on a common base, thereby reducing the inertia and weight that the interface actuators and human operator must support and move. Furthermore, because only rigid <b>links</b> and rotary <b>ball</b> bearings are used, the linkage avoids the compliance, friction, and/or backlash associated with other types of transmission elements.

It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or center) link, causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or drag link at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacterial}} flagellar hook is a {{short and}} uniquely curved tube that connects the basal body to the filament. Hook length is controlled at 55 nm on average by a soluble protein FliK in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The N-terminal segment of FliK responsible for measuring the hook length {{is considered to be}} intrinsically disordered. Here, we show by high-speed atomic force microscopy that a FliK molecule in solution takes on a shape of two <b>balls</b> <b>linked</b> by a flexible string; the larger ball corresponds to the N-terminal region and the smaller one corresponds to the C-terminal region. The N-terminal domain is stable but the C-terminal domain fluctuates in shape. Based on these and other features of FliK, we propose that the folding of the N-terminal segment {{at the tip of the}} growing hook plays a major role in determining the minimal length of the hook...|$|R

In the spectral region investigated(20 - 650 cm(- 1)), we see no low-energy interball modes, but symmetry breaking of the <b>linked</b> C- 60 <b>balls</b> {{is evident in the}} complex spectrum of intramolecular modes. Experimental features suggest large splittings or frequency shifts of some IhC 60 -derived modes that are activated by symmetry reduction, implying that the balls are strongly distorted in these structures. We have calculated the vibrations of all three systems by first-principles quantum molecular dynamics and use them to assign the predominant IhC 60 symmetries of observed modes. Pur calculations show unprecedentedly large downshifts of T- 1 u(2) -derived modes and extremely large splittings of other modes, both of which are consistent with the experimental spectra. For the rhombohedral and orthorhombic polymers, the T- 1 u(2) -derived mode that is polarized along the bonding direction is calculated to downshift below any T- 1 u(1) -derived modes. We also identify a previously unassigned feature near 610 cm(- 1) in all three systems as a widely split or shifted mode derived from various silent IhC 60 vibrations, confirming a strong perturbation model for these linked fullerene structures...|$|R

500|$|Other {{explanations}} {{have been}} suggested for the terraces, including the construction of defensive ramparts. Iron Age hill forts including the nearby Cadbury Castle in Somerset show evidence of extensive fortification of their slopes. The normal form of ramparts is a bank and ditch, {{but there is no}} evidence of this arrangement on the Tor. South Cadbury, one of the most extensively fortified places in early Britain, had three concentric rings of banks and ditches supporting an [...] enclosure. By contrast, the Tor has seven rings and very little space on top for the safekeeping of a community. It has been suggested that a defensive function may have been <b>linked</b> with Ponter's <b>Ball</b> Dyke, a linear earthwork about [...] east of the Tor. It consists of an embankment with a ditch on the east side. The purpose and provenance of the dyke are unclear. It is possible that it was part of a longer defensive barrier associated with New Ditch, three miles to the south-west, which is built in a similar manner. It has been suggested by Ralegh Radford that it is part of a great Celtic sanctuary, probably 3rd century BC, while others, including Philip Rahtz, date it to the post-Roman period and link it to the Dark Age occupation on Glastonbury Tor. The 1970 excavation suggests the 12th century or later. The historian Ronald Hutton also mentions the alternative possibility that the terraces are the remains of a medieval [...] "spiral walkway" [...] created for pilgrims to reach the church on the summit, similar to that at Whitby Abbey.|$|R
