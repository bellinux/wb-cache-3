5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E
25|$|The {{overall goal}} is for an {{individual}} to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt.

3000|$|When {{developers}} adopt a framework, {{the need}} to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> programming language adds to the initial learning curve. Most Qt adopters have to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language, since Qt uses a proprietary language, QML. According to practitioners, if a developer needs to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language, this is a possible negative factor against selecting the framework. This <b>learning</b> curve from <b>a</b> <b>new</b> programming language was also experienced in the student survey. In general, most students were willing to invest in learning: 56.8 % wanted to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> framework during the course. However, some students felt it took too much time to learn QML, {{despite the fact that}} QML resembles JavaScript and thus was designed to be relatively easy to adopt for UI developers. According to one student, [...] "a fundamental issue, like how to add functionality to QML elements, required several hours of brainwork [to learn]". Similarly, some students were not familiar with C++ and reported having difficulties every time they had to write their applications in C++.|$|R
25|$|Any {{stimulus}} {{that increases}} the likelihood of a behavior increasing is a reinforcer. An effective use of positive reinforcement would be frequent praise while an employee is <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> task. An employee's behavior can also be shaped during the learning process if approximations of the ideal behavior are praised or rewarded. The frequency of reinforcement is an important consideration. While frequent praise during the learning process can be beneficial, {{it can be hard to}} sustain indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|The role {{of sleep}} in memory {{has long been}} suspected.

Such behavioral and imaging measures in tests with both animal and human subjects have shown that pretraining sleep plays {{a critical role in}} preparing the memory for encoding and posttraining sleep {{plays a major role in}} memory consolidation.|$|E

25|$|Goal-setting Theory {{has strong}} {{empirical}} support dating back thirty years. However, {{there are some}} boundary conditions that indicate in some situations, goal-setting can be detrimental to performance on certain types of tasks. Goals require a narrowing of one's focus, so for more complex or creative tasks, goals can actually inhibit performance because they demand cognitive resources. Similarly, when someone is <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> task, performance-related goals can distract from the learning process. During the learning process, it may be better to focus on mastering the task than achieving a particular result. Finally, too many goals can become distracting and counterproductive, especially if they conflict with one another.|$|E

He was asked to move from first base to the outfield to {{accommodate}} Rudy York, who was one of the best young hitters of his generation; York was tried at catcher, third baseman, and outfielder and proved to be a defensive liability at each position.

25|$|Shift {{workers who}} work {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of the problem may be the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E

Martin hoped to switch to shortstop during the 2013 World Baseball Classic, citing {{he did not want to}} learn another pitching staff during the tournament, because he was already <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> staff in Pittsburgh. Martin played third base in the minors before converting to catcher. Martin would later withdraw his name, citing soreness. On December 5, 2016, Martin committed to play shortstop for Team Canada at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Martin was left off of Team Canada's WBC roster on February 8, 2017, due to insurance complications relating to his minor offseason knee surgery.|$|E

Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a Missionary Training Center (or two to three months for those <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people among whom they will be living. As of January 2014, the LDS Church has over 80,000 missionaries worldwide and over 10,000 Welfare Services Missionaries.|$|E
25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. <b>Learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

500|$|Before the 2008 season, Kendrick was {{a victim}} of an [...] "elaborate {{practical}} joke" [...] executed by Brett Myers that had Kendrick convinced he had been traded away to Japan. During the season, Kendrick's performance slipped; he posted a 5.49 ERA in 30 starts. Despite his relative ineffectiveness, the Phillies won the 2008 World Series, and though he was left off the postseason roster, Kendrick received a World Series ring and co-authored a diary from the series. Phillies pitching coach Rich Dubee attributed the decline to hitters discerning that Kendrick threw predominantly a sinker, and almost always in the strike zone, thus fostering predictability for hitters. As such, he spent the majority of the 2009 season in the minor leagues, working on developing his change up, which proved to be an arduous process. Ultimately, after <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> grip from Justin Lehr, he had a eureka moment during a bullpen session in 2009; he developed the pitch, and made it back to the major leagues [...] "for good" [...] near the conclusion of the season.|$|E
