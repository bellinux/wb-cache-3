The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her.

5|$|Ultima Underworld is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) {{that takes place}} from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player's goal is to adventure through a large, multi-level dungeon, in which the entire game is set. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world, and with the icon-based interface on the heads-up display (HUD). Each icon has a specific effect; for example, the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely, while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready his or her weapon. The player's progression through the game is non-linear: areas may be explored, and puzzles and quests finished, in any order. An automatically filling map, to which the player may add notes, records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness. The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts. Exploratory actions include <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, jumping, and swimming.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E
25|$|FPSs {{naturally}} {{lend themselves}} to separate and simultaneous control of the player's movement and aim, and on computers this has traditionally been achieved {{with a combination of}} keyboard and mouse. Players use the X-axis of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, and the Y-axis for <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down; the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart of}} Dunedin City {{is a central}} plain {{surrounded}} by hills, {{the remnants of a}} long-extinct volcano. Calton Hill lies around 6km to the southwest of the city centre (The Octagon); line of sight with Calton Hill from the Octagon is obscured by a large hill spur heading east from the main ridge line that forms the western edge of central Dunedin. <b>Looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> to the west from the southern end of Dunedin's central plain, Calton Hill is the most northern prominence.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Lawson had {{established}} {{herself on the}} stage as a musical comedy star, able to earn fifty to sixty British pounds a week, and in 1933 she entered into the British film industry. Though she eventually acted {{in more than a}} dozen films, her screen career never matched her stage success. Her first major role was as Susie in Colonel Blood, which starred Frank Cellier. The most successful film that Lawson had a role in was the 1935 production of Scrooge, which starred Seymour Hicks and Donald Calthrop. She also appeared in films that included in their cast such notable actors as Stanley Holloway in D'Ye Ken John Peel? and Cotton Queen, Will Fyffe in Cotton Queen, and Vivien Leigh in Things Are <b>Looking</b> <b>Up,</b> <b>and</b> Bud Flanagan in A Fire Has Been Arranged. Lawson's last film was Oh Boy! in 1938.|$|E
500|$|Lionel Andrés Messi {{was born}} on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four {{children}} of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from Marche and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, [...] "Leo" [...] developed {{a passion for the}} sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.|$|E
2500|$|Jessica {{stood in}} the center of the hall [...] <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply {{recessed}} windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters' Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone. Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood. She thought not.|$|E

2500|$|This {{old joke}} {{has become part}} of the {{folklore}} of the hall, but its origins remain a mystery. According to The New York Times, the main player in the story has been described at various times as either an unnamed man, violinist Jascha Heifetz or the pianist Arthur Rubinstein. On its webpage, Carnegie Hall quotes the wife of violinist Mischa Elman as having perhaps the best story of its origin: [...] "One day, after a rehearsal that hadn’t pleased Elman, the couple was leaving Carnegie Hall by the backstage entrance when they were approached by two tourists looking for the hall’s entrance. Seeing his violin case, they asked, 'How do you get to Carnegie Hall?' Without <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> continuing on his way, Elman simply replied, 'Practice.'" ...|$|E
