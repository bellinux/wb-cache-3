Bioremediation success at these sites {{in the past has}} been gauged by the decrease in total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations to less than 10, 000 mg/kg measured using EPA Method 418. 1. We tested the “molarity of ethanol droplet” (MED) water repellency test as a rapid indicator of TPH concentration in soil at one <b>landfarm</b> near Bradford, PA. MED was estimated by determining the minimum ethanol concentration (0 – 6 M) required to penetrate air-dried and sieved soil samples within 10 sec. TPH in soil was analyzed by rapid fluorometric analysis of methanol soil extracts, which correlated well with EPA Method 1664. Uncontaminated <b>landfarm</b> site soil amended with increasing concentrations of waste oil sludge showed a high correlation between MED and TPH. MED values exceeded the upper limit of 6 M as TPH estimates exceed ca. 25, 000 mg/kg. MED and TPH at the land farm were sampled monthly during summer months over two years in a grid pattern that allowed spatial comparisons of site remediation effectiveness. MED and TPH decreased at a constant rate over time and remained highly correlated. Inexpensive alternatives to reagent-grade ethanol gave comparable results.

40|$|Presence of {{petroleum}} contaminants in soil may be toxic to human and organisms {{and act as}} a source of ground water contamination; hence, remediation of these compounds from environment is vital. In this study, first the feasibility of remediation of two petroleum-contaminated soil samples around Tehran Oil Refinery (oil refinery landfill and agricultural soils) was assessed using <b>landfarming</b> technique during a four month experimental period. The elimination of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) from soils treated through <b>landfarming</b> technique was then investigated in the rhizosphere of agropyron and fescue. The results showed that microbial respiration increased due to <b>landfarming</b> processes in both soils. Urease activity in the <b>landfarming</b> treatment for agricultural soil was 21, 45, 26, and 23 % higher than the control at the end of first to the 4 th months of experiment, respectively. However, no significant differences were observed between the <b>landfarming</b> and control treatments for landfill soil at the end of experiment. Furthermore, about 50 and 57 % reduction in TPH-concentration was observed in the <b>landfarming</b> treatment for landfill and agricultural soils at the end of experiment, respectively.

40|$|Landfarming is used {{to treat}} {{petroleum}} hydrocarbon–contaminated soils {{and a variety of}} waste streams from industrial operations. Wastes are applied to a soil surface and indigenous soil microorganisms utilize the hydrocarbons in the applied waste as a carbon source for metabolism, thereby biodegrading the applied material.

To assist in better defining atmospheric releases of total hydrocarbons from landfarms treating petroleum hydrocarbons, a flux gradient micrometeorological approach was developed and integrated with a custom-built total hydrocarbon detector, and a novel air sampling system and averaging algorithm.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{removal of}} petroleum products using <b>landfarming</b> {{has been applied}} commercially in large scale with relative success. The technology has been widely used due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.

These includes requirements for large land area for treatment, availability of the pollutant degrading bacteria, effectiveness of the technology at high constituent concentration (more than 50, 000 ppm), improved concentration reductions in cases requiring more than 95 % of pollution reduction and the flexibility of the technology in integrating the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons with other contaminants that may occur with the petroleum products...|$|R

40|$|Improper use {{of natural}} resources, {{especially}} soil, causes its degradation and severe soil erosion. Water erosion {{is an important factor}} causing soil degradation. Land use change of pasture would result in severe soil erosion mainly due to the reduction of vegetation cover and also surface soil disturbance. The objectives of this study were to estimate the amount of sediment, runoff and nutrient loss in four different land uses including a pasture with good vegetation cover (> 20 %), a pasture with poor vegetation cover (< 10 %), a currently being used dryland farm and a degraded dryland farm which is not used. Soil samples were taken from the depth of 0 – 10 cm in a completely randomized design with four replications. A rainfall simulator was run for two hours to estimate the amount of sediment, runoff and nutrient loss. Organic matter, total N, available P and distribution of particles size in soil and sediment were measured. The results showed that a very high degradation has occurred in the area mostly due to water erosion created as a result of overgrazing in pasture, susceptibility of geological formations and more importantly, the change of land use pasture to inefficient dryland farming. Maximum and minimum runoff was observed in the abandoned dry <b>landfarm</b> and pasture with good vegetation cover, respectively. Maximum sediment content was observed in dryland farm. Sediment content in dryland farm, abandoned dry <b>landfarm</b> and pasture with poor vegetation cover were 54. 5, 21 and 10. 4 times more than that in the pasture with good vegetation cover, respectively. Enrichment ratio (ER) of soil particles in sediment was highest for fine silt (2 - 5 µm), followed by clay. A minimum of ER was obtained for sand fraction. Percentages of organic matter, total N and available P in sediment were higher in the first hour as compared to the second one.

It is important to reveal the controlling factors on the field for optimal selection of remediation strategy. In this study, an integrated field <b>landfarming</b> technique was carried out to assess the relative effectiveness of five biological approaches on diesel degradation. The limiting factors during the degradation process were discussed. Method A total of five treatments were tested, including conventional <b>landfarming,</b> nutrient enhancement (NE), biosurfactant addition (BS), bioaugmentation (BA), and combination of bioaugmentation and biosurfactant addition (BAS). The consortium consisted of four diesel-degrading bacteria strains. Rhamnolipid {{was used as the}} biosurfactant. The diesel concentration, bacterial population, evolution of CO(2), and bacterial community in the soil were periodically measured. Results The best overall degradation efficiency was achieved by BAS treatment (90 +/- 2 %), followed by BA (86 +/- 2 %), NE (84 +/- 3 %), BS (78 +/- 3 %), and conventional <b>landfarming</b> (68 +/- 3 %).

40|$|This Remedial Investigation (RI) Report {{characterizes the}} nature and extent of contamination, evaluates the fate and {{transport}} of contaminants, and assesses risk to human health and the environment resulting from waste disposal and other US Department of Energy (DOE) operations in Bear Creek Valley (BCV). BCV, which is located within the DOE Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) encompasses multiple waste units containing hazardous and radioactive wastes arising from operations at the adjacent Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant. The primary waste units discussed in this RI Report are the S- 3 Site, Oil <b>Landfarm</b> (OLF), Boneyard/Burnyard (BYBY), Sanitary Landfill 1 (SL 1), and Bear Creek Burial Grounds (BCBG). These waste units, plus the contaminated media resulting from environmental transport of the wastes from these units, are the subject of this RI. This BCV RI Report represents the first major step in the decision-making process for the BCV watershed. The RI results, in concert with the follow-on FS will form the basis for the Proposed Plan and Record of Decision for all BCV sites. This comprehensive decision document process will meet the objectives of the watershed approach for BCV. Appendix A includes descriptions of waste areas and estimates of the current compositions of the wastes. Appendix B contains an extensive database of environmental data for the Bear Creek Valley Characterization Area. Information is also presented about the number and location of samples collected, the analytes examined, and the extent of data validation. Appendix C describes the hydrogeologic conceptual model for Bear Creek Valley. This model is one of the principal components of the conceptual site models for contaminant transport in BCV...|$|E

Are the results of these investigations sufficient to solve the problem? Based on several investigations of <b>landfarming</b> at Wageningen-UR and Utah State University, it is concluded that under proper conditions, PAH-degrading microorganisms are present and active in contaminated soils. However, long periods of time (e. g., up to 14 years) may be necessary to degrade the PAHs to sufficiently low concentrations. If locations for passive <b>landfarming</b> without active tilling or irrigation are available for use for long periods of time, it is possible to remediate PAH-contaminated soils and sediments in such a way that the remediated soil can be reused again, thereby solving the contamination problems...|$|R

The isolation of these microorganisms was carried out beforehand, assuming that they would be better adapted to petroleum hydrocarbons, as the <b>landfarming</b> consisted of an area impacted by the deposit of such compounds. The Bartha and Pramer respirometric test was used to measure the rate of biodegradation of the hydrocarbons by the mixed-culture of microorganisms via the evolution of CO 2. The results obtained with respect to the efficiency of biodegradation showed no significant differences (P> 0. 05), indicating no increase in the biodegradation process using the inoculum. The addition of nutrients (N, P, K) also did not contribute to an increase in biodegradation of the oil residue studied...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is {{currently}} developing a Proposed Plan (PP) for remediation of designated sources of chlorinated solvents that contribute contamination to the Southwest (SW) Groundwater Plume at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), in Paducah, KY. The principal contaminants in the SW Plume are trichloroethene (TCE) and other {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs); these industrial solvents were used and disposed in various facilities and locations at PGDP. In the SW plume area, residual TCE sources are primarily in the fine-grained sediments of the Upper Continental Recharge System (UCRS), a partially saturated zone that delivers contaminants downward into the coarse-grained Regional Gravel Aquifer (RGA). The RGA serves as the significant lateral groundwater transport pathway for the plume. In the SW Plume area, the four main contributing TCE source units are: (1) Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 1 / Oil Landfarm; (2) C- 720 Building TCE Northeast Spill Site (SWMU 211 A); (3) C- 720 Building TCE Southeast Spill Site (SWMU 211 B); and (4) C- 747 Contaminated Burial Yard (SWMU 4). The PP presents the Preferred Alternatives for remediation of VOCs in the UCRS at the Oil <b>Landfarm</b> and the C- 720 Building spill sites. The basis for the PP is documented in a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) (DOE, 2011) and a Site Investigation Report (SI) (DOE, 2007). The SW plume {{is currently}} {{within the boundaries of}} PGDP (i. e., does not extend off-site). Nonetheless, reasonable mitigation of the multiple contaminant sources contributing to the SW plume is one of the necessary components identified in the PGDP End State Vision (DOE, 2005).

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{to make the}} first set of measurements documenting the potential for emissions of pollutants from exploration and production (E&P) waste disposal facilities at Bourg, Louisiana and Bateman Island, Louisiana. The objective of the project was to quantify the emissions and to determine whether the measured emissions were potentially harmful to human health of workers and the adjacent community. The study, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) is designed to complement additional studies funded by Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LADNR) and the American Petroleum Institute. The distinguishing feature {{of this study is that}} actual, independent field measurements of emissions were used to assess the potential problems of this disposal technology. Initial measurements were made at the Bourg, LA facility, adjacent to the community of Grand Bois in late 1998 -early 1999. Emission measurements were performed using aluminum chambers placed over the surface of the <b>landfarm</b> cells. Air was pulled through the chambers and the concentration of the contaminants in the air exiting the chambers was measured. The contaminants of interest were the ''BTEX'' compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), commonly found in E&P wastes and hydrogen sulfide, a noxious gas present naturally in many E&P wastes and crude oils. Measurements indicated that emissions were measurable using the techniques developed for the study. However, when the air concentrations of these contaminants that developed above the <b>landfarm</b> cells were compared with standards for workers from the Occupational and Safety and Health Association (''OSHA'') and for communities (Louisiana's ambient air standards), levels were not of concern. Since amounts of wastes being processed by the Bourg facility were considerably lower than normal, a decision was made to continue the study at the Bateman Island facility near Morgan City, LA. This facility was receiving more normal loadings of E&P wastes. Additional emission measurements were made at the Bateman Island facility within cells over a range of ''ages'', from those most recently loaded with E&P wastes to cells that have not received wastes for 9 months or more. As expected the greatest chance for emissions when the cell is most recently loaded. Again, measured fluxes did not produce air concentrations that were of concern. As expected, the highest fluxes were observed in the cells that had recently received wastes and older cells had very low emissions. Measurements of emissions of hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) were also conducted at these two facilities. Levels of emissions were similar to the xange observed in the literature for natural salt marshes that surround these facilities. Production of sulfide within the cells was also measured by the most sensitive techniques available and measured sulfide production rates were low in the samples tested. The only potential concern at the facility with regards to sulfide was the levels of sulfide emitted from the sumps. The facility logbook at Bourg was analyzed to determine a time sequence of activities over 1998 - 1999. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality conducted a time-series of air concentrations for hazardous air pollutants during this period at the fenceline of the Bourg facility. These data were characterized by periods of static concentrations interspersed with peaks. A series of peaks were analyzed and compared with logbook records for the activities occurring at the time. In reverse fashion, a set of activities documented by the logbook was examined and the concentrations of benzene that developed from these activities were documented. No direct correlation could be made with the observed peaks and any activities suggesting that concentrations of benzene at the fenceline may be the result of a complex suite of activities including onsite activities not documented in the logbook (loading of the cells by truck haulers) and offsite activities (automobile traffic). Based on these results several recommendations were made. These include maintaining loading of wastes at rates observed during the study period and further evaluating sulfide emissions from the sump system. A scientifically based cell management approach that would maintain benzene levels below levels of concern is possible based on the simple emission models calibrated during this study. However, measured emission rates and long-term records of air concentrations near the facilities suggest that this is not necessary at present...|$|E

In some groups of animals, such as birds, oil exposure seems to alter blood parameters, while this relationship is poorly understood in rodents. The study aimed to investigate alterations in hematological profile in the wild rodent Calomys laucha exposed to crude oil contaminated soils. In this study, males specimens of Calomys laucha were exposed for 14 days to two soils contaminated by petroleum: (I) <b>landfarming</b> soil, coming from a bioremediation area of contaminated soil from a Petrochemical Complex through <b>landfarming</b> technique and (II) soil of a simulated oil spill in laboratory conditions. The animals were exposed individually in cages containing 1 kg soil with free access to food and water. Control animals were exposed to an artificial uncontaminated soil. At the end of the experiment, animals were anesthetized and blood was collected for hematological profile. The animals exposed to soil <b>landfarming</b> had significant {{reduction in the number of}} bands, segmented, eosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and increased red cell distribution width (RDW), while animals exposed to simulated soil spillage in laboratory had decreased number of bands, but an increase in the number of lymphocytes and platelets. These changes in hemostasis may indicate an early stage of the development of associated pathologies, while the hematological profile can be used as a crude oil exposure-related marker in wild rodents...|$|R

40|$|When {{applying}} <b>landfarming</b> for the remediation {{of contaminated}} soil and sediment, {{a fraction of}} the soil-bound contaminant is rapidly degraded; however, a residual concentration may remain, which slowly degrades. Degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and mineral oil can be described using a multi-compartment model and first-order kinetics, in which three degradable fractions are distinguished; (1) rapid, (2) slowly, and (3) very slowly degradable. Using this model populated with data from long-term experiments (initiated in 1990), it is shown that time frames from years to decades can be necessary to clean the soil or sediment to obtain a target below regulatory guidelines. In passive <b>landfarms</b> without active management, three principal potentially limiting factors can be identified: (1) availability of appropriate microorganisms, (2) supply of oxygen for the biodegradation process, and (3) bioavailability of the pollutants to the microorganisms. Bioavailable PAHs and mineral oil are readily biodegradable contaminants under aerobic conditions, and presence and activity of microorganisms are not problems. The other two factors can be limiting and are theoretically described. Using these descriptions, which are in agreement with field experiments of 10 to 15 yr, it is shown if and when optimization of the biodegradation process is an option. Because a long time period is necessary to degrade the slowly and very slowly degradable fractions, passive <b>landfarming</b> should be combined with beneficial use of the land area. Examples include the development of natural environments, use in constructions, growing of biomass for energy production, including biofuels, and use as cover for landfill...|$|R
