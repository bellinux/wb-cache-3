40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two {{different aspects of}} human capital accumulation: early childhood development and tertiary education. Specifically, it analyzes the role that public policies or changes in regulations affect incentives of agents {{in a way that}} ends up affecting the aggregate endowment of human capital in an economy. ^ The first chapter is related to early childhood development. Recent literature has shown that skills shaped during childhood have long lasting consequences later in life. This fact has promoted a large number of programs aimed at stimulating the skill formation process for children in disadvantage. However, little is known about how cost-effective are these policies. In this chapter I evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three alternative policies aimed at improving the living standards of families in disadvantage: cash transfers, childcare subsidies, and subsidies for child investments. I find that subsidies promoting child investments are much more productive than the other two alternatives. ^ In the second chapter, co-authored with David Zarruk, we analyze the consequences that subsidized loans for higher education have on the quality of education offered by colleges {{in the context of a}} developing country. We find that subsidized student <b>loan</b> <b>policies</b> lead to a widening gap in the quality of services provided by higher education institutions. This happens because the demand for elite institutions unambiguously increases when individuals can borrow. This does not happen in non-elite institutions, since relaxing borrowing constraints makes some individuals move from non-elite to elite institutions. The higher increase in demand for elite institutions allows them to increase prices and investment per student. If investment and average student ability are complementary inputs in the quality production function, elite universities also increase their acceptance cut-offs. In this new equilibrium, the differentiation of the product offered by colleges increases, where elite universities provide higher quality education to high-ability students and non-elite universities offer lower quality to less-able students. We calibrate the model to Colombia, which implemented massive student <b>loan</b> <b>policies</b> during the last decade and experienced an increase in the gap of quality of education provided by elite and non-elite universities. We show that the increase in the quality gap can be a by-product of the subsidized <b>loan</b> <b>policies.</b> Such results show that, when analyzed in a general equilibrium setting, subsidized <b>loan</b> <b>policies</b> can have negative effects in equilibrium. ...|$|R

The two fight, while accidentally hitting Father Pascal in the process. Chetan and Bhagat {{eventually}} get unconscious, and wake up to find Pascal beaten up(by the cons themselves), and Khushi is missing. Soon, Anthony greets the two cons, and tells them that he has kidnapped Khushi. If they want her, they need to give him the money that they stole from him in 24 hours. The two first go to a local bank in Bangkok, and tries to tell the bankers to give them money. The bankers get confused by what they mean, and tells them about their <b>loan</b> <b>policy.</b> Soon, a group of real robbers come to the bank. One of them insults Bhagat and Chetan, and the two fight back, taking out all the robbers in the process. As the cons try to leave with the cash, a banker stops them and asks for it back. Later, they steal money dressed as Santa, and goes to Anthony's plane. Anthony gives them Khushi. When the cons ask Khushi who does she love more, she goes straight to Anthony. The two cons were actually conned by Anthony, Khushi(Anthony's girlfriend), Father Pascal(Khushi's real father),and BBC(A friend of Anthony).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between the structure of a bank’s board of directors and the bank’s loan portfolio choice (holdings of agricultural, real estate, consumer, and commercial and industrial loans). The board of directors has the responsibility to monitor the <b>loan</b> <b>policy</b> of the bank; therefore, the structure of the board seems likely to influence the portfolio of loans that the bank has outstanding. However, financial institutions are unique in that they have additional external regulatory agencies that also monitor managerial behavior and actions. By means of this logic, bank boards should not influence <b>loan</b> <b>policy.</b> Using a sample of over 300 bank holding companies in 1997, we show evidence consistent with both arguments. First, growth in C&I loans as a percent of total assets is inversely related to the proportion of outsiders on the BHC board. Second, both proportion of outsiders and a board strength index are directly related to growth in consumer loans as a percent of total assets. Third, farm, and to a lesser extent, real estate, loan holdings are not related to bank board structure. Fourth, changes in consumer and C&I lending does not consistently explain the BHC’s future performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{that can be}} used by insurers to construct predictive models for their own insurance cash flows. The insurance cash flow components evaluated include premium flows, <b>policy</b> <b>loans,</b> and cash value surrenders. Also, the paper evaluates several hypotheses in the insurance literature that attempt to explain insurance cash flows. Though the results are theoretically consistent, they produce some interesting contrasts to findings of similar studies for whole life policies. For example, these results confirm that: (i) the credited rate strategy is important to policy performance; (ii) the emergency fund hypothesis appears to apply to <b>policy</b> <b>loan</b> utilization, premium payments, and total insurance cash flows; (iii) the arbitrage potential with regard to <b>policy</b> <b>loans</b> is reduced; and (iv) direct recognition of <b>policy</b> <b>loans</b> seems to be effective in reducing the disintermediation risk of traditional whole life insurance policies with fixed <b>policy</b> <b>loan</b> rates. Although policyholders do increase their use of <b>policy</b> <b>loans</b> as inflation increases, the overall results suggest that they tend to increase contributions to their universal life policies in order to maintain levels of protection in real terms. Finally, interest rate risk does exist for companies issuing universal life because changes in market interest rates lead to decreases in premiums and in total insurance cash flows. This lends support to the alternative funds hypothesis...|$|R
