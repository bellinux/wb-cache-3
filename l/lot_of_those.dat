He started the Rene Bourque Hockey Fund with the goal of providing hockey equipment to underprivileged kids, and has appeared as a spokesman for Native Americans in sport at youth symposiums.

As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ...

[...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism.

[...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve".

[...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive."

In June 2008, Ryan Gosling was in talks to join the film for the lead role to play Woodroof, but couldn't take the role. In 2009, producer Brenner sent the script to actor Matthew McConaughey and got him involved to star in the film. Wondering whether the Texas native was interested in playing another Texas native (he's originally from Uvalde), Brenner says that he asked himself: Who is Ron Woodroof?' And in my mind, it was Matthew. Like Ron, he's from Dallas, he's handsome, and he has a twinkle in the eye. Matthew also has intensity and intelligence like Ron did, mixed with that cowboy charisma and fighter's spirit. He was beyond perfect for the role." [...] Writer Borten said: [...] "Ron was a very charismatic, funny and persuasive, a real salesman. Even if he was making fun of you, you wanted him to continue because he was so charming. Matthew possesses a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> same qualities." [...] On March 9, 2011, Los Angeles Times confirmed that McConaughey would star in the film as Woodroof and quoted McConaughey as saying: [...] "It's a great script and a great story. And I think it can be a great movie." [...] Woodroof's sister Sharon Woodroof Braden was reportedly pleased with the casting of McConaughey as Woodroof because he had a similar swagger and personality. She had shown concern earlier in the development process when Pitt and Gosling were attached, due to their personalities not matching Woodroof's.|$|E
500|$|After E.T., Spielberg {{started to}} consult experts, and put more {{scientific}} research into his science fiction films.

He wanted to consult with the group to create a plausible [...] "future reality" [...] for the year 2054 {{as opposed to a}} more traditional [...] "science fiction" [...] setting.

Production designer Alex McDowell kept what was nicknamed the [...] "2054 bible", an 80-page guide created in preproduction which listed all the aspects of the future world: architectural, socio-economic, political, and technological. While the discussions did not change key elements in the film, they were influential in the creation of some of the more utopian aspects, though John Underkoffler, the science and technology advisor for the film, described it as [...] "much grayer and more ambiguous" [...] than what was envisioned in 1999. Underkoffler, who designed most of Anderton's interface after Spielberg told him to make it [...] "like conducting an orchestra", said [...] "it would be hard to identify anything [...] that had no grounding in reality." [...] McDowell teamed up with architect Greg Lynn to work on some of the technical aspects of the production design.

[...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night.

In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them."
