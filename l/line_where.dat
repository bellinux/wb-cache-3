5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and returned it to the 10-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard <b>line</b> <b>where</b> the Wolfpack began a drive.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Georgia Tech 15-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Yellow Jackets began their first offensive possession. On the first two plays of the game, Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones escaped the Clemson defense for gains of 21 yards and 22 yards, respectively. Those plays advanced the Yellow Jackets to the Clemson 42-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> Georgia Tech began advancing by small gains. In three plays, Georgia Tech gained a first down, but two subsequent plays lost yardage before kicker Scott Blair came onto the field to attempt—and convert—a 48-yard field goal. The score narrowed Clemson's lead to 7–3 with the quarter exactly half elapsed.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's defense {{also held}} fast {{on the next}} possession, and Tech was unable to gain a first down {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up a first down in Tech territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first down once on the Tech {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 21-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> Tech began its third possession of the second half. Tech picked up a first down via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|The post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Clemson 30-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> it was fumbled. The loose football jetted forward and was recovered by a Clemson player at the 34-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Tigers' offense began another drive. The first play of the possession was a nine-yard pass from Dantzler to Kelly, and {{it was followed by}} a shovel pass to Kelly, who gained a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. From there, Kantzler ran straight ahead for 27 yards and a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. After two incomplete passes, Clemson completed a five-yard false-start penalty. A one-yard run by Dantzler was followed by an unsuccessful fourth-down conversion attempt. Dantzler attempted a pass downfield, but the ball was intercepted by Ronyell Whitaker, who returned the ball to the Tech 32-yard line.|$|E
5|$|UConn's {{turnover}} woes {{continued on}} their next possession when, on their second play from scrimmage after receiving Buffalo's kickoff, Tyler Lorenzen was sacked, {{causing him to}} fumble the ball. The Bulls recovered and drove down the field to the UConn 12-yard <b>line</b> <b>where</b> they were stopped. Principe kicked a 29-yard field goal giving Buffalo back the lead, at 13–10.|$|E

Such conditions are thought to exist in the inner 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{from their}} 26-yard line after a kickoff, Clemson {{attempted}} to again cut into Tech's lead. The Tigers, again {{guided by the}} running offense of Spiller and Jamie Harper, advanced to the 37-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> Parker's passing attack took over. Parker completed two passes before Georgia Tech defender Jerrard Tarrant ran {{in front of a}} long throw downfield. He intercepted Parker's pass and returned it 50 yards to the Clemson 28, where Tech's offense began anew. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down but still was within range of a 40-yard field goal from Blair, who extended the Yellow Jackets' lead to 33–20.|$|E
5|$|Clemson fielded {{the opening}} kickoff at the two-yard line and {{returned}} it to their 25-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Tigers' offense performed the game's first offensive play, a one-yard scramble by Dantzler. A subsequent running play and an incomplete pass caused Clemson to go three-and-out before punting. Clemson punter Jamie Somaini mishandled the ball, however, and Virginia Tech's defense tackled him at the Tigers' 23-yard line. On Tech's first play after the turnover, quarterback Michael Vick completed a 23-yard pass to Jared Ferguson for a touchdown. The extra point kick by Carter Warley was successful, and Virginia Tech had a 70 lead with 13:23 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} the LVDS {{transmitter}} consumes a constant current also places much less demand on the power supply decoupling and thus produces less interference in the power and ground lines of the transmitting circuit. This reduces or eliminates phenomena such as ground bounce which are typically seen in terminated single-ended transmission <b>lines</b> <b>where</b> high and low logic levels consume different currents, or in non-terminated transmission <b>lines</b> <b>where</b> a current appears abruptly during switching.|$|R
5|$|FM1957 {{begins at}} FM471 near Rio Medina, as a two-lane country road. It then {{traverses}} mostly rural, undeveloped land, {{before reaching the}} Bexar–Medina county <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> it becomes Potranco Road. In far western Bexar County, Potranco Road travels through recently built, patchy, residential developments. Development becomes somewhat heavier after the highway passes State Highway211 (SH211), but FM1957 still displays mostly rural characteristics until the highway reaches Loop1604, at which point it enters the San Antonio city limits. Now five lanes wide, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, the legislative definition of FM1957 becomes UR1957; however, Potranco Road remains signed as FM1957.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State {{returned}} {{the ball to}} the 27-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short run to the right. On the next play, NC State picked up the game's first first down with a rush up the middle by fullback Mal Crite. Crite picked up another first down on the next play, driving the Wolfpack inside Virginia Tech territory, but the Hokies' defense stiffened and forced the Wolfpack to punt after NC State failed to gain another first down. Tech {{returned the}} punt to its 21-yard <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> the Tech offense took over. On Virginia Tech's first offensive play, running back Maurice Williams broke free for a 77-yard run that took the Hokies inside the one-yard line of NC State. The run was the longest of Williams' career and is a Peach Bowl record for longest play from scrimmage. Two plays later, Virginia Tech's Eddie Hunter crossed the goal line and scored the game's first points. The touchdown and extra point made the score 70, Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In Granville, NY22 was {{originally}} routed on Quaker, Main, and North streets. It was rerouted {{in the mid-1960s}} to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village.

From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state <b>line,</b> <b>where</b> it connected to VT30B, a spur route of VT30 {{that had been in}} place since 1935. Vermont renumbered VT30B to VT149 at this time to match the highway it now connected to in New York.|$|E
