40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass {{using for}} energy {{production}} must fulfil a condition: low {{costs in the}} production, in the compilation, in the storage and in the previous processing to the transformation in easily usable fuel. If we take into account this condition can be intuited that a high moisture content in the corn residues {{create a lot of}} problems like the increasing on the transport expenses, the difficulty of the transformation into quality fuel and the reduction of the yields in processes of thermochemistry conversion since the maximum calorific value which biomass can provide is when it has a void moisture content. Lignocellulosic biomass usually presents a moisture content around of 50 %, the intervals accepted for its utilization at thermochemistry conversion are between 20 % and 5 %. To the forced drying of the lignocellulosic biomass, the most used <b>drying</b> <b>rooms</b> are: the rotary drum drying, the pneumatic drying or fluid bed drying. The drying temperatures experienced in this type of <b>drying</b> <b>rooms</b> are from 90 º C until 165 º C and the speeds of the drying air vary between 1, 50 to 2, 50 m · s- 1 [1].

Clay would arrive into the area via a short gauge rail line in the warehouse.

40|$|Presented at the 21 st International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2015), July 6 - 10, 2015, Graz, Styria, Austria. We report three {{experiments}} {{measuring the}} upper limits, defined as auditory velocity thresholds beyond which listeners {{are no longer}} able to perceptually resolve a smooth circular trajectory in various reverberate conditions. These thresholds were measured for white noise, band-limited white noise and band-limited white noise mixed with a pure tone, in different reverberation conditions: acoustically <b>dry</b> <b>room,</b> two simulated source-image-based reverberations and natural reverberation with different configurations of loudspeaker arrays. Experiment 1 took place in a <b>dry</b> <b>room</b> and thresholds were measured with and without a reverberation simulation of an actual reverberant room. In Experiment 2, various simulated reverberation parameters were tested in the same <b>dry</b> <b>room,</b> and two different loudspeaker configurations were tested in a reverberant room. Experiment 3 investigated the effect of audio source type in simulated reverberation condition and for high velocities. No significant effects were observed among reverberation conditions, suggesting that the upper limit is robust against reverberation...|$|R

In this paper, a typical apartment was selected to simulate indoor thermal and wet environment all the year around of two conditions of with and without <b>drying</b> <b>room</b> on the roofs, and indoor operating temperature and relative humidity in typical months and typical days were analyzed. As a result, in summer indoor operating temperature could be lower than those without <b>drying</b> <b>rooms</b> by a maximum reduction of 2. 46 °C, improving thermal and wet environment effectively, due to which human thermal comfort was better accordingly. However in winter because of <b>drying</b> <b>room's</b> sheltering of {{solar radiation}}, indoor operating temperature was slightly lower that without air-drying shelter on the roof, unfavorable to improve indoor thermal environment. Taking local long and hot summer into comprehensive consideration, local air-drying shelter was helpful {{for the improvement of}} indoor thermal environment throughout the year...|$|R

Natural drying exactly economical, because didn 2 ̆ 7 t need many {{instrumentation}} and costs, but it is depend on nature. However, drying product less hygienic because susceptible concerning manure and growing microorganism. Beside that, drying can only be effective at dry season with necessity time about one week.
