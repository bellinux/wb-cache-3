5|$|Since 1994, the Wonderbra has {{expanded}} from the single push-up design into a full-range <b>lingerie</b> fashion label {{in most of}} the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal. In its native Canada, however, the brand promotes the functional qualities of its products—a departure from the strategy that made Wonderbra the top-seller in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s HOM, the French {{manufacturer}} of upscale underwear for men, was purchased {{and has since}} continued as a trademark within the company. The headquarters was located in Marseille. In early 2015, HOM was sold to the Austrian Huber Group, as Triumph wanted to streamline its portfolio. Valisère is the label for upper segment products, which beginning in 2007 became also available in Germany and was used primarily for luxury <b>lingerie.</b> Since 2014, Triumph International no longer uses the Valisère brand in the European market. Instead, the company focuses on Triumph Essence in the premium segment.|$|E
5|$|The clip commences with {{a police}} car {{arriving}} at the heating power plant, followed by Stan lying on a bed surrounded by surveillance cameras, sporting black <b>lingerie.</b> She is then introduced wearing a black hat and white shirt with a tie, while a crowd {{of male and female}} dancers perform a synchronized choreography. Following this, Stan makes an appearance wearing a white dress, and {{a police car}} is shown arriving. Subsequently, two policemen {{get out of the car}} in order to search for Stan. However, they do not find her in the bed and the video ends with Stan leaving the building and the men watching material recorded by the surveillance cameras.|$|E
5|$|Triumph {{products}} are distributed both via trade partners and department stores, {{as well as}} in their own shops. By the end of 2011, the company had built a network of 2,000 stores in 120 countries, of which 800 are its own stores, 450 are franchises and 850 are run with other partners. The company {{is one of the largest}} <b>lingerie</b> retailers in Germany based on the number of branches. The largest branch in terms of retail space was opened in Dresden's Centrum Gallery in 2012. In addition, Triumph International operates several online stores. These were developed using a fulfillment service provider that is part of Arvato.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, <b>lingerie</b> and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} {{attempting}} {{to gain a}} foothold in the acting industry, Merryman worked simultaneously as a model for <b>lingerie,</b> and a waitress, and was featured in Playboy. The show chronicled her audition process for a horror film, and a role in the television soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. She successfully landed a role during Desperately Seeking Stardom, on the television show Baywatch. Merryman subsequently gained a part on the television series Veronica's Closet. In 2000, Merryman was selected for a photo shoot by American photographer Mark Daughn; her pictures were used to advertise the Internet company Bomis. Daughn's photographs of Merryman also appeared in Mystique Magazine in January 2003, alongside models including: Aria Giovanni, Sunny Leone, Lisa Marie Scott, Natasha Yi, and Kalin Olson. She was featured in the book Mystique: Models of Mystique in the same year, photographed by Daughn.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sue Ellen {{goes into}} {{business}} by buying a partnership {{interest in a}} <b>lingerie</b> company.

Sue Ellen and J.R. enjoy a brief reconciliation; however, J.R.'s desire to regain Ewing Oil by {{having an affair with}} Kimberly Cryder destroys what is left of their marriage. Sue Ellen decides to leave J.R. for good, but he manages to take John Ross away and put him into hiding in a boarding school. Sue Ellen and her new lover, Nicholas Pearce, confront J.R. at his penthouse and demand he tell them where he hid John Ross.

In response, Sue Ellen shoots J.R. three times; however, he lives and neither she nor J.R. is indicted for any crimes.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the company}} has expanded, opening new stores of its own and {{acquiring}} competitors. In 2010, Triumph International acquired Beldona, the leading Swiss distributor of <b>lingerie,</b> and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States. In the latter country, Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer Journelle and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders. Since then, company stocks have no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, {{and the company is}} wholly owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families.|$|E
5|$|Sable briefly {{became a}} face again when she {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Playboy magazine (March 2004 issue) {{for the third time in}} her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in Playboy together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with Raw divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, even though all four women were faces at the time. The two teams squared off at WrestleMania XX in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a <b>lingerie</b> match. Sable and Wilson were victorious. The change was rumored to have occurred because Sable had suffered damage to her Breast Implants while Weightlifting.|$|E
5|$|The Bradley Center had {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 18,000, which was reduced for the event. This event grossed over $215,000 from an approximate attendance of 3,500. It also received 174,000 pay-per-view buys. Taboo Tuesday helped World Wrestling Entertainment earn $24.7million in revenue from pay-per-view events versus $18.5million the previous year, which was later confirmed by Linda McMahon on November 23, 2004 in a quarterly result. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the event 5 out of 10 stars. The rating {{was lower than}} the Taboo Tuesday event in 2005, which was rated 7 out of 10 stars. The Steel cage match was rated a ten of ten stars. The <b>Lingerie</b> Pillow Fight match was rated zero out of 10 stars.|$|E
5|$|The car {{stops in}} front of the club Crazy Horse. The {{following}} scenes show the singer emerging in a different set with a black background, as well as dancing atop a grand piano. Later, she is seen with female hands on her body as she dances seductively. Other scenes show her wearing <b>lingerie</b> and performing a pole dance with several other female dancers. Shortly afterwards, Beyoncé performs a choreographed chair dance across a purple background as Jay-Z is seen in the audience watching her while smoking a cigar. The end of the video shows the singer dancing with another woman next to her to a projected cheetah print. The last seconds cut to the breakfast table where Beyoncé is seen. For the video, the singer wears an archival corset by Christian Lacroix, lace gloves by Chanel, and a crystal mask by Atelier Swarovski.|$|E
5|$|The main Divas feud {{entering}} {{the event was}} between Christy Hemme and Carmella DeCesare, the two finalists in the Raw Diva Search. On the September 20 episode of Raw, Christy was announced as {{the winner of the}} Diva Search and received a one-year contract with WWE and $250,000. After the Diva Search, Carmella became a villainess and began a feud with Christy, due to jealousy of Christy winning the Diva Search. On the last edition of Raw before Taboo Tuesday, it was announced that Christy and Carmella would face each other at the pay-per-view with the fans choosing what type of match they would compete in. The choices were a <b>Lingerie</b> Pillow Fight, an Evening Gown Match, or an Aerobics Challenge. After the announcement was made, Carmella attacked Christy.|$|E
5|$|The show is {{a lavish}} event with {{elaborate}} costumed <b>lingerie,</b> varying music by leading entertainers, and set design according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracts hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top fashion models are selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this includes about a half dozen women under contract to the company, known as Victoria's Secret Angels, who help publicize the event. The giant angel wings worn by the models, {{as well as other}} wings of various forms and sizes such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, have become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret brand.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and <b>lingerie</b> walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E
5|$|With the {{takeover}} of two French name brands, HOM and Valisère, Triumph International ventured into the men's underwear and high-quality <b>lingerie</b> market. At the same time, the company announced in 1995 {{that in the future}} it would focus more on its Triumph umbrella brand, under which a number of brands would be classified. To that end, an advertising campaign was launched featuring Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen. In the 1990s, Triumph International launched another phase of international expansion, and since 1998 it has been present on the subcontinent of India. In 2001, its newest production facility opened in Dunaújváros (Hungary). After the turn of the millennium, Triumph {{was one of the biggest}} textile manufacturers in terms of sales in the domestic market.|$|E
5|$|After a long tenure on Monday nights, Keibler and Christy Hemme, {{were moved}} to SmackDown! on August 25, {{as part of a}} trade that brought Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle to Raw. On SmackDown! Keibler participated in <b>lingerie</b> matches and bikini contests. After a short absence, Keibler began a short feud with Jillian Hall, which led to the two having a match on Velocity, which Keibler lost. This would be Keibler's final match with WWE. Keibler then asked for time off to appear on Dancing with the Stars. During this time, Keibler's WWE.com profile was moved from SmackDown! to RAW, though she never made an {{appearance}} on the brand before leaving the company. Keibler's final mention on WWE programming occurred on the March 6, 2006 episode of RAW, where she was insulted by Candice Michelle for placing third on Dancing with the Stars during Michelle's unveiling of her Playboy magazine cover. After completing her stint on Dancing with the Stars, Keibler officially parted ways with WWE in July 2006 to move on to other endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Becky first {{appears in}} Coronation Street {{as a friend}} of local factory worker Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), whom she frames for theft at the Underworld <b>lingerie</b> factory. After betraying Kelly, she leaves the area for several months, {{returning}} later in the year when she meets former workmate Hayley Cropper, who is teaching an ex-offenders literacy class. Becky promises Hayley she will reform, and is offered a job at Roy's Rolls, the cafe owned and run by Hayley's partner, Roy. She doesn't change as promised and soon begins breaking the Croppers' property, threatening customers and stealing money from the till. Slug, a former acquaintance of Becky's, arrives in Weatherfield and the two joyride in the Croppers' newly acquired Morris Minor. Becky loses the couple's trust and her job. Hayley refuses Becky's apologies and when the cafe catches fire and Becky is rescued from the burning building, the Croppers assume she was responsible. Hayley apologises to Becky on learning that the fire was caused by an electrical fault and the two resume their friendship, with Becky re-employed at Roy's Rolls.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of <b>lingerie,</b> manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
