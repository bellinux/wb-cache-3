5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of <b>linear</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E

The higher LTE of many bulk nanocrystalline materials resulted from the porosity at their grain boundaries. However, many authors attributed the higher LTE of many nanocrystalline metal materials to their higher volume fraction of grain boundaries.|$|R

Flexible and transparent polyimide films were obtained upon thermal imidization of the precursor films on a substrate after residual solvent extraction from the precursor films by using adequate alcohols. Semi-aromatic PMDA/CHDA polyimide film displayed a considerably lower <b>linear</b> coefficient of <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> (CTE = 9. 6 ppm K 1) and {{a relatively low}} di-electric constant (2. 92). On the other hand, wholly cycloaliphatic CBDA/CHDA film attained a low CTE (26 ppm K 1) and a considerably lower dielectric constant (2. 66), simultaneously. Factors influencing the imidization-induced in-plane orientation, namely, effect of the steric structures of cycloaliphatic units are discussed in comparison with polyimides from hydrogenated PMDA (1, 2, 4, 5 -cyclohexanetetracarboxylic dianhydride).

40|$|In recent years, natural fiber-reinforced {{biodegradable}} thermoplastics {{are being}} {{recognized as an}} emerging new environmentally friendly material for industrial, commercial, and biomedical applications. Among different types of natural fibers, silk fiber is a common type of animal-based fiber, {{has been used for}} biomedical engineering and surgical operation applications for many years because of its biocompatible and bioresorbable properties. On the basis of our previous study, a novel biodegradable biocomposite for biomedical applications was developed by mixing chopped silk fiber and polylactic acid (PLA) through the injection molding process. This article is aimed at studying the dynamic mechanical and thermal properties of the composite in relation to its biodegradation effect.

Besides, the coefficient of <b>linear</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansions</b> (CLTE) of the composite was reduced by 28 %. This phenomenon was attributed to the fiber?matrix interaction that restricted the mobility of polymer chains adhered to the fiber surface, and consequently reduced the Tg and CLTE.

This result was mainly due to the increase of crystallinity of the composite during its degradation process. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
