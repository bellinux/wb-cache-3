40|$|Nitride {{compound}} {{materials are}} highly desirable for optoelectronic and power device applications {{due to their}} unique combinations of material properties. However due to the large <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatches</b> between AlN and GaN(2. 5 %), and between InN and GaN(11 %), growth of nitride devices which contains <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatched</b> multiple quantum well (MQW) structures remains a challenge. In this work the growth of III-Nitride by the MBE method is investigated, covering the growth of AlGaN/GaN Resonant tunneling Diode, the growth of In 0. 18 Al 0. 82 N that is lattice matched to GaN, and the fabrication of free standing GaN nanomembranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} HgSe grown by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE) are investigated for different <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatches</b> to the substrate and various growth conditions. The growth rate is shown to depend strongly on the growth temperature above lOO°C {{as well as on}} the Hg/Se flux ratio. It has been found that the crystalline perfection and the electrical properties are mainly determined by the layer thickness, especially for the growth on highly <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatched</b> substrates. Changes in the surface morphology are related to growth parameters. Differences between the electrical behavior of MBE-grown and bulk HgSe are discussed. The electrical properties of HgSe contacts on p-ZnSe are investigated as a function of different annealing procedures...|$|R
50|$|GaAs is <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatched</b> to {{germanium}} (Ge) by 0.08%. With {{the addition}} of 1.5% In to the alloy, InGaAs becomes perfectly latticed matched to Ge. The complete elimination of film stress reduces the defect densities of the epi-InGaAs layer compared to straight GaAs.|$|R

The crystal structure of γ" [...] is body-centered tetragonal (BCT), and the phase precipitates as 60 nm by 10 nm discs with the (001) planes in γ" [...] parallel to the {001} family in γ. These anisotropic discs form {{as a result of}} <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the BCT precipitate and the FCC matrix. This <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch</b> leads to high coherency strains which, together with order hardening, comprise the primary strengthening mechanisms. The γ" [...] phase is unstable above approximately 650 °C.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Grain boundaries=== Dislocations require proper lattice {{ordering}} to {{move through}} a material. At grain boundaries, there is a <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch,</b> and every atom that lies on the boundary is uncoordinated. This stops dislocations that encounter the boundary from moving.|$|E

50|$|The {{tensile test}} {{is widely used}} to study {{deformation}} mechanisms. This is because under compression, most materials will experience trivial (<b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch)</b> and non-trivial (buckling) events before plastic deformation or fracture occur. Hence the intermediate processes that occur to the material under uniaxial compression before the incidence of plastic deformation make the compressive test fraught with difficulties.|$|E
50|$|This {{method was}} {{employed}} {{without the use}} of LuAG seed on account of its unavailability and cost. Instead, the growth was performed using Yttrium aluminium garnet crystals with a minimal <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch</b> of 0.6%.

50|$|For optimal {{growth and}} {{resulting}} crystal quality, the crystal lattice constant a of each material must be closely matched, resulting in lattice-matched devices. This constraint has been relaxed somewhat in recently developed metamorphic solar cells which contain a small degree of <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch.</b> However, {{a greater degree}} of mismatch or other growth imperfections can lead to crystal defects causing a degradation in electronic properties.|$|E
50|$|Semiconductor materials, {{which are}} used to {{fabricate}} the superlattice structures, may be divided by the element groups, IV, III-V and II-VI. While group III-V semiconductors (especially GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs) have been extensively studied, group IV heterostructures such as the SixGe1−x system are {{much more difficult to}} realize because of the large <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch.</b> Nevertheless, the strain modification of the subband structures is interesting in these quantum structures and has attracted much attention.|$|E
50|$|The wetting layer {{serves as}} another {{parameter}} {{that can change}} the physics of a quantum dot. The thickness and composition {{determine the effect of}} the wetting layer on the quantum dot, however the thickness is usually roughly 0.5 nanometers.

Theoretically, due to the <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch,</b> finite thickness wetting layers are not stable and therefore admit some strain on the quantum dot.|$|E

40|$|Strain {{relief in}} <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatched</b> {{heteroepitaxy}} is mediated by formation and/or propagation of dislocations. Due to their technological significance, {{the process of}} strain relief in materials with face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices has been analyzed by several researchers 1, 2 following the work by Matthews and co-workers in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s 3 - 6. In the Matthews model, {{it is assumed that}} the strain relieved by any misfit dislocation is equal to the edge component of the dislocation burgers vector in the interface plane. This assumption has been used in all subsequent analyses of strain relief in <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatched</b> heteroepitaxy [1, 2]. Based upon the known three-dimensional atomic structure of the dislocations in fcc lattices, we show that the assumption is not valid for the 60 degree dislocations that form/expand via the conservative glide process. For compressively (tensilely) strained films the assumption is valid only for the 90 degree dislocations that form/expand via aggregation of vacancies (interstitials).

50|$|Transparent {{conductors}} are {{fragile and}} tend to break down due to fatigue. The most commonly used TCO is Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) because of its good electrical properties and ease of fabrication. However, these thin films are usually fragile and such problems as <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch</b> and stress-strain constraints lead to restrictions in possible uses for TCFs. ITO {{has been shown to}} degrade with time when subject to mechanical stresses. Recent increases in cost are also forcing many to look to carbon nanotube films as a potential alternative.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} perform bandgap {{engineering}} with InGaN over a range that provides a good spectral match to sunlight, makes InGaN suitable for solar photovoltaic cells. It is possible to grow multiple layers with different bandgaps, as the material is relatively insensitive to defects introduced by a <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the layers. A two-layer multijunction cell with bandgaps of 1.1 eV and 1.7 eV can attain a theoretical 50% maximum efficiency, and by depositing multiple layers tuned {{to a wide range}} of bandgaps an efficiency up to 70% is theoretically expected.|$|E

5000|$|Epitaxial strain is a {{critical}} factor in determining physical properties of thin films. The strain is usually stemmed from the <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatch</b> between film and substrate during epitaxial growth. Epitaxial strain in complex oxide has been widely studied to control functional properties when the film is within the “critical thickness”. In films beyond critical thickness, the strain is relaxed and functionality tuning by strain is not accessible. Researchers recently achieved very large strain in thick oxide films by incorporating nanowires/nanopillars in film matrix [...] http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600245.full.

40|$|The misfit {{stresses}} of metallorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} grown InGaAsP/InP heterostructure wafers were determined and their effects on the modulated mierostructures of InGaAsP epilayer were investigated. <b>Lattice</b> <b>mismatches</b> were measured using { 511 } asymmetric and (400) symmetric x-ray reflections.

Transmission electron microscopy results showed the presence of the modulated mierostructures (spinodal decomposition) in the epilayer. It was found that the modulation periodicity varies with the <b>lattice</b> <b>mismatches.</b> To investigate this observation, the interaction elastic energy induced by misfit stress was derived and used to explain the experimental results. Good agreement was obtained between the meas-ured and calculated modulation wavelength.
