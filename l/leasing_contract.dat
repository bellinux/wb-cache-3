Coast Air chose to continue operating the route between Bergen and Skien in their own name, and used the same aircraft and slot times. At Skien Airport, the Vildanden passengers were given the choice between Coast Air and Vildanden, and all nineteen chose Vildanden. On the return flight, three passengers chose each airline. Both aircraft flew to Skien, but due to heavy rain, only the aircraft from DAT was able to land. The passengers who had taken the Coast Air aircraft, were forced to land at Sandefjord Airport instead.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{research}} in this paper are automotive operating <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> in the Croatian business practice. The provisions of the {{general terms and conditions}} for operating <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> of the Croatian leasing companies are being analysed, particulary those relating to the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract after the operating <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> was terminated and the motor vehicle returned to the lessor. The existence of three contractual models of the automotive operating <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> in the Croatian business practice is established, which vary with regard to the assignment and the distribution of the residual value risk.

Simon Spies {{stated that they}} had been [...] "endlessly generous" [...] towards the Norwegian airline, and that they had suffered numerous delays ultimately caused by the airline's financial shortcomings. Conair had taken delivery of five equivalent aircraft and the company was therefore able to operate its own flights. Trans Polar had plans to quickly return to operations: the two remaining aircraft would be returned to Aer Lingus and three new aircraft would be purchased. This would be financed through conversion of debt to share capital and new investments from various shipping companies. Borgen emphasized that the market price for leasing aircraft had fallen and that the airline therefore could operate at a lower cost with new <b>leasing</b> <b>contract.</b> Once the airline was back on its feet, he believed Spies would return as a customer. Trans Polar informed its remaining customers on 22 May that it would terminate its flights.|$|E

2500|$|On August 31, Buchanan {{called a}} special session of the state {{legislature}} to consider the convict lease issue.

Another issue was what to do with convicts should the convict-leasing system be terminated. [...] After three weeks of debate, the legislature adjourned on September 21, taking little action other than making it a felony to interfere with the leasing system and authorizing the governor to take any necessary action to protect the system. [...] After this setback, the miners held out hope with the state's court system, which considered a case brought by the Tennessee Commissioner of Labor, George Ford, who claimed the poor conditions in which the inmates worked and lived violated state law.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how asset risk (i. e. the risk that the value of the leased asset loses unexpectedly most of its value at the end of the contract) is measured and hedged. Design/methodology/approach – The evaluation of the <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> is achieved by applying the theory of option pricing as the lessor is the writer of a call option on the leased asset. A sensitivity analysis on some parameters is performed. Findings – The paper disentangles the components of the profit of a <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> and allows to choose the optimal final purchase price. This lets the lessor hedge against asset risk. Research limitations/implications – The paper’s result can be extended by considering more complex options (such as American or exotic ones) into the <b>lease</b> <b>contract.</b> Practical implications – Results in the paper allow for a more flexible and efficient management of <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> where both parties benefit under an economic and a financial point of view. Originality/value – This is believed to be the first paper that applies derivative evaluation to the analysis of <b>lease</b> <b>contracts.</b> Keywords Assets management, Leasing, Pricing, Profit, Hedgin...|$|R

2500|$|The Insolvency Act 1986 section 238 only catches {{depletion}} of a company's total assets, {{rather than simply}} preferring one creditor {{at the expense of}} others. To deal with this issue, section 239 allow avoidance preferences that entail a [...] "desire to prefer" [...] one creditor over another. This test is hard to fulfill. In Re MC Bacon Ltd, a company gave a floating charge to Natwest bank in return for a continued overdraft as its business declined. Millett J held the company had not desired to prefer the bank. It had no special affection for its bank, and only agreed to the charge to prolong survival of the business. By contrast, in Re Agriplant Services Ltd Jonathan Parker J held it was an unlawful preference for Agriplant Services Ltd to pay £20,000 due on a <b>leasing</b> <b>contract</b> for earth moving equipment to a company. This was mainly because Agriplant's major shareholder Mr Sagar, had guaranteed that Agriplant's liability, and so repayment absolved Mr Sagar's liabilities above other creditors. Similarly in Re Conegrade Ltd, the Lloyd J held that when two directors of a small engineering company caused the company to sell them a property for £125,000, to then be leased back to Conegrade Ltd, the dominant purpose must have been to give them as creditors a preference over others. Thus, it was void.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{analyzes}} the statutory regulation of leasing transactions in the Czech Republic, {{both from the}} perspective of the general legislation and {{from the perspective of}} the tax laws. Since operating and finance <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> are not classified under nominate (named) contracts in the Czech Civil or the Commercial Codes, the principal legal aspects of this commercial arrangement have been established largely by way of evolving judicial and business practice. The absence of the general legal regulation, particularly with respect to finance leases, has also had some important consequences for tax laws and their application. The thesis also describes the distinguishing features of finance leases compared to the general <b>lease</b> <b>contracts.</b> A thoughtful statutory regulation of leasing transactions would therefore bring about the much-needed legal certainty for all parties involved in and affected by <b>lease</b> <b>contracts.</b> The present thesis sets out both a thorough description of the current state of law with respect to <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> and puts forwards proposals on how to improve the enactments of law in future...|$|R
