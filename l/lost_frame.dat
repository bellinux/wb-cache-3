40|$|Irrecoverable {{data loss}} is {{inevitable}} for low-delay video confer-encing over typical loss-prone networks {{such as the}} Internet. A semi-super-resolution (SSR) framework has been previously pro-posed to supply an additional low-resolution (LR) thumbnail to aid error concealment when the high-resolution (HR) image is lost. Super-resolution is an ill-posed problem, however, and previous block-search based SSR methods tend to produce discontinuities in output images, which can be objectionable, especially in human faces where {{the focus of a}} viewer usually lies. In this paper, we propose to recover a human face in a <b>lost</b> <b>frame</b> using the same SSR framework, but by operating on the entire face at a time. We leverage a recent work on robust principal component analysis (RPCA), where the “salient ” features (human face in our scenario) in a sequence of previous HR frames can be recovered despite the presence of gross but sparse errors. We propose and derive various improved methods to solve the SSR problem using RPCA. Beyond robust recovery of the human face, transformations of the face in previous HR frames are also deduced, so that the recovered face can be appropriately transformed in the <b>lost</b> <b>frame</b> for natural viewing. Experimental results show that our face-based approach gives much improved face recovery compared to previous SSR block searches.
