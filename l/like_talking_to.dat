500|$|Jazz critic Kenny Mathieson {{described}} Ibn Ali as [...] "An Elmo Hope acolyte with {{a rhythmic}} quirkiness that had him compared with [...] Monk and [...] Nichols". Ibn Ali himself credited Hope with being his main inspiration: [...] "by meeting Mr Hope it was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> and having acquaintance with {{the mystery of}} music, who explained not by the ruler or lip but with music. So from him I heard how to learn." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{midnight on}} Monday, February 9, Murray used her {{personal}} computer to search MapQuest for {{directions to the}} Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont. The first reported contact Murray had with anyone on February 9 was at 1:00 pm, when she emailed her boyfriend: [...] "I got your messages, but honestly, I didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> much of anyone, I promise to call today though." [...] She also made a phone call inquiring about renting a condominium in the same Bartlett, New Hampshire, condo association her family had vacationed at in the past. Telephone records indicate the call lasted three minutes. The owner did not rent the condo to Murray. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons unknown.|$|E
500|$|Women's {{suffrage}} was {{an early}} interest of Douglas, and although she tended {{to shy away from}} polemics in her early work at The Miami Herald, on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions. In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, William Jennings Bryan's wife, and two other women to Tallahassee to speak in support of women's right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: [...] "All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> graven images. They never paid attention to us at all." [...] Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.|$|E
60|$|Of course. There are one or {{two things}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE (gazing at him; after a moment). Sure! I guess I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
60|$|He <b>liked</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> me. I was {{the only}} person round who really {{understood}} him. He would talk by the hour and I would listen with my tongue hanging out and nod now and then.|$|R
2500|$|A {{southern}} background {{combined with}} a performing style largely associated with African Americans had led to [...] "bitter criticism by those who feel he stole a good thing", as Tan magazine surmised. No wonder that Elvis became [...] "a symbol of all that was oppressive to the black experience in the Western Hemisphere". [...] A black southerner in the late 1980s even captured that sentiment: [...] "To talk to Presley about blacks was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Adolf Hitler about the Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roma {{is furious}} at Williamson, who has blown a big sale. Levene picks up where Roma left off, and begins {{insulting}} Williamson. Mid-rant, Levene accidentally reveals his knowledge that Williamson {{made up the}} claim about the check being cashed, information {{he could not have}} known unless he had been in Williamson's office. Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.|$|E
6000|$|I {{reflected}} a moment. [...] "I don't mind {{talking about these}} things to you," [...] I said. [...] "It seems almost <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I couldn't induce him," [...] said Mrs. Miller very gently. [...] "He wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the waiter. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that waiter." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Rigby {{shook his}} head and was going to prophesy, when Lord Eskdale, who <b>liked</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> be short, and was of opinion that Rigby should keep his amplifications for his {{slashing}} articles, put in a brief careless observation, which balked his inspiration.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you don't}} mind, Mrs Clinton, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your doctor alone about the case. You can {{wait in the}} next room.' ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. I <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you. I can {{let myself}} go with you. I can say {{things to you}} I cant say to other people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor chap!" [...] he remarked. [...] "Just {{at first}} I really used to <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him. He was so earnest, {{and so many}} of his {{arguments}} were absolutely sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t think so," [...] ses Peter, taking ’is pipe out of ’is {{mouth and}} yawning. [...] "She’s rather {{too young for}} me; I <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> gals wot’s a bit older. I won’t stand in Ginger’s way." ...|$|E
60|$|Foster <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{strangers and}} as the girl had not rebuffed him, he took her cloak, which looked very wet, from the rack.|$|R
6000|$|... "But wouldn't you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{him some}} more?" [...] I suggested; [...] "I {{can see you}} any time about this little {{business}} of ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you for a}} few moments," [...] {{she said}} quietly. [...] "Afterwards will you come on to the terrace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll soon {{get used}} to it," [...] Joan told her. [...] "The great thing {{is not to be}} afraid of one's fate, {{whatever}} it is; but just to do one's best." [...] It was rather <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. I shall {{send for}} Dr. Baum, for I'm {{convinced}} {{that you are}} going to be ill. I shall say no more, but act as I think proper, because it's <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the wind to reason with you in one of these perverse fits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you and I don't <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you. And I see now it {{is because}} you keep on talking of my Personality and your Personality. That makes me uncomfortable. It's like having some one {{following}} me about with a limelight. And {{in a sort of}} way I do like it. I like it and I'm flattered by it, and then I go off and dislike it, dislike the effect of it. I find myself trying to be what you have told me I am--sort of acting myself. I want to glance at looking-glasses to see if I am keeping it up. It's just exactly what Mr. Britling says in his book about American women. They act themselves, he says; they get a kind of story and explanation about themselves and they are always trying to make it perfectly plain and clear to every one. Well, when you do that you can't think nicely of other things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Courage," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "you are a {{sensible}} man, and a man of honor. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you confidentially." ...|$|R
30|$|I can {{understand}} why students don’t {{want to be called}} on personally, and I'm pretty uncomfortable calling students by name in a class environment. But I think it’s important because unless I am calling on everyone, the conversation usually degrades to two or three people who <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me or <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the class. So getting multiple people talking in the class is an essential goal for me and right now that's one of my best tools to accomplish that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drop {{in on me}} sometime," [...] he said, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--Hodder heard a {{voice behind}} him, and turned. A servant was {{standing}} there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don't despise {{your neighbors}} so. Remember you are turned twenty-two now, {{and you will}} have no fortune: your father, I am sure, {{will not be able to}} spare you anything. Mr. Lydgate is very {{intellectual}} and clever; I know there is an attraction in that. I <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> such men myself; and your uncle finds him very useful. But the profession is a poor one here. To be sure, this life is not everything; but it is seldom a medical man has true religious views--there is too much pride of intellect. And you are not fit to marry a poor man.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, uncle; {{that was}} very silly and ridiculous, but I {{did not like the}} man himself, putting that aside altogether. It was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a man with a mask on: it gave me a creepy feeling. It did not seem to me that one single word he said was sincere, but that he was acting; {{and over and over again}} as he was talking I said to myself, 'What is this man really like? I know he is not the least bit in the world what he pretends to be. But what is the reality?' I felt just the same as I should if I had one of those great snakes they bring to our veranda coiling round me. The {{creature}} might look quiet enough, but I should know that if it were to tighten it would crush me in a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was exactly}} <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a child--a very rude little child. He would begin almost every {{sentence}} with, [...] "Now {{tell me something}} about India," [...] and would turn aimlessly from one question to the other without the least continuity. I was not angry, but keenly interested. The man was a revelation to me. To his questions I returned answers mendacious and evasive. After all, it really did not matter what I said. He could not understand. I can only {{hope and pray that}} none of the readers of the [...] "Pioneer" [...] will ever see that portentous interview. The man made me out to be an idiot several sizes more drivelling than my destiny intended, and the rankness of his ignorance managed to distort the few poor facts with which I supplied him into large and elaborate lies. Then, thought I, [...] "the matter of American journalism shall be looked into later on. At present I will enjoy myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} plain enough," [...] I replied, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you before you}} decide to hand {{him over to the}} authorities." ...|$|R
50|$|In Second Life, {{users can}} do almost {{anything}} {{that they can do}} in their physical lives. There are some who do things that they would normally do, <b>like</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people, while others do things that normally would be more rare for them to do in the physical world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, is that Earl Portney?" [...] {{came from}} within, and both Earl and Randy {{recognized}} Jasper Guardley's voice. [...] "If it is, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] {{said the}} fishy-eyed young man one {{afternoon}} to Dan. [...] "You don't go into fits of laughter when I remark {{that it has}} been a fine day; most people do. Of course, on the stage I don't mind. I know I am a funny little devil. I get my living by being a funny little devil. There is a photograph of me hanging in the theatre lobby. I saw a workman stop and look at it the other day as he passed; I was just behind him. He burst into a roar of laughter. 'Little--! He makes me laugh to look at him!' he cluttered to himself. Well, that's all right; I want the man in the gallery to think me funny, but it annoys me when people laugh at me off the stage. If I am out to dinner anywhere and ask somebody to pass the mustard, I never get it; instead, they burst out laughing. I don't want people to laugh at me when I am having my dinner. I want my dinner. It makes me very angry sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was vexed when {{my father}} called Dowden's irony timidity, but after many years his {{impression}} has not changed for he wrote to me but a few months ago, [...] "it was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a priest. One {{had to be careful}} not to remind him of his sacrifice." [...] Once after breakfast Dowden read us some chapters of the unpublished [...] "Life of Shelley," [...] and I who had made the [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] my sacred book was delighted with all he read. I was chilled, however, when he explained that he had lost his liking for Shelley and would not have written it but for an old promise to the Shelley family. When it was published, Matthew Arnold made sport of certain conventionalities and extravagances that were, my father and I had come to see, the violence or clumsiness of a conscientious man hiding from himself a lack of sympathy. He had abandoned too, or was about to abandon, what was to have been his master-work, [...] "The Life of Goethe," [...] though in his youth a lecture course at Alexandra College that spoke too openly of Goethe's loves had brought upon him the displeasure of our Protestant Archbishop of Dublin. Only Wordsworth, he said, kept, more than all, his early love.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} conceal it from himself--Elizabeth appealed to him. Being {{built on a}} large scale himself, he had always been {{attracted}} by small women. There was a smallness, a daintiness, a liveliness about Elizabeth that was almost irresistible. She was so capable, so cheerful {{in spite of the fact}} that she was having a hard time. And then their minds seemed to blend so remarkably. There were no odd corners to be smoothed away. Never in his life had he felt so supremely at his ease with one of the opposite sex. He loved Claire--he drove that fact home almost angrily to himself--but he was forced to admit that he had always been aware of something in the nature of a barrier between them. Claire was querulous at times, and always a little too apt to take offence. He had never been able to talk to her with that easy freedom that Elizabeth invited. Talking to Elizabeth was <b>like</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> an attractive version of oneself. It was a thing to be done with perfect confidence, without any of that apprehension which Claire inspired lest the next remark might prove the spark to cause an explosion. But Claire was the girl he loved--there must be no mistake about that.|$|E
500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they <b>liked,</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the Queen as they <b>liked,</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{the people on the}} train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this… they said if you want something, do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{returning}} to the waiting-room, he addressed a characteristic question to the assembled visitors. [...] "More humbug?" [...] asked the gentleman who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a pretty woman.|$|R
50|$|The pair {{look around}} Barcelona and John takes {{photographs}} of Brian. They discuss, among other things, John’s relationship with Cynthia, {{which he does}} not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Brian about.|$|R
