40|$|The {{impact of}} window {{area on the}} energy balance of a {{building}} was investigated by simulations in DEROB-LTH. The glazed area was varied in three types of buildings with different types of glazing and for several climates. One low energy house was compared to a less insulated house but identical in size and layout. Three different types of glazing were used; uncoated double glazing, double glazing with one <b>low-e</b> <b>coated</b> pane and triple glazing with two <b>low-e</b> <b>coated</b> panes. Climates with variations in solar radiation, mean temperature, altitude and latitude were chosen. The results show that if energy efficient window alternatives are chosen the flexibility of choosing the glazed area and orientation is higher. Choosing a larger area facing south resulted in a higher heating demand for uncoated double glazing in the standard house. An increased area also resulted in an increased peak load for heating for all the simulated cases. Choosing the energy efficient glazing type gave a decrease in heating demand for increased south facing glazed area in the standard house. In the low energy house the difference in heating demand between different areas was smaller than for the standard house. An office module with two types of switchable glazing and one solar control glazing unit was used in three different climates; Stockholm, Brussels and Rome. Larger window areas increase the cooling demand but if glazing types with lower solar transmittance are used, the difference in cooling demand between different window areas decreases. An extremely large window area, however, increases the peak load both for cooling and for heating and should therefore be avoided. Energy can be saved by using switchable windows instead of solar control or in particular standard glazing...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 The Department of Energy {{reports that}} {{buildings}} consume more than 40 % of primary {{energy in the}} U. S. and that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, windows constitute a major path for energy losses from buildings and therefore also present a significant opportunity for efficiency improvement and waste reduction. With this in mind, the work in this dissertation is focused on improving the control of solar and thermal radiation through windows. These radiation spectra can be controlled independently because they peak at different wavelengths due to the much higher temperature (5500 °C) of the Sun compared to objects on Earth (25 °C). In this work, a thermochromic material is utilized to control solar irradiance and a low-emissive (low-E) material is used to control thermal radiation. Thermochromic materials possess optical properties that change in response to temperature and low-E coatings are reflective in the mid-infrared (thermal) region. VO 2 is an exciting candidate for thermochromic coatings because its transmittance in the visible region is relatively constant, but its reflectance in the IR increases significantly with temperature. The main technical issues limiting VO 2 are luminous transmittance (Tlum) that is too low and a transition temperature (τc) that is too high. For the <b>low-E</b> <b>coating,</b> (SnO 2) x(In 2 O 3) 1 -x (ITO glass) was chosen because it has both high luminous transmittance and low emissivity. In this dissertation it is shown that τc of VO 2 can be lowered from 50 to 45 °C by reducing the grain size of the film from 70 to 31 nm. In the area of luminous transmittance, TiO 2 is investigated as an anti-reflective coating {{which can be used}} to increase Tlum. Later in this work, it is demonstrated that the energy efficiency gained through VO 2 can be further improved by combining it with a <b>low-E</b> <b>coating.</b> The multilayer design combines anti-reflection in the visible region, thermochromism the near-IR and low emissivity in the mid-IR for an outstanding energy-efficient coating across the solar and thermal spectra.

40|$|Staining of façades due to {{microbial}} {{growth has been}} on the rise in recent years.

Two Transparent Insulating Materials (TIM) were considered: monolithic silica aerogel and capillary geometric media. So, 16 innovative glazing systems were realized, assembling several types of glass, in various combinations, both with a pane of aerogel and with capillary geometric media. Moreover, in order to carry out a comparison between the performances of the samples, a double glazing window with air in the interspace was considered. The software Windows 5. 1 was employed to calculate the energetic and luminous parameters of the samples: visible (Tvis) and solar (Tsol) transmittance, visible (Rvis) and solar (Rsol) reflectance, thermal transmittance (U); the thermal transmittance was evaluated in 48 different conditions, depending on the season and exposure (North, East, South, West). Results show that U values of innovative glazings lay in the 1. 299 - 1. 385 W/m 2 K range for the aerogel windows and in the 1. 384 e 1. 529 W/m 2 K range for TIM windows, while the conventional double windows have values of about 2. 5 W/m 2 K.

40|$|One {{approach}} to increasing the energy efficiency of windows is {{to control the}} amount of solar radiation transmitted through a window by using electrochromic technology. What is unique about this project is that the electrochromic {{is based on the}} reduction/oxidation reactions of cathodic and anodic organic semi-conducting polymers using room temperature ionic liquids as ion transport electrolytes. It is believed that these types of coatings would be a lower cost alternative to traditional all inorganic thin film based electrochromic technologies. Although there are patents 1 based on the proposed technology, it has never been reduced to practice and thoroughly evaluated (i. e. durability and performance) in a window application. We demonstrate that by using organic semi-conductive polymers, specific bands of the solar spectrum (specifically visible and near infrared) can be targeted for electrochemical variable transmittance responsiveness. In addition, when the technology is incorporated into an insulating glass unit, the energy parameters such as the solar heat gain coefficient and the light to solar gain ratio are improved over that of a typical insulating glass unit comprised of glass with a low emissivity coating. A minimum of {approx} 0. 02 quads of energy savings per year with a reduction of carbon emissions for electricity of {approx} 320 MKg/yr benefit is achieved over that of a typical insulating glass unit including a double silver <b>low-E</b> <b>coating.</b> Note that these values include a penalty in the heating season. If this penalty is removed (i. e. in southern climates or commercial structures where cooling is predominate year-round) a maximum energy savings of {approx} 0. 05 quad per year and {approx} 801 MKg/yr can be achieved over that of a typical insulating glass unit including a double silver <b>low-E</b> <b>coating.</b> In its current state, the technology is not durable enough for an exterior window application. The primary downfall is that the redox chemistry fails to recover to a bleached state upon exposure to heat and solar radiation while being cycled over time from the bleached to the dark state. Most likely the polymers are undergoing degradation reactions which are accelerated by heat and solar exposure while in either the reduced or oxidized states and the performance of the polymers is greatly reduced over time. For this technology to succeed in an exterior window application, there needs to be more work done to understand the degradation of the polymers under real-life application conditions such as elevated temperatures and solar exposure so that recommendations for improvements in to the overall system can be made. This will be the key to utilizing this type of technology in any future real-life applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to develop a glass façade element which actively controls thermal energy losses and solar energy gains through the building envelope. At the root of this type of façade is a four layer glazing element with two fluid filled chambers and one gas filled chamber in the middle.

The gas chamber in the middle, along with the <b>Low-E</b> <b>coating</b> of the third glass pane, further reduces energy transmission. The cooling and heating of the building is fulfilled by the inner fluid chamber. The regulation of the indoor temperature over the entire surface of the glass façade reduces the convection currents and thus increases the comfort level. During periods of high solar radiation, the clear fluid in the outer chamber is exchanged by a coloured one. This clouding system increases the absorption capability of the fluid and thus the efficiency of the system. As the water level of the external fluid reservoir is located below the façade element, depression is present within the chamber, resulting in an undesirable inward deformation of the panes (lens effect).

40|$|U. S. {{households}} rely {{primarily on}} three sources of energy: natural gas, electricity, and fuel oil. In {{the past several}} decades, electricity consumption by households has grown dramatically, and {{a significant portion of}} electricity used in homes is for lighting. Lighting includes both indoor and outdoor lighting and is found in virtually every household in the United States. In 2001, according to the US Energy Information Administration, lighting accounted for 101 billion kWh (8. 8 percent) of U. S. household electricity use. Incandescent lamps, which are commonly found in households, are highly inefficient sources of light because about 90 percent of the energy used is lost as heat. For that reason, lighting has been one focus area to increase the efficiency of household electricity consumption. Windows have several functions, and one of the main functions is to provide a view to the outside. Daylighting is another one of windows main functions and determines the distribution of daylight to a space. Daylighting windows {{do not need to be}} transparent, and a translucent daylighting window is sufficient, and often desired, to diffuse the light and make the space more environmentally pleasing. In homes, skylights are one source of daylighting, but skylights are not very energy efficient and are inseparably linked to solar heat gain. In some climates, added solar heat gains from daylighting may be welcome; but in other climates, heat gain must be controlled. More energy efficient skylights and daylighting solutions, in general, are desired and can be designed by insulating them with aerogels. Aerogels are a highly insulating and transparent material in its pure form. The overall objective for this project was to prepare an economical, translucent, fiber-reinforced aerogel insulation material for daylighting applications that is durable for manufacturing purposes. This advanced insulation material will increase the thermal performance of daylighting windows, while satisfying constraints such as durability, cost, user acceptance, size limits, and environmental safety concerns. The energy efficient daylighting window will consist of a translucent and resilient aerogel panel sandwiched between glass panes in double glazed windows. Compared to the best windows available today, the double glazed translucent windows with 1 / 2 -inch aerogel inserts will have a U-value of 1. 2 W/m{sup 2 } K (0. 211 BTU/ft{sup 2 } h F) without any coating or low conductivity fill gases. These windows will be more effective than the windows with an Energy Star rating of U- 2 W/m{sup 2 } K and could be made even more efficient by using <b>low-e</b> <b>coated</b> glass glazings and inert gas fills. This report summarizes the work accomplished on Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 03 NT 41950. During this project, Aspen Aerogels made transparent and translucent aerogels from TMOS and TEOS. We characterized the transparency of the aerogels, reinforced the transparent aerogels with fibers and prepared large translucent aerogel panels and blankets. We also conducted an initial market study for energy efficient translucent windows. A lab-scale process was developed that could be scaled-up to manufacture blankets of these translucent aerogels. The large blankets prepared were used to fabricate prototype translucent windows and skylights. The primary goal of this project was to develop transparent, resilient, hydrophobic silica aerogels that have low thermal conductivities (R- 10 /inch) to be used to produce aerogel insulated double-glazing windows with a U value of 0. 6 W/m{sup 2 }K. To meet this objective we developed a process and equipment to produce blankets of translucent, hydrophobic aerogel. We focused on silica, organically-modified silica aerogels (Ormosils), and fiber reinforced silica aerogels due to the appreciable expertise in silica sol-gel processing available with the personnel at Aspen Aerogels, and also due to the quantity of knowledge available in the scientific literature.

50|$|Window {{glass is}} by nature highly {{thermally}} emissive, {{as indicated in}} the table above. To improve thermal control (insulation and solar optical properties) thin film coatings are applied to the raw soda-lime glass. There are two primary methods in use: pyrolytic CVD and magnetron sputtering. The first involves deposition of fluorinated tin oxide (SnO2:F see Tin dioxide uses) at high temperatures. Pyrolytic coatings are usually applied at the float glass plant when the glass is manufactured. The second involves depositing thin silver layers with antireflection layers. Magnetron sputtering uses large vacuum chambers with multiple deposition chambers depositing 5 to 10 or more layers in succession. Silver-based films are environmentally unstable and must be enclosed in insulated glazing or an Insulated Glass Unit (IGU) to maintain their properties over time.

Their performance is determined by comparing results to prototype highly insulated superwindows as well as a more conventional insulating glass unit with a <b>low-E</b> <b>coating</b> and argon gas fill. The authors used the DOE- 2. 1 E energy analysis simulation program to analyze the annual and hourly heating energy use due to the windows of a prototypical single-story house located in Madison, Wisconsin. Cooling energy performance was also investigated. The results show that for highly insulating windows, the solar heat gain coefficient {{is as important as the}} window`s U-factor in determining heating performance for window orientations facing west-south-east. For other orientations in which there is not much direct solar radiation, the window`s U-factor primarily governs performance. The vacuum glazings had lower heating requirements than the superwindows for most window orientations. The conventional low-E window outperformed the superwindows for southwest-south-southeast orientations. These performance differences are directly related to the solar heat gain coefficients of the various windows analyzed. The cooling performance of the windows was inversely related to the heating performance. The lower solar heat gain coefficients of the superwindows resulted in the best cooling performance. However, the authors were able to mitigate the cooling differences of the windows by using an interior shading device that reduced the amount of solar gain at appropriate times...|$|E
40|$|Ventilated building-integrated {{photovoltaic}} (BIPV) facades can {{not only}} generate electricity at the locations of buildings themselves but if designed optimally, such facades can also reduce the respective heat gains and heat losses in summer and winter via the building envelope. The development of a novel ventilated BIPV double-skin facade (DSF), constituted by a see-through amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV module and an inward opening window, is reported in this paper. In order to enhance ventilation, an air-flow duct, 400. mm in depth is situated between the outside PV module and the inside window. This ventilation design can remove much of the waste heat generated by the PV module energy conversion processes, and thus bring down the operating temperature of the solar cells.

The thermal performance of PV-DSFs operating in different modes was studied and compared. The results showed that the ventilated PV-DSF provides the lowest solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), while the non-ventilated PV-DSF better reduces heat loss. Based on the experimental results, the optimum operation strategy for the PV-DSF under different weather conditions has been determined and proposed. This novel PV-DSF is more suitable for sub-tropical climates because it results in a much lower SHGC than that of a <b>low-e</b> <b>coating</b> DSF. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into three parts. In the first part (chapters 2 to 7), types of {{architectural}} membrane structures from coated fabrics are presented, different types of coated fabrics and their composition is described, welding procedures for membranes from coated fabrics are shown, and physical and mechanical characteristics of these membranes are given, including laboratory tests descriptions of individual characteristics. In {{the second part of the}} thesis (chapter 8), we are discussing energy efficient roofing from coated fabrics with an additional <b>low-e</b> <b>coating,</b> which due to its low thermal emission or high reflection rates can lower energy costs for cooling and heating of the building interior. In the third and last part (chapter 9), the procedure for static calculations of membrane forces in pneumatic roofing is described in two different ways: Using the Youg-Leplace equation for measuring surface tension in membranes and using the principle of modelling membrane surfaces with the infinite number of parallel line elements. The calculation procedure regarding membrane deformability and the calculation procedure regarding the snow load of the roofing, if the snow load is smaller than the initial air pressure inside the roofing and if it is bigger than the initial air pressure inside the roofing, are shown. Changes in forces in the upper and lower membrane of the double-layer pneumatic roofing are described, together with corresponding reaction components in supports, depending on the calculation type, membrane deformability, initial heights of both membranes, size of air pressure inside the roofing, and size of snow load. Also, the calculation procedure of membrane forces and corresponding reaction components regarding wind suction load, is shown...|$|E
40|$|For {{energy saving}} in a building, low {{emission}} (<b>Low-e)</b> <b>coating</b> on window glass {{is the important}} part of modern energy-efficient window technology. At present, many studies {{around the world are}} focused on simple fabrication methods, low cost, and good performance of the Low-e films. In this thesis, we investigate the ZrN based Low-e multilayer coating prepared by rf magnetism sputtering, putting the emphasis on the effect of the fabrication conditions as well as thermal aging on the optical performance of the coatings. The multilayer of ZrO 2 /ZrN/ZrO 2 was fabricated on quartz glass, with sputtering Zr metallic target in a mixed atmosphere of N 2 +Ar for ZrN and O 2 +Ar for ZrO 2 film. First, fabrication conditions for ZrN film are studied in detail, such as the deposition temperature, gas flow ratio, rf sputtering power, negative bias voltage, and so on. Second, two kinds of multilayers were produced. That is, the layer thickness is 40 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm and 170 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm corresponding to the ZrO 2 /ZrN/ZrO 2 /glass structure, of which the thickness outer ZrO 2 layer was just changed in order to examine its effect on durability of the multilayer during aging test. Both multilayers show good solar selectivity with an appearance of neutral color. Aging tests have been done. It shows that thermal stability of the two multilayers is almost the same, but corrosion resistivity is stronger for the 170 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm multilayer than the thinner one, due to the thicker outer layer of ZrO 2. 在建筑节能中，太阳光谱选择性透过Low-e薄膜是现代节能窗技术的重要组成部分，目前世界许多国家都在积极研究工艺简单、成本低廉、性能优良的新型Low-e薄膜。本论文根据的Ⅳ族元素氮化物Low-e薄膜光学性质和磁控溅射技术的原理，在国内外研究发展的基础上，针对Low-e薄膜的发展趋势，开展了射频磁控溅射制备ZrN基Low-e薄膜镀膜玻璃研究。 本课题以射频反应磁控溅射方法作为制备手段，选择Zr为靶材，以N 2 、O 2 为反应气体，制备对红外选择透过、可见光较高透过率的ZrO 2 -ZrN- ZrO 2 -石英玻璃膜Low-e薄膜，使之具有较好的光谱选择选择性透过和装饰效果，可应用节能窗表面。通过对膜层结构、各层膜厚、负偏压、反应气体分压等工艺条件的调整，成功制备了 40 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm和 170 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm两种ZrO 2 -ZrN- ZrO 2 -石英玻璃的膜系。两种膜系光谱选择透过特性良好，均可以作为Low-e薄膜的工作层。从透过率、膜厚、沉膜时间、成膜速率、颜色等方面综合比较了两种膜系，发现 40 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm膜系在光学性能上对可见光－红外透过选择性更强；其颜色等性能更符合美观等要求。 对两种膜系进行了探索性质的老化实验，实验发现两种膜系的热稳定性类似，抗热老化性能差；抗酸腐蚀性（HCl浸泡）都比较好，由于 170 nm/ 40 nm/ 40 nm膜系氧化物层厚度更大，抗腐蚀性更强。 本论文最后提出了要将这种光谱选择性透过Low-e薄膜推向实用化，实验室需要研究的课题...|$|E

The PV/T, a “multifunctional solar window” made of PV cells laminated on solar absorbers, is placed in a window behind the glazing. The solar window is built into a single family house, Solgården, in Älvkarleö outside Gävle {{in the eastern part of}} Sweden. To reduce the costs of the solar electricity, reflectors have been placed in the construction to focus the radiation onto the solar cells. In this way expensive solar cells can be replaced by considerably cheaper reflector material.

The reflectors can also be used to reduce the thermal losses through the window. A model for electric and hot water production was developed. The simulation program, in Excel, can perform yearly energy simulations where different effects such as shading of the cells or the glazing effects can be included or excluded. The simulation can be run with the reflectors in an active, up right, position or with the reflectors in a passive, horizontal, position. The simulation program was calibrated against a prototype window placed in Lund in the south of Sweden and against the solar window in Solgården.

40|$|A {{percentage}} of insulating glass (IG) units break each year due to thermally induced perimeter stresses. The glass industry has {{known about this}} problem {{for many years and}} an ASTM standard has recently been developed for the design of monolithic glass plates for thermal stresses induced by solar irradiance. It is believed that a similar standard can be developed for IG units if a proper understanding of IG thermal stresses can be developed. The objective of this research is to improve understandings of IG thermal stresses and compare the IG thermal stresses with those that develop in monolithic glass plates given similar environmental conditions. The major difference between the analysis of a monolithic glass plate and an IG unit is energy exchange due to conduction, natural convection, and long wave radiation through the gas space cavity. In IG units, conduction, natural convection, and long wave radiation combine in a nonlinear fashion that frequently requires iterative numerical analyses for determining thermal stresses in certain situations. To simplify the gas space energy exchange, a numerical propagation procedure was developed. The numerical propagation procedure combines the nonlinear effects of conduction, natural convection, and long wave radiation into a single value. Use of this single value closely approximates the nonlinear nature of the gas space energy exchange and simplifies the numerical analysis. The numerical propagation procedure was then coupled with finite element analysis to estimate thermal stresses for both monolithic glass plates and IG units. It is shown that the maximum thermal stresses that develop in IG units increase linearly with input solar irradiance during the transient phase. It is shown that an initial preload stress develops under equilibrium conditions due to the thermal bridge effects of the spacer. It is shown that IG units develop larger thermal stresses than monolithic glass plates under similar environmental conditions. Finally, it is shown that the use of low-e coatings increase IG thermal stresses and that the location of <b>low-e</b> <b>coating</b> as well as environmental conditions affect which glass plate develops larger thermal stresses...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} energy and light {{performance}} assessment of two configurations of an Active Transparent Façade (ATF), which are investigated {{by means of}} an experimental campaign that makes use of a full-scale mock-up room of an office building. The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or double pane glazing with <b>low-e</b> <b>coating),</b> while share all the other features - i. e. external glazing, shading system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated double pane glazing (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively. A higher amount of daylight is then guaranteed within the indoor space by Module A, but this might result in a higher probability of visual discomfort for the occupants. On the other hand, the Module B determines lower daily energy transmitted toward the indoor environment than Module A: on average, the daily energy gain/loss from/toward the outdoor environment are reduced of about 30 %, in summer (with or without the reflective roller screen), and in the range 30 - 40 % in winter (with or without the reflective roller screen...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{presentation}} of Mike Davies' idea of the polyvalent façade [1], {{the vision of a}} multifunctional building skin has produced a number of technological developments taking first steps in this direction. Switchable façades with electrochromic or gasochromic glazing have been investigated for many years. Research has mainly concentrated on material and device development [2]. Large-area chromogenic devices are in the discussion for building applications. Recently a large European project has treated the architectural and technical integration of switchable devices into buildings as well as durability and lifecycle aspects [3]. Glazing companies still balk at the risk of a market introduction of glazings which can change its colour dynamically and thus change characteristic properties like total solar energy transmittance and visual transmittance. In this situation it might seem hazardous to try and incorporate even more functions into a glazing unit than the mentioned technologies. In spite of these considerations, it has been the goal of this research to develop a glass façade system that actively controls not only visual light transmission and the solar energy transmission but may even incorporate further processes in the building envelope The extraction and provision of heat within the transparent façade, i. e. at the interface between the artificial interior and natural exterior environments, offers the possibility to completely control the energy flows and comfort conditions at the façade. For this purpose, a four-layer glazing element with two fluid-filled cavities and one gas-filled cavity between the panes was designed (see Figure 1). The outer liquid layer in cavity I reduces the solar irradiation by absorption even in the clear state. Excess solar heat gains are kept outside. During periods of very high solar radiation, the clear fluid in the outer cavity I is replaced by a coloured one thus increasing absorption. In cavity III the liquid layer holds the surface temperature constant at room temperature - in summer it can be cooled down whereas in winter heat can be added to the room. A heat pump could be used for providing the temperature levels needed for these purposes. These large-area, transparent heating and cooling elements show uniform temperatures over their entire surface, which leads to an increased interior comfort range since convection is reduced due to large areas with uniform temperatures. The gas-filled chamber II in the middle, along with the <b>Low-E</b> <b>coating</b> of the third glass pane, further reduces energy transmission in winter (heat losses) and during the summer (solar gains). Shading, heating and cooling therefore {{become an integral part of}} the glazed transparent building envelope which is adaptable to the requirements of the different seasons (Figure 2) Of course this vision is not without risk. It has to be transformed from an idea to a reliable technological system before it can be used by designers and engineers to produce completely different buildings...|$|E

In this way expensive solar cells can be replaced by considerably cheaper reflector material. The tiltable reflectors give the user a possibility to control the amount of sunlight being let into the building. The reflectors can also be used to reduce the thermal losses through the window. A calculation model for electricity and hot water production was created. The simulation program, in Excel, can perform yearly energy simulations where different effects such as shading of the cells or the glazing effects can be included or excluded. The simulation can be run with the reflectors in an active, up right, position or with the reflectors in a passive, horizontal, position. The simulation programme was calibrated against a prototype window placed in Lund in the south of Sweden and against the solar window in Solgården Älvkarleö. The calculation model serves as a basis for the module written for the simulation program TRNSYS. A “TRNSYS-deck” was built and calibrated for the building Solgården. The energy balance for the system shows that the control of the reflectors is of great importance. A good control strategy for the reflectors can lower the annual energy demand and improve the indoor climate. A control mechanism that incorporates the indoor and outdoor temperatures can for instance decide to open the reflectors during summer nights to cool the building. Yearly simulations of the energy balance for a house with the solar window was compared to simulations where the 16 m 2 solar window was replaced with a 8 m 2 normal window. The results show the annual amount of auxiliary is lower with a developed solar window compared to the normal window case. The developed solar window has considerably lower U-values than the existing solar window. A simulation was run to investigate the over heating of the building using different control strategies for the reflectors. The simulation was also run for the normal window. The results show that the reflectors of the solar window work fine as a sun shade, keeping the overheating to a minimum. A normal window has to be supplemented with a sun shade of some kind to keep the over heating during the summer on an acceptable level. An Improvement of the solar window that can be of great importance is to add some sort of <b>low-e</b> <b>coating</b> on the glazing to reduce the U-value even further. However, it must be taken into account that the transmittance of the glazing will be affected in a negative way if <b>low-e</b> <b>coating</b> is added. Lower transmission means lower electricity and hot water production. Other improvements that can be made are better insulation of the reflector and the absorber. The most important way to improve the annual electricity production is to use better solar cells. Today cells of standard quality with an efficiency of about 16 - 17 % can be obtained. The electric system at Solgården is built up around a battery bank that can be charged from the solar window, the Stirling generator or from the grid. To have continuous power for some time during a black out and also the relatively low fuse that is needed for the house are two advantages with this system. Simulations show that the day to day storage of electricity in the batteries evens out the power peaks from the load and the electric production, and that further storage is of limited use. Simulations show that the production of electric energy from a combination of solar cells and a Stirling generator is in good agreement with the load during the full year. Solgårdens two parallel electric systems, 230 V and 12 V, has many advantages such as electric security and low energy consumption. To save electric energy is of extra interest when solar cells are used as an energy source. Due to the high price for solar cells large energy saving investments ought to be made before a solar cell installation is economically interesting. To move the energy use from electricity to hot water use is profitable for a stand alone house since solar heating and bio fuel is considerably cheaper compared to solar electricity. Tumble driers, washing machines and dishwashers can for instance use a circulating hot water system instead of electricity in order to minimize the electric use. Normally the energy balance between produced electric energy and produced thermal energy is in better agreement if hot water is used instead of electric energy. Other important investments to make the electric usage more efficient are to use low energy light bulbs and modern kitchen appliances, pumps, fans and computers. This can save as much as 80 % of the electricity compared to old standard techniques. Solgården is in practice working with the main fuses of the sizes of 3 - 4 A only. This can be accomplished because of the battery bank and since no equipment with a high current demand is connected to the power system. A high slope of the PV-modules has the advantage that the power during the summer is decreased. On the other hand a module tilt of 45 ° is to prefer both from an energy and a power view. A 45 ° tilted module gives a higher annual output in kWh per monitored kWp than a vertical module...|$|E
