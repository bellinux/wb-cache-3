Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Kefalas {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} explore alternative voting systems, which was defeated in committee, but which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> an 11-member multi-partisan task force to study related issues. Another of Kefalas' proposed bills, which would have required the Colorado Department of Revenue to regularly report on tax burdens across individual income groups, was also defeated in committee.|$|E
5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and ideologies have {{developed over the}} years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, including black feminism and intersectional feminism.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of Kariba Dam was of enormous {{value to the}} development of both Rhodesia and the Zambian Copperbelt, and <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> what was at the time the largest manmade lake in Africa south of the Sahara.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of Jobber's Canyon in 1989 <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have {{been converted into}} condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{pressure of}} mechanization {{evident in the}} newspaper and the magazine, has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> vast monopolies of communication.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of the film has also spread overseas. The film was an inspiration for Japanese companies Studio Hibari and Aniplex, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the manga and anime franchise Nerima Daikon Brothers, which contain heavy references to the film.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E

5|$|Apple’s first tablet {{computer}} was the Newton MessagePad 100, introduced in 1993, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the ARM6 processor core with Acorn Computers. Apple {{also developed a}} prototype PowerBook Duo-based tablet, the PenLite, but decided not to sell {{it in order to}} avoid hurting MessagePad sales. Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the MessagePad 2100, was discontinued in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} of the P90 <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories.

5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> an island arc of volcanoes {{on the west coast}} of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with {{the early stages of the}} creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E
50|$|CCHA has {{a long-standing}} {{relationship}} with the National Endowment for the Humanities, and this relationship has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> and implementation of many workshops and summer institutes for humanities faculty.

50|$|These ideas {{eventually}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation,</b> by James Clerk Maxwell, of {{the first}} unified field theory in physics {{with the introduction of}} equations for the electromagnetic field. The modern version of these equations is called Maxwell's equations.|$|R
50|$|Feng Boyi {{explains}} that modern, experimental art {{does not have}} a place currently in Chinese art exhibitions. One cannot freely show this style of art. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation,</b> popularity, and success of District 798 among contemporary artists.|$|R

5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in {{a flurry}} of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Manekshaw rose {{to become}} the 8th Chief of Army Staff in 1969, after {{commanding}} troops at both division, corps and regional command levels.

50|$|Kahn's {{fascination with}} the power of art for healing <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation,</b> in 2001, of a {{permanent}} installation commissioned by the HealthCare Chaplaincy of New York: a meditative room consisting of nine sky-and-water murals and sculptural furniture designed and executed by the artist.|$|R
5|$|Near the {{entrance}} of the mosque lies the Tomb of Muhammad Iqbal, a poet widely revered in Pakistan as the founder of the Pakistan Movement which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of British India.

5|$|Starting in 1613, {{the growing}} inefficiencies {{of the central}} government, {{as well as an}} {{increase}} in foreign threats, <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a local territorial defense force, known as żołnierz powiatowy (district's soldiers raised by the powiat regions). The artillery formations, at first staffed by foreigners, were reformed in the 1630s, with a new tax levied to support them. This time also marked the introduction of the General of the Artillery post into the Commonwealth army. In the mid-17th century, the numbers of wojsko zaciężne and kwarciane proved to be insufficient, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> wojsko komputowe (named after komput, a document passed by the Sejm). Wojsko komputowe numbered (in 1649) 26,000. At the same time, wojsko kwarciane was disbanded, and kwarta directed towards the newly created artillery forces. Brzezinski notes that wojsko kwarciane was dissolved in the aftermath of its defeat at the battle of Batoh in 1652. In 1659, in aftermath of a series of wars, the reformed army numbered around 54,000-60,000; it would decline from that point onward, as the country, impoverished from those wars, {{would not be able to}} support such a number again.|$|E
