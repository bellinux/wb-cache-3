40|$|In this study, a semi-analytical {{numerical}} method, the scaled boundary {{finite element}} method, is employed {{to investigate the}} time-dependent behaviour of pile foundations when subjected to ocean wave loads. Individual piles present steady-state vibrations at the same frequency as external waves considering the material damping effect. In the case {{with a group of}} two piles, the structural behaviour of pile foundations is a multivariable function of the wave properties and the spatial arrangement of piles, and each pile responses differently to various parameter combinations. The <b>leading</b> <b>pile,</b> which interacts with incoming waves earlier, normally experiences greater displacement amplitude than the subsequent pile. Both piles show relatively greater displacement in cases with large wave numbers. When the two piles are closely spaced or when the wave number is small, their responses tend to have phase difference and move towards different directions.

40|$|In a pile group {{subjected}} to lateral or moment loading, the soil movements are primarily along the loading direction. In a torsionally load pile group, however, the primary soil movements are rotational. The movements of soils in the pile group {{can be in}} arbitrary directions. As a result, the soil response in a torsionally loaded pile group {{is different from that}} in a laterally loaded pile group. In this paper, three-dimensional finite-difference analyses of a torsionally loaded single pile, a torsionally loaded pile group, a laterally loaded single pile and a laterally loaded pile group are conducted to study soil responses and group interactions in torsionally loaded pile groups. The large-diameter bored piles studied are 2 in in diameter and 13. 2 in in length. The pile groups are 2 x 2 groups with a three-diameter spacing.

The tests were {{run on a}} 3 × 3 pile group supporting a foundation with and without a superstructure set in a dry sand deposit prepared in a cylindrical laminar box. Experimental variables included the natural period of a superstructure {{and the presence of}} foundation embedment. Based on the test results and discussions, the following conclusions are made: (1) When the natural period of a superstructure was shorter than or close to that of the ground, the inertial force of the superstructure mainly controlled pile stresses, in which both shear force and bending moment tended to be the largest in the <b>leading</b> <b>pile.</b> When the overturning moment is small in this case, sway motion dominates in which bending moment has maxima at both pile head and a certain depth in the ground. When the overturning moment becomes large enough to induce a rotation of foundation, by contrast, rocking motion dominates in which pile bending moment is small at the pile head, increasing with depth with a peak at some depth; (2) When the natural period of superstructure was much longer than that of the ground, the inertial force from the superstructure gets small and ground displacement may control the pile stresses {{in such a way that}} the shear forces at the pile heads were almost the same within a pile group. In this case, pile stress distributions with depth were mainly controlled by the sway motion due to the ground displacement, in which bending moment becomes a maximum only at the pile head and decreases with depth; and (3) The combination of the effects of the sway and rocking motions on pile stress varied depending on such factors as the presence of foundation embedment, natural periods of superstructures, aspect ratios of structures (height/width) and ground displacement...|$|E

40|$|Very limited {{experimental}} {{test data}} {{are available on the}} response of pile groups under the combined action of vertical and lateral loads. In practice, the loads applied on piles are often a combination of both vertical and lateral loads. In addition, piles are often arranged in groups, and the behavior of a pile group may differ substantially from that of a single pile. In this research, tests were performed on model pile groups subjected to both axial and lateral loads in order to evaluate the effects of pile-pile interaction in pile groups and to study the influence of axial loads on the lateral load response of pile groups in sands. The model pile groups tested consisted of 2 × 2, 1 × 2, and 1 × 3 piles. The model piles were driven into sand samples prepared at different densities using a large pluviator. The piles were then connected by a solid steel pile cap placed above ground level. The axial load (base and shaft) for a pile cap displacement of 10 % of the pile diameter was first obtained from axial load tests. For all the model pile groups tested in dense sand, the group efficiency was a little less than unity, while {{in the case of the}} pile groups tested in medium dense and loose sand values of group efficiency higher than one were measured. The results of the lateral pile load tests were presented in terms of the lateral load-pile head displacement response of the model pile groups, the load experienced by the individual piles in the groups, and the bending moment profiles of the individual piles. The lateral load carried by each pile was obtained from strain gauges that were attached to the shaft of the piles 10 cm below their head. The results showed that the <b>leading</b> <b>piles</b> experienced larger loads and bending moments than those experienced by the trailing piles due to the more intense pile-pile interaction. The combined load tests were performed for axial loads of 0 % (pure lateral load), 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the axial loads of the pile groups corresponding to a settlement of 10 % of the model pile diameter. The results of the combined load tests demonstrated that the bending moments and lateral deflections of the pile head increases substantially in the presence of axial loads with antifriction devices which provide minimal restraint to the lateral movement of the test piles. ...|$|R

Recognised here are two types of hyaloclastite deltas. One of syn-sedimentary origin (Hjörleifshöfði) and one derived from primary fragmentation processes (Stóri-Nupur).

30|$|The gain in pile {{capacity}} is analyzed by two phenomena of primary consolation and secondary consolidation. The sudden increase of shaft {{capacity is}} often linked to primary consolidation at initial times (day 0 up to day 7). Pile driving induces disturbance and alters {{the structure of}} the clay surrounding the <b>pile,</b> <b>leading</b> to development of excess pore water pressure as a result of soil disturbance. The increase in pore water pressure results in reduction of effective stress in the pile surrounding soil and, hence, decreases the pile-soil interface shear strength. On the other hand, immediately after pile driving, this generated excess pore water pressure starts to dissipate rapidly. The rate of decrease in pore water pressure due to dissipation is dependent on pile characteristics such as diameter and materials, as well as soil permeability. Similarly, the rate of increase in shaft capacity is proportional to the rate of decrease in pore water pressure as shown in Figs.  5 and 6. The rate of dissipation of the excess pore water pressure and, hence, the rate of increase in shaft capacity began to decline about 3  days after initial driving.|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of performance of deep foundation systems under seismic loading {{is one of}} the most complex problems in earthquake engineering, due to the varying degrees of nonlinear soil response observed during severe earthquakes. Strong shaking may lead to large excess pore pressures and strain-induced softening, increasing the amount of nonlinear behavior in the near, intermediate and free field domains. These effects overall become more significant for multi-directional shaking, which may reduce the soil stiffness and increase permanent deformations of the structure and/or soil even further. In particular, in the near field, lateral multi-directional movements of the pile can cause radial degradation of the soil stiffness, and can create radial gapping, which in turn, reduces the confinement of the <b>pile,</b> <b>leading</b> to an increase in bending moments on the structural members. Similarly, two-directional shaking may generate larger shear strains in the intermediate and free field.

In this paper a possible mechanism for production of abiogenic hydrocarbons is proposed, linking it to a previously proposed orogenic isostatic model.

40|$|The drumlin sediments at Chimney Bluffs, New York {{appear to}} {{represent}} a block-inmatrix style glacial melange. This melange comprises sand stringers, lenses and intraclasts juxtaposed in an apparently massive diamicton. Thin section examination of these glacigenic deposits has revealed microstructures indicative of autokinetic subglacial defonnation which are consistent with a deformable bed origin for the diamicton. These features include banding and. necking of matrix grains, oriented plasma fabrics {{and the formation of}} pressure shadows at the long axis ends of elongate clasts. Preservation of primary stratification within the sand intraclasts appears to suggest that these features were pre-existing up-ice deposits that were frozen, entrained, then deposited as part of a defonning till layer beneath an advancing ice sheet. Multi-directional micro-shearing within the sand blocks is thought to reflect the frozen nature of the sand units in such a high strain environment. It is also contended that dewatering of the sediment <b>pile</b> <b>leading</b> to the eventual immobilisation of the defonning till layer was responsible for opening sub-horizontal fissures within the diamicton. These features were subsequently infilled with mass flow poorly sorted sands and silts which were subjected to ductile defonnation during the waning stages of an actively deforming till layer. Microstructures indicative of the dewatering processes in the sand units include patches of fine-grained particles within a coarser-grained matrix and the presence of concentrated zones of translocated clays. However, these units were probably confined within an impermeable diamicton casing that prevented massive pore water influxes from the deforming till layer~ Hence, these microstructures probably reflect localised dewatering of the sand intraclasts. A layered subglacial shear zone model is proposed for the various features exhibited by the drumlin sediments. The complexity of these structures is explained in terms of ii superposing deformation styles in response to changing pore water pressures. Constructional glaciotectonics, as implied by the occurrence of sub-horizontal fissuring, is suggested as the mechanism for the stacking of the sand intraclast units within the diamicton. The usefulness of micromorphology in complimenting the traditional sedimentology of glacigenic deposits is emphasised by the current study. An otherwise massive diamicton was shown to contain microstructures indicative of the very high strain rates expected in a complexly deforming till layer.. It is quite obvious from this investigation that the classification of diamictons needs to be re-examined for evidence of microstructures that could lead to the re-interpretation of diamicton forming processes.

6000|$|But {{in order}} to judge this Jewish possibility, we must {{understand}} more fully {{the nature of the}} Jewish problem. We must consider it from the start, because there are still many who do not {{know that there is a}} Jewish problem. That problem has its proof, of course, in the history of the Jew, and the fact that he came from the East. A Jew will sometimes complain of the injustice of describing him as a man of the East; but in truth another very real injustice may be involved in treating him as a man of the West. Very often even the joke against the Jew is rather a joke against those who have made the joke; that is, a joke against what they have made out of the Jew. This is true especially, for instance, of many points of religion and ritual. Thus we cannot help feeling, for instance, that there is something a little grotesque about the Hebrew habit of putting on a top-hat as an act of worship. It is vaguely mixed up with another line of humour, about another class of Jew, who wears a large number of hats; and who must not therefore be credited with an extreme or extravagant religious zeal, <b>leading</b> him to <b>pile</b> up a pagoda of hats towards heaven. To Western eyes, in Western conditions, there really is something inevitably fantastic about this formality of the synagogue. But we ought to remember that we have made the Western conditions which startle the Western eyes. It seems odd to wear a modern top-hat as if it were a mitre or a biretta; it seems quainter still when the hat is worn even for the momentary purpose of saying grace before lunch. It seems quaintest of all when, at some Jewish luncheon parties, a tray of hats is actually handed round, and each guest helps himself to a hat as a sort of hors d'oeuvre. All this could easily be turned into a joke; but we ought to realise that the joke is against ourselves. It is not merely we who make fun of it, but we who have made it funny. For, after all, nobody can pretend that this particular type of head-dress is a part of that uncouth imagery [...] "setting painting and sculpture at defiance" [...] which Renan remarked in the tradition of Hebrew civilisation. Nobody can say that a top-hat was among the strange symbolic utensils dedicated to the obscure service of the Ark; nobody can suppose that a top-hat descended from heaven among the wings and wheels of the flying visions of the Prophets. For this wild vision the West is entirely responsible. Europe has created the Tower of Giotto; but it has also created the topper. We of the West must bear the burden, as best we may, both of the responsibility and of the hat. It is solely the special type and shape of hat that makes the Hebrew ritual seem ridiculous. Performed in the old original Hebrew fashion it is not ridiculous, but rather if anything sublime. For the original fashion was an oriental fashion; and the Jews are orientals; and the mark of all such orientals is the wearing of long and loose draperies. To throw those loose draperies over the head is decidedly a dignified and even poetic gesture. One can imagine something like justice done to its majesty and mystery in one of the great dark drawings of William Blake. It may be true, and personally I think it is true, that the Hebrew covering of the head signifies a certain stress on the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, while the Christian uncovering of the head suggests rather the love of God that is the end of wisdom. But this has nothing to do with the taste and dignity of the ceremony; and to do justice to these we must treat the Jew as an oriental; we must even dress him as an oriental.|$|R
