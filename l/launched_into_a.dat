5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the International Space Station. Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use the International Space Station as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E

25|$|Compass-1 (also {{known as}} Compass One) is a German amateur CubeSat picosatellite, built and {{operated}} {{in the late}} 2000s by Aachen University of Applied Science. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation, aboard a PSLV rocket as a secondary payload to the CartoSat-2A primary spacecraft on 28 April 2008. It was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Geocentric orbit with an altitude of 597nbsp&km. Its primary mission is remote sensing; however, it also contains some technology demonstration experiments {{regarding the use of}} small satellites and GPS tracking.|$|E
25|$|As {{originally}} conceived, ISRO was {{to launch}} MOM on its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), {{but as the}} GSLV failed twice in 2010 and ISRO was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine, it was not advisable {{to wait for the}} new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the MOM project for at least three years. ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the Oberth effect) to place itself on a trans-Mars trajectory.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} very proud of his work in {{producing}} the first artificial meteors. He placed explosive charges in the nose cone of a V2 rocket, to be detonated at high altitude and fire high velocity pellets of metal through the atmosphere. The first attempts appeared to be failures, and Zwicky sought to try again with the Aerobee rocket. His requests were denied, until the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. Twelve days later, on October 16, 1957, Zwicky launched his experiment on the Aerobee, and successfully fired pellets visible from the Mount Palomar observatory. It is thought {{that one of these}} pellets may have escaped the gravitational pull of the Earth and become the first object <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> solar orbit.|$|E

25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E
25|$|On lap 2, Schumacher took {{second from}} Alesi {{after a couple}} of {{unsuccessful}} earlier attempts. The Frenchman had been holding Schumacher up while Senna pulled out a 4-second lead. Senna and Schumacher pulled away {{from the rest of the}} pack, increasing their lead by over a second a lap. Both pitted on lap 21 but Schumacher was quicker and rejoined ahead. He pulled away to take a 10-second lead but then Senna began to reel him in. By lap 35, Verstappen, Brundle and Eddie Irvine had all got ahead of Wendlinger. As they came up to lap Éric Bernard, Verstappen tried to pass Irvine. Irvine pushed him onto the grass and Verstappen spun off, going over Irvine and tipping it into Bernard's car and then hitting Brundle, being <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> series of barrel rolls. No-one was hurt, but Irvine was banned initially for one race, later extended to three races by the FIA after an unsuccessful appeal. By now, Alesi, who had stopped twice, was behind Hill who had only stopped once.|$|E
25|$|The rematch with McFarland {{was set for}} 4 July, Independence Day, to {{coincide}} with the World Lightweight Title fight between champion Joe Gans and Battling Nelson held in California. The Welsh-McFarland fight was gaining much press attention, and this increased after fight promoter and owner of the Jeffries Arena, Jim Jeffries, had offered Gans a $20,000 purse to face the winner of the bout in August. Betting was heavy for the match, and was to be refereed by Jeffries himself. Fought over 25 rounds, Welsh had the upper hand for the first nineteen, but after an announcement was made that Nelson had won in California, Welsh's game slipped with McFarland taking control. In the final two rounds Welsh took a heavy beating and was knocked down to the canvas in the last round. At the end of the encounter the decision from the referee was a draw. McFarland took the result badly and <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vicious tirade of abuse towards Jeffries, though Welsh too thought he had done enough to win in the first two thirds of the fight and sent a cablegram to Wales stating such.|$|E

25|$|At the lap four restart, Vernay {{made ground}} up on Ericsson, {{and managed to}} {{slipstream}} past the All-Japan Formula Three champion on the run to Lisboa. Ricciardo tried a similar move on Bottas but could not manage to complete the pass, and such was his momentum loss, Vanthoor managed to slip through on the Australian into fifth position. Another Carlin driver in the wars was Hartley, as he clouted Coletti out of eighth position. Over the succeeding laps, Asmer's lap record from 2007 took a pounding as first Mortara and then Vernay took the lap record into the 2:10 bracket. However, any further progress for the record to fall was halted by a huge accident that befell Boyd on lap seven. Running in eleventh position, the young Ulsterman pulled out to pass his team-mate Mäki on the exit of the Mandarin, but clipped the car's left rear wheel at 170mph. Boyd's Dallara became airborne and was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> frightening aerial somersault, landing upside down before righting itself via a hit with the retaining wall. His car rebounded across the circuit, and was luckily avoided by {{every one of the}} cars around him on track. The crash meant the last three laps of the race were completed behind the safety car, and pulled in to allow the cars to pass across the line without overtaking. This allowed Vernay to win the race, securing pole position for the main race on Sunday. Ericsson was second ahead of Mortara– once he had returned the place back to the Swede– with Bottas, Vanthoor, Ricciardo, Bird, Iguchi, Merhi and Mäki completing the top ten. Outside the top ten were van der Zande, Kunimoto, Sims, García, Chilton, Cozzolino, Dusseldorp, Saga, Huertas, Zampieri, Bianchi and Coletti after their respective collisions, Imperatori, Hartley, McKenzie and Ho rounded out the 26 classified finishers.|$|E

John Stow talked to old men who, remembering him, said [...] "that he was of bodily shape comely enough, only of low stature" [...] and a German traveller, Nicolas von Poppelau, who spent ten days in Richard's household in May 1484, describes him as [...] "three fingers taller than himself...much more lean, with delicate {{arms and legs and}} also a great heart."

[...] Despite Gomez's strong start, Alvarez dazed Gomez with a stiff right hand shot in the fourth round, after which the Argentinian <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> furious onslaught. [...] Gomez steadied in the fifth but was visibly tired. Two minutes into the sixth round, Alvarez floored Gomez with a right hook.
