50|$|The Lightship Nantucket or Nantucket Shoals was {{the name}} given to the lightvessel that marked the {{hazardous}} Nantucket Shoals south of Nantucket Island. Several ships have been commissioned and served at the Nantucket Shoals <b>lightship</b> <b>station</b> and have been called Nantucket. It was common for a lightship to be reassigned and then renamed for its new station.The Nantucket station was a significant US <b>lightship</b> <b>station</b> for transatlantic voyages. Established in 1854, the station marked {{the limits of the}} dangerous Nantucket Shoals. She was the last lightship seen by vessels departing the United States, as well as the first beacon seen on approach. The position was 40 mi southeast of Nantucket Island, the farthest lightship in North America, and experienced clockwise rotary tidal currents.|$|E

50|$|This {{light was}} erected in 1869 {{to replace the}} last of three <b>lightships</b> <b>stationed</b> at this {{location}} to {{mark the end of}} the Rappahannock Spit, a shoal extending east from Windmill Point itself. These <b>lightships</b> were <b>stationed</b> beginning in 1839, the first being seized by the Confederates in the Civil War. As was typical of such an exposed location, ice was a serious threat, and the light was badly damaged in the winter of 1917-1918, with repairs not completed until 1921.|$|R
50|$|This light {{replaced}} <b>lightships</b> <b>stationed</b> at {{this location}} beginning in 1853. Extra fender piles {{were added to}} the usual six pile structure in order to provide extra stability against the current. In 1903 riprap was placed around the piles for additional protection. A hurricane in September 1933 damaged the light.|$|R
50|$|United States Lightship 101, {{known as}} Portsmouth, was first {{stationed}} at Cape Charles, Virginia. Today {{she is at}} the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum in Portsmouth, Virginia. Portsmouth never had a <b>lightship</b> <b>station,</b> however when the vessel was dry docked there as a museum, she took on the pseudo-name, Portsmouth. A National Historic Landmark, {{she is one of}} a small number of surviving lightships.|$|E
5000|$|United States {{lightship}} Chesapeake (LV-116/WAL-538/WLV-538) is {{a museum}} ship {{owned by the}} National Park Service and on a 25-year loan to Baltimore City, and is operated by Historic Ships in Baltimore, Maryland. A National Historic Landmark, {{she is one of}} a small number of preserved lightships. Since 1820, several lightships have served at the Chesapeake <b>lightship</b> <b>station</b> and have been called Chesapeake. It was common for a lightship to be reassigned from one <b>Lightship</b> <b>Station</b> to another and thus [...] "renamed" [...] and identified by its new station name. Even though the [...] "name" [...] changed during a Lightships service life, the hull number never changed. The United States Coast Guard assigned new hull numbers to all lightships still in service in April 1950. After that date, Light Ship / Light Vessel 116 was then known by the new Coast Guard Hull number: WAL-538. In January 1965 the Coast Guard further modified all lightship hull designations from WAL to WLV, so Chesapeake became WLV-538.|$|E
50|$|The United States Lightship LV-87/WAL-512 (Ambrose) is a riveted steel {{lightship}} {{built in}} 1907 and {{served at the}} Ambrose Channel <b>lightship</b> <b>station</b> from December 1, 1908 until 1932, and in other posts until her decommissioning in 1966. It {{is one of a}} small number of preserved American lightships, and now serves as a museum ship at the South Street Seaport Museum in southern Manhattan, New York City.|$|E
50|$|The Seven Stones lightvessel also {{acts as an}} {{automatic}} weather station. A series of Trinity House <b>lightships</b> <b>stationed</b> near the Sevenstones Reef have measured significant wave heights (Hs or SWH)—the periodic average of the highest one third of waves in a spectrum—since the early 1960s using Ship Borne Wave Recorders (SBWR). The Sevenstones Lightship {{is in a very}} exposed location and is open to most North Atlantic storms.|$|R
50|$|The {{first light}} at this {{location}} was a hexagonal screw-pile lighthouse erected in 1872, replacing the last <b>lightship</b> <b>stationed</b> within the bay. It {{was destroyed by}} fire in 1880 and replaced {{in the same year}} with a new house on the same foundation. This was facilitated by the availability of a newly constructed house originally intended for the Bells Rock Light, so that the light was out of service for only fifty-five days.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lightships</b> were <b>stationed</b> at this {{location}} beginning in 1825. During the Civil War the lightship was burned by Confederate forces in 1861.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the {{lighthouse}} {{began in the}} spring of 1950 on the Suomenlinna shipyard. The tower was erected during the autumn of 1952, the Caisson was sunk to a depth of 10 m about 12 km (7.5 mi) from shore and about 25 km (15 mi) south of Porvoo. The lighthouse stands 27 m above sea level and was originally built to replace a <b>lightship</b> <b>station.</b> The design of {{the lighthouse}} {{is similar to that of}} several Swedish Baltic Sea lighthouses and she was painted with red and white horizontal bands.|$|E
50|$|Craney Island {{forms the}} west side of the {{entrance}} to Norfolk's harbor and has been used as a military facility since the War of 1812. In 1820 a lightship was stationed off its eastern side to protect the edge of the channel. This ship had previously been stationed off Willoughby's Shoal, but was quickly moved after it was determined that the first location was too exposed. This was the first permanent <b>lightship</b> <b>station</b> in the country; it was replaced in 1859 by the first of two screw-pile lights, a square house which survived until 1884. In that year the decrepit structure was replaced with a new hexagonal house, which in turn was removed in 1936, to be replaced by an automated light on the old foundation. In the early 1970s the light was completely removed and replaced by a buoy.|$|E
5000|$|Commissioned in 1921, the Huron began {{service as}} a relief vessel for other Great Lakes lightships. She is ninety-seven feet long, twenty-four feet in beam, and carried a crew of eleven. On clear nights her beacon could be seen for {{fourteen}} miles (21 km). After serving in northern Lake Michigan, the Huron {{was assigned to the}} Corsica Shoals in 1935. These shallow waters, six miles (10 km) north of Port Huron, were the scene of frequent groundings by lake freighters in the late nineteenth century. A <b>lightship</b> <b>station</b> had been established there in 1893, since the manned ships were more reliable than lighted buoys. After 1940 the Huron was the only lightship on the Great Lakes. Retired from Coast GuardService in 1970, she was presented to the City of Port Huron in 1971. State historical marker ...|$|E

50|$|In 1854, {{because of}} {{complaints}} from mariners that {{the height of}} the existing Bald Head Lighthouse was inadequate, and the light of its Third-order Fresnel lens wasn't bright enough to warn mariners of the shallow waters of the treacherous Frying Pan Shoals off the coast of Cape Fear in North Carolina, United States, the first <b>lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> on the shoals, in lieu of a proposal to improve Bald Point Lighthouse. <b>Lightships</b> remained on <b>station</b> for 110 years.|$|R

50|$|The {{first true}} Lightship Baskets {{were made in}} the mid- to late 1800s aboard the Lightship {{stationed}} on the Nantucket Shoals. The first <b>Lightship</b> <b>Station</b> on the Nantucket Island Shoal was established in June 1854 and crewed by six men. Deployments aboard the Lightship often lasted for 30 days and the crewmembers generally had little to do. The earliest Lightship Baskets begin appearing in the 1860s and are generally of more utilitarian form. The first purse style basket with a lid was made by Lightship Captain Charles Ray (1798-1884), and is relatively similar to the type sold today. Lightship basket bases, rims, and staves tended to be made on-island, with lightship crewmembers bringing these items on board the ship to do the actual weaving, and help pass the time. The moulds were originally made from old cut-up ships' masts. According to the Nantucket Lightship Basket Museum, some of these early Lightship Basket makers included: “Captain Davis Hall, Captain Andrew Sandsbury, Roland Folger, Thomas W. Barrallay, William D. Appleton, George W. Ray, Charles F. Ray, Joe Fisher, Charlie Sylvia, SB Raymond and Isaac Hamblin.” Lightship Baskets stopped being made on board the Nantucket lightships in 1900, when the government stopped allowing crewmembers to spend time doing so. The process continued on Nantucket Island. José Formoso Reyes began making the first true lightship basket purses in the 1940s, calling them “Friendship Baskets” after learning the craft from Captain Charles Ray’s grandson Mitchel Ray. Charlie Sayles, Sr. is credited with creating the original Ivory Whale adornment for a basket top in the 1940s, a practice that is ubiquitous today.|$|E
50|$|Commissioned in 1951, Columbia was {{the fourth}} and final <b>lightship</b> <b>stationed</b> {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River. Built by Rice Brothers Shipyard in Boothbay, Maine, Columbia was {{launched}} with her sister-ship, Relief (WLV-605). The new WLV-604 replaced the aging vessel LV-93, which had been in service on the Columbia River since 1939. The Columbia River lightships guided vessels across the Columbia River Bar and an area known as the Graveyard of the Pacific from 1892 until 1979. Columbia was the final lightship to be decommissioned on the U.S. West coast. She was replaced by an automated navigational buoy soon after. The buoy has since been retired.|$|R
50|$|That lightship, LV 69, was {{the first}} of six lightships {{employed}} at Diamond Shoals in the twentieth century. Prior to World War I, lightships were assigned in pairs at this station, which each relieving the other; after LV 71 was sunk by the German submarine U-104, a single ship was assigned, relieved as needed. During World War II the lightship was replaced by a lighted buoy. The last <b>lightship</b> <b>stationed</b> here, WLV 189, {{was the first}} lightship built after the Coast Guard took over the Lighthouse Service, and the first all-welded lightship; it was expressly built for service at this station, and remained in service there until 1966.|$|R
50|$|At 2:30 a.m. on 20 December 1983 the Lightship 613 {{relieved}} Lightship 612 until 8:00 a.m. {{when she}} was relieved by a Large Navigational Buoy, making Lightship 613 the last <b>Lightship</b> on <b>station</b> in the US and on Nantucket Station.|$|R
5000|$|... "Smith Point", at {{the mouth}} of the Potomac River, has been marked by a {{succession}} of lights, having been served by three towers, three lightships, a screw-pile lighthouse, and the present caisson structure. The first light, a stone tower, was erected by Elzy Burroughs on Smith Point itself in 1802. Erosion at the point was severe, and the light had to be rebuilt further inland in 1807 by Burroughs and his brother, William K. Burroughs. William had also been named the second keeper of the light in 1806. Again in 1828 the tower was rebuilt, this time by another builder. This last tower was finally abandoned in 1859, having been supplemented in the meantime by a <b>lightship</b> <b>stationed</b> off the point from 1821 onward.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1901or 1902as a {{replacement}} for Point Adams Light. The <b>Lightship</b> Columbia kept <b>station</b> about 5 mi offshore.|$|R
50|$|Daunt Rock {{has always}} been a hazard to shipping. The first <b>lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> there by the Irish Lights Board in 1864 {{following}} the wreck of the City of New York on the rock. Lightvessel Puffin took up this duty. There was a severe gale on 8 October 1896 and the Puffin vanished.|$|R
50|$|The United States Coast Guard {{indicates}} that a <b>lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> at Pacific Reef starting in 1838. The Pacific Reef Light erected in 1921 is still operational.

50|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{launched an}} extensive {{investigation into the}} disappearance of the crew of the Deering. Five departments of the government - Commerce, Treasury, Justice, Navy, and State - looked into the case. Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, was intrigued by the fact that several other vessels of various nationalities - most notably the sulfur freighter Hewitt - had also disappeared in roughly the same area. Though most of these vessels were later revealed to have been sailing in the vicinity of a series of particularly vicious hurricanes, the Hewitt and Deering were proven to have been sailing away from the area of the storm at the time. Hoover's assistant, Lawrence Ritchey, was placed in charge of the investigation. Ritchey tried to chart what happened to the vessel between its last sighting at Cape Lookout and its running aground at Diamond Shoals by reading the log books of the Coast Guard <b>lightships</b> <b>stationed</b> at those places.|$|R

50|$|Various <b>lightships</b> {{held this}} <b>station</b> from 1823 until its {{replacement}} in 1967. The original {{was only the}} fourth lightship designed and commissioned to serve a U.S. coastal port. The first Lightship Ambrose is now a museum in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Diamond Shoals, which extend {{many miles}} out from Cape Hatteras, is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dangerous spots on the Atlantic seaboard. While a light was exhibited from the cape itself from 1804, its range was insufficient, and a <b>lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> on the shoal itself in 1824. It was driven off station numerous times, eventually being wrecked near Ocracoke Inlet in 1827. Various buoys were placed beginning in 1852, but all were short-lived.|$|R
50|$|The bank {{extends from}} Northwest to Southeast, is 10 {{miles long and}} 1 mile broad. In the late 1840s the Bahama Bank <b>Lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> on its Southeast end, in 11 fathoms, its light visible at the {{distance}} of 10 miles. Following {{the construction of the}} Maughold Head Lighthouse the Bahama Bank Lightship was decommissioned in 1914 and replaced by a buoy. The Bahama Bank was formerly a popular area for fishing within region of the Isle of Man.|$|R

50|$|Old Baldy lighthouse, {{built in}} 1817, was not tall enough or {{bright enough to}} aid vessels trying to avoid Frying Pan Shoals in all weather conditions. To remedy the problem, a <b>lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> on the shoals {{themselves}} in the mid-1800s. On multiple occasions the lightship broke loose and drifted freely, leaving Frying Pan Shoals without a light, or worse with a light in the wrong place. This problem was compounded when New Inlet closed and vessels were {{no longer able to}} avoid navigating around the shoals.|$|R
50|$|Wolf Trap Shoal juts {{into the}} bay from Winter Harbor, a point {{a few miles north}} of Mobjack Bay and the York River. It got its name from the 1691 {{grounding}} of HMS Wolf, a British naval vessel engaged in enforcing the Navigation Act and in combating piracy. In 1821 a <b>lightship</b> was <b>stationed</b> at this spot, and after refurbishment in 1854, the original ship was destroyed by Confederate raiders in 1861 during the Civil War. Two years later a replacement ship was put on station.|$|R
5000|$|Relief {{was built}} in 1904 as a light vessel for the United States Lighthouse Service, {{a part of the}} United States Department of the Treasury.
