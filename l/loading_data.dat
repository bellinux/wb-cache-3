5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue <b>loading</b> <b>data</b> allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E

This reduces accumulation of gaseous {{oxygen in the}} feed line during prelaunch tanking (loading of the LOX). After propellant <b>loading</b> <b>data</b> from ground tests and the first few space shuttle missions were assessed, the anti-geyser line was removed for subsequent missions.

30|$|To {{improve the}} quality of power <b>load</b> <b>data,</b> {{stochastic}} noise present in the <b>load</b> <b>data</b> must be identified and filtered out [5, 6]. At present, there are mainly following methods in the power load forecasting field, such as regression analysis, combined forecasting, exponentially smoothing, neural network and wavelet methods, and so on. Moreover, in view of the uncertainties and randomness of short-term <b>load,</b> innovative <b>data</b> processing strategies are proposed, such as frequency domain decomposition method and property matrix hierarchical analysis method [7 â€“ 9]. However, the existing time series modeling methods may not meet the requirements of time series stationary. These methods neglect the pretreatment of <b>load</b> <b>data</b> and statistical checking [10]. Independent, steady, normal, zero-mean and trend-item processing of the required data is required, and non-stationary, non-random and non-normal characteristics of power <b>load</b> <b>data</b> are needed to be tested.|$|R
