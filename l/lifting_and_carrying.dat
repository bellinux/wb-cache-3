25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E
500|$|Anecdotes about Milo's almost superhuman {{strength}} and lifestyle abound. [...] His daily diet allegedly consisted of 9 kg (20lbs) of meat, 9 kg (20lbs) of bread, and 10 litres (18 pt) of wine. Pliny the Elder (XXXVII, 54 = 144) and Solinus (De mirabilibus mundi, 77) both attribute Milo's invincibility in competition to the wrestler's consumption of alectoriae, the gizzard stones of roosters. [...] Legends say he carried his own bronze statue to its place at Olympia, and once carried a four-year-old bull {{on his shoulders}} before slaughtering, roasting, and devouring it in one day. He {{was said to have}} achieved the feat of lifting the bull by starting in childhood, <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> a newborn calf and repeating the feat daily as it grew to maturity.|$|E
500|$|Although less {{dangerous}} than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, {{and would be}} exacerbated by constant exposure {{to high levels of}} mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, <b>lifting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dance is}} {{sometimes}} said to reenact a violent [...] "discussion" [...] between a pimp and a prostitute. It includes mock slaps and punches, the man picking up and throwing {{the woman to}} the ground, or <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> her while she struggles or feigns unconsciousness. Thus, the dance shares many features with the theatrical discipline of stage combat. In some examples, the woman may fight back.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Repetitive manual {{handling}} tasks {{account for a}} substantial portion of work-related injuries. However, few studies report endurance time in repetitive {{manual handling}} tasks. Consequently, there is little guidance to inform expected work time for repetitive manual handling tasks. We aimed to investigate endurance time and oxygen consumption of a repetitive <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> task using linear mixed models. Methods Fourteen male soldiers (age 22. 4 ± 4. 5 yrs, height 1. 78 ± 0. 04 m, body mass 76. 3 ± 10. 1 kg) conducted four assessment sessions that consisted of one maximal box <b>lifting</b> session <b>and</b> three <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> sessions. The relationships between carry mass (range 17. 5 - 37. 5 kg) and the duration of <b>carry,</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> mass <b>and</b> oxygen consumption, were assessed using linear mixed models with random effects to account for between-subject variation. Results Results demonstrated that endurance time was inversely associated with carry mass (R 2 = 0. 24), with significant individual-level variation (R 2 = 0. 85). Normalising carry mass to performance in a maximal box lifting test improved the prediction of endurance time (R 2 = 0. 40). Oxygen consumption presented relative to total mass (body mass, external load <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> mass) was not significantly related to <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> mass (β 1 = 0. 16, SE = 0. 10, 95 %CI: - 0. 04, 0. 36, p = 0. 12), indicating that there was no change in oxygen consumption relative to total mass with increasing <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> mass. Conclusion Practically, these data can be used to guide work-rest schedules and provide insight into methods assessing the physical capacity of workers conducting repetitive manual handling tasks...|$|R

50|$|The stone {{has been}} used as a test of {{strength}} by either simply lifting the stone, or by <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> the stone around the goat pen where it is located. The Husafell Stone is also named Kviahellan (pen slab) by pastor Snorri, who used the stone as a door to his sheep pen. The test to achieve fullsterkur ("full-strong") status is to lift the stone up and carry it the 50 metres around the perimeter of the goat pen. Successfully walking the full distance around the pen is considered a widely recognized feat of strength in the field of stone carrying, and is referred to as achieving fullsterkur status.|$|E
50|$|A hydria (ὑδρία; plural hydriai) {{is a type}} of water-carrying vessel in the {{metalwork}} {{and pottery}} of Ancient Greece. The hydria has three handles. Two horizontal handles {{on either side of the}} body of the pot were used for <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> the pot. The third handle, a vertical one, located in the center of the other two handles, was used when pouring water. If the third handle is missing, the type is called a kalpis. This water vessel can be found in both red- and black-figure technique. They often depicted scenes of Greek mythology that reflected moral and social obligations. As well as holding water hydriai could be used for holding ashes in burials and collecting ballots in elections.|$|E

50|$|Bats that consume non-insect animal prey are benefited by low wing-loading, {{which allows}} them to <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> larger prey items.

50|$|Strength: Hanuman is {{extraordinarily}} strong, one capable of <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> any burden for a cause. He is called Vira, Mahavira, Mahabala and other names signifying this attribute of his. During the epic war between Rama and Ravana, Rama's brother Lakshmana is wounded. He {{can only be}} healed and his death prevented by a herb found in a particular Himalayan mountain. Hanuman leaps and finds the mountain. There, states Ramayana, Hanuman finds the mountain is full of many herbs. He doesn't know which one to take. So, he lifts the entire Himalayan mountain and carries it across India to Lanka for Lakshmana. His immense strength thus helps Lakshmana recover from his wound. This legend is the popular basis for the iconography where he is shown flying and carrying a mountain on his palm.|$|E
50|$|Homotherium reached 1.1 m at the {{shoulder}} and weighed an estimated 190 kg and was therefore {{about the size of}} a male African lion. Compared to some other machairodonts, like Smilodon or Megantereon, Homotherium had shorter upper canines, but they were flat, serrated and longer than those of any living cat. Incisors and lower canines formed a powerful puncturing and gripping device. Among living cats, only the tiger (Panthera tigris) has such large incisors, which aid in <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> prey. The molars of Homotherium were rather weak and not adapted for bone crushing. The skull was longer than in Smilodon and had a well-developed crest, where muscles were attached to power the lower jaw. This jaw had down-turned forward flanges to protect the scimitars. Its large canine teeth were crenulated and designed for slashing rather than purely stabbing.|$|E

5000|$|The long {{distance}} human transport theory was bolstered in 2011 {{by the discovery}} of a megalithic bluestone quarry at Craig Rhos-y-felin, near Crymych in Pembrokeshire, which is the most likely place for some of the stones to have been obtained. Other standing stones may well have been small sarsens (sandstone), used later as lintels. The stones, which weighed about two tons, could have been moved by <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>carrying</b> them on rows of poles and rectangular frameworks of poles, as recorded in China, Japan and India. It is not known whether the stones were taken directly from their quarries to Salisbury Plain or were the result of the removal of a venerated stone circle from Preseli to Salisbury Plain to [...] "merge two sacred centres into one, to unify two politically separate regions, or to legitimise the ancestral identity of migrants moving from one region to another". [...] Each monolith measures around 2 m in height, between 1 and 1.5 m wide and around 0.8 m thick. What was to become known as the Altar Stone is almost certainly derived from the Senni Beds, perhaps from 50 mi east of Mynydd Preseli in the Brecon Beacons.|$|E
