40|$|Background: Advance care {{planning}} (ACP) {{is thought to}} enhance patient autonomy and improve end-of-life care. However, {{there is evidence that}} when patients engage in ACP, the resultant plans are often not implemented. This has been attributed to either nonadherence by health professionals or inadequacies in ACP such as inaccessibility of the plans, plans providing ambiguous or conflicting instructions, and inappropriate focus on the completion of documents rather than communication. However, it is not known whether these postulated reasons are consistent with the experiences and views of health care professionals providing end-of-life care in the community. Objective: Our aim was to explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) on factors influencing the implementation of ACPs. Methods: We conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews of a purposive sample of 17 Australian GPs. Interview transcripts were analysed using constructionist grounded theory utilizing NVivo 9 software. Results: Factors that were considered to have an important influence on the implementation of ACPs include: ACP factors such as form, <b>legal</b> standing, accessibility, <b>clarity,</b> currency, and specificity; illness factors such as quality of life, function, diagnosis, prognosis, and prognostic certainty; family factors such as family attitudes to ACP and different conceptualizations on whether care is provided to individuals or to a family unit; and organizational and care setting factors such as health care facility 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes and policies in relation to end-of-life care. Conclusions: Problems in implementation of ACPs are multifactorial and not necessarily due to deliberate nonadherence by health professionals. Potential solutions to improve the clinical impact of ACP are discussed. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the legal {{framework}} in Ireland for specialist palliative care is inadequate and consequently a more appropriate legal framework must be identified. This research is guided by three central research questions. The first central research question examines {{the legitimacy of the}} distinction between specialist palliative care and euthanasia. The second central research question asks what legal framework currently exists in Ireland for specialist palliative care. The third central research question examines an alternative legal framework for specialist palliative. This thesis is composed of seven chapters. The first Chapter is an introduction to the thesis and defines the terminology and the central research questions. Chapter Two explores the development and practice of palliative care in Ireland. Chapter Three examines the distinction in criminal law between specialist palliative care practices and euthanasia. Chapter Four examines the human rights framework for specialist palliative care. Chapter Five critiques the regulatory framework in Ireland for specialist palliative care. Having gained a thorough understanding of palliative care and the related legal framework, this thesis then engages in comparative analysis of the Netherlands which is used as a source of ideas for reform in Ireland. Chapter Seven is the concluding chapter and, in it, the main findings of this thesis are summarised. The main findings being that: the distinction between specialist palliative care and euthanasia is not sufficiently supported by justifications such as a double effect or the acts and omissions distinction, there is no clear decision-making framework in Ireland for specialist palliative care, and the current <b>legal</b> framework lacks <b>clarity</b> and does not promote consistency between providers of specialist palliative care.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} the Chinese laws, judicial interpretations, scholarly views and government policies relating to contractual formality for land sale contracts in their historical and modern settings. The thesis also employs a comparative methodology to critically evaluate the Statute of Frauds literature in some selected Common Law jurisdictions {{such as the}} United States, Australia and England. This investigation includes English legal history, {{the development of the}} Statute of Frauds legislation, associated scholarly views and judicial interpretations. These positions and arguments are compared and contrasted with their counterpart in mainland China and other Civil Law jurisdictions such as Germany and Taiwan, including Chinese legal history, the principle of freedom of contract and the Chinese version of Healing Theory. The most important original contribution is the examination and integration of the functions of formality (particularly writing) in both Sino-Civilian (mainland China, Germany and Taiwan) and Anglo-American literature which forms the theoretical framework of the thesis. Formality is also examined against the theory of freedom of contract in mainland China. Additionally, the thesis compares and contrasts the contractual consequences where the statutory writing obligation is not observed, as well as the legal techniques to address oral land sale contracts across the selected Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions. Arising out of this, the thesis proposes a legal reform measure for mainland China and argues for a clear requirement of writing for real property sale contracts in modern mainland China. The reform recommendation also includes contractual consequence for lack of writing and the legal techniques to address the informal and sale contracts. This reform has legal, political, economic and social significance. The reform increases <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>clarity</b> in land sale contracts, {{one of the most important}} dealings in Chinese society, and could be integrated into China’s unified Civil Code in the making.
