After eight years of consulting and little in way of changes the school ended its relationship with Olmsted in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{surrounding}} the museum cover about 100 hectares. They {{were designed by}} the French <b>landscape</b> <b>architect</b> and botanist Édouard André (1840–1911) and his son Rene Eduard Andre, assisted by the Belgian gardener Buyssen de Coulon. Local historians have estimated that they originally contained about 500 varieties of trees and shrubs, some brought from gardens in Berlin. About 250 imported and 370 native plant species are now represented at the park; 24 of these are included in Lithuania's 1992 list of endangered species. Pine and fir trees adapted to the sandy soil predominate.|$|E

5|$|In 1908 the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the {{creation}} of community space along Ashland Creek, which became Ashland Canyon Park. The discovery of lithia water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a mineral spa at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included piping the mineral water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged John McLaren, <b>landscape</b> <b>architect</b> of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the mineral spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling mineral waters from the area's springs.|$|E

5|$|Land on the Boboli hill at {{the rear}} of the palazzo was {{acquired}} in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The <b>landscape</b> <b>architect</b> employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.|$|E

5|$|Marian Cruger Coffin (September 16, 1876 – February 2, 1957) {{was one of}} {{the first}} American women to work as a {{professional}} <b>landscape</b> <b>architect,</b> and became famous for designing numerous gardens for members of the East Coast elite to whom she had connections through her mother's side of the family. As a child, she received almost no formal education but was home-tutored while living with her mother's relatives in upstate New York. Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for a woman of her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901–4 as one of only four women in architecture and landscape design.|$|E
5|$|The Miller House is a Mid-Century modern home {{designed}} by Eero Saarinen and located in Columbus, Indiana. The residence {{was commissioned by}} American industrialist, philanthropist, and architecture patron J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller in 1953. Design and construction on the Miller House took four years and was completed in 1957. The home was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000. In 2009, the home and gardens, along {{with many of the}} original furnishings, were donated to the Indianapolis Museum of Art by the Miller family. In addition to Eero Saarinen, the house and gardens showcases the work of leading 20th-century figures such as interior designer Alexander Girard, <b>landscape</b> <b>architect</b> Dan Kiley, and principal design associate at the Saarinen office, Kevin Roche.|$|E
5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most {{idiosyncratic}} 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The <b>landscape</b> <b>architect</b> Thomas Cook began to execute {{the plans for the}} park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye {{in the form of a}} swan. The lake originally had a snow (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.|$|E

5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s <b>landscape</b> <b>architect,</b> a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief <b>Landscape</b> <b>Architect</b> for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned <b>landscape</b> <b>architect</b> Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
