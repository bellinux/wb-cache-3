5000|$|As of July 2009, over 200 Eastern Ontario establishments {{featured}} Beau's <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> on tap. [...] "Just {{about every}} LCBO in the region" [...] sells <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread.</b> By late 2009, Beau's was supplying {{a number of}} bars and LCBOs in the Greater Toronto Area.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tread</b> <b>lugs</b> {{provide the}} contact surface {{necessary}} to provide traction. As the <b>tread</b> <b>lug</b> enters the road contact area, or footprint, it is compressed. As it rotates through the footprint it is deformed circumferentially. As it exits the footprint, it recovers to its original shape. During the deformation and recovery cycle the tire exerts variable forces into the vehicle. These forces are described as Force Variation.|$|R
5000|$|Wear bars (or wear indicators) {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the <b>tread</b> <b>lugs</b> are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of 1.6 mm and are tires are deemed [...] "worn out" [...] when the tread is worn down to that point.|$|R
50|$|Fixed-Point Laser Sensors were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the above methods. Lasers combine the narrow-track area-of-interest with a large stand off distance from the tire. In order to cover a larger area-of-interest, mechanical positioning systems have been employed to take readings at multiple positions in the sidewall. Fixed-Point Laser sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the <b>tread</b> <b>lugs</b> in radial run-out measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.|$|R
50|$|Beau's {{has been}} {{successful}} since opening, having sold its entire first batch of 3,000 litres (5,300 pints) to nine Ottawa-area bars and restaurants before the official opening date. Though it originally expected to supply <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> to local LCBOs and Beer Stores in 2006, <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> first appeared in Ottawa LCBOs in early 2008, by which time it had expanded to over 90 establishments in the Ottawa area.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its debut}} year, <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> won [...] "Best Beer of the Fest" [...] at the 2006 Golden Tap Awards. <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> {{went on to}} win [...] "Best beer brewed in Ontario (outside of the GTA)" [...] at the 2007 and 2008 Golden Tap Awards, and [...] "Best regularly-produced craft beer brewed in Ontario" [...] and [...] "Best of the Fest" [...] at the 2009 awards. The brewery itself also won [...] "Best {{microbrewery}} in Ontario (outside of the GTA)" [...] and [...] "Best micro/craft brewery in Ontario" [...] in 2008 and 2009, respectively.|$|E
50|$|At the 2009 National Organic Brewing Challenge awards, <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> won 2nd place, while {{seasonal}} Night•Märzen placed 3rd. Another Beau's seasonal beer, Festivale, {{won gold}} medal at the 2009 Mondial de la Bière in Strasbourg.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tread</b> <b>lugs</b> often feature slits—sipes—that {{improve the}} {{flexibility}} of the lug to deform as it traverses the footprint area. This reduces shear stress in the lug and reduces heat build up. Testing of identical siped and unsiped tires showed measurable improvements in snow traction and ice braking performance, however diminishing and extending braking distances on wet and dry pavement by a few feet on siped tires. Off-road tire enthusiasts have been siping tires for years for greater traction, as many manufacturers now offer already siped off-road-tires.|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} from the analysis of a failure which occurred in the fiberglass loop {{of one of the}} Loopwheel traction elements delivered to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for use on the JPL Mars Rover demonstration model. The loop failed in compression in the outer fibers forming a hinge which, through cycling, caused the inner fibers to break. The probable cause of this failure was the load being introduced as point loads {{at the center of the}} loop causing high compressive stresses and early buckling. To decrease the stress level and delay buckling, the <b>tread</b> <b>lugs</b> can be reshaped so that the entire lug contacts the ground when the loop is loaded. This can be accomplished through removal of lug material, starting with zero removal at the outer edge and linearly increasing to one-half of the lug thickness at the center...|$|R
50|$|Capacitive Sensors {{generate}} a dielectric field between the tire and sensor. As {{the distance between}} the tire and the sensor varies, the voltage and/or current properties of the dielectric field change. Analog circuitry is employed to measure the field changes and record the run-out waveform. Capacitive sensors have a larger area-of-interest, on the order of 10mm compared to the very narrow contact stylus method. The capacitive sensor method is one of the earliest technologies, and has proven highly reliable; however, the sensor must be positioned very close to the tire surface during measurement, so collisions between tire and sensor have led to long-term maintenance problems. In addition, some sensors are very sensitive to moisture/humidity and ended with erroneous readings. The 10mm area-of-interest also means that bulge measurement is limited to {{a small portion of the}} tire. Capacitive sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the <b>tread</b> <b>lugs</b> in radial runout measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.|$|R
5000|$|Beau's beers {{have been}} very well received, having [...] "earned a {{reputation}} for quality and clean taste with beer drinkers who want {{more than just a}} cheap buzz," [...] and <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> having become a [...] "fast favourite." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{launched}} on July 1, 2006, {{and is known}} for its [...] "regionally famous" [...] <b>Lug</b> <b>Tread</b> lagered ale, {{as well as a number}} of seasonal beers. Beau's beers are available throughout Eastern Ontario on tap as well as at LCBO liquor stores. [...] In February 2015, the brewery has also begun selling its products in Quebec. By May 2016, the company had 150 full-time employees as a result of a claimed [...] "growth at a compounded rate of 45 per cent year-over-year" [...] since 2006.|$|E
40|$|This study proposes an {{efficient}} {{combination of the}} Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) to study the tractive performance of a rubber tire in interaction with granular terrain. The presented approach is relevant to all engineering devices interacting with granular matter which causes response forces. Herein, the extended discrete element method (XDEM) is {{used to describe the}} dynamics of the granular assembly. On the one hand, the discrete approach accounts for the motion and forces of each grain individually. On the other hand, the finite element method accurately predicts the deformations and stresses acting within the tire tread. Hence, the simulation domain occupied by the tire tread is efficiently described as a continuous entity. The coupling of both methods is based on the interface shared by the two spatially separated domains. Contact forces develop at the interface and propagate into each domain. The coupling method enables to capture both responses simultaneously and allows to sufficiently resolve the different length scales. Each grain in contact with the surface of the tire tread generates a contact force which it reacts on repulsively. The contact forces sum up over the tread surface and cause the tire tread to deform. The coupling method compensates quite naturally the shortages of both numerical methods. It further employs a fast contact detection algorithm to save valuable computation time. The proposed DEM-FEM Coupling technique was employed to study the tractive performance of a rubber tire with <b>lug</b> <b>tread</b> patterns in a soil bed. The contact forces at the tread surface are captured by 3 D simulations for a tire slip of 5 %. The simulations showed to accurately recapture the gross tractive effort, running resistance and drawbar pull of the tire tread in comparison to related measurements. Further, the traction mechanisms between the tire tread and the granular ground are studied by analysing the motion of the soil grains and the deformation of the tread...|$|E
