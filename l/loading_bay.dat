25|$|The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry {{now holds}} {{a variety of}} Haçienda and Factory records artefacts, {{including}} the main <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> doors from the club, and {{a wide array of}} posters, fliers and props. Rob Gretton bequeathed his collection of Haçienda memorabilia to the Museum.|$|E
25|$|Computer Identics Corporation {{installed}} one of {{its first}} two scanning systems {{in the spring of}} 1969 at a General Motors (Buick) factory in Flint, Michigan. The system was used to identify a dozen types of transmissions moving on an overhead conveyor from production to shipping. The other scanning system was installed at General Trading Company's distribution center in Carlstadt, New Jersey to direct shipments to the proper <b>loading</b> <b>bay.</b>|$|E
25|$|Montferrand {{selected}} the quarry contractor in March 1830, in {{a bidding war}} that reduced the column price from 420 thousand to 150 thousand roubles. Carving took {{a year and a}} half, and in September 1831 the column safely separated from the rock. By April 1832, the carvers completed shaping it and started blasting the path from the quarry to the <b>loading</b> <b>bay.</b> The barge loading nearly ended in a catastrophe. The column broke through the ramp and threatened to roll over the barge; a team of 300 workers managed to set it back in place.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of those who escaped unharmed were workers {{in the front of}} the building who left through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke. Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out through a <b>loading</b> <b>bay.</b> The bay was initially blocked by a tractor-trailer, but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle. Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.|$|E
25|$|Torque then {{encounters}} a fellow inmate, Dallas (Mark Berry), who he knows from his previous prison, Eastern Correctional Institution. They {{head through the}} eastern cellblock, where Torque has a vision of Carmen, who explains why she left him; when he was incarcerated for the second time, she knew she {{needed to make a}} change to her life. Torque and Dallas make it to the <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> and Torque heads to the control room, opening the doors, and allowing Dallas to escape. However, a fire starts, preventing Torque from following. He then hears a call from Consuela Alvarez (Meg Savlov), Ernesto's wife, asking Ernesto to call her. She tells him that herself and the girls are fine, but there is a fire in the nearby forest getting closer to their house.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of the SNES are predominantly gray, of slightly different shades. The original North American version, designed by Nintendo of America industrial designer Lance Barr (who previously redesigned the Famicom to become the NES), has a boxy design with purple sliding switches and a dark gray eject lever. The <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> surface is curved, both to invite interaction and to prevent food or drinks from being placed on the console and spilling as had happened with the flat surfaced NES. The Japanese and European versions are more rounded, with darker gray accents and buttons. The North American SNS-101 model and the Japanese Super Famicom Jr. (model SHVC-101), all designed by Barr, are both smaller with a rounded contour; however, the SNS-101 buttons are purple where the Super Famicom Jr. buttons are gray. The European and American {{versions of}} the SNES controllers have much longer cables compared to the Japanese Super Famicom controllers.|$|E

25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her {{restoring}} force and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off-duty helmsman who was sleeping in his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50a.m., Sewol was leaning 30 degrees to port.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Colton Tramway was {{worked by}} two small {{locomotives}}, {{both of which}} faced the main line at Brendon Hill. These locomotives were housed in a locoshed near the <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> at Brendon Hill.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{stated that}} he wanted to [...] "redefine" [...] the group and conceptualise a new image that would {{represent}} his perception of their personas. He described the band as [...] "extremely style-savvy" [...] and motivated them to be bold, uninhibited and experimental. The video takes influences from styles of fashion editorial and features the Sugababes in various costumes and guises. Their outfits were created with many fabrics, in addition to newspapers, plastic bin bags and florist's cellophane. Overall, there were 13 costume changes. Scenes for the video were shot {{in a wide range of}} environments and locations, including a fire escape, <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> and storage cupboard.|$|E
50|$|Brunswick Mill, Bradford Road, {{alongside}} the Ashton Canal, was a seven-storey mill with 35 <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> facing {{directly onto the}} canal, with a smaller three 3/4-storey block of warehouses and offices backing onto Bradford Road.|$|R
50|$|Other post-1940s {{buildings}} and structures occur across the site, including offices, silos, <b>loading</b> <b>bays,</b> storerooms and power infrastructure. Many date from the 1970s and 1980s. These are {{not considered to be}} of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the factory, with its large {{internal}} space, <b>loading</b> <b>bays,</b> cold room, engine room, exterior water tanks, office building and other secondary structures demonstrates the principle characteristics of an early twentieth century butter factory.|$|R
500|$|After a large pipe bridge, {{the canal}} widens {{to form a}} <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> where coal from Hatfield Main Colliery was {{transferred}} to barges. A railway, which has now been dismantled, connected the site to the mine. About [...] from Stainforth, the Don turns towards the north, while the canal continues to the east, passing under the M18 motorway. As it approaches Thorne, it passes under the Sheffield to Hull Railway near Thorne North railway station. [...] Immediately beyond the bridge is Stanilands Marina, followed by Thorne Lock, with a swing bridge crossing its head. The canal turns briefly to the south, to pass under the A614 road and the [...] to [...] railway near Thorne South railway station. The railway remains close to the northern bank {{for most of the}} way to Keadby. There is another marina near Wykewell Lift Bridge, and after Moor's Swing Bridge, the canal crosses open countryside.|$|E
500|$|A [...] Sainsbury's {{supermarket}} (total [...] "sales area" [...] {{accessible to}} the public: [...] ) forms a major component both of Block C and of the New England Quarter itself. It extends across the east-west space of the block; {{as a result of}} the steeply sloping land at this point, the store frontage faces the newly built Ann Square and the newly pedestrianised New England Street, while the rear is at basement (sub-ground floor) level. A car park with 194 spaces for shoppers has been created beneath the store, and is linked to it by travelators. The service area and <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> extend beneath the new road between Blocks C and D, and into the ground beneath Block D. The new store opened on 1 March 2007. It replaced a smaller outlet in London Road, which had opened in 1974 and which had seen little refurbishment since the original planning application for a Sainsbury's on the New England Quarter site was put through in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} now has extra new {{spaces for}} the public, performers and support crew. The theatre has new changing rooms and a <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> while the central atrium has been {{opened up and}} has become an additional area for hosting arts activities. [...] The roof level of the theatre was raised to match that of the concert hall, and the extra space under the roof houses a new dance studio.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 Chipping Norton {{became a}} {{railhead}} for the Zonal Delivery Scheme. The goods shed was modified {{with a series}} of <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> constructed enabling goods to be unloaded from wagons straight into lorries for local delivery.|$|R
40|$|Demographic {{pressure}} and slash and burn practices are two factors which {{reduce the number}} of Lophira alata plants in its natural range where it is more represented by young plants. The hypothesis that its understorey regeneration may be affected by seed tree size and growing conditions was investigated in the tropical moist forest in southern Cameroon using mature trees of various diameter classes for a sustainable management of the species. Biomass partitioning was also examined in regenerating seedlings growing in <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> and forest understorey. Seedling density was highest when seed tree diameter at breast height (dbh) was 100 cm or more. A strong positive correlation was found between seed tree diameter dbh and crown size expressed as mean diameter of projected crown area, but crown size correlated much better with seedling density. Compared with their counterparts of the same height growing in <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> in full sunlight but devoid of litter and topsoil, seedlings found in understorey exhibited lower root: shoot ratio, indicating that soil-derived resources were more limiting in <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> than on undisturbed forest floor. Leaf weight per area (leaf dry weight/leaf area) (LWA) and leaf packing (leaf number/cm shoot height) were almost 2 -fold greater in <b>loading</b> <b>bays</b> than in understorey. As seedlings seldom grew taller than 50 cm in the latter environment, it may be inferred that root: shoot ratio, LWA, and leaf packing can be used to assess the sustainability of growth and development of this pioneer species at the seedling stage...|$|R
50|$|In 2008 {{alterations}} {{were made}} {{on the north side}} of the station to provide car parking and coach <b>loading</b> <b>bays,</b> the latter in connection with the operation of the 'Orient Express' which until then operated from Folkestone Harbour Station.|$|R
2500|$|The furthest seat is 60 metres {{from the}} stage, 20 metres closer than in The Point. This was {{achieved}} by arranging the seats around the stage in a gigantic [...] "fan" [...] formation which the architects likened to the Colosseum of Rome. There are no corporate boxes inside the venue. The backstage area has a [...] "substantial" [...] <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> for trucks. Alcohol is available in a high-security area of the venue {{in an effort to}} curb under-age drinking. Prior to re-development, the seating capacity was 6,300 or 8,500 standing.|$|E
2500|$|Linked by {{regular and}} fast {{services}} from Sutton Coldfield railway {{station on the}} Cross-City Line to the centre of Birmingham, Sutton is mostly a commuter dormitory town for {{people who work in}} Birmingham. The 1955 Sutton Coldfield rail crash occurred here, when an express train entered the very tight curve through the station much faster than the speed limit of [...] The Sutton Park Line also crosses the town roughly perpendicular to the cross-city line (crossing at a point out of easy sight near the former Midland Road station), but lost its passenger services and stations in the 1964 [...] "Beeching Axe". It retained a <b>loading</b> <b>bay</b> at the adjacent Clifton Road Royal Mail sorting office for a time, but now remains as a freight only line.|$|E
2500|$|Initially called New Baccara to {{distinguish}} it from Mayte Mateos' re-formed Baccara, Mendiola teamed up with vocalist Marisa Pérez and in 1987 reached the top five in Spain and top 40 in Germany with the single [...] "Call Me Up", written by Ian Cussick. 1988 saw the duo release a series of euro-influenced Hi-NRG dance tracks on the Bellaphon recording label. [...] "Call Me Up", [...] "Fantasy Boy" [...] and [...] "Touch Me" [...] were produced by Luis Rodríguez, and were big club hits across Europe. A version of Bette Midler's [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", released on the <b>Loading</b> <b>Bay</b> label in the late 1990s, was also a hit in UK clubs. Towards {{the end of the}} decade New Baccara was renamed back to Baccara, and releases continued, although the group did not chart as their output was directed towards the club scene with singles pressed in strictly limited quantities.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew John Engeldinger ( [...] 1976 [...] September 27, 2012), a 36-year-old {{resident}} of Minneapolis for twelve years, {{was raised in}} Richfield, Minnesota and graduated from the Academy of Holy Angels. He was formerly employed by Accent Signage Systems, but recently fired from the business. According to neighbors, Engeldinger was a loner who never engaged in conversation with anyone, while a former coworker described him as not eating lunch or taking breaks with other employees. Engeldinger's parents and other family stated that he {{had some sort of}} mental illness and resisted treatment, eventually becoming estranged. Early reports state that he began shooting upon returning after being fired were incorrect, authorities said Friday, according to the NBC article. He was in the front office after being fired, and then went to the <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> and authorities said there were clear indications he may have targeted certain people. [...] A search of his home uncovered packaging for 10,000 rounds, indicating that he was heavily armed and had practiced shooting quite a bit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} legal hearings, residents testified how: [...] "If {{you walked}} {{right behind the}} factory it was like cotton. It was in {{the cracks in the}} pavement behind the factory;" [...] and: [...] "It used to be blue-white. We used to sweep this blue dust up. It was blue fluffy stuff... I used {{to get up in the}} morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the <b>loading</b> <b>bay,</b> to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
