Third-year survival of seedlings stored in refrigeration {{did not differ from}} that of seedlings maintained in a <b>lathhouse</b> prior to planting. Survival of seedlings planted in mid-June was about 70 % compared to 48 % for seedlings planted in late July. Survival was only 52 % within strip shelterwood units and more than 72 % in the more protected environment of uniform shelterwood units. Seedlings within strip shelterwood units were slightly taller after 3 years than those under a uniform shelterwood...|$|E
40|$|Fay Elberta' peach trees {{grown on}} either 'Lovell' or 'Nemaguard' {{rootstocks}} in sandy soil in a <b>lathhouse</b> were highly susceptible to bacterial canker if inoculated with the nematode Macroposthonia xenoplax and the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. If {{either one of}} these organisms were omitted, serious bacterial canker did not develop. Cankers appeared later and remained small when nematodes were omined. Very few cankers appeared on trees not inoculated with the bacterium. Peach trees on both rootstocks were good hosts for, and were stunted by, nematodes. Larger numbers of fruit were produced on trees free of bacterial canker or nematodes. Differences in magnitude of bacterial canker symptoms produced experimentally in different years are considered...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{effect of}} low {{temperatures}} given {{at different times}} and duration upon the time of bud burst, shoot elongation, number of needles developed and needle length in Douglas-fir plants from the Oregon Cascades and three coastal areas ranging from Washington to California were determined. The plants were grown outside in a <b>lathhouse</b> then chilled at 11 -day intervals with three temperatures. These treatment combinations were applied early and late in the dormant period. The most effective temperature treatment was 40 °F followed by 45 ° and 50 ° F, in that order. All three temperatures hastened bud burst for the plants from low elevation as length of chilling increased; however, 45 ° and 50 °F was ineffective when chilling was expanded from 33 to 44 days for the high elevation. If chilling is done early a longer period is required to break dormancy than if done late during the dormant period. Delay of chilling also increased shoot elongation {{and the number of}} needles developed remained fairly constant, altering only the needles per centimeter...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Red-osier dogwood {{plants were}} grown {{outdoors}} in a <b>lathhouse</b> and under two temperature regimes in growth chambers {{to determine the}} time of vegetative maturity, the transition between summer and winter dormancy. Xylem water potential (XWP), tissue moisture content, ethylene and ethane production, and electrical impedance were {{used to try to}} find a quantitative measure of vegetative maturity that could be used by researchers and nurserymen to predict maturity. XWP showed a significant correlation with tip dieback, but the variability within samples precludes its use as an index of maturity. The change in moisture content was too gradual to be of value as a predictive index. Ethylene production of stem sections correlated with tip dieback, and deserves future testing. Frozen stem sections produced ethane and ethylene, both of which declined as maturity progressed. Electrical impedance values showed promise as the most accurate measure of maturity in red-osier dogwood. A second objective was to relate vegetative maturity to the first stage of cold acclimation in red-osier dogwood. Previous research has suggested that the onset of cold acclimation occurred before rest and about the time that the plants matured. Confirmation that vegetative maturity and the onset of cold acclimation coincide is presented in these studies...|$|E
40|$|Page(s) : 8 (1), 77 - 87, 9 RefRooting {{response}} of lime leaf-bud cutting {{to the application}} of the rooting hormone indole butyric acid (IBA), basal wounding (W) and the combination of IBA and W was investigated. Leaf-bud cuttings were taken from the previous season's growth. Each piece of the leaf-bud cutting consisted of a leaf blade, a petiole and a portion of a stem with an attached axillary bud. Leaf-bud cuttings were taken in March, June and September. The treatments consisted of the application of powder IBA, W, combination of IBA and W and the control. The prepared leaf-bud cuttings were inserted in a rooting medium (sand) and kept under a plastic-covered frame in a <b>lathhouse.</b> Rooting percentage, number and length of roots, weeks required for the emergence of roots and survival percentage of rooted cuttings were determined. The results revealed that lime could be propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cuttings. Basal wounding had a little more influence on rooting than untreated cuttings (control). The application of IBA or in combination with W resulted in significantly higher values for almost all parameters than basal wounding and the control. The results also showed that the time of the year in which leaf-bud cuttings were taken had an influence on rooting, regardless of the treatments used. Khartoum University Pres...|$|E
40|$|A {{program for}} obtaining {{resistance}} to Phytophthora root rot of avocado was initiated on the Riverside {{campus of the}} University of California in 1950. With this type of disease {{it was felt that}} a resistant rootstock would provide the best control, hence this program has received the primary emphasis in research on this disease. Several publications have described the collections of avocado types and related species in Latin America (2, 3, 4, 5), the testing procedures in the search for resistance (6), and preliminary reports have been presented of the resistance of some of the plant materials (6, 7). All plants are now first screened for resistance in the nutrient solution tank test in the greenhouse, which provides a rapid and severe trial (6). High resistance was reported early in the development of this program in several small-fruited species of the genus Persea, based on tests in the greenhouse and <b>lathhouse</b> and a few preliminary field trials (7). Similar high resistance has been found in additional collections made in Latin America by the senior author within the past few years. Unfortunately to date all of the high resistance occurs in species which are not graft compatible with avocado (1) and hence cannot be used directly as rootstocks, as had been hoped. The first indications of resistance in graft-compatible types were reported by Zentmyer and Thorn in 1956, in the Duke variety of avocado (9). This paper summarizes the numerous field plots that have been established over the past 10 years to provide further tests of resistance of the various collections under conditions of natural infection. To date 27 plots are involved, with 1, 901 trees, in Lo...|$|E
40|$|O umezeiro (Prunus mumeSieb & Zucc.) é uma rosácea de folhas caducas, nativa da China, cujos frutos e flores são muito apreciados pelos povos orientais. No Brasil, alguns estudos foram realizados visando a sua utilização como porta-enxerto para pessegueiro e nectarineira, dadas as suas características de adaptação, rusticidade, redução do porte da planta e compatibilidade com algumas cultivares de Prunus persica. O presente estudo foi conduzido em câmara de nebulização sob ripado, pertencente ao Departamento de Produção Vegetal da FCAV/UNESP, Câmpus de Jaboticabal-SP. Objetivou-se verificar a influência de quatro comprimentos de estacas herbáceas no enraizamento de dois clones de umezeiro. O {{material}} vegetal, identificado como Clone 10 e Clone 15, foi oriundo do Programa de Melhoramento Genético do Instituto Agronômico de Campinas-SP. O experimento foi constituido de fatorial 2 x 4, em blocos casualizados, sendo o fator clone em 2 níveis (Clone 10 e Clone 15) e o fator comprimento de estaca em 4 níveis (12; 15; 18 e 25 cm). Pelos resultados observados, verificou-se diferença entre os clones somente na porcentagem de estacas brotadas e número de raízes por estaca. O comprimento da estaca influenciou na porcentagem de enraizamento e na mortalidade das estacas, sendo que estacas maiores tenderam a apresentar maiores porcentagens de enraizamento e menores de mortalidade. As estacas com 12 cm, embora apresentando menor número de raízes por estaca, são recomendadas por permitirem a obtenção de um maior número de estacas por planta-matriz. Houve efeito significativo da interação entre os fatores para número e comprimento de raízes. The japanese apricot (Prunus mume Sieb & Zucc.) is a Rosaceae {{of falling}} leaves, native of China, whose fruits and flowers are quite appreciated by the oriental people. In Brazil, some studies were accomplished seeking its use as rootstock for peach and nectarine trees, due its adaptation characteristics, rusticity, {{reduction of the}} plant load and compatibility with some cultivars of Prunus persica. The present study were carried out under intermitent mist inside a <b>lathhouse,</b> belonging to the Vegetal Department of the Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias (FCAV/UNESP), Campus of Jaboticabal, São Paulo State. The objective {{of this study was}} to verify the influence of four lengths of herbaceous cuttings in the rooting of two japanese apricot clones. The vegetable material, identified as Clone 10 and Clone 15, was originating from the Genetic Improvement Program of the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, SP. The experiment was constituted by a 2 x 4 fatorial in randomized blocks, having the factor clone 2 levels (Clone 10 and Clone 15) and the factor cuttings length 4 levels (12, 15, 18 and 25 cm). For the observed results, differences was only verified among the clones in the sprouted cutting percentage and number of roots for cutting. The rooting percentage and the mortality of the cuttings were influenced by the cutting lenght, meanwhile, larger cuttings tended to present higher rooting and smaller mortality percentages. The cuttings with 12 cm, although presenting few roots number for cutting, they are recommended for allow the obtention of a higher number of cuttings for main plant. There was significant effect of the interaction between the factors for number and length of roots...|$|E
