50|$|Dawn redwood {{has proved}} an easy tree {{to grow in}} {{temperate}} regions, and is now widely planted as an ornamental tree. Planted trees have already reached 25 - 40 m in height and 1 - 1.3 m in diameter, despite being in cultivation for less than sixty years. This rapid rate of growth has led to consideration for using the tree in forestry plantations. It has been discovered that M. glyptostroboides will thrive in standing water, much like Bald Cypress, and if left branched {{to the ground in}} full sun, will develop the large, contorted boles that have made it famous. <b>Limbing</b> or pruning at an early age will prohibit this formation later on.|$|E

Several factors to consider are: tree lean and bend, wind direction, branch arrangement, snow load, obstacles and damaged, rotting tree parts, which might behave unexpectedly when cut. A tree may have to fall in its natural direction if it's too dangerous or impossible to fell in a desired direction. The aim is for the tree to fall safely for <b>limbing</b> and cross-cutting the log. The goal is to avoid having the tree fall on another tree or obstacle.|$|E

50|$|Geoff Marples {{wrote an}} account of being a tiehack in the East Kootenays in 1938 and {{described}} {{the process of making}} axe ties to include: First a suitable tree was chosen and then falling and <b>limbing</b> the tree. Next came scoring which is chopping, by eye without a chalk line, of notches to remove extra wood about every 10 in; hewing the trunks only on two sides unless the log was over 11 in in diameter; bucking (cutting to in this case 8 ft); peeling any remaining bark off; and stacking the ties so a chain can be wrapped around them. Next came skidding each group of ties to a landing with a team of horses, and then loading and hauling the ties to a railway siding by truck and unloading by hand. Scaling was the key event where a railroad inspector accepted or culled (rejected) and graded each tie as a number one (7 in by 9 in used for the main railroad lines) or number two (6 in by 6 in used for sidings). Loading the 200 lb ties by hand onto a car was the last task. Marples wrote that he netted 48 cents for each grade one, and 36 cents for each grade two and made $150 for a winters work.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{research}} aims to: a) {{assess the}} energy expenditure during typical forestry activities; b) assess the actual workload of forestry work; c) define the eventual relationship between oxygen uptake () {{and heart rate}} during the studied working phases. Methods: Eleven healthy skilled forestry workers were studied. Using a portable device, oxygen uptake (), carbon dioxide output (), pulmonary ventilation () and heart rate (HR) were measured. The forestry work was divided into four phases: walking uphill, felling, <b>limbing</b> & chain-sawing and complementary activities. A work time report was kept and in each phase a weighted average (WA) of all parameters was obtained. Results:Walking uphill, felling, <b>limbing</b> & chain-sawing activities did not show significant statistical differences between each other and were classified as heavy activities (mean 2. 17 lmin- 1,mean HR 157 beatmin- 1). The complementary activity {{was found to be}} less demanding and statistically differed in respect to the others (0. 55 l min- 1, HR 98 beat min- 1). By theWA, the actual workload of forestry work resulted in a moderate to heavyoptimal job (and HR being 1. 51 l min- 1 and 133. 5 beat min- 1 respectively in a typical working day). Furthermore it was possible to set up a relationship between and HR for the forestry work. Conclusions: Forestry activity can be classified as moderate to heavy-optimal. Finally, a good and linear correlation between and HR proved to be an easy tool to evaluate the metabolic demand...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{effect of}} land uses on {{neighboring}} property values is of critical interest to urban planners, developers, and citizens. Property values are in part defined by built structure and lot characteristics, locational attributes (e. g., proximity to amenities and disamenities), {{and other features}} such as views from a property. The effects of these attributes can be estimated using the hedonic property valuation method. While many of these attributes are easily quantified, views are less tangible. This study attempts to develop a viewshed estimation technique {{that takes into account}} the <b>limbing</b> up of trees, a major limitation of viewshed estimates to date. The <b>limbing</b> up effect was estimated using a conditional statement on three viewsheds: ground elevation only, ground elevation plus 8 feet where there are trees, and the elevation of vegetation (LIDAR). The viewsheds areas were intersected with their land use zone (residential, institutional, agricultural, etc) as well as their land use category (pavement, building, short, or tall vegetation) and perspective was controlled for. The viewshed estimates were evaluated within econometric models, yielding some interesting results, including that increased visibility of houses and pavement reduced property values, short vegetation had a positive effect, and views of trees themselves had no significant effect. While the techniques used in this study have great potential, they were limited in their current application due to computing power. Further investigations may help overcome some of the constraints within this study and explore variations on this technique in order to generate robust viewshed estimates...|$|E
40|$|Whole {{tree and}} tree length {{thinning}} are two alternatives which {{are likely to}} be more productive and may prove to be more cost effective than conventional log length thinning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare log length, tree length, and whole tree thinning techniques in terms of productivity and harvesting costs. The thinning operation took place in a second-growth Douglas-fir stand [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] (average dbh = 12. 8 ") using a small skyline yarder (28 ' tower, 120 HP) in a gravity return configuration. The treatments were defined by the amount of work done by the faller prior to yarding. Log length implies that felling, <b>limbing,</b> bucking and topping occured at the stump. Tree length indicates that trees were felled, limbed and topped only, and finally, whole trees were felled only prior to yarding. A rubber-tired cable skidder was used to swing material from the landing chute to a processing area. Here the skidder operator Forest Engineering presented on April 14, 1983 completed any <b>limbing</b> and bucking which was necessary. He then sorted and decked the logs prior to loading. During log length thinning, logs were either cold decked in front of the yarder or swung with the skidder to a loading deck. Detailed time studies were used to evaluate the felling and yarding operations for each of the three thinning techniques. Multiple linear regression was then used to develop predictive models for felling and yarding work cycles. An analysis of the delays on this study made it possible to separate out delays which were affected by a particular thinning technique, rather than having a single prorated delay time as is usually done. By combining results from the regression and delay analyses, estimates of productivity for each thinning technique were obtained. Finally, harvesting costs in dollars per cunit at the loading deck were generated and used to compare log length, tree length, and whole tree thinning. Results indicated that where cold decking is feasible and will not overly hamper the operation it will probably still be the cheapest alternative since a skidder is not required. The cost per cunit for this method was 8. 24 or 11...|$|E
