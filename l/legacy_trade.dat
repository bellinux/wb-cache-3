40|$|A robust {{method for}} pricing options at strikes {{where there is}} not an {{observed}} price is a vital tool for the pricing, hedging, and risk management of derivatives. All institutions that trade derivatives will have an approach to this task. Typical examples might be a simple interpolation scheme across implied volatilities, or the use of a model-based formula optimized to fit observed prices. It is our view that while these methods work well for interpolation across actively traded strikes, they often break down when used for extrapolation. We introduce in this paper a technique for smile extrapolation that is robust, simple, fast and offers control on the form of the tails in the distribution. Using this method allows distribution-sensitive products such as CMS rates or inverse-FX options to be priced consistently with the smile of traded vanilla options. The resulting arbitrage-free distributions are also key to the copula-based pricing of multi-asset products such as spread options, quantos and hybrids. Our approach fixes several problems currently seen in today’s stressed markets, e. g. with CMS rates. There are two distinct areas where smile extrapolations can be a problem: when an institution has <b>legacy</b> <b>trades</b> on its books that are struck far from today’s at-the-money strike (a common situation in the current market) and in the pricing of more exotic products that depend on the use of an entire risk-neutral probability density function (PDF) of the underlying.

40|$|Through an ethno-historical and ethnographic {{study of}} social networks, this {{dissertation}} discusses an early 20 th century trade system in Ladakh, India, its interruption by mid 20 th century border formation, {{and the continuing}} role of the community formed by this network a half century later. The research explores {{the concept of a}} social network {{from the vantage point of}} its demise, showing how social and economic networks have lasting significance in local communities long after they cease to function. In the course of research, a historical view of regional network interactions revealed a complex web of social arrangements which facilitated trade among ethnic groups. Members of regional trading networks in frontier areas increased their trading capabilities by forming cosmopolitan groups which transcended religious, ethnic, and national identity. The basis of communal identity for these groups was the social interactions associated with trade rather than a particular geographic locale. ^ In the Ladakhi ethnographic context there are many ways to construct an understanding of the trading past, which are discussed as memories of trade. As well as creating narratives of memory, the formation of borders within the Ladakh region and the severance of trading networks created a social legacy. The <b>legacies</b> of <b>trade</b> are the ways in which networks of social relationships were reorganized in response to the severance of regional trade networks. The reorganization, or <b>legacy</b> of <b>trade,</b> is an ongoing process of engaging with the contradictions and possibilities for cosmopolitan social networks within new political and economic arenas. Thus legacies are sites under community negotiation, with contesting visions of the new social networks, which can lead to social conflict. ^ In light of this relationship between the demise of trade networks and social conflict in the region, we can understand conflict in border communities as a product of the struggle between incompatible social contexts: one created by the legacy of trans regional cosmopolitanism, the other by national boundaries. ...|$|R

Most of these animals are found today in China and Mongolia. Here, we used 12 microsatellite DNA markers to characterise 140 domestic Bactrian camels from 4 populations of China (n = 84) and 2 populations of Mongolia (n = 56). Genetic diversity, expressed as mean number of alleles and expected heterozygosity (He), were similar in all populations. Genetic distances (DS and DA) indicate closer genetic relationships between populations within each country than between the Chinese and Mongolian populations. Significant differentiation indices (Fst) were obtained for all between-country comparisons (P 0. 05). The lack of genetic differentiation among the Chinese populations is possibly a historical <b>legacy</b> of <b>trading</b> along the Silk Road which favoured gene flow between populations.

40|$|This {{introductory}} essay {{discusses the}} legacies of the transatlantic slave trade across three continents. It begins by investigating the historical amnesia about the trade which {{has only recently}} and in some geographies been ameliorated, taking {{as a point of}} departure observations by Nobel Prize Winners Derek Walcott and Toni Morrison, who were in the vanguard of a movement to memorialise it. The essay moves on to discuss not only traditional memorials, walking trails and artworks, but also ghostly <b>legacies</b> of the <b>trade,</b> including human body parts. Taking the small slave port of Lancaster, England, as a key case study, the essay draws on recent theoretical work on corporeality, spectrality, Holocaust studies, trauma, dark tourism, the Black Atlantic and memory studies to interrogate the meanings of these legacies. The way that black agency contributes to new understandings of the horrors of the slave trade is demonstrated by discussion of William Wells Brown's intervention at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Such “guerrilla memorialisation” is shown at work historically and in recent memorialisations of the trade. Moreover, its urgent need in the wake of contemporary issues of forced labour from the African continent is discussed. The final section on memorial landscapes summarises the essays in this volume and discusses the links between the various locales. France, which is trying {{to come to terms with}} its history through legislation and the creation of memorials, is discussed as a slave power case study. The new memorial in Nantes is an important municipal response to the <b>legacy</b> of the <b>trade</b> and by its esplanade design is linked back to the city trails in Britain discussed earlier in the essay. Other geographies with slaving pasts such as Wales and Mauritius are introduced, as well as the African Burial Ground in New York. The essay ends where it started, on the West Coast of Africa, with a reflection on heritage tourism and the complex legacies of slavery on the slave castle coast...|$|R

It unearths the deep history of indigenous and African {{slavery in the}} upper Mississippi River Valley and traces its connections outward toward the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. "Deep River" argues for a new spatial frame {{for the history of}} slavery and freedom to understand how colonial experiences in the upper Mississippi River Valley shaped the trajectory of emancipation in the United States. It also offers new perspectives on the history of emancipation by exposing free and enslaved black agency to eradicate slavery from Illinois. "Deep River" moves past legal categories as an organizing framework for slave and free societies. It demonstrates that inheritable bondage long survived its legal abolition. Displacing laws as the engine of change, it argues the collaborations between free black migrants, fugitive slaves, and white anti-slavery activists drove the processes of emancipation forward. Free and fugitive migrants into Illinois settled in black freedom villages which afforded slaves limited access to capital, avenues toward finding attorneys, and support in legal proceedings. In this way, Illinois's movement to a free society sprang from domestic migrations and a longer colonial <b>legacy</b> of <b>trade</b> and settlement in the Mississippi Valley, not laws and statutes passed by the United States. By focusing on the ways in which black northern migration and litigation in local courts shaped emancipation in the state, "Deep River" illuminates how legal and political development in Illinois followed the paths that enslaved African Americans created...|$|R

In this article, we give a semantic account of dependent interoperability. Our presentation relies on and is guided by a pervading notion of type equivalence, whose importance has been emphasized in recent work on homotopy type theory. Specifically, we develop the notion of type-theoretic partial Galois connections as a key foundation for dependent interoperability, which accounts for the partiality of the coercions between types. We explore the applicability of both monotone and antitone type-theoretic Galois connections {{in the setting of}} dependent interoperability. A monotone partial Galois connection enforces a translation of dependent types to runtime checks that are both sound and complete with respect to the invariants encoded by dependent types. Conversely, picking an antitone partial Galois connection instead lets us induce weaker, sound conditions that can amount to more efficient runtime checks. Our framework is developed in Coq; it is thus constructive and verified in the strictest sense of the terms.

40|$|Studies on the {{changing}} labor relations in post-communist countries have flourished in recent years, such that a review and analysis {{of what has been}} reported is overdue. Yet, interestingly, these studies have not reached a consensus on what they seek to explain. Indeed, some of the main questions remain under contention. First, is labor in post-communist societies weak, or (in at least some countries) strong? What should the referent be in determining strength or weakness? To the extent labor is weak, what would explain this weakness? If labor's power varies throughout the region, what would explain this variation? There {{have been a number of}} answers posed to these questions to date, but not a thorough testing of rival hypotheses. This paper will demonstrate, using a variety of measures, that labor is indeed a weak social and political actor in post-communist societies, especially when compared to labor in western Europe. This general weakness is rather surprising when one examines it against the now considerable economic and political diversity that exists in the post-communist world. The paper will then examine a number of hypotheses that have been proposed to explain labor's weakness, concluding that the institutional <b>legacies</b> of post-communist <b>trade</b> unions, and the ideological legacy of the discourse of class, best explain this overall weakness. However, the concept of legacy is itself found wanting, since it is unable to account for the extent of this weakness or the trends that have occurred in the region over time...|$|R

As background this report reviews {{the state of the}} literature related to the Omani houses of Zanzibar and also presents a very brief historical perspective. A description of the selected case study in its current state is followed by a proposed reconstruction to its perceived original form when built in the 19 th century. This exercise reveals a concept of great sophistication and clarity. Although the planning process and the constituent elements were standardized, an infinite range of possible plan forms and sections ensured flexibility and responsiveness. Our subsequent analysis hints that the Omani house is unique but not alien when compared with other traditional Arab courtyard houses. The report is concluded with suggestions for future academic research, while our conclusions and recommendations focus on opportunities for practical research and development. The premature demise of this house type was partly the result of colonization and European interference. It offers valuable lessons, however, which could be explored in our quest for better affordable housing in Southern and East Africa.
