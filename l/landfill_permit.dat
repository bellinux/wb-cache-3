Plans {{to expand the}} landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City’s second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition. The landfill expansion {{was seen as a}} way to alleviate the city's accumulations of waste, and Tallapoosa was seen as the only suitable location to put the landfill. The preservation effort was headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of the Bronx Historical Society. It suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create to protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site. However, the state and federal governments did not favor the landfill being located at Tallapoosa. On October 11, 1967, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges, the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, on the site where the landfill was planned to be expanded.

The State of Alabama has recently begun to experience major regionalization of landfills due to these changes in solid waste policies. The recent influx of large regional solid waste facilities has been the cause of much public concern which has brought into question the fairness and adequacy of parts of Alabama’s <b>landfill</b> <b>permitting</b> process. An open dialog was shared with the public at 13 meetings throughout Alabama to critique the process and gather public input.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many states have {{established}} specific regulations {{for the management of}} petroleum industry wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) above specified thresholds. These regulations have limited the number of disposal options available for NORM-containing wastes, thereby increasing the related waste management costs.

The Minimum Requirements for Waste Disposal by Landfill forms {{part of the}} Department of Water Affairs and Forestry's Waste Management Series that {{establishes}} a reference framework of standards for waste management in South Africa. It also facilitates {{the enforcement of the}} <b>landfill</b> <b>permitting</b> system provided for in terms of Section 20 of the Environment Conservation Act, 1989 (Act 73 of 1989). The minimum requirements (MR) are standards by which environmentally acceptable waste disposal practices can be differentiated from unacceptable practices. The need for environmentally acceptable yet cost-effective waste disposal has become a priority in South Africa. This is because increasing population and urbanisation have resulted in growing waste generation, placing pressure on the environment. There is also an increasing awareness of environmental issues and a desire for a clean environment {{on the part of the}} public. To ensure a cleaner environment, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, with whom responsibility for waste disposal is currently vested, has been tasked to meet both current and future waste disposal needs. The aim of the Department is to protect the environment and the public from the impacts of bad waste disposal practices. It has been found that whilst there is sound legislation in place, many local authorities do not comply for various reasons. The Minimum Requirements will be evaluated and a case study approach and a local authority in the KwaZulu-Natal province will be selected.

The site never operated as a commercial facility because residents forced the Governor to include in the deed that it was a one-time only toxic waste facility. The landfill was built with plastic liners, a clay cap, and PVC pipes which allowed for methane and toxic gas to be released from the landfill. Although state officials told citizens they planned to build the landfill with a perforated pipe leachate collection system under the landfill, a system critical to a functioning [...] "dry-tomb" [...] landfill, no such leachate collection system was ever installed. The nearly 1 million gallons of water that was capped in the [...] "dry-tomb" [...] landfill could not be pumped out, and citizens later learned from state rainfall and landfill monitoring data that tens of thousands of gallons of water had been entering and exiting the landfill for years. Within a few months of burying the PCBs, EPA found significant PCB air emissions at the landfill and 1/2 mile away, but citizens did not learn about this report for another 15 years. The 60,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil were buried within about 7 feet of groundwater. Warren County's first independent scientist, Dr. Charles Mulchi, had predicted that the landfill would inevitably fail because of unsuitable soils and close proximity to groundwater.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that one in four Americans lives within 3 miles of a contaminated site, many of which pose serious risks to {{human health and the}} environment. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) provided the federal government with authority to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances and created a trust fund to provide for certain cleanup activities. Under CERCLA, EPA established the Superfund program to address the threats that contaminated sites pose. Although EPA has paid for the cleanup of many of these sites through the Superfund program, funding for these cleanups has diminished in recent years. In 2010, we reported that EPA's estimated costs to clean up existing contaminated sites exceed the Superfund program's current funding levels and that some sites have not received sufficient funding for cleanup to proceed in the most cost-efficient manner. Additionally, in July 2009, we reported that EPA does not collect sufficient information on the cost of cleanup activities at Superfund sites and recommended, among other things, that EPA assess and improve the data it collects on the status and cost of cleanups. EPA coordinates the cleanup of Superfund sites by identifying sites potentially requiring cleanup action and placing eligible sites on its National Priorities List (NPL). EPA may compel the parties responsible for contaminating these sites to clean them up, or the agency may, using resources from the trust fund established by CERCLA, conduct cleanups itself and seek reimbursement from responsible parties. In some cases, EPA {{may not be able to}} obtain reimbursement because the agency cannot identify a responsible party or the responsible party or parties may be insolvent or may no longer exist. One category of contaminated sites [...] landfills and other waste disposal facilities [...] made up more than one-third of the 1, 397 sites EPA placed on the NPL from 1983 through 2007, and EPA's expenditures at these 511 sites totaled about $ 3. 6 billion through fiscal year 2007. According to EPA, landfill sites on the NPL generally share similar characteristics and present similar threats to the environment. For example, these sites generally exhibit contamination in various media, such as soil, surface water, or groundwater, and many landfills at Superfund sites contain hazardous waste that may contaminate nearby soil or water. Further, some have argued that landfills used for the disposal of debris created by disasters may also contain hazardous waste that could have long-term, negative environmental impacts. Consequently, concerns have been raised by various studies and environmental groups about the potential for such landfills to become Superfund sites. For instance, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a Louisiana emergency order authorized some potentially hazardous materials to be disposed of in <b>landfills</b> <b>permitted</b> to receive construction and demolition debris rather than in landfills with liners approved for such waste. Studies by a Louisiana State University research institute and an environmental engineering firm found that these categories of waste can introduce hazardous materials into landfills, increasing the likelihood of pollution. In this context, Congress asked us to review issues related to the cost to clean up the Agriculture Street Landfill Superfund site, which received debris from Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and other Superfund sites involving landfills in the Gulf Coast region where cleanup has been completed. Our objectives were to determine (1) what is known about the nature and costs of the cleanup activities at Superfund landfill sites and (2) the costs to clean up the Agriculture Street Landfill site and two additional selected Superfund landfill sites in the Gulf Coast region, and the key factors that influenced these costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Because it is {{difficult}} to characterize heterogeneously contaminated soils in detail and to excavate such soils precisely using heavy equipment, it is common for large quantities of uncontaminated soil to be removed during excavation of contaminated sites.

The baseline approach for the remediation of soils containing radioactive waste is excavation, pretreatment, containerization, and disposal at a federally <b>permitted</b> <b>landfill.</b> However, disposal of low-level radioactive waste is expensive and storage capacity is limited. ThermoNuclean`s Segmented Gate System (SGS) removes only the radioactively contaminated soil, in turn greatly reducing the volume of soils that requires disposal.

The results of that survey, published in 2000, suggested that 3 % of drilling wastes, less than 0. 5 % of produced water, and 15 % of associated wastes are sent to offsite commercial facilities for disposal. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) collected information on commercial E&P waste disposal companies in different states in 1997. While the information is nearly a decade old, the report has proved useful. In 2005, Argonne began collecting current information to update and expand the data. This report describes the new 2005 - 2006 database and focuses on the availability of offsite commercial disposal companies, the prevailing disposal methods, and estimated disposal costs. The data were collected in two phases. In the first phase, state oil and gas regulatory officials in 31 states were contacted to determine whether their agency maintained a list of permitted commercial disposal companies dedicated to oil. In the second stage, individual commercial disposal companies were interviewed to determine disposal methods and costs. The availability of offsite commercial disposal companies and facilities falls into three categories. The states with high oil and gas production typically have a dedicated network of offsite commercial disposal companies and facilities in place. In other states, such an infrastructure does not exist and very often, commercial disposal companies focus on produced water services.

These systems are {{the cornerstone of the}} verification program for low-density Green is Clean (GIC) waste at the Laboratory. GIC waste includes all non-regulated waste generated in radiological controlled areas (RCAS) that has been actively segregated as clean (i. e., nonradioactive) through the use of waste generator acceptable knowledge (AK). The use of this methodology alters LANL's past practice of disposing of all room trash generated in nuclear facilities in radioactive waste landfills. Waste that is verified clean can be disposed of at the Los Alamos County Landfill. It is estimated that 50 - 90 % of the low-density room trash from radioactive material handling areas at Los Alamos might be free of contamination. This approach avoids the high cost of disposal of clean waste at a radioactive waste landfill. It also reduces consumption of precious space in the radioactive waste landfill where disposal of this waste provides no benefit to the public or the environment. Preserving low level waste (LLW) disposal capacity for truly radioactive waste is critical in this era when expanding existing radioactive waste <b>landfills</b> or <b>permitting</b> new ones is resisted by regulators and stakeholders. This paper describes the operating experience with the WAND and HERCULES since they began operation at SWO.

Industry – encouraged by financial penalties from the Government – faces the challenges of cleaner and more sustainable production whilst trying to remain competitive in the market place. This thesis presents development of several theoretical propositions: a ‘fit thinking’ design framework, the ‘All Seeing Eye of Business’ (All-SEB) and the ‘waste alchemist’ industrial role. The ALL-SEB is a model to understand the impact and potential uses of manufacturing waste. The insights provided by the All-SEB model, resulted in a general waste elimination framework developed {{to serve as a}} guiding strategy for waste elimination. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a major hypothesis derived from the All-SEB: unavoidable waste could be transmuted into profitable co-products as a measure to divert waste from landfill. The ATM (analyse, transform and market) methodology was developed as a way to help companies transmute waste into ‘co-products’. A tool for idea generation (the wheel of waste) was developed to be used in the Analysis phase of the ATM methodology. Case study research was undertaken in order to test the ATM methodology and the way in which unavoidable waste could be transmuted into a profitable co-product in a real world manufacturing setting. The case study results revealed the generative mechanisms that enable waste transmutation into profitable co-products; based on these findings a refined ATM methodology for waste transmutation was proposed. The implementation of the theoretical propositions in industrial settings shed light into strategic aspects of resource efficiency: from waste prevention through ‘fit thinking’, to manufacturing process innovation all the way to a better company integration into the industrial ecosystem. Companies looking to achieve zero waste to landfill status would benefit from using the refined ATM methodology. It was found that the ATM methodology and the wheel of waste are useful to several other actors in the industrial ecosystem: waste management companies looking to transform themselves into ‘resource and energy providers’, to external consultants and to third party companies dubbed ‘waste alchemists’ that could offer waste transmutation services to manufacturers...|$|R

As far as the summer 2010 status is concerned, the “Fano” landfill is comprehensive of diversified sections/sub-sections with particular cover conditions. Precisely, the oldest and inactive Section ‘’ 1 ” is equipped with a final, composite cover system consisting of non-compacted clay layer, compacted clay layer, geotextile-geonet-geotextile layer, and top soil. Particularly in summer 2010, the top soil of Section “ 1 ” was naturally covered by spontaneously growing and dense herbaceous vegetation. Differently, the subsequent and inactive Section ‘’ 2 ” is comprehensive - as for the summer 2010 status - of three parts with diversified cover conditions: (1) the predominant areal portion named Sub-section ‘’ 2 A”, presenting since the end of summer 2007 a temporary artificial covering system (1 mm HDPE overlying a 50 cm clay layer) as permitted by the Italian landfill legislation for waste isolation from precipitation; (2) the smaller Sub-section “ 2 B”, having solely the clay layer without the HDPE; and (3) the south-eastern portion named Sub-section “ 2 S”, which during the period March-June 2010 was characterised by the deposition of about 9, 400 ton of sea-sediments dredged from the Fano harbour. Finally, the active Section “ 3 ”, in operation since the year 2008, is disaggregated in the following portions: (1) the main Sub-section “ 3 B”, which presents a temporary non-compacted clay cover; and (2) the smaller and double portion named Sub-section “ 3 A”, which consists of two lateral parts of a long slope temporarily covered during the year 2010 with a geomembrane (HDPE). Interestingly, specific monitoring campaigns of LFG diffuse emissions have been annually carried out at the “Fano” landfill since the year 2005 with the non-stationary variant (i. e., with instantaneous location on ground surface) of the static accumulation chamber technique. The paper presents some elaborations of the monitoring data of the overall campaigns 2005 - 2010. In particular, the discussion is primarily focused on the campaign carried-out at the “Fano” landfill site during the summer 2010 when the site sections/sub-sections were simultaneously characterised by the aforementioned different cover options. The evaluation of LFG emissions with the static chamber approach at the “Fano” <b>landfill</b> site has <b>permitted</b> to individuate some relevant effects attributable to possible types of landfill cover...|$|R
40|$|Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 121 is {{identified}} in the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) (1996, as amended February 2008) as Storage Tanks and Miscellaneous Sites. CAU 121 consists of the following three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) located in Area 12 of the Nevada Test Site, which is approximately 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada: (1) CAS 12 - 01 - 01, Aboveground Storage Tank; (2) CAS 12 - 01 - 02, Aboveground Storage Tank; and (3) CAS 12 - 22 - 26, Drums; 2 AST's. CAU 121 closure activities were conducted according to the FFACO and the Streamlined Approach for Environmental Restoration Plan for CAU 121 (U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office, 2007). Field work took place from February through September 2008. Samples were collected to determine the path forward to close each site. Closure activities were completed as defined in the plan based on sample analytical results and site conditions. No contaminants of concern (COCs) were present at CAS 12 - 01 - 01; therefore, no further action {{was chosen as the}} corrective action alternative. As a best management practice (BMP), the empty aboveground storage tank (AST) was removed and disposed as sanitary waste. At CAS 12 - 01 - 02, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were present above the preliminary action level (PAL) in the soil beneath the AST that could possibly have originated from the AST contents. Therefore, PCBs were considered COCs, and the site was clean closed by excavating and disposing of soil containing PCBs. Approximately 5 cubic yards (yd{sup 3 }) of soil were excavated and disposed as petroleum hydrocarbon PCB remediation waste, and approximately 13 yd 3 of soil were excavated and disposed as PCB remediation waste. Cleanup samples were collected to confirm that the remaining soil did not contain PCBs above the PAL. Other compounds detected in the soil above PALs (i. e., total petroleum hydrocarbons [TPH] and semi-volatile organic compounds [SVOCs]) were determined to not likely have originated from the tank. Additional sample results showed that the compounds were likely present as a result of degraded asphalt around the adjacent, active water tank and not from the abandoned AST; therefore, they were not considered COCs. As a BMP, the empty AST was removed and disposed as sanitary waste. No COCs were present at CAS 12 - 22 - 26; therefore, no further action was chosen as the corrective action alternative. Although TPH was present at concentrations that exceeded the PAL, the volatile organic compound and SVOC hazardous constituents of TPH did not exceed the final action levels (FALs); therefore, TPH was not considered a COC. As a BMP, the empty AST was removed and disposed as sanitary waste. Closure activities generated sanitary waste, petroleum hydrocarbon PCB remediation waste, PCB remediation waste, and hazardous waste. Waste was appropriately managed and disposed. Waste that is currently staged on site is being appropriately managed and will be disposed under approved waste profiles in <b>permitted</b> <b>landfills.</b> Waste minimization activities included waste characterization sampling and segregation of waste streams...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the investigation was to confirm the presence and determine {{the location of a}} cache of 30 to 60 buried 55 -gallon drums that were allegedly dumped along the course of the pre-existing, northsouth diversion ditch (NSDD) adjacent to <b>permitted</b> <b>landfills</b> at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Kentucky. The ditch had been rerouted and was being filled and re-graded {{at the time of the}} alleged dumping. Historic information and interviews with individuals associated with alleged dumping activities indicated that the drums were dumped prior to the addition of other fill materials. In addition, materials alleged to have been dumped in the ditch, such as buried roofing materials, roof flashing, metal pins, tar substances, fly ash, and concrete rubble complicated data interpretation. Some clean fill materials have been placed over the site and graded. This is an environment that is extremely complicated in terms of past waste dumping activities, construction practices and miscellaneous landfill operations. The combination of site knowledge gained from interviews and research of existing site maps, variable frequency EM data, classical total magnetic field data and optimized GPR lead to success where a simpler less focused approach by other investigators using EM- 31 and EM- 61 electromagnetic methods and unfocused ground penetrating radar (GPR) did not produce results and defined no real anomalies. A variable frequency electromagnetic conductivity unit was used to collect the EM data at 3, 030 Hz, 5, 070 Hz, 8, 430 Hz, and 14, 010 Hz. Both in-phase and quadrature components were recorded at each station point. These results provided depth estimates for targets and some information on the subsurface conditions. A standard magnetometer was used to conduct the magnetic survey that showed the locations and extent of buried metal, the approximate volume of ferrous metal present within a particular area, and allowed estimation of approximate target depths. The GPR survey used a 200 megahertz (MHz) antenna to provide the maximum depth penetration and subsurface detail yielding usable signals to a depth of about 6 to 10 feet in this environment and allowed discrimination of objects that were deeper, particularly useful in the southern area of the site where shallow depth metallic debris (primarily roof flashing) complicated interpretation of the EM and magnetic data. Several geophysical anomalies were defined on the contour plots that indicated the presence of buried metal. During the first phase of the project, nine anomalies or anomalous areas were detected. The sizes, shapes, and magnitudes of the anomalies varied considerably, but given the anticipated size of the primary target of the investigation, only the most prominent anomalies were considered as potential caches of 30 to 60 buried drums. After completion of a second phase investigation, only two of the anomalies were of sufficient magnitude, not identifiable with existing known metallic objects such as monitoring wells, and in positions that corresponded to the location of alleged dumping activities and were recommended for further, intrusive investigation. Other important findings, based on the variable frequency EM method and its combination with total field magnetic and GPR data, included the confirmation of the position of the old NSDD, the ability to differentiate between ferrous and non-ferrous anomalies, and the detection of what may be plumes emanating from the landfill cell...|$|R

This mini dissertation discusses the delisting of waste generated at a tanning facility. This facility produces crust leather from partially tanned hides received from other tanneries in the Mpumalanga province. Crust leather is the product in the penultimate process before it attains its desired leather like properties. The crust leather is sent to a finishing plant for the final process of painting before it is supplied to the automotive industry for upholstery purposes. Large volumes of raw materials including chemicals, water and hides {{are used in the}} retanning process to produce crust leather. During the production of this leather various waste streams are generated including effluent, solid waste and tanning sludge. The tanning sludge is classified in terms of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry’s Minimum Requirements for Handling, Classification and Disposal of Hazardous waste as a possible or potentially hazardous waste. Hazardous waste must be disposed of to a <b>permitted</b> hazardous waste <b>landfill</b> site which has a significant cost implication for the tanning facility. This mini-dissertation focuses on the attempt to delist the tanning sludge. This mini-dissertation highlights the problems associated with hazardous waste disposal in the form of sludge from the tannery. This disposal is expensive because there is only one <b>permitted</b> hazardous waste <b>landfill</b> site in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces. This site is called Holfontein and is situated approximately 200 km from the tanning facility. The high disposal cost encountered is owing to the specialist management required because of the environmental risks involved in operating this waste disposal site. However, an option to delist the hazardous tanning sludge waste is available to the tanning facility, which could mean that the hazard rating is reduced from extremely hazardous to a lower rating or even to general waste. Delisting the tanning sludge will allow it to be disposed of to a general landfill site. Previous attempts to delist the tanning sludge were not successful as the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge caused it to remain classified as extremely hazardous waste. Due to the increasing waste disposal cost the tanning facility once again engaged in the processes to delist the tanning sludge. The personnel of the tanning facility is of the opinion that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) should not be present in the tanning sludge as these substances are not used generally in the tanning industry. Therefore, the main aim of this mini-dissertation is to delist the tanning sludge to general waste thus allowing it to be disposed of to a general landfill site, which in turn will result in a reduction in the waste disposal costs. Delisting of hazardous waste produced in a tannery In order to achieve the main aim, the study entailed a literature review of the retanning process explaining the generation of the various waste streams, the possible presence of chromium (Cr) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) in the process, and a review of the environmental legislation that will determine the waste disposal options. To delist the tanning sludge the tanning facility followed a defined procedure as determined by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. The tanning sludge was assessed using analytical procedures as specified. The objective was to characterise the leachability of the tanning sludge, as well as to verify the presence of any hazardous substances which prevent the tanning sludge from being delisted. Leachability is the potential mobilisation of substances from the sludge under circumstances similar than that of the waste disposal sites. This includes the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge. In an approach to verify the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge the composition of the raw materials (chemicals and hides) were evaluated and samples were taken from the various effluent streams. The tanning sludge was sampled separately to determine the leachability characteristics. No hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) were found to be present in the raw materials or in any of the waste effluent streams. However, small quantities of cyanide (CN) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) were found to be present in the tanning sludge. The reason for the presence of these constituents could not be determined as it was proved that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) do not enter the process through the raw materials. It was further proved that the process does not support circumstances to oxidise trivalent chromium to hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). Further, the presence of cyanide (CN) cannot be explained since it is not a substance that is generally used in the tanning industry. Part of the study included determining treatment options for the tanning sludge. It was found that treating the tanning sludge with lime reduced the concentration of heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). However, after analysis and classification of the tanning sludge it was found that it was not the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) that prevented the tanning sludge from being delisted to a lower hazard rating but rather the presence of small quantities of cadmium (Cd). Cadmium (Cd) is classified as extremely hazardous and therefore it is this substance that is responsible for the high hazard rating classification of the sludge. Although the objective to delist the tanning sludge was not achieved, it was determined that the waste can be disposed of to a general waste <b>landfill</b> site <b>permitted</b> to accept a certain amount of waste containing heavy metals (such as chromium and manganese). The reduction in the waste disposal cost will therefore be achieved and the tanning facility will dispose of their waste in a Delisting of hazardous waste produced in a tannery sound and environmentally responsible method ensuring it will not {{have a significant impact on}} the environment...|$|R
