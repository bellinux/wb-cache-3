5000|$|Beginning with Robert Morrison in 1807, Protestant missionaries {{began working}} from Macao, Pazhou (known {{at the time}} as [...] "Whampoa"), and Guangzhou ("Canton"). Their {{household}} staff and the printers they employed for Morrison's dictionary and translation of the Bible—men like Cai Gao, Liang Afa, and Qu Ya'ang—were their first converts and suffered greatly, being repeatedly arrested, fined, and driven into exile at Malacca. However, they corrected and adapted the missionaries' message to reach the Chinese, printing thousands of tracts of their own devising. Unlike the westerners, they were able to travel through the interior of the country and began to particularly frequent the prefectural and provincial examinations, where local scholars competed for the chance to rise to power in the imperial civil service. One of the native tracts, Liang's nine-part, 500-page tome called Good Words to Admonish the Age, found its way into the hands of Hong Xiuquan in the mid-1830s, although it remains a matter of debate during which exact examination this occurred.

50|$|After Terry Brooks had {{completed}} all {{work on his}} first novel, The Sword of Shannara, in fall 1975 - having begun it in 1967 - he began work on another book soon after. The plot he originally chose featured the son of Menion Leah as the protagonist and a girl with a Siren-like song that could manipulate the properties of objects around her. Brooks outlined about three-quarters of the story before beginning to write; he refused an attempt by Lester del Rey to see it because Brooks wanted to impress the editor. When Brooks finished three-quarters of the tale in fall 1977 after writing around his law practice hours, he found himself stuck and {{could not think of}} a suitable ending. He decided to send the story to del Rey to get his opinion on what the end should be.

Once del Rey finished a full line-by-line examination of the plot, Brooks <b>leafed</b> <b>through</b> the comments and found them to be disturbingly accurate.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} evidence {{dates from}} 1332 AD with a Latin {{report from the}} French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a baptism formula (Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit) from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of Durrës, Pal Engjëlli; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the Gospel of Matthew, also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters. Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too.

40|$|Diagrams and schemas {{included}} in medieval medical manuscripts are understudied within art historical scholarship. This thesis discusses the multivalence of meanings — medical, social and theological — generated within schemas {{included in}} sixteen different medical codices, produced in England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Through text-image analysis, {{by considering the}} diagrams {{in relationship to the}} texts that immediately surround them and the other texts included within the same codex, the following chapters show that diagrams, through different means, emphasised or legitimized the surrounding texts and medical practices. Additional analysis is interpictorial: the visual motifs are considered in relationship to similar and related pictorial subjects, familiar from other manuscripts and artistic contexts. Through consideration of the intervisual references to devotional art and other scientific schemas, the multiple meanings of the medical diagrams are further elucidated. Another feature of the codices that is studied is their status as physical objects, how they were held, used, <b>leafed</b> <b>through</b> and transported. Lastly, by situating the codices and their diagrams within a late medieval English social, ideological and religious milieu, a deeper understanding of their function is achieved. This thesis shows that rather than being simple tools used in medical practice or representations of medical theories, diagrams included in medical manuscripts functioned in multiple, prescriptive and descriptive, ways to define theological, civic and gendered ideas around social order...|$|R
5000|$|Art-historical {{analysis}} {{in the early to}} mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a [...] "Virgin and Child" [...] work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems to energetically leaf through it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent Mary. More recently, art historians such as Alfred Acres have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work—especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central {{to the understanding of the}} painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently <b>leafing</b> backwards <b>through</b> the pages, towards the beginning. While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is <b>leafing</b> backwards <b>through</b> the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning. Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards Genesis: 3 describing the Fall of Man, citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the redemptive theme, including the [...] Madonna Standing panel in the Kunsthistorisches Museum where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people came}} {{from other parts}} of Scotland, and even from England and Ireland, to hear the sermons, and no doubt to witness the {{convictions}} and conversions.

(He was surprised, when he announced his text, to hear the rustle of Bibles being <b>leafed</b> <b>through</b> to follow him [...] - [...] an indication of the high rate of literacy among common Scots of the time.)Four ministers preached on the Friday fast day before the sacrament, four others preached on the Saturday to prepare those taking Communion and probably 15 preached in total on the Sunday of the Communion. James Meek reckons about 3000 took communion, about 10% of the crowd. Another, more evangelical minister calculated that, in total, about 400 persons were converted during the six months of the Cambuslang work, though he also noted [...] "backsliders". The crowds seemed to dwindle after the second communion, no doubt partly due to the year progressing. For some years, however, 18 February was kept, according to Mr M’Culloch [...] "partly as a day of thanksgiving for the remarkable season of grace to many in the British colonies, and particularly for this small corner, in the years 1741 and 1742; and partly as a day of humiliation and fasting for misimprovement (sic) of mercies; and especially for the backslidings of many, who then showed a more than ordinary concern about their souls, but have since fallen away, and turned as bad, or worse than they were before". It is not known if Mr M’Culloch finally experienced either conviction or conversion. There was a centenary event in 1842.|$|R

5000|$|Durán Madonna (also {{known as}} the Madonna in Red or Virgin and Child in a Niche or Madonna Enthroned) is an oil on oak panel {{painting}} completed sometime between 1435 and 1438 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The painting derives from [...] Jan van Eyck's Ince Hall Madonna and was much imitated subsequently. Now in the Prado, Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene Virgin Mary dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully <b>leafing</b> backwards <b>through</b> a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. But unlike van Eyck's earlier treatment, van der Weyden not only positions his Virgin and Child in a Gothic apse or niche as he had his two earlier madonnas (the Madonna Standing and the Virgin and Child Enthroned), but also places them on a projecting plinth, thus further emphasising their sculptural impression.|$|R

40|$|Rummaging the ?queer? smelling attic of his parental home, a space {{filled with}} ?big trunks, broken furniture, old books, old clothes, and {{odds and ends}} of all sorts,? fifteen-year-old Forrest Reid hit upon a {{treasure}} that would furnish his listless life with a ?fresh stimulus?: stacks of ivory yellowed periodicals dating from the 1860 s, the decade prior to his birth. As he <b>leafed</b> <b>through</b> back numbers of Good Words, Cornhill, Quiver, Argosy and Once a Week, young Reid realised that here was the ?nucleus of a real collection? ? not of stories, essays or poems, but of the images that went with them. He was conscious that {{the removal of the}} illustrations from the magazines might be frowned upon as an act of vandalism; so, he secretly busied himself in the ?sunless pallor of the skylight? or even by candlelight to extract wood engravings that, as he recalled in his 1926 autobiography Apostate, ?possessed an increasing fascination? for him: ?They accepted life as it was and turned it into beauty; they invested the most homely material with a delicate and poetic charm. ? Reid had never been to a picture gallery ? and here was a chance to assemble one from the ?spoils of the lumber-room?. From the start, Reid?s collecting was studious and methodical: ?I cut out and mounted my pictures, carefully dating each drawing, and writing its title {{at the foot of the}} board, and the title of the magazine in which found it? (177). The use of possessive is telling here. By appropriating the images, by releasing them from the fictions they were designed to accompany and separating them from the publications they were intended to promote, the collector changed their value along with their meaning. Reid was not alone in this endeavour. Aficionados like Gleeson White and Harold Thomas Hartley concurred that magazine illustrations were well worth collecting, an engagement that elevated the ephemeral to the status of art or at least recognised its potentialities as art. This chapter examines the motives, methods, achievements and influences of those pioneer collectors ? their approaches and attitudes toward their pursuit as well as their own role and responsibilities ? and considers them in relation to the collector?s market from the 1860 s to the present day...|$|R
