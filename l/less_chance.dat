5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
5|$|When Davis {{and other}} youngsters signed new deals in 2011, McCarthy had said they stood <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> of first-team {{football}} in the Premier League {{than when the}} team were playing in the Championship. A year later and back in the Championship, Davis was in the team {{at the beginning of}} the season, but lost form and returned to the reserves. By November, he was again challenging for a first-team place, and manager Ståle Solbakken turned down the chance to re-sign Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong, still regaining fitness after serious injury, preferring to let the home-grown product prove himself. Davis featured regularly, but more often from the bench than in the starting eleven.|$|E

25|$|A {{workbench}} base {{should support}} the top {{so that it}} doesn't move, {{while at the same}} time keeping clear of the work. There are two main types: open bases and bases with built in storage. Open bases are easier to build and there is <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> of the base hindering the work - plus, it is usually necessary to compromise the strength and rigidity of a base in order to accommodate storage.|$|E

25|$|Young forage fish, such as herring, mostly feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{and as they}} mature {{they start}} to consume larger organisms. Older herrings feed on zooplankton, tiny animals that are found in oceanic surface waters, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Copepods and other tiny crustaceans are common zooplankton eaten by forage fish. During daylight, many forage fish stay {{in the safety of}} deep water, feeding at the surface only at night when there is <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> of predation. They swim with their mouths open, filtering plankton from the water as it passes through their gills.|$|E
25|$|Early {{identification}} and treatment results in <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> to spread disease, {{and for some}} conditions may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a window period after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that people turn to the Internet rather than to a medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems.|$|E

25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thousand}} years of dormancy are expected between large explosive eruptions of volcanoes in the Garibaldi Belt. A {{possible explanation for the}} lower rates of volcanism in the Garibaldi chain is that the associated terrain is being compressed in contrast to the more southern portions of the Cascade Arc. In continental rift zones, magma is able to push its way up through the Earth's crust rapidly along faults, providing <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> for differentiation. This is likely the case south of Mount Hood to the California border and east-southeast of the massive Newberry shield volcano adjacent to the Cascade Range in central Oregon because the Brothers Fault Zone lies in this region. This rift zone might explain the massive amounts of basaltic lava {{in this part of the}} central Cascade Arc. A low convergence rate in a compressional setting with massive stationary bodies of magma under the surface could explain the low volume and differentiated magmas throughout the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews proposed there could be a connection between regional glaciation of the North American continent during glacial periods and higher rates of volcanic activity during regional glacial unload of the continent. However, this is hard to predict due to the infrequent geological record in this region. But there is specific data, including the temporal grouping of eruptions synglacially or just postglacial within the Garibaldi Belt, that suggests this could be probable.|$|E
50|$|Double-decker buses may be {{more popular}} with {{passengers}} due to the better view, and to cyclists who {{may be at risk}} due to the unpredictable swing of an articulated bus's tail. Articulated buses normally offer more standing room while double-decker buses may sometimes (not always) offer more seats. Articulated buses have less dwell time because of the extra doors, while double-decker buses offer <b>less</b> <b>chances</b> for fare dodgers since there are fewer or no unmanned doors.|$|R
5000|$|Women {{have less}} {{decision-making}} power in household. Moreover, they have <b>less</b> <b>chances</b> for income-generating {{activities in the}} market. [...] An analysis of poverty measures in rural Ghana and Bangladesh showed that more persons in female-headed households are below poverty line. The inferior position of women in and outside household is interconnected because if women do not have economically constructed better alternative to staying with their husbands, they will be unlikely to make a voice against husbands.|$|R
30|$|From the patients’ {{point of}} view, {{there is less}} risk of wound infection, haematomas, pneumonia, major {{bleeding}} as well as decreased chances of deep venous thrombosis from early ambulation. In consequence, there will be shorter hospital stay, <b>less</b> <b>chances</b> of hospital-acquired infection especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and early return to full normal activity. This also means reduced overall costs and improved efficiency of hospitals from increased turnover of beds. Other investigators too noted lower hospital costs in patients undergoing laparoscopic staging [10, 22].|$|R
25|$|The F28 {{was similar}} in design to the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9, {{as it had}} a T-tail and engines mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. The {{aircraft}} had wings with a slight crescent angle of sweep with ailerons at the tip, simple flaps, and five-section liftdumper only operated after landing to dump the lift. These were employed rather than reverse thrust as the designers felt that doing so not only reduced weight, but maintenance also. Having no reversers also meant that on unpaved airstrips there was <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> of the engines ingesting debris. The leading edge was fixed (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was anti-iced by bleed air from the engines. The tail cone could split and be hydraulically opened to the sides to act as a variable air brake – also used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer. This design was also used on the HS-146, which became the BAe-146. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher RPM which helped eliminate 'lag time'. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or go-arounds on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear which used large low pressure tyres enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. Large wheel brakes also helped in shortening the landing run.|$|E
500|$|The {{counterfeit}} money was transported from Sachsenhausen to Schloss Labers, an SS-run {{facility in the}} South Tyrol. It was put through a money laundering operation run by Friedrich Schwend, who had been running an illegal currency and smuggling business since the 1930s. He negotiated a deal {{in which he would}} be paid 33.3% of the money he laundered; 25% was given to his agents undertaking the work—as payment to them and their sub-agents, and for expenses—leaving him with 8.3%. He recruited what he called [...] "salesmen" [...] in various territories, and built a network of 50 agents and sub agents; some of these were Jewish, deliberately selected because there was <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> that the authorities would consider them to be working for the Nazis. He informed his agents that the money had been seized from the banks of occupied countries.|$|E
500|$|The ruling classes {{strictly}} limited the space permitted for {{the homes of}} the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes. [...] Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived. [...] They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class. [...] Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> it had of surviving. [...] Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called azuma-e ("pictures of the Eastern capital") as souvenirs. [...] Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.|$|E

500|$|Confessing {{his love}} for games {{combining}} both luck and skill, Magic creator Richard Garfield admitted its influence in his design of Magic. In addressing the complaint about luck influencing a game, Dr. Garfield points out that new and casual players tend to appreciate luck as a leveling field, in which a random effect increases their chances of winning. Meanwhile, a player with higher skills appreciates a game with <b>less</b> <b>chance,</b> as the higher degree of control increases their chances of winning. According to Dr. Garfield, Magic has and would likely continue decreasing its degree of luck as the game matured. The [...] "Mulligan rule", as well as card design, past vs. present, are good examples of this trend. He feels {{that this is a}} universal trend for maturing games. Dr. Garfield explained using chess as an example, that unlike modern chess, in predecessors, players would use dice to determine which chess piece to move.|$|E

The country's destiny is imagined as a break-up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the <b>less</b> <b>chance</b> he has of moving on. García Márquez describes buildings as [...] "daunting, reverberating (if not exactly reiterating) with the echoes of a bloody past". The portrayal of the General's world as a labyrinth is underlined by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before: each location belongs to the past {{as well as to the}} present. The General in his Labyrinth blurs the lines between perdition in a man-made world and wandering in the natural world.|$|E
