40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} {{respiratory}} dynamics on odor {{response has been}} poorly studied at the olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>level.</b> However, {{it has been shown}} that sniffing in the behaving rodent is highly dynamic and varies both in frequency and flow rate. Bulbar odor response could vary with these sniffing parameter variations. Consequently, it is necessary to understand how nasal airflow can modify and shape odor response at the olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>level.</b> Methodology and Principal Findings: To assess this question, we used a double cannulation and simulated nasal airflow protocol on anesthetized rats to uncouple nasal airflow from animal respiration. Both mitral/tufted cell extracellular unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded. We found that airflow changes in the normal range were sufficient to substantially reorganize the response of the olfactory bulb. In particular, cellular odor-evoked activities, LFP oscillations and spike phase-locking to LFPs were strongly modified by nasal flow rate. Conclusion: Our results indicate the importance of reconsidering the notion of odor coding as odor response at the bulbar level is ceaselessly modified by respiratory dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The Olfactoscan is a sensory {{screening}} {{technique that}} identifies suppressing or enhancing aroma interactions for flavour optimisation. It combines olfactometry and gas chromatography via a specially developed interface: the gas chromatograph generates aroma packages from a flavour mixture that are {{one by one}} mixed with a pulse from a specific odorant as produced by the olfactometer. Trained panellists evaluate the intensity of that particular odour {{in the presence of}} each aroma package of compounds generated after gas chromatographic separation. Aroma packages of compounds that suppress or enhance the perception of the specific odorant are further identified with mass spectrometry. The dynamic principle of the Olfactoscan allows a rapid sensory screening of a high number of compounds (> 100) within a short time (15 - 20 min). As it represents a sensory screening method, interactions at receptors as well as higher <b>levels</b> (olfactory <b>bulb,</b> olfactory cortex) can be identified. Here, the Olfactoscan principle is described and an application example is given...|$|R
40|$|Occupational and {{environmental}} exposure of synthetic nitriles is of potential relevance to human health. Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), a prototype nitrile toxin, {{has been shown}} to produce dyskinetic syndrome in rodents. This study reports the effect of concomitant exposure of rats to hydrocortisone and IDPN on behavioural abnormalities namely excitation, circling and chorea (ECC) syndrome. Four groups of female Wistar rats were given hydrocortisone (0, 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg, gavage, for 10 days) 30 min. before IDPN (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally for 8 days). Two additional groups of rats were treated with either saline (control group) or 60 mg/kg of hydrocortisone (drug alone group). The animals were observed for neurobehavioural abnormalities including dyskinetic head movement, circling, tail hanging, air righting reflex and contact inhibition of righting reflex. After behavioural studies, the animals were killed, and the discrete brain regions and temporal bones were collected for biochemistry and inner ear histopathology, respectively. Hydrocortisone significantly and dose dependently attenuated the incidence and severity of IDPN-induced behavioural syndrome. Administration of hydrocortisone (60 mg/kg) alone significantly increased glutathione (GSH) <b>levels</b> in olfactory <b>bulb</b> and striatum, whereas IDPN alone significantly reduced GSH <b>levels</b> in olfactory <b>bulb,</b> striatum and hippocampus. Hydrocortisone (60 mg/kg) significantly compensated IDPN-induced depletions of GSH in different brain regions. Hydrocortisone also protected the animals against IDPN-induced vestibular hair cell degeneration. The protective effect of hydrocortisone may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

40|$|Direct cooling of {{buildings}} by water evaporation {{has traditionally been}} seen as appropriate, only, in dry and arid climates, which experience high <b>levels</b> of wet <b>bulb</b> temperature depression. The technique has generally not been applied in maritime climates where low <b>levels</b> of wet <b>bulb</b> temperature depression are frequently found. However, recent developments in enhancing heat and mass transfer in cooling towers, together {{with the success of}} high temperature sensible cooling systems, such as chilled ceiling panels and beams, have prompted a review of the evaporative cooling technique as an effective and low energy means of cooling modern deep plan buildings, in maritime climates. At present, however, there is little in depth research and analysis of the performance, energy efficiency, and availability of this form of cooling in maritime conditions. To address these issues an experimental research programme has been established with a view to demonstrating the potential and optimising the design of this form of cooling under low approach conditions. This paper presents the results of recent experimental research into the electrical consumption of a prototype inverter controlled cooling tower when generating cooling water at the chilled water temperatures required for chilled ceiling panels and beams, under varying load and wet bulb temperature approach conditions. Energy consumption efficiencies are presented for a range of specific conditions and typical annual efficiencies are computed. Results are compared with typical energy consumption efficiencies of conventional, vapour compression based, cooling systems. A considerable potential for the reduction of cooling electrical energy consumption, in maritime climates, is shown...|$|R

40|$|Alliinase (Alliin lyase EC 4. 4. 1. 4), a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent lyase, {{represents}} one of the major protein components of Allium species. The enzyme is a homodimeric glycoprotein and catalyzes the synthesis of allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate, a biologically active compound), pyruvate, and ammonia starting from the specific non-protein sulfur-containing amino acid alliin ((+S) -allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide). Using newly developed specific primers two new alliinase genes from Allium obliquum and Allium senescens ssp. montanum were amplified and sequenced, as well as their homologs, from Allium fistulosum and Allium schoenoprasum. The G+C content of the alliinase region ranges between that of other dicot plants and that reported in monocot cereal plants, in all four species. Investigations of gene expression revealed a significantly higher enzyme expression <b>level</b> in <b>bulbs</b> than in leaves in all four taxa. The deduced alliinase sequences displayed a high variability among different species, since the lowest sequence similarity was found to be 55. 5 % between Allium senescens ssp. montanum and Allium cepa, while the highest similarity is 77. 5 %, between Allium senescens ssp. montanum and Allium fistulosum. Leucine is the most common amino acid in all four alliinases, while cysteine is also more frequent than in other enzymes, suggesting a high stability of the molecules due to the possible disulfide bonds...|$|R

This experiment was conducted for studying the effect of bulb cooling on vegetative and reproductive characteristics and also study of changes of endogenous IAA and ABA <b>levels</b> during <b>bulb</b> vernalization of Lilium LA Hybrid cv. Ceb Dazzle during 2008 - 2009. In this experiment bulbs were vernalized for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks at 5 oC. Results showed that bulbs that received no cold treatment, produced no flower. Thus in this cv. Vernalization is essential for flowering. Increases of cold duration was reduced both leaf number and bulb germination time, and increased flower number and plant height. Results also showed that during cold treatment, ABA content of mother scales decreased gradually. On the other hand IAA levels both in mother and daughter scales were increased {{at the start of}} cold treatment. Maximum IAA concentration obtained from daughter scales at the end of cold storage. At the flowering stage ABA levels were higher in mother scales than daughter scales. It seems that dormancy factor (es) might be in the mother scales.

40|$|AbstractTo {{visualize}} odorant representations by receptor neuron {{input to}} the mouse olfactory bulb, we loaded receptor neurons with calcium-sensitive dye and imaged odorant-evoked responses from their axon terminals. Fluorescence increases reflected activation of receptor neuron populations converging onto individual glomeruli. We report several findings. First, five glomeruli were identifiable across animals {{based on their}} location and odorant responsiveness; all five showed complex response specificities. Second, maps of input were chemotopically organized at near-threshold concentrations but, at moderate concentrations, involved many widely distributed glomeruli. Third, the dynamic range of input to a glomerulus was greater than that reported for individual receptor neurons. Finally, odorant activation slopes could differ across glomeruli, and for different odorants activating the same glomerulus. These results imply {{a high degree of}} complexity in odorant representations at the <b>level</b> of olfactory <b>bulb</b> input...|$|R
40|$|Fertilization with humic {{substances}} (HS) {{has been}} proposed as target tool to improve crop production within a sustainable agriculture framework. The dose and application method are two factors that can influence the effect of HS on nutrient composition and productivity of onion. Therefore, our main objective {{was to assess the}} effect of each of the abovementioned factors, separately or interacting, on the quality and productivity of onion bulbs in a field test. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 2  ×  3, with two methods of application of HS and three different doses. The combined application method, immersion together with foliar pulverization, showed highest improvement of biomass and nutritional content of bulbs. However, while the intermediate dose of HS exerted greater increases on onion yield, productivity, carbohydrates and proteins <b>levels</b> in <b>bulbs,</b> mineral nutrient accumulation resulted especially when highest doses of HS were added. From a nutritional point of view, higher sweetness (from 113 to 149  mg g of soluble sugars in dry matter) and an improved P, K and Mg content of bulbs (4. 00, 11. 65 and 3. 18  g kg, respectively) in response to HS addition has been ascribed.

Sulphur application had significant effect on yield components and bulb yield of onion. The highest bulb yields (19. 75 and 19. 88 t/ha) were obtained from sulphur levels between 60 and 75 kg/ha in two consecutive years. Both the cumulative weight and rotten loss were significantly influenced by sulphur fertilization. The maximum weight loss (40. 78 %) was recorded after 180 days of storage in S 60 kg/ha and the minimum (31. 40 %) was found in S 45 kg/ha. The bulbs stored in bamboo platform were found in acceptable condition after 6 months of storage showing 31. 40 % of weight loss. The maximum rotten bulbs (63. 75 %) were observed in control treatment (without S) and the minimum rotten bulbs (37. 04 %) were observed in S 45 kg/ha after 180 days of storage because application of sulphur enhanced the storability of onion bulbs.

In {{the central nervous}} system, expression of CNTF-mRNA is highly concentrated in olfactory bulb. In the present study, we examined the regulatory mechanism of CNTF-mRNA expression in cultured astrocytes from newborn rat brain. Cultured astrocytes from new born rat brain expressed CNTF-mRNA at levels comparable to the <b>level</b> in olfactory <b>bulb</b> in vivo. Treatment of the astrocytes with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, led to a decrease of CNTF-mRNA level. The effect of forskolin was mimicked by cAMP-linked agonists, such as VIP, PACAP, isoproterenol and dopamine. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, did not abolish the forskolin-induced decrease of CNTF-mRNA. Measurement of the half-life of CNTF-mRNA {{in the presence of}} actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, indicated that the degradation of CNTF-mRNA is not destabilized by the forskolin-treatment. These data taken together suggest that the cAMP-induced suppression of CNTF-mRNA is mainly caused by the inhibition of CNTF gene transcription...|$|R

From the results, it was possible to estimate the room noise level due to presence of piglets at around 12. 49 dB. The resulting noise level found was below the international limit for swine housing and in accordance to national standards for farm workers.

These enzymes are expressed in many if not all tissues, predicting an as yet unappreciated significance for adenosine deamination-mediated recoding of gene transcripts in the mammalian organism. We now report the molecular cloning of cDNA for RED 2 (alias ADARB 2), a third member of the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase family in the rodent. RED 2 is closely sequence-related to RED 1 but appears to be expressed only in the brain, where expression is widespread reaching highest <b>levels</b> in olfactory <b>bulb</b> and thalamus. RED 2 further differs from RED 1 in having a 54 -residue amino-terminal extension which includes an arginine-rich motif.

In stable arterial hypertension, this type of regulation is lost. On the basis of the results of this study, it has been concluded that blood viscosity is normally a primary controlled parameter of homeostasis.

There are two endogenous inhibitor proteins of CaMKII, CaMKII N alpha and N beta, which can regulate CaMKII activity in vitro. However, the physiological role of these endogenous inhibitors is not known. Here, we have investigated whether CaMKII N beta protein expression is regulated after contextual fear conditioning or exposure to a novel context. Using a novel CaMKII N beta-specific antibody, CaMKII N beta expression was analysed in the naïve mouse brain as well as in the amygdala and hippocampus after conditioning and context exposure.

40|$|Expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the coordinate activation of olfactory bulb neurons by brief exposure to specific odors in the alert rat. In situ hybridization to c-fos mRNA was compared to regional increases in 2 -deoxy-D-[14 C]glucose incorporation in an adjacent section analysis. Levels of c-fos mRNA in olfactory bulb were high in rats recently removed from their home cage but were low in animals placed in a relatively odor-free chamber for 30 min. Presentation of specific odors to alert rats for as little as 5 min increased c-fos mRNA in radially distributed neuronal ensembles that spanned the lamina of the main olfactory bulb. The complementary RNA (cRNA) -labeled neuronal collectives consisted of cells in the glomerular layer that precisely defined the borders of individual glomeruli and underlying tufted, mitral, and granule cells. The activated fields were much broader in the granule cell layer than in the overlying glomerular layer and thus exhibited a flask-like, as opposed to a columnar, contour. The bulbar distribution of cRNA-labeled cell arrays differed with different odors and, in the glomerular layer, corresponded to focal regions of high 2 -deoxy-D-[14 C]glucose uptake. Administration of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK 801 did not attenuate the odor induction of c-fos but, instead, increased c-fos mRNA <b>levels</b> throughout the <b>bulb.</b> We propose that the neuronal ensembles expressing increased c-fos mRNA with odor stimulation represent principal functional units of sensory processing in the main olfactory bulb of the behaving rat...|$|R

The field experiment was performed as a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement of four nitrogen levels (control (100), 200, 250, and 300 kg ha- 1) and two <b>levels</b> of cultivated <b>bulb</b> weight (10 - 20 and 20 - 30 g) with three replications in both years of the experiment. Our results showed that increasing the nitrogen rate and bulb weight significantly enhanced Persian shallot production. Radiation-use efficiency (1. 06 to 1. 27 g MJ- 1), maximum crop growth rate (8. 3 to 11. 2 g m- 2 d- 1), and maximum leaf area index (1. 3 to 2. 6) showed a positive correlation with nitrogen rate and bulb weight. Nevertheless, nitrogen-use efficiency (0. 87 to 2. 38 g bulb per g nitrogen) indicated a negative relationship with applied nitrogen rate. Moreover, increasing the nitrogen application rate increased the carbon allocation to above-ground organs. On the other hand, nitrogen limited conditions increased the carbon allocation to underground organs and car-bon remobilization from stem and leaves to bulbs during the late growth season. Increasing the nitrogen application rate and bulb weight may be appropriate practices for enhancing Persian shallot production; however, evaluation {{of the impact of}} nitrogen on the quality of bulbs needs to be investigated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Methylene blue (MB), a free-radical {{scavenger}} inhibiting {{the production}} and actions of nitric oxide, may counteract excessive vasodilatation induced by nitric oxide during cardiac arrest. Effects of MB in cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were investigated. DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, laboratory animal study. SETTING: University animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS: A total of 63 piglets of both sexes. INTERVENTIONS: A pig model of extended cardiac arrest (12 mins of untreated cardiac arrest and 8 mins of cardiopulmonary resuscitation) was employed to assess the addition or no addition of MB to a hypertonic saline-dextran solution. These two groups (MB and hypertonic saline-dextran group [MB group] and hypertonic saline-dextran-only group) of 21 animals were each compared with a group receiving isotonic saline (n = 21). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Although the groups were similar in baseline values, 4 -hr survival in the MB group was increased (p =. 02) {{in comparison with the}} isotonic saline group. Hemodynamic variables were somewhat improved at 15 mins after restoration of spontaneous circulation in the MB group compared with the other two groups. The jugular <b>bulb</b> <b>levels</b> of 8 -isoprostane-prostaglandin F 2 alpha and 15 -keto-dihydro-prostaglandin F 2 alpha (indicators of peroxidation and inflammation) were significantly decreased in the MB group compared with the isotonic saline group. Significant differences were recorded between the three groups in levels of protein S- 100 beta (indicator of neurologic injury), with lower levels in the MB group compared with the isotonic saline and hypertonic saline-dextran-only groups. Troponin I and myocardial muscle creatine kinase isoenzyme arterial concentrations (indicators of myocardial damage) were also significantly lower in the MB group. CONCLUSIONS: MB co-administered with a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution increased 4 -hr survival vs. saline in an experimental porcine model of cardiac arrest and reduced oxidative, inflammatory, myocardial, and neurologic injury...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Foodborne {{outbreaks}} involving {{fresh produce}} {{have been on}} the rise since the late 1990 's. Pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli are prevalent in agricultural environments and commonly travel between farms via irrigation water. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has placed an increased emphasis on microbiological standards of irrigation water and fresh produce. The Produce Rule is a defined portion of FSMA that labels all ready-to-eat produce as covered under the rule and requires producers to comply with FDA's proposed water standards for a relative level of public safety. If producers can demonstrate a post-irrigation mitigation strategy to reduce microbial concentrations and meet FDA water standards, they will be able use of their water source even if it initially does not meet the microbiological criteria. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the conventional finishing process for dry bulb onions is able to effectively reduce generic E. coli and Salmonella spp. to the FDA's standards. A secondary objective was to evaluate the contribution of soil type on the hypothetical irrigation-to-harvest intervals for root crops. The first study investigated the effectiveness of the conventional curing process to reduce microbial <b>levels</b> on dry <b>bulb</b> onions grown with contaminated irrigation water. Spanish yellow dry bulb onions were grown in Owyhee silt loam and Semiahmoo muck soils in containers in two greenhouses and irrigated with contaminated water containing a cocktail of rifampicin-resistant generic E. coli and Salmonella spp. (4. 80 log CFU/ml) every 2 - 3 days from day 40 to day 111. At maturity, irrigation was stopped for 12 days, lifted, and then followed by 16 days of curing. Onion and soil samples were collected, rinsed, and massaged with 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} small intestinal villous atrophy in celiac disease patients from quantitative analysis of videocapsule image sequences. METHODS: Nine celiac patient data with biopsy-proven villous atrophy and seven control patient data lacking villous atrophy were used for analysis. Celiacs had biopsy-proven disease with scores of Marsh II-IIIC except {{in the case of}} one hemophiliac patient. At four small intestinal <b>levels</b> (duodenal <b>bulb,</b> distal duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), video clips of length 200 frames (100 s) were analyzed. Twenty-four measurements were used for image characterization. These measurements were determined by quantitatively processing the videocapsule images via techniques for texture analysis, motility estimation, volumetric reconstruction using shape-from-shading principles, and image transformation. Each automated measurement method, or automaton, was polled {{as to whether or not}} villous atrophy was present in the small intestine, indicating celiac disease. Each automaton&#x 2019;s vote was determined based upon an optimized parameter threshold level, with the threshold levels being determined from prior data. A prediction of villous atrophy was made if it received the majority of votes (&#x 2265; 13), while no prediction was made for tie votes (12 - 12). Thus each set of images was classified as being from either a celiac disease patient or from a control patient. RESULTS: Separated by intestinal level, the overall sensitivity of automata polling for predicting villous atrophy and hence celiac disease was 83. 9 %, while the specificity was 92. 9 %, and the overall accuracy of automata-based polling was 88. 1 %. The method of image transformation yielded the highest sensitivity at 93. 8 %, while the method of texture analysis using subbands had the highest specificity at 76. 0 %. Similar results of prediction were observed at all four small intestinal locations, but there were more tie votes at location 4 (ileum). Incorrect prediction which reduced sensitivity occurred for two celiac patients with Marsh type II pattern, which is characterized by crypt hyperplasia, but normal villous architecture. Pooled from all levels, there was a mean of 14. 31 1; 3. 28 automaton votes for celiac vs 9. 67 1; 3. 31 automaton votes for control when celiac patient data was analyzed (P < 0. 001). Pooled from all levels, there was a mean of 9. 71 1; 2. 8128 automaton votes for celiac vs 14. 32 1; 2. 7931 automaton votes for control when control patient data was analyzed (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Automata-based polling may be useful to indicate presence of mucosal atrophy, indicative of celiac disease, across the entire small bowel, though this must be confirmed in a larger patient set. Since the method is quantitative and automated, it can potentially eliminate observer bias and enable the detection of subtle abnormality in patients lacking a clear diagnosis. Our paradigm was found to be more efficacious at proximal small intestinal locations, which may suggest a greater presence and severity of villous atrophy at proximal as compared with distal locations...|$|R
40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from chamber kilns with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a <b>level</b> of wet <b>bulb</b> temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate chamber kilns with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot kiln. The conditioning chamber opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the spray line must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the progressive kiln. This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|R
40|$|Neurofilaments (NFs) are the {{intermediate}} filaments specific to nervous tissue. They are probably {{essential to the}} tensile strength of the neuron, {{as well as to}} transport of molecules and organelles within the axon. Three peptides with apparent molecular masses of approximately 68 (NF-L), 145 (NF-M), and 200 (NF-H) kDa appear to be the major components of NF. The expression of these peptides is specific to nervous tissue and is developmentally regulated. Recently, complete cDNAs encoding NF-L and NF-M, and partial cDNAs encoding NF-H, have been described. To better understand the normal and pathophysiology of NFs we chose to clone the cDNA encoding the rat NF-H peptide. Using monoclonal antibodies that recognized NF-H, we screened a rat brain lambda gt 11 library and identified a clone that contained a 2100 -nucleotide cDNA insert representing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the NF-H protein. Anti-fusion protein antibodies recognized the NF-H peptide on immunoblots and stained fibrillar structures only in neurons. The cDNA recognized a 4500 -nucleotide polyadenylated mRNA that was present only in nervous tissue and a 3500 -nucleotide mRNA in adrenal. Brain NF-H mRNA levels were tightly developmentally regulated and paralleled the levels of NF-H peptide on immunoblots. Nuclear runoff studies showed that the 20 -fold developmental increase in the NF-H message was due only in part to a 4 -fold increase in its transcription rate. Levels of NF-H mRNA varied 20 -fold among brain regions, with highest levels in pons/medulla, spinal cord, and cerebellum, and lowest <b>levels</b> in olfactory <b>bulb</b> and hypothalamus. Transcription studies revealed only a 2 -fold difference in the transcription rates among these brain regions. Based on these results, we infer that half of the developmental increase and most of the interregional variation in the levels of the NF-H mRNA are mediated through message stabilization. Sequence information revealed that the carboxyl-terminal region of the NF-H peptide contained a unique serine-, proline-, alanine-, glutamic acid-, and lysine-rich repeat. The serine residues are likely sites of phosphorylation in the mature peptide. Genomic blots revealed a single copy of the gene in the rat genome and two copies in the human genome. In situ hybridizations performed on human chromosomes mapped the NF-H gene to chromosomes 1 and 22. Whether one copy is a pseudogene remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Ischemic {{neuronal}} injury {{continues to}} be a major delimiting factor in achieving successful clinical outcomesafter resuscitation from cardiac arrest. In this thesis, a pig model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) wasused to address the effects of different interventions on cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during CPR and theinitial postresuscitation period. A novel technique is presented to quantify the reperfusion oxidative injury. Maximization of cerebral blood flow during CPR by open-chest cardiac compression, continuous aortic balloon occlusion, and intra-aortic administration of hypertonic saline-dextran (HSD) did not ameliorate thepostresuscitation hypoperfusion or improve the cerebral oxygen extraction ratio or tissue pH. These findings disaffirm earlier studies suggesting that conserving brain viability after global ischemia is mostly a question ofmaintaining high perfusion pressure. Despite an increased cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR, intra-aortic administered epinephrineabove the aortic balloon occlusion did not further improve cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. This findingmay indicate adverse effects of epinephrine on cerebral vascular beds, possibly induced by a relatively highconcentration of epinephrine when administered above the site for aortic balloon occlusion. The IV administration of equipotent doses of epinephrine or vasopressin during CPR resulted incomparable hemodynamic changes. The peak increase in cerebral cortical blood flow, however, was reachedapproximately 30 sec later by vasopressin. Furthermore, the second bolus of vasopressin during CPR did notaugment cerebral perfusion, whereas epinephrine did. Consequently, reports suggesting that vasopressin issuperior to epinephrine with respect to its effects on central hemodynamics and vital organ blood flow may bebiased by the pharmacodynamic differences between the drugs, depending on the time point at which blood flowmeasurements are performed. In comparison with IV vasopressin, vasopressin administered above the aortic balloon occlusion resulted in a significant increase in cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR, but not after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Cerebral cortical blood flow was, however, not improved during CPR, whereas a significant increase was recorded after ROSC. Relatively higher concentrations of vasopressin above the sitefor intra-aortic balloon occlusion may, therefore, predominantly induce cerebral cortical vasoconstriction duringCPR but induce vasodilatation after ROSC. Assessment of oxidative stress or inflammation have been extremely difficult to attain. In our pig model of resuscitation, an association wasobserved between the duration of cardiac arrest and jugular <b>bulb</b> <b>levels</b> of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, a major isoprostane and a novel index of oxidative injury. 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, and the prostaglandin 15 -K-DH-PGF 2 α, increased within 5 min after ROSC and remained so up to 2 h, indicating the interval of time during which cerebral reperfusion oxidative injury and inflammatory response may occur and are potentially preventable...|$|R
