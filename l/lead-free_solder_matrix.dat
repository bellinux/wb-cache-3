This paper deals with microstructures and properties of SAC 305 <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> reinforced with graphene nanosheets (GNS) decorated with Ni nanoparticles (Ni-GNS). These Ni-coated GNS nanosheets were synthesized by an in-situ chemical reduction method. After morphological and chemical characterization, Ni-GNS were successfully integrated into SAC 305 <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy with different weight fractions (0, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 wt. %) through a powder metallurgy route. The obtained composite solders were then studied extensively {{with regard to their}} microstructures, wettability, thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. After addition of Ni-GNSs, cauliflower-like (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 intermetallic compounds (IMCs) were formed at the interface between composite solder joint and copper substrate. Additionally, blocky Ni-Sn-Cu IMC/GNS hybrids were also observed homogenously distributed in the composite <b>solder</b> <b>matrices.</b> Composite <b>solder</b> alloys incorporating Ni-decorated GNSs nanosheets showed slightly reduced electrical resistivity compared to the unreinforced SAC 305 solder alloy.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for replacing tin-lead (Sn/Pb) <b>solders</b> with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> in the electronics industry due to health and environmental concerns. The European Union recently passed a law to ban the use of lead in electronic products. The ban will go into effect in July of 2006. The Japanese electronics industry has worked to eliminate lead from consumer electronic products for several years. Although currently there are no specific regulations banning lead in electronics devices in the United States, many companies and consortiums are working on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> initiatives including Intel, Motorola, Agilent Technologies, General Electric, Boeing, NEMI and many others to avoid a commercial disadvantage. The solder joints reliability not only depends on the solder joint alloys, {{but also on the}} component and PCB metallizations. Reflow profile also has significant impact on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint performance because it influences wetting and microstructure of the solder joint. A majority of researchers use temperature cycling for accelerated reliability testing since the solder joint failure mainly comes from thermal stress due to CTE mismatch.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of mobile consumer electronics, a {{unique set of}} reliability issues those are associated with portable products and their using environment. In particular, accidental dropping is believed to cause substantial damage to the solder joints. The increasing occurrence of drop failure of portable electronics has been traced to the failure of the solder joints that interconnect the integrated circuit (IC) components with the printed circuit board (PCB). The increasing market pressure to replace lead based solder in electronic products has resulted in research being carried out in many areas related to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Thus, the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints under mechanical shock loading is a major concern. The main objective of this thesis is to study the failure mechanism and life prediction for lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joint subject to repetitive mechanical drop loading. The emphasis will be placed on the strain hardening effect of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint under repetitive mechanical drop loading. The mechanical properties of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy were first studied by the tensile test. The results showed that the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was strongly strain rate dependent. The constitutive model of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was built. Nanoindentation tests were employed to obtain the mechanical properties of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC. The nanoindentation hardness value for SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC was found to decrease with increasing aging time. The IMC layers grew in thickness during thermal aging tests, while there were no significant changes in the Young’s modulus of IMC. High speed ball pull tests were used to find the brittle fracture strength of IMC. The simulation of the high speed ball pull tests were studied and correlated with the high speed ball pull tests. Then the IMC brittle failure criterion was established. The strain hardening effects of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> were found by solder wire drop test and board level drop test (BLDT). The structure stiffening effects were also found by the strain measurement during the BLDT experiment. The failure analysis after the PCBA BLDT experiment showed that all the failure modes were brittle failures. A 3 D finite element model of the PCBA was built and studied under repetitive drop loading. The dominant strain rates of the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints were found by correlating the material properties with tensile tests. After gradually correlating the drop loading condition, PCB strain, failure location and mode, and the IMC strain rates, the drop to failure number under repetitive drop loading was found.

Although PBGA packages have many advantages such as {{a larger number of}} I/Os, robust assembly process, and better thermal / electrical performance, their board level reliability is still a major concern. This is because their solder joints have a relatively short stand-off height especially for the Chip Scale Package (CSP). It is a global trend to replace today's harmful lead-containing <b>solders</b> with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> in future electronic products. Although there are various <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> systems available in the industry, people are still unsure over the selection of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> {{due to the lack of}} reliability data. When implementing such a large change in a material system, the effect on the reliability is always the first concern, especially at the board level. The implementation of the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> is a challenging process. It involves lots of study of process control and reliability for the board level interconnects. This brings out the value of the current study on the experimental evaluation of board level solder joint reliability of plastic ball grid array assemblies with eutectic lead-tin and <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders.</b> Four different reliability tests, namely the accelerated temperature cycling test, three point bending test, random vibration test, and the mechanical drop test were performed to evaluate the reliability of the <b>lead-free</b> board level <b>solder</b> joint.

The major drawback of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> is the problems caused by its high reflow temperature.

Issues addressed in this study include using VFM to reduce the solder reflow temperature, comparing the heating rate of different size solder particles, and comparing the reliability of VFM reflowed solder versus conventionally reflowed solder. Results comparing the effect of particle size on the heating rate of solder showed that the differences were negligible. This {{is due in part to}} the particle sizes overlapping. Many <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> pastes reflow around 250 ℃. Results indicate that when using the VFM, <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste will reflow at 220 ℃. The reliability of solder that was reflowed using the VFM at the reduced temperature was found to be comparable to solder reflowed in a conventional manner.

The realization of these functions in a packaging system depends {{on the performance of}} interconnect materials. Any failure on the interconnect materials could make entire system down. Currently, {{one of the most popular}} interconnect materials is <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder,</b> which has been used for two decades instead of toxic Sn-Pb solder. The updates on processes, equipments and standards for <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> have been completed. However, as continuous increase on the chip power and the miniaturization of consumer electronics, <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> is facing big challenges. The disadvantages of traditional <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder,</b> such as high process temperature, grain coarsening and thermal fatigue failure, are gradually exposed. Therefore, one of the urgent needs for packaging is to develop new interconnect materials. In recent years, as the development of nanotechnology, nanostructured materials are gradually applied on the packaging. Following this tendency, two promising nanostructured interconnect materials are presented in this thesis. The first part of this thesis shows a nanocomposite material. It consists of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles and Sn- 58 Bi <b>solder</b> <b>matrix.</b> Sn- 58 Bi solder has the advantage on low process temperature. However the inherent brittleness of Sn- 58 Bi limits its application. For this reason, the Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles are added into the Sn- 58 Bi in order to improve the mechanical properties. The result of shear test shows that the shear strength of Sn- 58 Bi increases by two times by the addition of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles. The result also indicates that the nanocomposite solder has excellent thermal fatigue resistance. The demonstrated properties make nanocomposite solder can be a potential candidate for replacing Sn-Ag-Cu in future. In this thesis, we also present another kind of interconnect material based on vertically aligned carbon nanofibers. High stability and compatibility of carbon nanofibers are always attractive to the packaging industry. By using a series of processes, such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, transfer and bonding, the vertically aligned carbon nanofibers are successfully assembled in the packaging system. As interconnect material, vertically aligned carbon nanofibers exhibit acceptable electrical resistance and shear strength.

The proposed test configuration is utilized to characterize the constitutive properties of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Experimental parameters are obtained for (1) a partitioned model, where the elastic, rate-independent plastic and rate-dependent creep behaviors are all separated and (2) a unified creep-plastic model. Reliability assessment of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint is performed by calibration of virtual qualification model for leaded packages with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder...</b>|$|R
