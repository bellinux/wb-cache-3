5|$|In Nigeria, {{at least}} half a million suffer from vaginal fistula, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of lack of medical care. Early marriages can result in fistula.|$|E
5|$|<b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the {{influence}} of humans in sheep breeding, ewes often produce multiple lambs. This increase in the lamb births, both in number and birth weight, may cause problems in delivery and lamb survival, requiring the intervention of shepherds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> {{of the number of}} medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{at the end}} of 1944, the Soviets entered Romania and Bulgaria {{forcing the}} Germans out of the Balkans. They left behind <b>a</b> region <b>largely</b> ruined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of wartime exploitation.|$|R
50|$|In severe winters, {{when the}} water surface of the bodden freezes over, the Rassower Strom remains <b>largely</b> {{ice-free}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the current {{to and from the}} Großer Jasmunder Bodden and provides a refuge for large numbers of water fowl.|$|R
5|$|By the 1780s, {{the brewery}} {{probably}} had an annual output of around 1,500 barrels, {{similar to the}} rival breweries of Benjamin Wilson and Michael Bass. Throughout the eighteenth century, Worthington sales were mostly of porter, directed towards the Baltic market, which was transported via narrowboat through the River Trent to the Port of Hull. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of this trade, {{by the time of}} Worthington's death in 1800, Worthington & Co. ranked among the largest of the provincial breweries.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E
5|$|Howard Staunton (1810– 22 June 1874) was an English chess master who is {{generally}} regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of his 1843 victory over Saint-Amant. He promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape—the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cook—that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851, which made England the world's leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world's strongest player.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of {{lobbying}} by Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, the government eliminated the HEW regulation in 1983, but 39 states, Guam and the District of Columbia still had religious exemptions in their civil codes on {{child abuse and}} neglect as of February 2015. Forty-eight US states allowed religious exemptions for compulsory vaccination as of June 2015. In Australia the church was the only group with a religious exemption for vaccination as of April 2015; the government said that it planned to remove it.|$|E
5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> {{of the new}} steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E
5000|$|The song is {{believed}} to originate from the miners' lockout of 1844. Although this was a national lock-out, {{the language of the}} song suggests that it refers to the dispute in the north-east coalfield, which lasted roughly 20 weeks. The lockout <b>largely</b> collapsed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of [...] "blackleg" [...] labour.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Civil War, Covington <b>largely</b> prospered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the city's access to the tobacco grown around the Bluegrass, with numerous cigar factories around the town. Its iron mills, distilleries, glassworks, and stove makers were also noteworthy. Birdsill Holly's innovative water supply network was introduced in 1871.|$|R

5|$|On May17, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{issued its}} {{seasonal}} forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E
5|$|This cyclone {{brought a}} devastating storm surge {{of up to}} 10metres (33ft) high to the Ganges Delta. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of this surge somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000people lost their lives, making this storm the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone ever recorded {{and one of the}} deadliest natural disasters of modern times. The total damage from the storm exceeded $85million (1970 USD, $480million 2008USD) and much of the agricultural and fishing capacity of the region was wiped out. In total some 3.6million people suffered direct effects from this cyclone.|$|E
5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of their isolation from outside culinary influences {{and the need to}} produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, moving their cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E
50|$|Merson died in Paris in 1920, {{his work}} <b>largely</b> {{forgotten}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the overwhelming {{popularity of the}} avant-garde art forms {{as seen in the}} works of the Impressionists and other artistic movements. Named <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Knight of the Legion of Honor during his life, he was elevated to the level of Commander posthumously.|$|R
50|$|Like other Philippine languages, Bikol has {{a number}} of loanwords, <b>largely</b> Spanish <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of 333 years of Spanish rule in the Philippines. This {{includes}} suerte (luck), karne (carne, meat), imbestigador (investigador, investigator), litro (liter), pero (but), and krimen (crimen, crime). Another source of loanwords is Sanskrit, with words like hade (king) and karma.|$|R

5|$|Edward was crowned at age {{fourteen}} {{after his}} father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied. This started {{what became known as}} the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of his inactivity and poor health.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, through a process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh emerged as the political capital in the fourteenth century. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed {{himself to}} William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Fossils=== Because, during dolomitisation, {{traces of}} fossils are <b>largely</b> lost <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of recrystallisation, fossils in the Wetterstein {{dolomite}} {{are harder to}} distinguish, and even in thin sections may be barely recognizable. Wetterstein dolomite is rarely as bituminous as typical Main Dolomite and therefore tends {{to be much more}} pure and brighter-coloured. Otherwise, there are no fundamental differences with the Wetterstein limestone.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, behaviorism was <b>largely</b> eclipsed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the {{cognitive}} revolution.

25|$|The {{austerity}} program {{imposed by}} the International Monetary Fund in late 1979 continued until 1984, but substantial trade surpluses were obtained only from 1983 on, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> delayed <b>result</b> of the import substitution industrialization programs of the 1970s and the reduction in imports brought about by economic decline. The austerity program enabled Brazil to meet interest payments on the debt, but {{at the price of}} economic decline and increasing inflation.|$|R
5|$|Thorpe gained {{nationwide}} {{attention for}} the first time in 1911. As a running back, defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 upset of Harvard, a top ranked team in those early days of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate championship <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of his efforts – he scored 25 touchdowns and 198points during the season, according to CNN's Greg Botelho. Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points. Thorpe rushed 191 times for 1,869 yards, according to Boda; the figures do not include statistics from 2 of Carlisle's 14 games in 1912 because full records are not available.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E
