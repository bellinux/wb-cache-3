For very small pion and kaon masses all of the usual corrections are truly <b>long</b> <b>distance,</b> while for larger masses the <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> portion decreases.

40|$|In {{the normal}} case, a {{reflexive}} pronoun is bound within its containing clause. More exceptionally, a reflexive is instead {{related to a}} binder in a higher clause – a phenomenon known as <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding. <b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> binding {{can be found in}} Norwegian, but as I will show here, with considerable variation between speakers. Quite a few speakers accept <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding only across indefinite interveners. For those who accept <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding across definite interveners, the acceptability drops if the embedded clause has V 2 order, and in particular if the initial constituent of the embedded clause is topicalised. Other factors that influence the acceptability of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding are the logophoricity of the matrix verb, the agentivity of the embedded verb, the presence of person features in the intervening subject, and the presence of negation in the embedded clause. Some speakers reject <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding only when two ore more negative factors co-occur. This shows that <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding is a complex phenomenon, and that individual grammars can give priority to different factor...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 <b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> {{travel is}} a {{critical}} component of American life, generating immense impacts on a variety of aspects of the society. In 1995, American households took about 656 million <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> domestic trips (100 + miles, one way), which totaled 1 billion person trips. Compared to the well-studied intra-urban travel, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel needs further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts, for which the <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel data serve as a substantial basis. While MPOs periodically collect both supply and demand data to support the development of regional models, supply-side data reflecting transportation service and costs at corridor, interregional, and national level are scarce. To merge the gap, {{there is a need to}} establish a national data framework, with available datasets integrated to support implementing quantitative methods on a national highway network to resolve network loading issues for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel. This research intends to address this imperative. The research scope embraces the <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger travel on national highways within the contiguous United States. The framework developed comprises not only a data warehouse where a plethora of datasets reside and interact, but also a complete modeling methodology to infer network loading conditions of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel. Applying the national data framework approach, this research answers a pivotal question: how can we gain knowledge and insights of distributive patterns of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> passenger travel at interregional level given existing data resources? This research elaborates the methodologies for the framework design and addresses the technical and theoretical challenges particularly in issues of travel impedance estimation and <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel network loading. Findings from this research lay a solid foundation for building the fundamental theoretical framework urgently needed for <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel studies and contribute significantly to the understanding of the supply side of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel, from available infrastructure capacity and networks loading conditions to the induced environment challenges, infrastructure congestion, and investment costs, as well as facilitating policy making and evaluation pertain to <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> travel at national level...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that (some {{speakers}} of) Norwegian allow <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding, defined here as binding across a finite clause boundary. A number of factors that facilitate <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding have also been identified. In the study reported on here, 93 native speakers of Norwegian judged 30 sentences in a web-based questionnaire. The results show that V 2 order in the embedded clause reduces the acceptability of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding considerably, and the presence of a fronted topic in the embedded clause further adds to this effect. V 2 order involves a relatively complex C-domain, and the presence of an initial topic increases the complexity even more. It appears that even without <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding, an embedded complex C-domain reduces the acceptability for some speakers, but adding <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding increases the rejection rate considerably. There are also other factors that influence the acceptance of <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding, and in addition, there is individual variation in the weighting of the factors. Moreover, for some speakers each factor in isolation does not make <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding unaccept¬able – only the interaction of two or more factors leads to ungram¬maticality. Hence, <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> binding is a more complex phenomenon than has hitherto been assumed...|$|R
