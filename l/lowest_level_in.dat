5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>in</b> the ninth century, when few books and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E

25|$|In 2000 {{a strong}} economy, falling unemployment, {{and the impact}} of the Internet {{appeared}} to breathe new life into the “Swedish model” of a welfare society, one that had seemed dead and buried during the deep recession of the early 1990s: growth reached 4%, and unemployment fell to the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>in</b> years. The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36% approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.|$|E

25|$|High level {{points in}} the gravity field occur {{at the head of}} Yass River just north of the east finger of the ACT of –320μm·s−2. 1μm·s−2 is 0.1milligals, so this level is –32milligals.

Oaks Estate is −400, the highest levels in the metropolitan area are at Watson and Mitchell at −350, and at Mulligans Flat at −345.

25|$|Irrigation plays a {{major role}} in a country the very {{livelihood}} of which depends upon a single river, the Nile. Most ambitious of all the irrigation projects is that of the Aswan High Dam, completed in 1971. A report published in March 1975 by the National Council for Production and Economic Affairs indicated that the dam had proved successful in controlling floodwaters and ensuring recurring water supply, but that water consumption had been more than needed and shall be controlled. Some precious land was lost below the dam because the flow of Nile silt was stopped, and increased salinity remains a major problem. Furthermore, five years of drought in the Ethiopia highlands—the source of the Nile River's water—caused the water level of Lake Nasser, the Aswan High Dam's reservoir, to drop to the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>in</b> 1987.|$|E
25|$|Founded as Sporting Club Anderlechtois on 27 May 1908 {{by a dozen}} {{football}} lovers at the Concordia café (located in the Rue d'Aumale/Aumalestraat in {{the municipality}} of Anderlecht), the club beat Institut Saint-Georges in their first match, 11–8. They joined the official competition in 1909–10, starting at the <b>lowest</b> <b>level</b> <b>in</b> the Belgian football league system, then the third provincial division. In 1912–13, they gained promotion to the second-higher level of football, then named the Promotion. After only one season at that level, the championships were suspended due to World War I, and resumed in 1919–20. With {{the popularity of the}} team increasing, Anderlecht had moved to a new stadium in the Astrid Park in 1917 (then known as Meir Park). They baptized the stadium Stade Emile Versé in honor of the club's first major patron, the industrialist Emile Versé.|$|E
