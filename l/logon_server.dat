40|$|WebAuth is – as {{indicated}} by its name – an authentication system for web pages and web-based applications. Its primary goal is to provide for single-sign-on (SSO) behavior, i. e. to allow sharing an authenticated user’s identity among multiple web-based applications. This Report introduces one of several possible ways of making WebAuth infrastructure more robust and stable. It expects the reader to possess basic knowledge of the WebAuth system acquired either by experience or by studying available materials, such as [Gro 05] or WebAuth home page 1. The Report does not deal with WebAuth or SSO basics. These are sufficiently described by the article referred to above, or by [GS 05]. To put the WebAuth system successfully into operation [Gro 05], {{it is necessary to}} ensure that the new system is reliable. Overall reliability is – most importantly – determined by the reliability of the WebKDC <b>logon</b> <b>server,</b> which represents the core of the whole system. Obviously, reliability can be increased by adding more logon servers. It is certainly possible to set-up multiple logon servers and to configure various applications to contact various WebKDCs. However, isolated WebKDCs cannot be used to set up a single-sign-on environment, which is our main target. That is why it is necessary to commission multiple WebKDC servers and to configure them in such a manner that they act uniformly as a single authentication server (or a cluster of such servers) regardless of which of the servers has been actually contacted by the user. Several servers may be configured to act under a common DNS name – such as webkdc. zcu. cz – while the actual network address of the server is provided to the client by the DNS Round-Robin technique. DNS Round-Robin allows name servers to answer a single request with multiple addresses. One hostname (or service name) may be entered into the DNS server’s configuration file repeatedly with various addresses and it is also possible to...|$|E
