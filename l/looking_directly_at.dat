5|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the {{photosphere}} of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), {{even for}} just a few seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun {{can lead}} to {{permanent}} eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. <b>Looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the viewer.|$|E

25|$|Zoroaster {{is rarely}} {{depicted}} as <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the viewer; instead, {{he appears to}} be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{two main}} faces, the Southwest (on the left when <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the wall) and the Southeast, is a prow.

25|$|Since <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Sun {{with the}} naked eye {{permanently}} damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high optical density) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.|$|E

25|$|The 5-15 socket is {{standard}} in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Panama.

However, in the US the National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) specifies that the ground hole should be on top. Sideways installation is also permitted; in this case, NECA 130-2010 specifies the neutral (long) slot is on top.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Glenn Kenny {{has said}} that the [...] "calm precision" [...] of the mise en scène in the opening dream {{sequence}} [...] "put [...] under such a powerful spell" [...] that [...] "it reconfirmed ... Rivette's standing as an ultimately unquantifiable master". Throughout the film, everyday sounds are amplified by a lack of music, and the film uses sweeping long shots, and several incidental scenes of Julien working, talking with his cat, and of the characters sleeping. Slant Magazine commented that the cat is the film's most interesting character, and Philippa Hawker of The Age notes that the film [...] "has one of the best sequences involving a cat on film." [...] The camera follows the cat and films it <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the camera, giving a sense of artistic freedom and spontaneity.|$|E

2500|$|Hale began {{painting}} her self-portrait in 1884, {{working on}} it at her family's home in Roxbury, Massachusetts and at their summer home in Matunuck, Rhode Island. The painting, Self-Portrait, depicts Hale gazing confidently at the viewer with her right hand dangling slightly over the chair. Dressed in all black, Hale wears a dress with buttons and a fur collar, covered by a loose jacket. Peeking out of a round black hat are Hale's bangs, {{which at the time}} were praised as a youthful hairstyle but could also connote promiscuity. Hale seems to be making a fashion statement with her bangs, choice of costume, and the ostrich-feather fan that she holds. When Hale first showed the painting to her instructors in 1885, artist Bouguereau significantly criticized the size and position of the hand and encouraged Hale to make it [...] "prettier". However, Hale did not make any of the suggested changes to the hand, refusing to conform her work to the idealized, academic notions of beauty. The compositional weight of her hand is also notable because it was extremely rare for artists of any gender to portray themselves <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the viewer without any tools to identify their profession.|$|E
2500|$|The cloister {{area and}} part of the open chapel have been {{converted}} into a site museum. This museum contains pre-Hispanic artifacts, Catholic religious objects, religious paintings from the 17th century and more. One item which stands out is a painting of “Nuestra Señora de la Luz” an oil work of the Virgin Mary pregnant. It is claimed that from whatever angle the work is viewed, the Virgin appears to be <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the onlooker. Two other important pieces are an anonymous paints from the 16th century with Flemish influence presenting Saint Augustine and pictorial fragments from an altarpiece from 1737. The museum also contains a number of mummified remains on display. These were found under the floor of the main nave of the monastery church in 1982, when restoration work was being performed. These remains are of several children and one adolescent, each found in its own wooden coffin and in good condition. They were identified as upper-class Spanish due to their dress. The belief at that time was to be buried in the church as close to the altar as possible in order to reach heaven sooner. Today they can be viewed in the museum in the room which used to be the dispensary. [...] For this reason and others, photos inside the museum area are strictly prohibited.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, <b>looking</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E
