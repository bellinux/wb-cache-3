The electrolytic capacitor, {{part of the}} low-pass fi lter in the DC-link, has been blamed as a ailureprone component, and several approaches have been followed to improve the reliability.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a compact ultrawideband (UWB) bandpass filter (BPF) with sharp selectivity, wide notched-band, wide out-of-band rejection, and approximately flat group delay. The proposed filter structure {{is composed of}} a U-shaped open-circuited line that is interdigitally coupled to the input/output feed-lines using high impedance lines. The structure generates multiple resonant modes across the UWB span between 3. 1 and 10. 6 GHz, however, high coupling between the feed-lines and the U-shaped structure transforms the discrete resonant modes into an UWB BPF. Coupling is enhanced by inserting dielectric slots in the ground-plane immediately under the coupling-lines. A wide notched-band is implemented by introducing asymmetry in the coupled lines. This was achieved by making one of the coupling lines longer by folding it and extending the line to partially couple with U-shaped structure. The length of the extended coupled line and {{the position of the}} folded section determine the center frequency of the notch-band and its 3 -dB bandwidth. The notch was designed to be centered at 5. 5 GHz with appropriate 3 -dB bandwidth to blocking interference from WLAN signals.

In addition to the disordered patterns of specific size evident at small scales, slow height variations of scale-free character become increasingly evident when the system size is increased. The surface spectrum at small wave numbers has a power-law shape with a lower cut-off due to the finite system size. The temporal properties of these long-range height variations are investigated by analysing the time series of surface roughness fluctuations. The resulting power-spectral densities can be expressed as a sum of white noise and a generalized Lorentzian whose cut-off frequency varies with system size. The dependence of this <b>lower</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> on the smallest wave number connects spatial and temporal properties and gives new insight into the surface evolution on large scales...|$|E

The Grand Banks of Newfoundland in particular, located within the Avalon terrane, has been intensely investigated on both a local and crustal scale. [...] Gravity data is available for the Avalon terrane. A number of processing techniques, in both the space and frequency domains, was applied to the data in an effort to extract the topography of the Moho for the Grand Banks region. The data were passed through a series of low-pass filters, each having progressively <b>lower</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> to Isolate the long-wavelength signal from Moho. To ensure that the observed long-wavelength signal was due primarily to sources at Moho depth and not from intervening sources, the gravity field of the Mesozoic rift basins of the Grand Banks, also long-wavelength in character, was modelled and subtracted from the observed field. [...] Using an average depth to Moho derived from spectral analysis of the field and from seismic data for the region as well as a density contrast obtained from direct (seismic refraction results) and indirect (inferred geology) sources, the data was inverted to obtain a map of depth to Moho. Profiles along selected seismic reflection line locations were extracted and the Mohos compared. The broad Moho relief obtained from the inverted gravity data agreed with that of the seismic Moho, however, the amplitude of the topography generated by the inversion is significantly reduced. In light of the sparse deep seismic coverage within the study area, the inversion results give a good first approximation to a comprehensive map of Moho topography for the region. ...|$|R
