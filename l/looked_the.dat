Cuomo stated that, while the band liked the chosen band photo for the cover, Matt Sharp was {{not happy with the}} way his head <b>looked.</b> <b>The</b> Geffen Art Director used Photoshop to swap out the head with one from another shot.|$|E
5|$|River Phoenix as {{the teenage}} Jones. Phoenix had portrayed {{the son of}} Ford's {{character}} in The Mosquito Coast (1986).

5|$|Robert Russell as John Stearne. Playing Hopkins's thuggish assistant, Russell {{certainly}} <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> part. However, as filming progressed, Reeves {{found the}} actor's high-pitched voice unsuitable {{for such a}} rough character, and after production was completed he had all of his dialogue dubbed by another actor, Jack Lynn (who also appeared in a small role as an innkeeper).|$|E

5|$|Welles had met stage actress Ruth Warrick {{while visiting}} New York on {{a break from}} Hollywood and remembered her as {{a good fit for}} Emily Norton Kane, later saying that she <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> part.

She characterized her own personal relationship with Welles as motherly.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June the Regent {{appointed}} Lord Liverpool {{to head a}} new Tory administration. Despite their eulogies {{to their}} fallen leader, {{members of the new}} government soon began to distance themselves from his ministry. Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced: greater press freedom, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June, but too late to avoid the declaration of war on Britain by the United States. Lord Liverpool's government did not maintain Perceval's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade, which began to flourish as the authorities <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> other way. Linklater estimates that around 40,000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies, because of lax enforcement of the law.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{were drawn}} to play at home against Birmingham City in the Fifth Round, with Birmingham {{dominating}} the first half through a David Murphy goal. Daniel Sturridge scored {{in the second half}} to force a replay, which was played on 6 March at Birmingham, just two days after André Villas-Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea manager. Birmingham held Chelsea throughout the first half, and <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> stronger side at times, but after Mata and Raul Meireles scored twice in five minutes, Chelsea dominated the remainder of the game until the final whistle. In the Sixth Round, Chelsea overcame Leicester City at home in a 5–2 thriller. Gary Cahill scored his first FA Cup goal for Chelsea from a corner in the 12th minute, with Salomon Kalou following up five minutes later. In the second half, Fernando Torres ended a goal drought of over 25 hours to score, before Jermaine Beckford gave Leicester a late lifeline. Torres scored again in the 85th minute to put the result beyond doubt, although Ben Marshall grabbed one back three minutes later, before Meireles scored in the 90th minute to send Chelsea through to the semi-final.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E

25|$|The Babylonian {{placeholder}} {{was not a}} true zero {{because it}} was not used alone. Nor was it used {{at the end of a}} number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), <b>looked</b> <b>the</b> same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder.
