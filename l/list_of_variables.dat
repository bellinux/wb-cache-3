These samples are scientifically selected to represent the larger group. For example, the General Social Survey chooses a select number of households, approximately 8,000, which represent the nation as a whole, and surveys them every two years. Interviewers with laptops conduct face-to-face interviews, and the result is information about [...] "social wellbeing" [...] including [...] "housing, health, paid work, social connectedness, and human rights. It sometimes conducts specialty surveys about a specific industry or topic.

5000|$|Given a {{specific}} relation, its expressibility {{in the language}} can be checked by considering an arbitrary <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> whose columns in the table above (the [...] "ideal" [...] solutions to the universal gadget) form that relation.

50|$|This {{approach}} is then generalized to support mutual recursion. A mutually recursive let expression may be composed by rearranging the expression {{to remove any}} and conditions. This is achieved by replacing multiple function definitions with a single function definition, which sets a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> equal {{to a list of}} expressions. A version of the Y combinator, called the Y* poly-variadic fix-point combinator is then used to calculate fixed point of all the functions at the same time. The result is a mutually recursive implementation of the let expression.|$|E

50|$|The {{labeling}} literals {{are used}} on variables over finite domains to check satisfiability or partial satisfiability of the constraint store {{and to find}} a satisfying assignment. A labeling literal is of the form , where the argument is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> over finite domains. Whenever the interpreter evaluates such a literal, it performs a search over the domains of the variables of the list to find an assignment that satisfies all relevant constraints. Typically, this is done by a form of backtracking: variables are evaluated in order, trying all possible values for each of them, and backtracking when inconsistency is detected.|$|E

The struct can contain many other complex and simple data types in an association, so is a natural organizing type for records like the mixed data types in lists of directory entries reading a hard drive (file length, name, extension, physical (cylinder, disk, head indexes) address, etc.), or other mixed record type (patient names, address, telephone... insurance codes, balance, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Vector {{autoregression}} (VAR) is an {{econometric model}} used {{to capture the}} linear interdependencies among multiple time series. VAR models generalize the univariate autoregressive model (AR model) by allowing {{for more than one}} evolving variable. All variables in a VAR enter the model in the same way: each variable has an equation explaining its evolution based on its own lagged values, the lagged values of the other model variables, and an error term. VAR modeling does not require as much knowledge about the forces influencing a variable as do structural models with simultaneous equations: The only prior knowledge required is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> which can be hypothesized to affect each other intertemporally.|$|E
