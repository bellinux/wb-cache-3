This reasearch was aimed to know an antioxidant capacity of methanolic extract from yellow paprika with 2, 2 –diphenyl– 1 –picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The fresh yellow paprika was determined of its <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> by gravimetric. The yellow paprika extract was obtained by maceration using methanol as solvent. The content of β–carotene from this extract was analyzed qualitively by thin layer chromatography and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity of methanolic extract from yellow paprika was determined base on measurement of residual DPPH by UV–Vis spectrophothometric at wavelength of 515. 6 nm. The data was used to calculate % inhibition. Furthermore, IC 50 value was determined to know potency of its antioxidant. The result of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> yellow paprika fruit was obtained 6. 33 ± 0. 02 %. The analysis with thin layer chromatography and UV-Vis spectrophotometer showed that this fruit was contain of β–carotene. The result of antioxidant activity analysis from yellow paprika fruit was obtained IC 50 value of 0. 3028 ± 0. 0093 mg/mL.

We installed three transects in the Cerrado with plots in each Neosol type. Areas along the transects were randomly chosen for determining soil chemical properties, and accumulated leaf litter was collected monthly for a year for analysis. We used litter bags to test for a correlation between <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> mass and nutrient release. The calcareous cerrado had higher levels of macronutrients, higher pH, and lower Al compared to the arenitic cerrado. The estimated annual release of leaf litter nutrients in kg ha- 1 yr- 1 was higher in the calcareous cerrado. Nutrient concentration was significantly higher in different months in the calcareous cerrado, except for S and N. In general, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> mass was not correlated with nutrient release. Calcareous Neosol is unique to the cerrado sensu stricto, and retains more nutrients and facilitates higher leaf litter chemical quality than cerrado of the same physiognomy on dystrophic soils.

40|$|Abstract. Fixation with {{glutaraldehyde}} in seawater {{is shown}} {{to be effective in}} reducing the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> wt associated with preservation <b>of</b> plankton. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> wt from several plankton species and from bulk plankton samples was negligible. Organic weight loss was significant in some experiments, but less than that caused by formaldehyde. In a single experiment, carbon loss was zero, but nitrogen loss was high. Plankton samples are most often used either for measurements of biomass or for micro-scopic examination of preserved organism. These two purposes are mutually exclusive because biomass is lost on preservation in formaldehyde (Lovegrove, 1966; Hopkins, 1968; Omori, 1978; Durbin and Durbin, 1978). Samples to be preserved for later exam-ination can be used for biomass measurements only after a long period of preservation, and with the knowledge that the correction for weight loss is approximate (Omori, 1978). Obtaining both fresh samples for biomass measurement and preserved samples for examination normally presents no difficulty. Freshly collected samples can be split into separate subsamples for different treatments or, preferably, separate samples can be taken for each purpose (Beers, 1976). The difficulty arises when weights of individual taxa or other subsets of the crude sample are required. Sorting live plankton sample...|$|R

Organic matter content was measured as the weight <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> samples after combustion at 540  °C for 4  h. Particle-size analyses were performed on the Corg-free sediment fraction from the 10 slices from 3 cores. Prior to analysis, 20  mL of demineralised water {{was added to the}} samples, which were subsequently treated with 5  mL H 2 O 2 solution (35  %) and boiled until the reaction stopped and the H 2 O 2 had disintegrated into H 2 O and O 2. Particle-size analysis was carried out using the Micro-Liquid Module of a Beckmann Coulter Laser Particle Sizer LS 13320 at NIOZ, which resulted in 92 particle-size distributions classes from 0.4 to 2000  μm.|$|R
40|$|The {{solid state}} {{fermentation}} technique on {{palm kernel meal}} by using Aspergillus niger wild type and NRRL 337 was studied. The fermentation was carried out at 30 oC for 3 days continued with enzymatic process at room temperature and 40 oC for 2 days. The result showed that at the third days of fermentation spores started to grow on the surface. The 3 rd days fermentation can improve protein content and in vitro digestibility (IVDMD) with minimal <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> matter. The dry matter contents at 3 days fermentation were 48. 88 and 48. 83 % for product using Aspergillus niger wild type and NRRL 337. Combination 3 days fermentation and 2 days enzymatic process at room temperature by using Aspergillus niger NRRL 337 type gave the best product with optimal IVDMD value and protein digestibility of 51. 47 and 71. 33 %...|$|R
40|$|Suffusion, one of {{the main}} {{internal}} erosion processes, selectively erodes the fine particles which move through the voids formed by the coarser particles. In the literature, the mechanical consequences of suffusion on soil were investigated by several researchers. However, no general conclusion can be drawn because the already published results appear to be opposite. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate these consequences. A large triaxial erodimeter was developed in order to perform suffusion tests and triaxial tests on coarse soils which are often encountered in French dikes. For the suffusion characterisation, the proposed interpretative method is based on the energy expended by the seepage flow and the cumulative <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> mass. The results of triaxial tests on non-eroded and eroded specimens show the significant effect of an achieved suffusion process on the mechanical strength of soils...|$|R
