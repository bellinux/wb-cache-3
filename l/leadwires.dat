This version is reproduced with permission from Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery. Anatomic studies of skull growth have shown an increase (about 20 mm) in {{the distance between the}} round window and the asterion where the receiver-stimulator is usually located. In order to accommodate the skull growth of young patients, an expandable leadwire connecting the receiver-stimulator and the electrode array is necessary. Several expandable <b>leadwires</b> were evaluated in experimental animals, including helical <b>leadwires</b> protected by Silastic tubes and <b>leadwires,</b> with "V" or "W"-shaped levels in a single phase, and protected by thin Silastic or Teflon bags. The <b>leadwires</b> together with their controls were implanted on young animal's scapulae, temporal and parietal bones and in subcutaneous tissue. The in vivo expansion of the leadwire was monitored by periodic x-ray examination and the force to expand the leadwire was measured at the completion of implantation. The results showed that helical <b>leadwires</b> weresurrounded by fibrous tissue and a large force was required to expand them. The V or W-shaped <b>leadwires</b> were able to expand up to 20 mm in vivo and only a moderate force was required to expand them. For most of the cases, there was none or little fibrous tissue in Silastic or Teflon bags. The results indicated that for a paediatric cochlear implant, <b>leadwires</b> with V or W-shaped levels could, expand and biocompatible envelopes could effectively protect the <b>leadwires</b> from being bound by fibrous tissue.

40|$|A {{paediatric}} {{cochlear implant}} {{should include a}} leadwire system that can readily expand {{in the presence of}} tissue adhesions and can be effectively fixed at a site close to the cochlea to ensure that the electrode array is not displaced during skull growth. In this study, <b>leadwires</b> were implanted in six young animals for a period of five months. During explantation, the mean force � standard deviation required to expand individual leadwire was found to be 12. 5 � 5. 0 g. In order to evaluate the efficacy of leadwire fixation techniques, four fixation procedures were initially developed in human temporal bones and subsequently used to fix <b>leadwires</b> implanted in the temporal bones of eight animals for a period of four months. <b>Leadwires</b> were fixed by platinum wires at the fossa incudis or by platinum wires with a titanium barbed nail at the mastoid. The biomechanical evaluation revealed that the forces required to displace the leadwire from fixation points were 70. 6 � 33. 5 g. Significantly, the forces required to withdraw a chronically implanted electrode array from an animal cochlea were 1. 5 � 0. 4 g. The present results highlight the importance of an effective leadwire fixation technique for paediatric cochlear implants, particularly in preventing the displacement of an electrode array from the cochlea during skull growth.

The development of cochlear implants for use in very young children (1 - 2 years old) will require techniques designed to accommodate temporal bone growth. Previous anatomic {{studies have shown that the}} leadwire of a cochlear implant must be capable of expanding up to 20 mm between the round window and the implanted receiver-stimulator in response to skull growth. In the present study morphologic and biomechanical evaluation of five expandable leadwire designs was conducted following their implantation in young cats. Two helical shaped leadwire designs frequently exhibited extensive fibrous tissue adhesions and broke during long-term implantation. In contrast, thin, flexible Silastic envelopes were effective in minimizing tissue adhesions. Residual V- and Z-shaped <b>leadwires,</b> placed in these envelopes, showed little evidence of fibrous tissue adhesions following implantation periods of up to 2 years. Moreover, these <b>leadwires</b> readily expanded both during the growth of the animal and when biomechanical expansion studies performed at the completion of the implant period. These expandable leadwire designs appear to be appropriate candidates for use in pediatric cochlear implants. Open Acces...|$|E

The bones were dissected as one would perform cochlear implant surgery using a posterior tympanotomy approach. Nineteen anatomical /surgical landmarks with implications for cochlear implant surgery were identified on each bone and the distance between these points measured. The temporal hone {{was found to be}} a complex structure, phylogenetically, anatomically and functionally consisting of four different parts with independent postnatal development. The inner and middle cars were adult size at birth. The external auditory canal and most parts of the temporal hone were subject to significant lateral growth. The size of the pneumatised mastoid increased in all directions. In the facial recess, however, no postnatal growth was observed. Between birth and adulthood an average of 12 mm (SD 5 mm) of growth was seen directly between the sino-dural angle and the round window, the landmarks approximating the Implantation site for the receiver-stimulator and the electrode entry point into the inner car. However, if an electrode <b>leadwire</b> is fixed at a cortical fixation site such as the posterosuperior point of Macewen's triangle, the <b>leadwire</b> would be subject to approximately 20 mm of growth. These results indicate that a paediatric cochlear implant design incorporating an expandable <b>leadwire</b> to accommodate this growth should allow up to 25 mm of <b>leadwire</b> lengthening. The fossa incudis showed no growth relative to the round window and was found to be a convenient fixation site for the electrode array close to the cochlea. From an anatomical and surgical point of view, cochlear implantation in very young children is feasible, provided the electrode array is secured and the design accommodates for controlled <b>leadwire</b> lengthening.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the postnatal growth {{of the temporal bone}} is an important prerequisite for the development of cochlear implantation in very young children. Such information will have an important bearing on both the design of the implant and the surgical procedure. We have measured the postnatal growth of the temporal bone by direct anatomical measurements on 60 cadaver specimens with ages ranging from 2 months to 84 years. Nineteen anatomical landmarks with implications for cochlear implant surgery were identified on each bone and the distance between these points measured. The inner and middle ears were adult size at birth. The external auditory canal and most parts of the temporal bone were subject to significant lateral growth. The size of the pneumatized mastoid increased with age in all directions. Significantly, no postnatal growth was observed in the facial recess.

40|$|A {{thermistor}} is {{an electronic}} component that exhibits a large {{change in resistance}} with a change in its body temperature. The word “thermistor ” is actually a contraction of the words “thermal resistor”. The thermistors that we shall describe herein are ceramic semiconductors and have either large positive {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (PTC devices) or large negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTC devices). Both types of thermistors (PTC and NTC) have definite features and advantages which make them ideal for certain sensor applications. NTC THERMISTORS The NTC thermistors which are discussed herein are composed of metal oxides. The most commonly used oxides are those of manganese, nickel, cobalt, iron, copper and titanium. The fabrication of commercial NTC thermistors uses basic ceramics technology and continues today much as it has for decades. In the basic process, a mixture of two or more metal oxide powders are combined with suitable binders, are formed to a desired geometry, dried, and sintered at an elevated temperature. By varying the types of oxides used, their relative proportions, the sintering atmosphere, and the sintering temperature, a wide range of resistivities and temperature coefficient characteristics can be obtained. Types of NTC Thermistors Commercial NTC thermistors can be classified into two major groups depending upon the method by which electrodes are attached to the ceramic body. Each group may be further subdivided into various types of thermistors where each type is characterized by differences in geometry, packaging and/or processing techniques. The first group consists of bead type thermistors. All of the bead type thermistors have platinum alloy <b>leadwires</b> which are directly sintered into the ceramic body.

40|$|Concerns {{associated}} with cochlear implantation {{in young children}} include intracochlear spread of infection along the electrode array during otitis media, and electrode extraction caused by skull growth post-implantation. New biomaterials were used to seal and secure the electrode at its entry point into the cochlea. Hydroxyapatite was deposited around the outside of an electrode cuff and it bonded well to the surrounding bone of the otic capsule. The electrode cuff accommodated variable insertion depths {{with the help of}} a new, silicone based hydroscopic polymer. Preliminary results, including experimental testing of the device in an animal model of pneumococcal otitis media, indicate protection of the implanted cochlea against the spread of infection.

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{a number of}} safety issues associated with cochlear implantation in both adults and children and confirm that it is safe. The results of these studies may be summarized as follows: 1) The insertion of a free-fit scala tympani array into the human cochlea produces minimal damage to cochlear structures provided insertion is stopped {{at the point of}} first resistance. 2) Chronic intracochlear implantation and electrical stimulation using charge balanced biphasic current pulses does not result in neural degeneration or evoke an adverse tissue reaction within the cochlea. 3) The use of fascia to seal the implanted round window results in an effective barrier to the spread of infection into the cochlea. 4) Temporal bone {{studies have shown that the}} distance between the round window and the fossa incudis remains essentially unchanged from birth. Therefore, the fossa incudis provides a suitable fixation point for the electrode array in young children. This study also showed that the distance from the round window to the implanted receiver-stimulator undergoes significant change in children of up to two years of age. These children would require an expanding <b>leadwire</b> system. 5) Finally, long-term effects of cochlear implant surgery on skull growth have shown that this should not be a problem when implanting very young children.

This version is reproduced with permission from Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery. The growth of the human temporal bone is of practical concern if young children are implanted. It is feared that the normal development {{of the temporal bone}} after implantation may displace the electrode array and jeopardize the success of the device. To evaluate the extent of growth 60 cadaver specimens of all ages were examined by direct anatomical measurements. The bones were dissected by imitating the cochlear implantation surgical procedure in the temporal bone laboratory. 19 anatomical/surgical landmarks with implications for cochlear implant surgery were identified and the distance between them measured. The inner ear and middle ear are adult size at birth. The external auditory canal and most parts of the temporal bone are subject to significant lateral growth. The size of the pneumatised mastoid was found to increase in all directions. In the facial recess however, no postnatal growth could be noted. Between birth and adulthood a considerable amount of growth is to be expected between the sino-dural angle and the round window, the landmarks representing the implantation site for the receiver/stimulator and the electrode entry site respectively. From an anatomical and surgical point of view, cochlear implantation in very young children proved to be feasible, provided the electrode array is secured close to the cochlea and the design accommodates for controlled <b>leadwire</b> lengthening.

This version is reproduced {{with the permission}} of the publisher. Speech processing strategies based on high rate electrical stimulation have been associated with recent improvements of speech perception among cochlear implant users. In the present study we investigated the effects of chronic monopolar stimulation using very high rates (14493 pulses). Under general anaesthesia (ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (3. 8 mg/kg) i. p.) six normal hearing cats were implanted bilaterally with a three channel platinum (Pt) scala tympani electrode array, while a return Pt-electrode was placed outside the bulla. Chronic electrical stimulation using charge-balanced biphasic current pulses was delivered unilaterally via a transcutaneous <b>leadwire</b> connected to a backpack-stimulator for up to 2000 h. The animals hearing status was periodically monitored using acoustically evoked compound action potentials (CAP's) and brainstem responses (ABR's). In addition the electrically evoked ABR (EABR) was also recorded to ensure that the chronic stimulus was above threshold. Stimulus current and electrode voltage waveforms were monitored twice daily and access resistance (Ra) and electrode impedance (Zc) calculated. ABR and CAP thresholds were elevated immediately following implantation, but generally showed evidence of partial recovery (0 - 40 dB). Further deterioration of thresholds on the stimulated side (10 - 30 dB) was subsequently observed, while control-thresholds remained more stable. Ra (1. 3 - 1. 8 kΩ) and Zc (2. 2 - 3. 8 Ω) typically increased in the first few weeks of electrical stimulation up to Ra: 5. 6 kΩ and Zc: 8. 1 kΩ, before decreasing slightly to a constant plateau. These initial results indicate changes in the electrode-tissue interface and tissue growth within the cochlea. They also indicate that chronic stimulation at these high rates may decrease residual hearing. 27 - 30 JanuaryOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|Pneumococcal {{otitis media}} is most {{frequent}} {{in young children}} and {{is a matter of}} concern in cochlear implantation. In the course of the 'implantation surgery the physiological barrier between the middle ear and inner ear is broken down by incising the round window membrane or by fenestration of the cochlear wall. It is feared that the insertion of an electrode array into the scala tympani could provide a pathway for microorganisms and toxins to enter the cochlea, resulting in labyrinthitis. To assess the actual risk of, secondary inner ear infection post implantation we developed a cat animal model of otitis media. In addition we examined the, effectiveness of different sealing strategies compared to the alternative of leaving the electrode entry point unprotected. For sealing of the cochlea fibrous tissue or gelatine foam was wrapped around the electrode in the round window niche. 22 kittens (44 ears) were used for this study 32, ears were implanted at 2 months of age, and all 44 ears were inoculated after 2 months with a broth of, streptococcus pneumoniae and the animals sacrificed one week later. The bullae of the animals were swabbed and the cochleas processed and examined under light microscopy. Histological analysis of the cochleas showed,the� highest incidence (45 %) of labyrinthine spread of infection in the unimplanted control group. Suppurative or serous labyrinthitis was found in only one third (33. 3 %) of the implanted and unsealed cochleas. In contrast only one of 16 sealed cochleas, (6. 2 %) showed labyrinthine signs of acute inflammation. Experimental pneumococcal otitis media could be reliably established in all animals and proved to be a valuable animal model for the testing of the intracochlear spread of infection. We conclude that a cochlear implant electrode inserted via the round window does not increase the risk of tympanogenic abyrinthitis. Our results indicate that grafting of the electrode entry point results in significant protection of the inner ear against labyrinthine spread of ototis media along the <b>leadwire</b> of the cochlear implant. 24 - 27 SeptemberOpen Acces...|$|R

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. Electrical stimulation using high surface area (HiQ) platinum (Pt) electrodes exhibit a lower electrode impedance, polarisation and direct current (DC) in vitro compared with standard (ST) Pt electrodes of the same geometric size. In the present study we investigated whether HiQ electrodes maintain these advantages in vivo. This could be important for the development of new arrays with an increased number of smaller electrodes. Under general anaesthesia (Ketamine 20 mg/kg and Xylazine 4 mg/kg i. p.) five normal hearing cats were implanted bilaterally with a two-channel Pt scala tympani electrode array (4 HiQ, I ST array). Chronic electrical stimulation using charge balanced biphasic current pulses was delivered unilaterally via a transcutaneous <b>leadwire</b> connected to a backpack-stimulator for periods of up to 2400 hours. DC, stimulus current and electrode voltage waveforms were monitored twice daily and access resistance (Ra), electrode impedance (Zc) and polarisation (Zc-Ra) calculated (kΩ). Mean HiQ data were compared to ST data using Students t-test (*=p< 0. 05, **=p< 0. 001). Immediately following implantation both HiQ and ST-electrodes exhibited low impedance values (Ra: 1. 06 vs 1. 00, Zc: 1. 24 vs 2. 12 *, and Zc-Ra: 0. 18 vs 1. 08 **). Subsequently impedance increased, largely due to a rise in Ra (5. 35 vs 6. 8 : Zc: 6. 96 vs 9. 80, and Zc-Ra: 1. 61 vs 3. 00 *). At the end of the experiment the array was explanted and tested in saline (Ra: 0. 63 vs 0. 74 *, Zc: 0. 73 vs 1. 90 **, Zc-Ra: 0. 10 vs 1. 16 **). These initial results suggests that intracochlear tissue growth increased the access resistance of both electrode designs. However, HiQ electrodes maintained not only a significantly lower polarisation, they also showed a lower average residual DC (23 vs 130 nA**) throughout the experiment. 31 January - 3 FebruaryOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|Galfenol has the {{potential}} to transform the smart materials industry by allowing for the development of multifunctional, load-bearing devices. One of the primary technical challenges faced by this development is the very limited experimental data on Galfenol's frequency-dependent response to dynamic stress, which is critically important for the design of such devices. This report details a novel and precise characterization of the constitutive behavior of polycrystalline Galfenol (Fe 81. 6 Ga 18. 4) under quasi-static (1 Hz) and dynamic (4 to 1000 Hz) stress loadings. Mechanical loads are applied using a high-frequency load frame. Quasi-static minor and major hysteresis loop measurements of magnetic flux density and strain are presented for constant electromagnet currents (0 to 1. 1 A) and constant magnetic fields 0 to 14 kA/m (0 to 180 Oe). The dynamic stress amplitude for minor and major loops is 2. 88 and 31. 4 MPa (418 and 4550 psi), respectively. Quasi-static material properties closely match published values for similar Galfenol materials. Quasi-static actuation responses are also measured and compared to quasi-static sensing responses; the high degree of reversibility seen in the comparison is consistent with published measurements and modeling results. Dynamic major and minor loops are measured for dynamic stresses up to 31 MPa (4496 psi) and 1 kHz, and the bias condition resulting in maximum, quasi-static sensitivity. Eddy current effects are quantified by considering solid and laminated Galfenol rods. Three key sources of error in the dynamic measurements are accounted for: (1) electromagnetic noise in strain signals due to Galfenol's magnetic response, (2) error in load signals due to the inertial force of fixturing, and (3) phase misalignment between signals due to conditioning electronics. For dynamic characterization, strain error is kept below 1. 2 percent of full scale by wiring two collocated gauges in series (noise cancellation) and through <b>leadwire</b> weaving. Inertial force error is kept below 0. 41 percent by measuring the dynamic force in the specimen using a nearly collocated piezoelectric load washer. The phase response of all conditioning electronics is explicitly measured and corrected for. In general, as frequency is increased, the sensing response becomes more linear because of an increase in eddy currents. As frequency increases above approximately 100 Hz, the elbow in the strain-versus-stress response disappears as the active (soft) regime stiffens toward the passive (hard) regime. Under constant-field conditions, the loss factors of the solid rod peak between 200 and 600 Hz, rather than exhibiting a monotonic increase. Compared to the solid rod, the laminated rod exhibits much slower increases in hysteresis with frequency, and its quasi-static behavior extends to higher frequencies. The elastic modulus of the laminated rod decreases between 100 and 300 Hz; this trend is currently unexplained...|$|R
