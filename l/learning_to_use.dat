5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote that {{boys and girls}} learning to read numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the abacus and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic.|$|E

Burrows initially oversaw the transition to armour until he returned to New Zealand on furlough in May 1943 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel J. W. McKergow.|$|E

25|$|A {{case study}} of {{dialogue}} journal writing with a young gifted child {{points out that the}} learning styles of gifted children (rapid development, open exploration, self-motivated, dislike of rote drills) are uniquely compatible with the dynamic communication that is possible in dialogue journals.

25|$|Dreamscape was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} three months by George Lippert, who also co-wrote the game's script and voiced all male characters. Carol Mertz and Lippert's son Zane provided the voices for all other characters. Lippert designed the game around a 3D cabin model he made while <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Unreal Engine. While the game was initially set to be released in April 2011, the release date was pushed back two months in order to fix a memory bug that prevented it from running on certain devices.|$|E
25|$|Dreamscape {{was mostly}} {{developed}} by George Lippert, {{who is the}} CEO of Speedbump Studies. Lippert acted as the game's sole programmer, and also provided the voice for all male characters. He also co-wrote the game's script alongside Jane Kalmes. Lippert designed the game around a 3D cabin model he made while <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Unreal Engine in January 2011. Development began the same month, and was finished by April the same year. All voice acting was recording using iPhones, occasionally while in a closet. Carol Mertz, in association with Rampant Interactive, provided the voices of Amelia and the Scarecrow Guide. Lippert's eight-year-old son Zane, with some digital assistance, provided the voice of young Amelia. Isaias Garcia composed and performed the musical score.|$|E

25|$|During Advanced Skills Training Combat Controllers (along with PJs and SOWT) attend {{two more}} {{advanced}} courses. Army Military Free Fall Parachutist School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona for five weeks. The course instructs free fall parachuting procedures. It also provides wind tunnel training, in-air instruction focusing on student stability, aerial maneuvers, air sense, parachute opening procedures and parachute canopy control. They also attend Air Force Combat Diver School which is hosted at the Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida. Combat Diver School is six weeks long. After completion of Combat Diver School trainees become combat divers, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> scuba and closed circuit diving equipment to covertly infiltrate denied areas. The course provides training to depths of 130feet, stressing development of maximum underwater mobility under various operating conditions. A class of CCTs and PJs at the Air Force Combat Diver School {{was covered by}} Discovery Channel's program Surviving the Cut during season two, which originally aired 25 July 2011.|$|E
25|$|Motor {{planning}} {{is an important}} component of becoming a fluent semantic compaction user. Icon sequencing should be the initial focus of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> semantic compaction devices. A beginner needs to be fluent in a given icon set before progressing to a more advanced level. The Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) strategy aids individuals in developing motor plans for sequencing icons for messages. Minspeak relies upon the motor-based learning principles that when motor patterns are repeated, these processes become automatic and simplified. Common automated motor patterns include typing on a keyboard without looking, riding a bicycle, or swallowing food and drink. Increased automaticity and simplification with the production of language allows experienced Minspeak users to delegate cognitive attention to their intended message (language) instead of to the formulation of their message. This allows users to focus on communicating a specific message rather than focus on how to build the message by searching for icons across different pages and or screens. The use of LAMP strategies has been associated with increased natural expression through unique combinations of words in non-verbal children with autism. Ideally, once the system of Minspeak is mastered, productions of communication should take less time and effort across communication contexts.|$|E

Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not really changed at all other than <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a cell phone. Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less-perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom girls can more easily relate to– a better role model than the old Nancy because she can actually be emulated, rather than a [...] "prissy automaton of perfection." ...|$|E
