In one study, researchers surveyed 140 students at 89 different higher education institutions and discovered that students were 9 times more likely to report that they had mastered learning the course objectives when First Principles of Instruction were used and when they spent ample time and effort studying. Another study observed award-winning instructors at an institute of higher education and found that they used some or all of First Principles of Instruction in their teaching strategies, thereby linking acclaimed instructors with the principles. In another study, researchers compared the effectiveness of instruction using First Principles of Instruction with more traditional instruction and found that students in the First Principles group learned significantly more and finished learning tasks significantly faster. Another study found that biology students <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>instruction</b> using First Principles of Instruction had significantly increased confidence in their ability to solve similar problems in the future, compared to other learners.|$|E

In particular, an intelligent robotic agent {{should not have}} to be reprogrammed for each of the various tasks it may face during the course of its lifetime.

Therefore, a powerful notion is that of an instructible agent, one which is able to receive task-level instructions and advice from a human advisor. An agent must do more than simply memorize the instructions it is given (this would amount to programming).

An open-ended geometric-analogies test was administered eight times during a period of six months to eighty children in Grades 1 and 2 (six- to eight-year-olds). Strong evidence for bimodality was found in the distribution of the test scores and weaker evidence for inaccessibility. In the perfor-mance curves of the transitional subjects sudden jumps were demonstrated. Further-more, the transitional subjects displayed a temporary increase of inconsistent solution behavior and solution time near the sudden jump.

Our survey of ML covers both levels of Neural Network learning and Symbolic learning. In symbolic process learning, five types of learning and their applications are discussed: rote learning, <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>instruction,</b> learning from analogy, learning from examples, and learning from observation and discovery. The Reliability Analysis systems (RAs) presented in this thesis are mainly designed for maintaining plant safety supported by two functions: risk analysis function, i. e., failure mode effect analysis (FMEA); and diagnosis function, i. e., real-time fault location (RTFL). Three approaches have been discussed in creating the RAs. According to the result of our survey, we suggest currently the best design of RAs is to embed model-based RAs, i. e., MORA (as software) in a neural network based computer system (as hardware). However, there are still some improvement which can be made through the applications of Machine Learning. By implanting the 'learning element', the MORA will become learning MORA (La MORA) system, a learning Reliability Analysis system with the power of automatic knowledge acquisition and inconsistency checking, and more.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a functional model of learning from teaching that, {{in contrast to}} structural models of schemata and knowledge representation, focuses on the neural and cognitive processes that learners use to generate meaning and understanding from instruction. Wittrock's model of generative learning (Wittrock, 1974 a, 1990) consists of four major processes: (a) attention, (b) motivation, (c) knowledge and preconceptions, and (d) gener-ation. Each of these processes involves generative brain functions studied in neural research and generative cognitive functions studied in knourledge-acquisition research. In this model of generative learning, the brain is a model builder. It does not transform input into output. Instead, it actively controls the processes of generating meaning and plans of action that make sense of experience and that respond to perceived realities. Within this framework, teaching becomes the process of leading learners to use their generative processes to construct meanings and plans of action. The model of generative learning and teaching (Wittrock, 1990, 19911) is a functional model of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>instruction</b> that builds upon knowledge about the processes {{of the brain and}} upon cognitive research on compre-hension, knowledge acquisition, attention, motivation, and transfer. I first reported the model and its underlying empirical research in 1974 (Wittrock, 1974 b). That beginning led to a line of experiments that examined and tested implications of the model (e. g., Wittrock & Carter, 1975; Wittrock, 1990).

Previous {{studies have shown that}} anxiety specific to language learning situations is negatively associated with measures of second language achievement.;The three studies that make up this dissertation are concerned with providing answers to two main issues that have been raised in the literature on language anxiety. The first concerns the relation of language anxiety to various indices of attitudes and motivation that have been implicated in second language learning. The results of Study 1 support the conclusion that language anxiety is distinct from attitudes and motivation. Further analyses show that language anxiety is significantly negatively correlated with second language performance measures that rely on a broad base of language skills (e. g. course grades) and relatively specific tasks as well (e. g. vocabulary recall).;The second issue concerns the more specific cognitive effects of language anxiety. In order to examine effects of language anxiety on the cognitive activities that underlie language learning, a model of the effects of anxiety on <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>instruction</b> (Tobias, 1986) is used in two additional studies. The model separates language learning into three overlapping stages, concerned with the exposure (Input stage), comprehension (Processing stage), and production of the second language (Output stage). Study 2 employs scales designed to measure anxiety at each of the three stages separately. Results show that anxiety at each of the stages of processing is correlated with performance at that stage. Study 3 attempted to induce anxiety at each of the stages using a video camera. Results showed that when the camera was associated with increased anxiety, performance at all three stages was impaired, but when the camera failed to arouse anxiety, performance was not impaired. Results are discussed in terms of their implication for the conceptualization of language anxiety, its measurement, and potential actions to remedy its negative effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> situated, interactive tutorial in-struction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a exible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this ex-ibility, however, the agent {{must be able to}} learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other do-main knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of exible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation spec-i ed in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can <b>learn,</b> <b>from</b> <b>instructions,</b> each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to current intelligent systems, {{which must be}} laboriously programmed for each task they are meant to perform, instructable agents can be taught new tasks and associated knowledge. This thesis presents a general theory of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> tutorial <b>instruction</b> and its use to produce an instructable agent. Tutorial instruction is a particularly powerful form of instruction, because it allows the instructor to communicate whatever kind of knowledge a student needs at whatever point it is needed. To exploit this broad flexibility, however, a tutorable agent must support {{a full range of}} interaction with its instructor to learn a full range of knowledge. Thus, unlike most machine learning tasks, which target deep learning of a single kind of knowledge from a single kind of input, tutorability requires a breadth of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> a broad range of instructional interactions. The theory of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> tutorial <b>instruction</b> presented here has two parts. First, a computational model of an intelligent agent, the problem space computational model, indicates the types of knowledge that determine an agent's performance, and thus, that should be acquirable via instruction. Second, a learning technique, called situated explanation specifies how the agent <b>learns</b> general knowledge <b>from</b> <b>instruction.</b> The theory is embodied by an implemented agent, Instructo-Soar, built within the Soar architecture. Instructo-Soar is able to learn hierarchies of completely new tasks, to extend task knowledge to apply in new situations, and in fact to acquire every type of knowledge it uses during task performance - control knowledge, knowledge of operators' effects, state inferences, etc. - from interactive natural language instructions. This variety of learning occurs by applying the situated explanation technique to a variety of instructional interactions involving a variety of types of instructions (commands, statements, conditionals, etc.). By taking seriously the requirements of flexible tutorial instruction, Instructo-Soar demonstrates a breadth of interaction and learning capabilities that goes beyond previous instructable systems, such as learning apprentice systems. Instructo-Soar's techniques could form the basis for future 'instructable technologies' that come equipped with basic capabilities, and can be taught by novice users to perform any number of desired tasks...|$|R

Martin (1993) hypothesized that episodic memories of students mediate learning from instructional interventions because of the personal associations carried with them. The present research investigated the role of episodic memories of Grade 6 students in mathematics instruction, especially {{with respect to the}} possible mediation of student learning. Individual differences in learning style, attitude toward learning, and knowledge were investigated as possible factors that affect recall of episodic memories from classroom instruction. Study 1 assessed the suitability of two learning style inventories for use with a Grade 6 sample. The Individual Differences Questionnaire was found to be a good measure for verbal/imaginal encoding, and the Inventory of Learning Processes was found to be an adequate measure of learning style related to theories of information processing. In Study 2, students completed an attitude toward mathematics inventory, tests of prior knowledge and achievement, and were required to list their episodic memories for classroom instruction. Initial support for the mediational hypothesis was not seen in Study 2. Although expected, encoding preference did not affect scores on the posttests. Instruction may not have varied enough to allow students with either preference to benefit. As a result, Study 3 manipulated the amount of imagery used during instruction to determine if such a manipulation affected recall of information presented. Students completed the same battery of tests as in Study 2 in a controlled setting with instruction in mathematics presented via videotape. Students who preferred to encode verbally did better on posttests of achievement in the verbal condition. Students who preferred to encode imaginally recalled more episodic memories in the imaginal condition. Although the predicted main and interaction effects of imagery were not significant, limited support for the mediational hypothesis was found {{in the form of a}} correlation between recall of instructionally relevant episodes and score on the posttest. Deep processors tended to perform well on the posttests and elaborative processors tended to perform poorly.

40|$|Already in the 80 s, Winne (1982) {{argued that}} {{research}} on <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>instruction</b> is mostly {{focused on the}} instructional stimuli as such and its effects on learning assuming that all learners process the stimuli as intended. Students actual processing of the instructional stimuli remains, he argued, a black box that is largely undocumented within research but needs more consideration. Research that investigates students tool-use within technology-enhanced learning environments opens Winnes black box and stresses its importance. In this respect, tools are defined as all those instructional (technology-supported or face-to-face) stimuli that are deliberately integrated into or added to the learning tasks and learning content in view of fostering students learning. Although these tools provide, theoretically, learning support, evidence suggests that {{only a minority of}} students profits from this learning support. Particularly, throughout multiple studies it was revealed that students tool-use is on average suboptimal i. e., on average tools are neglected or used in other ways as intended which had in most studies significant performance effects. In terms of Winnes (1982) black box, current tool-use evidence implies that the learning effectiveness of a learning environment depends on students adaptive tool-use or using tools in line with the learning task requirements. Nevertheless, current tool-use evidence indicates that this black box problem cannot be minimized since only a minority of students used the available tools adaptively. Consequently, more research on students adaptive tool-use seems necessary from an instructional design perspective. Current tool-use evidence is however mainly retrieved in controlled, technology-enhanced, learning environments that were uniquely designed for the research purpose. These controlled learning environments differ inherently from realistic, technology-enhanced learning environments in terms of tool-set, learning tasks and learning episode. As a consequence, the ecological validity of current tool-use evidence can be questioned. The current dissertation addressed this ecological validity and investigated students tool-use throughout an ecological technology-enhanced learning environment. As an introduction (cf. chapter 1), the dissertation hypothesized on a model of adaptive tool-use and its main components based on an analysis of the existing tool-use research and relevant theoretical frameworks i. e., Winnes (1982) cognitive conditions, Perkins (1985) framework and Nelson Le Galls (1985) and Newmans (1994) help-seeking model. In this respect, tool-use is conceptualized as a self-regulated strategy wherein students can regulate (a) the tools that they select (tool-diversity), (b) the way these tools are used (tool-activeness) and (c) the moment these tools are selected within the learning episode (tool-consistency). Adaptive tool-use on the other hand was conceptualized as (a) selecting those tools that are functional for the learning task at hand (tool-diversity), (b) use these tools as intended by the instructional designer (tool-activeness) and (c) reflect and monitor this tool-choice when learning tasks change accordingly (tool-consistency). Throughout three studies, the empirical validity of this model was investigated. The first study (cf. chapter 2) that was executed was a literature review that explored current tool-use evidence within content management supported courses i. e., the type of learning environment that was used throughout the PhD. Particularly, the literature review presented an overview over the existing research on students tool-use within CMS supported courses and related the main findings to our tool-use model. With respect to the latter, existing evidence was analyzed in relation to (a) students agency in tool-use, (b) performance effects of tool-use and (c) influencing student variables. The second study was an empirical study that aimed to explore the importance of the three components of adaptive tool-use i. e., diversity, activeness and consistency. Particularly, it was explored within chapter 3 whether student differences in tool-use reflect different tool-use patterns that mark differences in (a) students tool-diversity and (b) students tool-activeness. Additionally, it was investigated whether these differences affected students learning significantly and are hence important to consider. Chapter 4 explored whether students differed significantly in the moment tools were accessed (tool-consistency) and whether these temporal differences influenced students performance as well. The final empirical study was mainly focused on (1) replicating the tool-use patterns of the previous study with a new student group, (2) investigating the conditional factors for students tool-use and (3) investigating the importance of students tool-diversity, tool-activeness and tool-consistency in one analysis. The different findings of these two empirical studies are related {{to each other and to}} our tool-use model in the conclusion. Additionally, new research opportunities are addressed that come out of these findings. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Online digital environments are {{inviting}} {{all of us}} {{to reject}} the role of spectatorship and to participate actively in our own learning write Erica McWilliam and Norman Jackson GO TO almost any Australian university campus and you will find at least one big lecture theatre. Whether built last year or a century ago, lecture theatres have a predictable design: hundreds of tiered seats arranged so that hundreds of students can be focused fairly and squarely on a singular podium where a singular figure ? a lecturer ? gives a lecture. We continue to insist on the term lecturer as the appropriate professional title for an academic below the rank of professor or associate professor. Lectures, like sermons, were once part and parcel of a society in which elites were in the know and the great unwashed were presumed ignorant. Students, as seekers after knowledge, sat at the feet, literally and metaphorically, of the great man. Feet-sitting is not the predilection of 21 st-century students. Whether we call them gen C, gen Y or gen Z, the net generation, millennials, digital natives, the online generation or the gamer generation, today?s young people have multiple ways of informing themselves, and being lectured to is unlikely to be high on their list of preferences. According to a recent US research study, young gamers do not tolerate front-end instruction. They jump over instruction manuals, learning to use a meta-map or to operate without one, rather than <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> <b>instruction</b> from outside the subculture. Hands-on trial and error is the dominant learning mode. Not all university students are gamers and many are not young. However, there is a message here that is bringing content delivery through lecturing into collision with the learning preferences of today 2 ̆ 7 s students. Online digital environments are inviting {{all of us to}} reject the role of spectatorship and to participate actively in our own learning. In the terms used by Axel Bruns, a senior lecturer in the Queensland University of Technology?s creative industries faculty, we are all being enabled to become ?prod-users? ? both producers and users of knowledge ? not just passive consumers of expert knowledge that comes from above. The pedagogical geometry is horizontal, not vertical. So what are we to do with our big, expensive lecture theatres? After all, a 400 to one student-teacher ratio is a cheap pedagogical option, even if it is becoming a less effective one for 21 st century learning. Moreover, the lecture?tutorial combination is a form of pedagogical work with which administrators, academics and students are all comfortably familiar. Familiarity, as we know, breeds contempt, and {{there is no doubt that}} students express this contempt when they vote with their feet to avoid lectures. One reason they give for this is the nature of the material presented. Frequently, it comes straight out of textbooks or lecture notes, giving students little incentive to attend. That the traditional presentation is nearly always delivered as a monologue in front of a passive audience compounds the problem. Only exceptional lecturers are capable of holding students? attention for an entire lecture period. It is even more difficult to provide an adequate opportunity for students to think critically about the arguments and propositions being developed. Consequently, lectures simply reinforce students? feelings that the most important step in mastering the material is memorising a zoo of apparently unrelated examples. Lecturing leaves it to them to join the dots. Little wonder that, after a week or two, our lecture theatre cohort has so often dwindled to a few hardy, compliant souls, who may attend more out of anxiety about missing something than any desire to engage in meaningful learning. We do not have to lock up our lecture theatres. But we do have to stop using them to give lectures. The best alternatives do not reside in simply podcasting lectures or adding more dot-points to the PowerPoint slides that students can access on the subject website. They reside in new forms of pedagogical engagement that invite prod-user participation rather than passive consumption. Here are two approaches being trialled in the US and Britain. Peer instruction is a technique developed by Harvard physicist Eric Mazur. Mazur realised that, despite getting good feedback from his students, their test results were poorer than they should be. To address this issue, he devised peer instruction. Instead of just listening, students respond continually to conceptual questions, called ConcepTests, designed to expose common difficulties in understanding the material. The students are given one to two minutes to think about the question and formulate their own answers; they then spend two to three minutes discussing their answers in groups of three to four, attempting to reach consensus on the correct answer. The teacher then can check understandings through a show of hands. The process can be significantly enhanced through the use of an audience response system (voting system or clickers) that provides excellent feedback to teacher and students on levels of understanding. This is not a difficult technique to implement. Two levels of introductory physics have been taught at Harvard using this strategy and students made significant gains in conceptual understanding (as measured by standardised tests) as well as gaining problem-solving skills comparable with those acquired in traditionally taught classes. Indeed, Mazur?s university, after seeing video footage of this technique, decided to introduce his voting systems and peer discussion methods. Following successful piloting, many lecturers are adopting the approach. Dozens of instructors at other institutions have implemented peer instruction with their own students and found similar results. Inquiry-based learning is another approach to make lecture sessions more engaging. George Allan of the University of Portsmouth in Britain has developed a simple but effective way of moving a lecture program into a more engaging social process. Following a more traditional (but shortened) input from the lecturer, the students do not simply depart. The last ten to fifteen minutes are spent identifying a topic to be investigated before the next lecture session, thus motivating students to engage in peer-to-peer inquiry. The first fifteen minutes of the next session are spent engaging students in small group discussion (teams of three in a large lecture theatre) and the main part of the lecture is spent drawing from the student inquiries the main points they have found, correcting misunderstandings and, if possible, adding any important omissions. This makes for a much more participative culture than the traditional offerings of solitary, unconnected instruction. The approach does not require any rewriting of lecture notes. But the distribution of handouts differs. Students have to make inquiries and find the subject matter instead of being told the facts in a lecture or handout. Although some lecturers express anxiety about whether and how they will cover the syllabus, the students go about the business of getting through it and more. They can move much faster without waiting for the content delivery to come from the podium. This approach not only provides opportunities for students to participate in their own constructive thinking but it leads to better learning, which in turn leads to improved assessment results in exams and in coursework assignments. Britain?s University of Surrey is in the early stages of introducing this technique. More than 25 lecturers in four faculties participated in a workshop to introduce the design idea and each is adapting a module or several sessions in the module to teach this way in the northern autumn. The results will be shared in a conference at the end of the year. Students need to be engaged and monologic lectures are unlikely to do this. However, neither should we expect digital tools to provide pedagogical solutions in and of themselves. Moving everything online will not build prod-user capacity if the pedagogy remains subject-centred, expert-driven, and transmissive. We can 2 ̆ 7 t redesign our learning spaces overnight but we can make them more participatory and engaging with some simple technology adaptations and some practical changes to our large group teaching practices. ?
