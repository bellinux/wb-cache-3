Among these tasks the very common ones are association rule mining, classification and clustering. Clustering is gaining its popularity as efficient classifier.

50|$|A {{collimator}} is {{a device}} that narrows a beam of particles or waves.

50|$|During a checkride, an {{examiner}} {{takes on}} a role more {{like that of a}} passenger rather than an instructor. That is, it's the examiner's job to observe that the candidate demonstrates good decision-making skills, rather than to teach or to act as a crewmember, although an examiner is likely to offer advice during the ride if so inclined. The examiner usually does not touch any of the aircraft controls unless necessary to maintain the safety of the flight — in which case the candidate usually fails the examination instantly, except for the part when the examiner acts as a safety pilot during operations with a view <b>limiting</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

50|$|IMC exists when weather {{conditions}} are below those prescribed for Visual Flight Rules (VFR). VFR minimums are covered under FAR Part 91.155. Typically, IMC {{means you can}} not maintain adequate separation from clouds or low in-flight visibility exists. Simulated IMC conditions are accomplished by a pilot wearing a view <b>limiting</b> <b>device</b> while operating the controls of an aircraft. The most common view limiting devices are plastic visor hoods and foggles. Both devices block seeing outside the cockpit while the wearer's head is in a normal forward-facing position. Plastic visors fold over the crown of the pilot's head while foggles are glasses that only allow the bottom portion of the lenses to be transparent.|$|E
50|$|For {{industrial}} radiography using gamma radiation {{sources such as}} iridium-192 or cobalt-60, a collimator (beam <b>limiting</b> <b>device)</b> allows the radiographer to control the exposure of radiation to expose a film and create a radiograph, to inspect materials for defects. A collimator in this instance is most commonly made of tungsten, and is rated according to how many half value layers it contains, i.e., how many times it reduces undesirable radiation by half. For instance, the thinnest walls {{on the sides of}} a 4 HVL tungsten collimator 0.52 in thick will reduce the intensity of radiation passing through them by 88.5%. The shape of these collimators allows emitted radiation to travel freely toward the specimen and the x-ray film, while blocking most of the radiation that is emitted in undesirable directions such as toward workers.|$|E

Perhaps the answer {{may lie in the}} fact that in common-purposes cases (such as Goosen) the courts have specifically followed an approach which imputes the act of the perpetrator to the other participants in the common purpose, irrespective of whether the latter have contributed causally to the unlawful consequence or not. Their active participation in the common purpose coupled with the requisite guilty mind or fault is enough—either factual or legal causation between their association and the unlawful consequence is not required. The theory of mistake as regards the causal sequence, which is an aspect of mens rea, may thus be an important <b>limiting</b> <b>device</b> in cases of common-purpose liability, excluding liability for murder where death was foreseen by the participants in a common purpose, but death in fact occurred in an unexpected, or even bizarre, way.|$|E
