It is the second busiest port in Ireland and offers all six {{shipping}} modes i.e. <b>Lift-on</b> <b>Lift-off,</b> Roll-on Roll-off, Liquid Bulk, Dry Bulk, Break Bulk and Cruise.

40|$|LO-LO (<b>Lift-on,</b> <b>lift-off)</b> is a vernacular {{term used}} in the cargo /shipping {{industry}} to describe the method by which quay cranes are used to load and unload freight ships. This exhibition of contemporary art produced by Wintec Media Arts staff explores the relationship between New Zealand's primary industries and their international trade relationships and export methods used to distribute commodities to China. The works focus on various aspects of commodity production and distribution networks. These themes are responded to by the various artists using a diversity of media and conventions which range through abstract and figurative painting, kinetic sculptural, video and sound composition to documentary and allegorical photography.

40|$|Today, freight volumes {{on roads}} {{have gone up}} to a level {{that there is a}} need for {{alternative}} transport modes. Short Sea Shipping (SSS) is one alternative with a potential that can help reduce the high traffic on roads. Most SSS systems use vessels whereby cargo is rolled on and off using a ramp with very small capacities usually less than 500 TEU, but with increasing cargo traffic, it is not clear if such solutions will be efficient. For ports involved in SSS to meet up this new wave of change, the challenge to make appropriate investments and analysis tools is important. The type of vessel suitable for a SSS operation (such as roll-on roll-off (RoRo), <b>lift-on</b> <b>lift-off</b> (LoLo) etc) has been addressed in this thesis based on their compatibility and cost effectiveness with the terminal equipments. The purpose of this study is to develop an optimization model that can be incorporated into a Computer Decision Support System (DSS) for selecting equipments including ships at a strategic level for investments in handling unitised cargo at port terminals in the context of Short Sea Shipping (SSS). The main contribution of the thesis is the application of computer science techniques in the domain of strategic decision making related to the configuration of complex systems (e. g. interrelationships between ships and equipments) with choices of handling equipment. From modelling the selection of port terminal equipments for SSS, we realised that while integer linear programming is a promising approach for studying such systems, it remains a challenge to handle complex issues in depth especially in relation to the quay crane due to interdependencies between time, cost and capacity of equipments. Model results indicates that a LoLo vessel with a capacity between (500 and 1000 TEU) capable of completing a SSS voyage such that handling is done within 48 hours will be less costly than a RoRo that does it with multiple voyages or one voyage each for multiple RoRo vessels for TEU volumes greater than 1000. But RoRo vessels remain useful for trailers that cannot be transported by LoLo vessels. containers. Lotsgatan 14 374 35, Karlshamn Mobile: 0046 768 85 67 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is that of {{analysing}} the available sources of information for the Italian roll‐on roll‐off and underlining {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this data. As a matter of fact in the Short Sea Shipping the roll‐on roll‐off transport represents an important leg of the intermodal maritime combined transport. For this reason and considering the accessibility to the data made possible by the Information Communication Technologies, the analysis of this mode of transport should be simple, yet in reality it is not so. Actually the chosen sector does not always register the availability and quality of information that is present for other types of transport (such as container <b>lift‐on</b> <b>lift‐off</b> or cruises). Even though the roll‐on roll‐off transport is the core of the Motorways of the Sea, the historical series for the Italian market that can be consulted often present a certain amount of gaps. In fact, if on the one hand the official statistics published periodically by the Port Authorities contain information on the volume of annually handled goods, on the other, this same elaborations are not always comprehensive (especially in less structured ports) on the most significant features of the traffic flows, such as the origin and destination of the maritime relations. To solve this problem, it is possible to use some analysis carried out at central level (by the Italian Institute of Statistics and Eurostat) that could be useful to overcome the existing gaps, yet the chosen measure units differ from that of the Port Authorities. Here lies the main difficulty of reaching a sufficiently detailed description of the market that should support the choices of the operators but in particular the formulation of actions aimed at fostering modal shift from road to sea. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 concerns the introduction and methodological aspects; Section 2 addresses the Italian scenario and defines the sample (most important ports regarding Italian roll-on roll‐off market); Section 3 Takes into account the main relations of Short Sea Shipping and it focuses the analysis on some features of the traffic flows in the chosen ports. Section 4 contains some final considerations regarding the exploitation of the sources of information and the improvement of the roadsea combined transport's appeal...|$|E
