50|$|The Crescent-marked <b>lily</b> <b>aphid</b> or Mottled arum aphid, (Neomyzus circumflexus), {{also known}} as Aulacorthum circumflexum, is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants. It is also known to transmit plant viruses as well.|$|E
40|$|The water <b>lily</b> <b>aphid</b> Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae (L.) (Homoptera:Aphididae) {{is one of}} the {{potential}} pests of the genus Azolla Lam., an agronomically important aquatic fern used as green manure and as fodder. In this paper its life and fertility table was established by observing 70 virginoparous females individually from birth to death on Azolla microphylla Kaulf. under constant abiotic conditions. A rather short average development time of 6. 1 days was observed. The maximum length of survival recorded was 24 days, and a linear relationship was found between age and survival. The fecundity averaged 36. 8 larvae/female, but this appeared to be an age-specific parameter. Life table computation showed a high intrinsic rate of increase (0. 315 days(- 1)), meaning that theoretical populations could double every 2. 2 days...|$|E
40|$|The least {{expensive}} method for controlling the water <b>lily</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae (Homoptera: Aphididae), {{would be to}} select a more resistant variety of Azolla. Therefore the susceptibility of 6 species of Azolla totalling 12 forms, was analysed {{by the use of}} aphid survival and cumulative fecundity. For each form, a minimum of 50 to 140 virginoparous females were followed individually from birth to death. Six forms of three species appeared to be totally resistant, as a mortality rate of 100 % was recorded after 4 days; thus insects were unable to reach adulthood. For one form, adults were obtained but died within 11 days and fecundity was poor. The other five forms were more susceptible, and significant differences were found in the total number of offspring after one generation. These results show differences in susceptibility between different forms of Azolla, and thus strongly support the possibility of cultivating more resistant varieties...|$|E
