The {{declaration}} stated that when Fowler had [...] "directed" [...] the plaintiff to accompany the mutton to market [...] "in" [...] the van, Fowler was under a duty [...] "to use due and proper care that said van should be in a proper state of repair" [...] and [...] "not be overloaded, and that the plaintiff should be safely and securely carried thereby." [...] As a result of Fowler having breached this duty, the van had broken down and the plaintiff was harmed. No allegation was made as to negligent actions or omissions, nor of the existence or violation of a duty towards Charles Priestley by anyone in Fowler's employ.|$|E
60|$|Yes, it was {{the same}} Pendennis, and time had brought to him, as to the rest of us, its {{ordinary}} consequences, consolations, developments. We alter very little. When we talk of this man or that woman being no longer the same person whom we remember in youth, and remark (of course to deplore) changes in our friends, we don't, perhaps, calculate that circumstance only brings out the <b>latent</b> <b>defect</b> or quality, and does not create it. The selfish languor and indifference of to-day's possession is the consequence of the selfish ardour of yesterday's pursuit: the scorn and weariness which cries vanitas vanitatum is but the lassitude of the sick appetite palled with pleasure: the insolence of the successful parvenu is only the necessary continuance of the career of the needy struggler: our mental changes are like our grey hairs or our wrinkles--but the fulfilment of the plan of mortal growth and decay: that which is snow-white now was glossy black once; that which is sluggish obesity to-day was boisterous rosy health a few years back; that calm weariness, benevolent, resigned, and disappointed, was ambition, fierce and violent, but a few years since, and has only settled into submissive repose after many a battle and defeat.

Are you not awestricken, you, friendly reader, who, taking the page up for a moment's light reading, lay it down, perchance, for a graver reflection,--to think how you, who have consummated your success or your disaster, may be holding marked station, or a hopeless and nameless place, in the crowd--who have passed through how many struggles of defeat, success, crime, remorse, to yourself only known!--who may have loved and grown cold, wept and laughed again, how often!--to think how you are the same, You, whom in childhood you remember, before the voyage of life began? It has been prosperous, and you are riding into port, the people huzzaing and the guns saluting,--and the lucky captain bows from the ship's side, and there is a care under the star on his breast which nobody knows of: or you are wrecked, and lashed, hopeless, to a solitary spar out at sea:--the sinking man and the successful one are thinking each about home, very likely, and remembering the time when they were children; alone on the hopeless spar, drowning out of sight; alone {{in the midst of the}} crowd applauding you.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} {{of what constitutes a}} <b>latent</b> <b>defect</b> went unresolved, as did the matter of whether liability for consequential damages has its foundations on breach or on delict.|$|E
5000|$|Broadly {{speaking}} {{in this context}} a <b>latent</b> <b>defect</b> may be described as an abnormal quality or attribute which destroys or substantially impairs the utility or effectiveness of the res vendita for the purpose {{for which it was}} sold or for which it is commonly used .... Such a defect is latent when it is one which is not visible or discoverable upon an inspection of the res vendita." [...] In other words, a <b>latent</b> <b>defect</b> would not be apparent to an ordinary person, even if an expert might have discovered it. Where the seller makes the thing sold available, and it is discovered that the thing has a <b>latent</b> <b>defect,</b> the seller is liable to the buyer in four circumstances. It {{is important to note that}} the first three categories allow an aggrieved party a contractual remedy: that is, an actio empti, which includes a claim for consequential loss or id quod interesse. The fourth category provides for aedilitian relief.|$|E

50|$|The {{products}} {{currently in}} the manufacturing line are randomly picked every day with a predefined percentage or numbers and then put in a environmental chamber that provides the stress profile of thermal cycling, elevated temperature, or combined environmental stresses to induce fatigue damage.

50|$|Temperature cycling (or {{temperature}} cycle) is {{the process}} of cycling through two temperature extremes, typically at relatively high rates of change.

5000|$|In Common Law, {{there is}} no {{automatic}} right for a buyer to claim against a seller for such latent defects when they are discovered, absent an agreement in contract. Civil Law in some jurisdictions (Quebec, Canada) does provide for such an automatic right unless a property is sold [...] "without guarantee" [...] as to its quality. However, if a <b>latent</b> <b>defect</b> is discovered, {{there is often a}} presumption against the seller when a claim is made in misrepresentation that the seller knew about the <b>latent</b> <b>defect.</b> As such, the seller is required to show that he or she could not possibly have known of the defect, rather than the buyer having to show that the seller did know about the defect. However, if it can be shown the seller could not have known about the defect (and was not wilfully blind to the possibility) then the buyer's claim will not succeed.|$|E

40|$|In the {{milestone}} case of Kravitz v. General Motors, the Supreme Court of Canada {{has recently}} confirmed that a {{contract of sale}} confers on the buyer a right of action against the manufacturer, as distinct from the seller, under the legal warranty against <b>latent</b> <b>defects.</b> The obligation to answer for <b>latent</b> <b>defects</b> {{is inherent in the}} sale, and the action to enforce that obligation becomes available, as a incidental right, to subsequent owners of the thing sold, who may proceed directly against the manufacturer. This important case reinforces the prevalent tendency in Quebec case-law and legal writing towards better safeguards for the consumer. Interesting vistas are opened in this paper by comparing the principles underlying the Supreme Court's decision in Kravitz with French and American rules on manufacturer's liability. This exercise further highlights the significance of Kravitz in regard of the present state of the law and of legislative reforms currently under consideration...|$|R
50|$|Environmental stress {{screening}} (ESS) {{refers to}} the process of exposing a newly manufactured or repaired product or component (typically electronic) to stresses such as thermal cycling and vibration in order to force <b>latent</b> <b>defects</b> to manifest themselves by permanent or catastrophic failure during the screening process.

50|$|Despite this {{difference}} in the source of failure between software and hardware, several software reliability models based on statistics have been proposed to quantify what we experience with software: the longer software is run, the higher the probability that it will eventually be used in an untested manner and exhibit a <b>latent</b> <b>defect</b> that results in a failure (Shooman 1987), (Musa 2005), (Denney 2005).|$|E
