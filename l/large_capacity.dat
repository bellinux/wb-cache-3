5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E
5|$|The divers use surface {{supplied}} umbilical diving equipment, utilizing {{deep diving}} breathing gas, such as helium and oxygen mixtures, stored in <b>large</b> <b>capacity,</b> high pressure cylinders. The gas supplies are plumbed {{to the control}} room, where they are routed to supply the system components. The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use. The divers are supplied from the bell through umbilicals.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} two tower complexes, there is a {{reception}} office, administrative block, monastic quarters, meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. This <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> is often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during {{the life of the}} Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel from place to place.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{hosted a}} test event on 16 May 2015, staging a short match between their first team and an Invitational XI {{made up of}} past players. This event was {{organized}} to test the facilities and prove that the stadium can hold a <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> crowd, and took place with 3,241 supporters in attendance. The official opening game was a friendly between F.C. United of Manchester and Benfica B on 29 May, the anniversary of Manchester United's victory over Benfica in the 1968 European Cup Final. The date also {{happened to be the}} anniversary of the death of Ronald Johnson. Benfica won the opening game 0–1 in front of a crowd of 4,232. The ground's first league game was on 11 August 2015, the second match of the 2015–16 season for F.C. United, in a National League North local derby against Stockport County, a 1–2 loss.|$|E

25|$|Hayes {{next project}} came about as an {{approach}} from Colin Chapman. Chapman's cars had {{until that point}} relied on power from fast revving Coventry Climax engines, but with the change in Formula One regulations to three litre capacity from 1966, Coventry Climax decided for business reasons not to develop a <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> engine. Chapman had approach the fledgling Cosworth group, with Keith Duckworth commenting that he could produce a competitive three litre engine, given a development budget of £100,000.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} study in 1993, two French {{students had been}} assigned {{the design of a}} <b>Large</b> <b>Capacity</b> Missile Ship, a 20,000-tonner with 500 VLS cells filled with land-attack missiles. This design was inspired by a RAND paper in that year, which suggested a land invasion could be halted by destroying 20% of its vehicles with precision munitions. This would take several days with aircraft, but a surface ship with large numbers of land-attack missiles could achieve the same effect almost instantly.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, the {{motorcycle}} industry is mainly {{dominated by the}} Chinese motorcycle industry and by Japanese motorcycle companies. In addition to the <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> motorcycles, {{there is a large}} market in smaller capacity (less than 300cc) motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and African countries and produced in China and India. A Japanese example is the 1958 Honda Super Cub, which {{went on to become the}} biggest selling vehicle of all time, with its 60 millionth unit produced in April 2008.|$|E

25|$|In July 1976, Ford {{introduced}} the XC Falcon, {{which was the}} first model to comply with the new pollution regulations specified under Australian Design Rule 27A. This led to locally produced Cleveland V8s and the introduction of the cross-flow (also called the X-flow) six-cylinder. Versions of this engine were produced in North America and, in various guises, used in Australian Falcons through to the XF. Its long stroke and <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> made for very good 'towing' torque, while its thick castings and relatively loose tolerances gave it a reputation for reliability in spite of abuse.|$|E
25|$|The current {{commercial}} {{systems are}} aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security requirements. Key distribution by courier is typically used in such cases, where traditional key distribution schemes are not believed to offer enough guarantee. This {{has the advantage}} of not being intrinsically distance limited, and despite long travel times the transfer rate can be high due to the availability of <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> portable storage devices. The major difference of quantum key distribution is the ability to detect any interception of the key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network.|$|E
25|$|After EchoStar {{obtained}} the broadcasting assets {{of a failed}} joint venture between ASkyB and MCI WorldCom, it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110°W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119°W orbital location it developed the Dish 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one Dish and an innovative dual-LNB assembly. Although the new 20-inch Dish 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch Dish 300 and DirecTV Dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The Dish 500, as a result, provided very <b>large</b> <b>capacity</b> for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to Dish 500, Dish Network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels {{that can only be}} received with the Dish 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are H2, Boomerang, Science, Planet Green, PBS Kids Sprout and Comedy Central.|$|E
