Her wrist {{continued}} to affect her at the Australian Open, where Kirsten Flipkens defeated her in straight sets. After taking three-months rest from the tour, Robson underwent surgery on her <b>left</b> <b>wrist</b> in April. The surgery forced her to miss the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, and although Robson initially hoped to be playing {{by the end of}} the season, she only started training in October, and did not play again in 2014.|$|E

Although the draw weight of a typical English longbow is disputed, {{it was at least}} 360 N and possibly more than 600 N. Considerable practice was required to produce the swift and effective combat shooting required. Skeletons of longbow archers are recognisably adapted, with enlarged left arms and often osteophytes on <b>left</b> <b>wrists,</b> <b>left</b> shoulders and right fingers.|$|R
5|$|Before spring {{training}} in 2009, there was speculation that if Garko {{did not perform}} well, he might lose his starting first base job.

5|$|On 3 April 2012 in a {{game against}} the Islanders, Josefson bumped awkwardly into Jay Pandolfo {{resulting}} in a broken <b>left</b> <b>wrist.</b> He returned to the lineup on 21 May 2012 in the fourth game of the Eastern Conference Finals against Rangers and played a total of six games in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, scoring one point.|$|E
5|$|At the Australian Open, he won {{his opening}} match against Rhyne Williams, but lost to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the second round, having led two sets to one. Despite his second-round loss, del Potro {{returned}} to being world No. 4 because David Ferrer made it only to the quarterfinals and thus lost 360 points, whereas del Potro lost only 45 points. After the Australian Open, del Potro required treatment for his <b>left</b> <b>wrist,</b> which has been giving him trouble since 2012.|$|E
40|$|Standard radiographs of both wrists of 50 healthy {{volunteers were}} taken. The mean {{differences}} between the right and <b>left</b> <b>wrists</b> were 1. 5 ° for radial inclination, 0. 5 mm for ulnar variance and 2. 5 ° for palmar tilt. The variability of the left-right differences were compared with the variability of the whole group and were significantly less for radial inclination, ulnar variance and palmar tilt.

Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 2000) 25 B: 5 : 431 - 433 It is often assumed that the ulnar variance, radial inclination and palmar tilt of both wrists of an individual are virtually identical. Thus when a fracture of the distal radius is evaluated, the normal contralateral wrist is frequently used as a reference (Kelly et al., 1997; Kopylov et al., 1993; Trumble et al., 1998).

5|$|Entering the 2014 season, {{he was set}} {{to compete}} for {{a spot on the}} bench, as Amaro {{declared}} that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play everyday. However, the Phillies placed him on the disabled list (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated recovery time was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his <b>left</b> <b>wrist</b> when sliding into the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the disabled list, but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with platooning him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings at third base. Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, and was significantly hindered by injuries.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{in a more}} {{offensive}} role on {{the first}} line for {{the latter part of}} the season, Burrows finished the 2008–09 campaign with 51 points. His 28 goals broke Andrew Brunette's mark for the most in a single season by an ECHL alumnus (27 in 2006–07). In the subsequent first round of the 2009 playoffs, Burrows scored the series-winning goal in overtime to sweep the St. Louis Blues. It was his second goal of the game. The Canucks advanced to meet the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, who defeated them in six games. Burrows' level of play was noticeably diminished in the Chicago series and it was revealed afterwards that he required surgery to remove bone chips in his <b>left</b> <b>wrist.</b> He finished the playoffs with three goals and an assist over 10 games.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his <b>left</b> <b>wrist</b> after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the immediate effects of chiropractic wrist manipulation on three golf performance indicators, namely clubhead speed, distance, and smash factor in asymptomatic male golfers. A quasi-experimental study design, set up at the Golfers Club (Fourways, Johannesburg), compared 50 participants in the test group with 50 participants in the control group. The participants were right-handed with handicaps of 17 or less. The data collection process comprised <b>left</b> and right <b>wrist</b> range of motion readings using a manual goniometer; five warm-up shots using a 7 -iron into nylon netting; and ten shots recorded using the FlightScope Simulator. The process was concluded with <b>left</b> and right <b>wrist</b> range of motion goniometer readings. Only the test group received chiropractic wrist manipulations. No subjective data was recorded as participants were asymptomatic. There was a noteworthy difference in <b>left</b> and right <b>wrist</b> range of motion without any significant change in the test or control groups’ performance indicators. The evidence suggests that the immediate effect of chiropractic wrist manipulation on golf performance indicators is limited. M. Tech. (Chiropractic...|$|R

5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his <b>left</b> <b>wrist.</b> He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E

A bronze vessel has been found which is decorated with gold and silver. A gold foundry with about 3000 unpolished semi-precious stones has been found. Many tools used for polishing these stones and a furnace were found there. A burial site has been found with 11 skeletons, with their heads in the north direction. Near the heads of these skeletons, utensils for everyday use were kept.

40|$|Although {{halothane}} plus {{nitrous oxide}} in oxygen is utilized commonly as an anaesthetic technique for outpatient general anaesthesia in children, {{the incidence of}} arrhythmia during dental surgery under halothane can {{be as high as}} 75 % (Ryder and Wright, 1981). Since isoflurane is less likely to sensitize the myocardium in the presence of catecholamines (Johnston, Eger and Wilson, 1976), this study was designed as a prospective randomized comparison of the usefulness of isoflurane or halothane in the provision of outpatient anaesthe-sia for children undergoing dental surgery. In particular, the incidence and type of arrhythmia and the quality of anaesthesia and recovery, were studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred consecutive unpremedicated chil-dren (aged between 2 and 14 yr) who had been routinely selected for outpatient general anaesthe-sia were allocated randomly to two equal groups to receive either halothane or isoflurane.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{iterative}} visual recognition system for learning based randomized bin-picking. Since the configuration on randomly stacked objects while executing the current picking trial is just partially {{different from the}} configuration while executing the previous picking trial, we consider detecting the poses of objects just by using a part of visual image taken at the current picking trial where it {{is different from the}} visual image taken at the previous picking trial. By using this method, we do not need to try to detect the poses of all objects included in the pile at every picking trial. Assuming the 3 D vision sensor attached at the wrist of a manipulator, we first explain a method to determine the pose of a 3 D vision sensor maximizing the visibility of randomly stacked objects. Then, we explain a method for detecting the poses of randomly stacked objects. Effectiveness of our proposed approach is confirmed by experiments using a dual-arm manipulator where a 3 D vision sensor and the two-fingered hand attached at the right and the <b>left</b> <b>wrists,</b> respectively.

Failure to conduct validity tests {{will result in the}} measurement method being developed to be incapable of providing reliable ergonomics measurements. The objective {{of this study is to}} conduct validity test on the simple method ergonomics measurement which was developed. The method named Simple Ergonomics Risks Assessment (SERA). Content validity test and criterion validity test were conducted. The content validity test consists of 6 ergonomics experts who actively provide inputs and positive feedbacks to improve the measurement method being developed. Meanwhile, the criterion validity test involves data collection of complaints on body parts among oil palm workers which were derived from Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and ergonomics risk assessment scores obtained from SERA. Both findings were tested with the Chi-square test to explore possible relations between the two findings. Results from the test conducted showed that there are significant relations in the scores of neck posture; hip, right and left shoulder, right and <b>left</b> <b>wrists</b> and the right hand associated with fresh fruit bunch (FFB) harvesting activities. In the loose fruits collection, the Chi-square test showed significant relations in the scores of neck posture, hip, right and <b>left</b> shoulders, right <b>wrist,</b> right arm and the left hand. However, there are body parts such as the legs which showed no significant relation. More tests should be conducted to further explore the validity of the method being developed. Findings from both validity tests show that SERA were verified by the experts and tested with validated method so that it is valid to be applied in the future...|$|R
