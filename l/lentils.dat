5|$|Indian cuisine {{encompasses}} {{a wide variety}} of regional and traditional cuisines, often depending on a particular state (such as Maharashtrian cuisine). Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of <b>lentils,</b> such as masoor (most often red <b>lentils),</b> toor (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and mong (mung beans). <b>Lentils</b> may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split <b>lentils,</b> or dal, are used extensively. The spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{practices}} were noted during the Periods I and II and crops grown were inferred as wheat, barley and lentil; finding <b>lentils</b> established a link of the Neolithic people with Central Asia, crossing over the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Adas is {{a healthy}} lentil soup, common in the Middle East. Unlike {{other parts of the}} Middle East, Palestinians do not {{incorporate}} yogurt or other ingredients into this soup.

5|$|Agriculture was {{independently}} {{developed on}} the island of New Guinea. In Greece from c. 11,000 BC <b>lentils,</b> vetch, pistachios, and almonds were cultivated, while wild oats and wild barley appear in quantity from c. 7,000 BC alongside einkorn wheat, barley, sheep, goats and pigs, while emmer was used on Cyprus between 9,100 and 8,600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Average {{daily intake}} varies between 120 and 240 μg/day, which {{is higher than}} dietary recommendations. Pork, lamb, and beef liver each have {{approximately}} 1.5 parts per million of molybdenum. Other significant dietary sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, <b>lentils,</b> cucumbers and cereal grain.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} <b>lentils</b> and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} <b>lentil</b> starch were measured and linked {{up with its}} functional properties and {{compared with those of}} corn and potato starches. The amylose content of <b>lentil</b> starch was the highest among these starches. The crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy of <b>lentil</b> starch were the lowest among these starches. The high amylose: amylopectin ratio in <b>lentil</b> starch resulted into low crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy. Gelatinization and pasting temperatures of <b>lentil</b> starch were in between those of corn and potato starches. <b>Lentil</b> starch gels showed the highest storage modulus, gel strength and pasting viscosity than corn and potato starch gels. Peleg&# 039;s model was able to predict the stress relaxation data of these starches well (R 2 > 0. 98). The elastic modulus of <b>lentil</b> starch gel was less frequency dependent and higher in magnitude at high temperature (60 °C) than at lower temperature (10 °C). <b>Lentil</b> starch is suitable where higher gel strengthened pasting viscosity are desired...|$|R
40|$|The binding of fluorescein-conjugated <b>lentil</b> lectin and concanavalin A to {{the surface}} {{membrane}} of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied by flow cytometry. The lymphocytes bound 3 -fold more <b>lentil</b> lectin molecules compared with concanavalin A molecules and <b>lentil</b> lectin binding approached saturation {{at a much lower}} concentration than did that of concanavalin A. <b>Lentil</b> lectin identified two groups of lymphocytes: a low-binding T-cell fraction and a high-binding B-cell-enriched fraction. Concanavalin A did not discriminate between these populations in unseparated lymphocytes. Competition studies indicated that <b>lentil</b> lectin and concanavalin A were bound to different sites on the lymphocyte surface, although about 50 % of <b>lentil</b> lectin sites were in close proximity to concanavalin A sites...|$|R

5|$|Lentil soup is {{prepared}} in many ways, with additions such as cilantro or meat. Other soups include the harira of the Moroccan Jews, {{which is a}} spicy soup of lamb (or chicken), chickpeas, <b>lentils</b> and rice, and Yemenite bone marrow soup known as ftut, which is served on special occasions such as weddings, and is seasoned with the traditional hawaij spice mix.|$|E
5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, <b>lentils</b> and spinach) are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E
50|$|The word lens {{comes from}} the Latin name of the <b>lentil,</b> because a {{double-convex}} lens is lentil-shaped. The genus of the <b>lentil</b> plant is Lens, and the most commonly eaten species is Lens culinaris. The <b>lentil</b> plant also gives its name to a geometric figure.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} different intercropping arrangements of cumin and <b>lentil</b> on plant growth and yield, an experiment was conducted in Agricultural Research Station of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in the growing season of the year 2004. Treatments were A: row intercropping of cumin and <b>lentil</b> B: strip intercropping of cumin and <b>lentil</b> (three cumin rows and three <b>lentil</b> rows) C: strip intercropping of cumin and <b>lentil</b> (four cumin rows and four <b>lentil</b> rows) D: sole crop of cumin (six rows) E: sole crop of <b>lentil</b> (six rows). For this purpose a complete randomized block design with 4 replications was used. Results showed that economic and biologic yield of cumin, 1000 -seeds weight, number of seeds per umbel were affected by different intercropping arrangements {{and there was a}} decreasing trend in these parameters from intercropped to the sole crop. Biological and economic yield and also harvest index for <b>lentil</b> were higher in sole crop compared with intercrop.

5|$|Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, with {{evidence}} that, for example, cheese {{has been made}} in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Ful medames, a stew of fava beans with oil and cumin, is popular in Egypt and has become widespread across the Arab world. Duqqa is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. Kushari is a foreign-derived 19th century dish of rice, <b>lentils</b> and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food for the poor, but has become a national dish.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{simulation}} modeling {{efforts are}} {{also needed to}} do a geospatial assessment of the likely effect of genotypic variation in the limited-transpiration traits on yield performance [61, 63] of <b>lentil</b> at a regional scale. A <b>lentil</b> version of the SSM-Legumes model was developed and proven robust in evaluating variation in phenological development and yield of <b>lentil</b> {{in a range of}} environments, with different rainfall patterns, in the Middle East [15], and investigating the roles of changing phenology and sowing dates on the possible expansion of <b>lentil</b> culture in East Africa [16]. This model needs to be applied to assessing the potential values of these traits on water-limited <b>lentil.</b>|$|R

5|$|Friedrich Alefeld (1820–1872), {{who used}} Latin variety names, in a {{monographic}} study of beans, <b>lentils</b> and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Varietäten Gruppe and Kultur-Varietät, all with Latin names. In doing this {{he was probably}} laying the ground for the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group. In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, <b>lentils,</b> onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, <b>lentils,</b> bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the comparison of different intercropping patterns of cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) with <b>lentil</b> (Lens culinaris L.) in double crop, a field experiment was conducted based on a randomized complete block design with three replications and eight treatment at the farm located in West Azerbaijan province - city Nagadeh, Iran during growing reason of 2011 - 2012. Treatments included intra- row intercropping (50 % cumin + 50 % <b>lentil),</b> row intercropping (one row of <b>lentil</b> + one row of cumin) and strip intercropping (two rows of <b>lentil</b> + one rows of cumin, three rows of <b>lentil</b> + one rows of cumin, four rows of <b>lentil</b> + four two of cumin, six rows of <b>lentil</b> + two rows of cumin and pure <b>lentil</b> and cumin. Intercropping patterns had significant effect on all of mentioned traits. Results showed that the highest and the lowest economic yield of <b>lentil</b> were achieved in monoculture with 600 and 1600 kg. ha- 1 and six rows of <b>lentil</b> + two rows of cumin with 273 and 676 kg. ha- 1, respectively. Grain yield and biological yield {{were no significant differences}} at monoculture with row intercropping and intra- row intercropping. But with increasing strip widths of grain yield and biological yield decreased by 50 and 54 %, respectively. The essential oil percentage of all treatments was higher than monoculture. The highest essential oil yield was obtained of intra- row intercropping (20 kg. ha- 1). Results indicated that maximum (1. 8) and minimum (0. 94) LER values were obtained of row intercropping and strip intercropping (six rows of <b>lentil</b> + two rows of cumin), respectively. By changing row intercropping patterns to strip intercropping, LER was decreased due to complementary and facilitative effects in intercropping...|$|R
40|$|Successful host shifts by herbivorous insects {{may require}} the modiÞcation of {{multiple}} larval and adult traits. The seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) rarely attacks <b>lentil</b> (Lens culinarisMedikus), which is distantly {{related to its}} typical hosts. In a previous study, larval survival in <b>lentil</b> seeds increased from 2 to 85 % in fewer than 20 generations of laboratory selection. However, <b>lentil</b> is also a poor oviposition host; lifetime fecundity on <b>lentil</b> was initially {{less than a third}} of that on the ancestral host [mung bean, Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek] and one fourth of females did not even recognize <b>lentil</b> as a potential host. This study examined the genetic lability of host acceptance. We performed both quasi-natural selection, in which replicate lines switched to <b>lentil</b> were compared with those remaining on mung bean, and artiÞcial selection, in which lines were established using females from the base population that exhibited especially low or high acceptance of <b>lentil</b> during a short-term assay. After only Þve to eight generations of quasi-natural selection, lifetime fecundity on <b>lentil</b> was 2 to 3 times higher in the <b>lentil</b> lines than in the mung bean lines. Lentil-line females also accepted the novel host sooner after adult emergence. Similarly, a single generation of artiÞcial selection was sufÞcient to increase oviposition on <b>lentil</b> in the acceptance line. Host acceptance was not genetically correlated with larval survival, which remained 2 % in lines artiÞcially selected for either high or low acceptance of <b>lentil</b> seeds. Although modiÞcation of oviposition behavior in this study was not nearly as striking as the increase in larval survival reported previously, the C. maculatus population possessed enough standing genetic variation in both larval physiology and adult behavior to permit rapid adaptation to a very poor host...|$|R

5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are <b>lentils,</b> beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
