25|$|The opponens digiti minimi {{originates}} {{from the}} long plantar ligament and the plantar tendinous sheath of peroneus longus and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal. When present, it acts to plantar flex the fifth digit and supports the plantar arch. The flexor digiti minimi arises from the region of base of the fifth metatarsal and is inserted onto {{the base of the}} first phalanx of the fifth digit where it is usually merged with the abductor of the first digit. It acts to plantar flex the last digit. The largest and longest muscles of the <b>little</b> <b>toe</b> is the abductor digiti minimi. Stretching from the lateral process of the calcaneus, with a second attachment on the base of the fifth metatarsal, {{to the base of the}} fifth digit's first phalanx, the muscle forms the lateral edge of the sole. Except for supporting the arch, it plantar flexes the <b>little</b> <b>toe</b> and also acts as an abductor.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her <b>little</b> <b>toe</b> while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he {{is not the only one}} to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E
500|$|The fore {{legs were}} shorter and less heavily built than the hind legs. The upper arm {{had a large}} deltopectoral crest for muscle attachment, while the ulna and radius were slim. The upper arm and forearm were similar in length. The wrist was simple, with only two small bones. Each hand had four fingers, with no thumb (first finger). The index second, third, and fourth fingers were {{approximately}} the same length and were united in life within a fleshy covering. Although {{the second and third}} finger had hoof-like unguals, these bones were also within the skin and not apparent from the outside. The little finger diverged from the other three and was much shorter. The thigh bone was robust and straight, with a prominent flange about halfway down the posterior side. This ridge was for the attachment of powerful muscles attached to the hips and tail that pulled the thighs (and thus the hind legs) backward and helped maintain the use of the tail as a balancing organ. [...] Each foot had three toes, with no big toe or <b>little</b> <b>toe.</b> The toes had hoof-like tips.|$|E

60|$|When Stephen Gaff {{approached}} his own cottage, he beheld his wife belabouring the Bu'ster {{with both hands}} and tongue unmercifully. What special piece of mischief Billy had been doing is not of much consequence. It is enough to state that he suddenly planted the heel of his naked foot somewhat effectively on his mother's <b>little</b> <b>toe,</b> which chanced to be resting on a sharp stone at the moment, burst from her grasp, and rushed down the steep bank to the beach cheering, weeping, and laughing all at once, in a sort of hysterical triumph.|$|E
60|$|The night-watchman sat {{brooding}} darkly over {{life and}} its troubles. A shooting corn on the <b>little</b> <b>toe</b> of his left foot, {{and a touch of}} liver, due, he was convinced, to the unlawful cellar work of the landlord of the Queen's Head, had induced in him a vein of profound depression. A discarded boot stood by his side, and his gray-stockinged foot protruded {{over the edge of the}} jetty until a passing waterman gave it a playful rap with his oar. A subsequent inquiry as to the price of pigs' trotters fell on ears rendered deaf by suffering.|$|E
5000|$|Didactyly (from Greek di-="two" [...] plus Î´Î±ÎºÏ„Ï…Î»Î¿Ï‚ = [...] "finger") or bidactyly is the {{condition}} of having two digits on each limb, as in the Hypertragulidae and two-toed sloth, Choloepus didactylus. In humans this name is used for an abnormality in which the middle digits are missing, leaving only the thumb and fifth finger, or big and <b>little</b> <b>toes.</b> Cloven-hoofed mammals (such as deer, sheep and cattle - Artiodactyla) have only two digits, as do ostriches.|$|R

60|$|The {{hall was}} very full, and, as poor little Martha was rather late, {{she could not}} manage to crush in much beyond the door. Besides, being small, she could see nothing. In these {{depressing}} circumstances her heart began to sink, when her attention was attracted by a slight stir outside the door. A lady and gentleman were coming in. It so happened that the lady in passing trod upon one of Martha's cold <b>little</b> <b>toes,</b> and drew from the child a sharp cry.|$|R
60|$|The whole {{attitude}} {{of this young}} man warmed and shamed me. He had more fire in his <b>little</b> <b>toe</b> than I had in my whole carcass; he was stuffed to bursting with the manly virtues; thrift and courage glowed in him; and even if his artistic vocation seemed (to one of my exclusive tenets) not quite clear, who could predict what might be accomplished by a creature so full-blooded and so inspired with animal and intellectual energy? So, when he proposed that I should come and see his work (one of the regular stages of a Latin Quarter friendship), I followed him with interest and hope.|$|E
60|$|I {{began my}} {{concentration}} of will. Even then {{my body was}} numbing and prickling through the loss of circulation. I directed my will to the <b>little</b> <b>toe</b> of my right foot, and I willed that toe to cease to be alive in my consciousness. I willed that toe to die--to die so far as I, its lord, and a different thing entirely from it, was concerned. There was the hard struggle. Morrell had warned me {{that it would be}} so. But there was no flicker of doubt to disturb my faith. I knew that that toe would die, and I knew when it was dead. Joint by joint it had died under the compulsion of my will.|$|E
60|$|Yet that is {{the only}} {{attempted}} explanation I have ever come upon, and the thing has often worried me. I think it is just as probably a change in dietary. I have noticed that most of your vegetarians are shock-headed, ample-bearded men, and I have heard the Ancestor was vegetarian. Or it may be, I sometimes fancy, a kind of inherent disposition on the part of your human animal to dwindle. That came back in my memory vividly as I looked at the long rows of Sceptics, typical Advanced people, and marked their glistening crania. I recalled other losses. Here is Humanity, thought I, growing hairless, growing bald, growing toothless, unemotional, irreligious, losing the end joint of the <b>little</b> <b>toe,</b> dwindling in its osseous structures, its jawbone and brow ridges, losing all the full, rich curvatures of its primordial beauty.|$|E

Involvement of the palms was limited to a localised area over palmar aspect of right middle finger and was non-progressive. No other family member was affected.
