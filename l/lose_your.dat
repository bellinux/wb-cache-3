Published by Random House Publications, the book was well received by critics, and sold 10,000 copies within its first twenty days. A follow-up titled, Women and The Weight Loss Tamasha, was released two years later. It addressed the weight loss concerns and eating habits of women in various parts of their life, and featured Kapoor in a voice-over for the audiobook. In February 2013, Kapoor released her autobiographical memoir: The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva. Co-authored alongside Rochelle Pinto, it became the first book to be launched under the Shobhaa De imprint of Penguin Books—a set of series that included celebrity memoirs, guides and biographies. In a review published by Mint, Shefalee Vasudev criticised the writing style as [...] "too-breezy" [...] but further stated that it is [...] "a well-produced book, reproducing chirpy little post-it notes and diet charts, punctuated with Bebo's stunning pictures from her private albums to fashion magazine covers."

All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair.

Kesha described the concept behind the video {{in an interview with}} MTV, stating, [...] "I wanted it to be like a psychedelic trip of the mind, comparable with being so disgustingly in love with someone that you <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> head." [...] She chose to also incorporate an animal aspect to the video explaining that she was [...] "a huge animal lover". Kesha elaborated on the experience, [...] "I also ride an elephant — no big deal! — and, um, I dance around a cave with black-light body paint and a python. I was in a cave, in the desert, and it was really fun." [...] When asked about the inspiration for the video, she said [...] "This video was inspired by the Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie, the animation aspect.

Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> right to complain that there's never anything good on TV."

[...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken.

We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway.

500|$|Overall, {{reception}} of the album was positive. Speaking of second-generation artists emerging around the same time, Allmusic's Jason Ankeny wrote that Wainwright [...] "deserves to be heard regardless of his family tree". Furthermore, Ankeny complimented the musician for his songwriting abilities and his [...] "knack for elegantly rolling piano melodies and poignantly romantic lyrics". Music journalist Robert Christgau characterized Wainwright as a [...] "mind-boggling original" [...] whose talent is [...] "too big to let pass". One NME reviewer called the album [...] "floridly impersonal and [...] "grandiosely arranged", but also criticized Wainwright for being [...] "too overwrought and naff". Greenwald complimented Martha's backing vocals on the song [...] "In My Arms", as well as Parks' [...] "positively sterling" [...] string arrangement on [...] "Millbrook". Furthermore, he praised the vocal duet between Rufus and Martha on [...] "Sally Ann", claiming that a similar sibling performance had not been heard since The Everly Brothers. The album's cabaret elements and 1970s singer-songwriter style drew comparisons to Cole Porter and Joni Mitchell. Josh Kun of Salon.com wrote that Wainwright poetically incorporated [...] "foolish love and fantasy love, healing love and destructive love and love that {{makes you want to}} <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> sense of self just so you can find it again." [...] Kun asserted that the songs were [...] "built on a similar set of angled melodies and hairpin turns of phrase", and that each [...] "succeeds as its own distinctly intimate portrait of emotion and desire." ...|$|E
500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate {{on the things that}} did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E
500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "She's a Sensation", which was said by author Dave Thompson to have a 60's melody which [...] "melts through the hard rock." [...] The next song, [...] "7-11", deals with dating {{at a young age}} where the couple goes on dates to places like {{convenience}} stores and record swaps. The lyrics follow a boy who meets a girl by a Space Invaders machine, and eventually has to let her go after she dies in a car crash. True relates: [...] "You can <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> heart within the singer's torched '7-11'. Joey details in time-honoured girl group fashion the beauty of young love that takes place among the most mundane, humdrum of surroundings." [...] "You Didn't Mean Anything to Me", written by Dee Dee, reflects the desolation and vacillation which the bassist was feeling in his personal life as well as while he was with the band. This is evident through lines like [...] "Every dinner was crummy/Even the ones for free." [...] The pop-oriented song [...] "Come On Now" [...] was described by True as a [...] "sparkling rush of blood to the head from the [...] "comic book boy", and said that it ranged alongside songs from The Dave Clark Five and 1910 Fruitgum Company. The eleventh track on the album is titled [...] "This Business Is Killing Me", and was written by Joey to detail how everyone expects him to please others, but he simply cannot please everyone all the time. Pleasant Dreams concludes with [...] "Sitting in My Room", which contained lyrics quoted by David Fricke in the conclusion of his review on the album, saying: [...] "'It's us against them,' sneers Joey in [...] "Sitting in My Room.' 'They just wanna worry ... /They just wanna be so lame/Maybe they should try and sniff some glue.' Or put Pleasant Dreams on the box and crank it up to ten." ...|$|E
