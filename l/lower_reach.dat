25|$|An {{inclined}} plane for railway wagons at Blackhill connected the two {{reaches of the}} canal. The coals were unloaded from the boats in the upper reach into the wagons, run down the {{inclined plane}}, and again loaded into boats in the <b>lower</b> <b>reach,</b> which was a tedious operation, and hurtful to the coals.|$|E
25|$|The Monkey River {{has several}} {{important}} ecosystems including: (a) montane broadleaf primary forest; (b) upland coastal plain broadleaf secondary forest; (c) upper river freshwater riverine habitat; (d) <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> estuarine and mangrove habitats; and (e) Caribbean Sea coral reef and turtle-grass marine habitat. This shallow marine environment {{is home to}} the endangered manatee. Each of these five discrete ecosystems contains important habitat for either terrestrial or aquatic species of southern Belize.|$|E

25|$|The Cosumnes River is {{the last}} {{remaining}} free-flowing river in California's Central Valley, with the preserve located on the river's <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> where it joins the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta tidelands. The area supports a diverse range {{of plant and animal}} life, including three species of oak as well as rare plants like the endemic northern California black walnut (Juglans californica var. hindsii). Notable features include the sandhill crane fall migration and the Tall Forest in Wood Duck Slough. More than 250 bird species, more than 40 fish species, and some 230 plant species have been identified here.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} the Karnali River was {{considered}} to be attractive for the development of navigation right from the Indo–Nepal border till the confluence of this river and the Ganges. The <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> of this river—called the Ghaghra in India—was used in the past for navigation by steamers. Apart from {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas where most of the streams were simply fast-moving water throughout the greater part of the year and not navigable when flowing rapidly, most of the rivers with steadier currents had boats on them. The Ganges, the Ghaghra, the Yamuna, the Gomti, the Sharda and the Rapti were the most important navigable rivers in the Northwestern provinces and Oudh.|$|E
500|$|Between 1850 and 1854 the U. S. Army {{explored}} the <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> of the Colorado River from the Gulf of California, {{looking for the}} river to provide a less expensive route to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. [...] First in November 1850 to January 1851, by its transport schooner, Invincible under Captain Alfred H. Wilcox and then by its longboat commanded by Lieutenant George Derby. [...] Later Lieutenant Derby, in his expedition report, recommended that a shallow draft sternwheel steamboat would {{be the way to}} send supplies up river to the fort. [...] The next contractors George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Benjamin M. Hartshorne, brought two barges and 250 tons of supplies arriving at the river's mouth in February 1852, on the United States transport schooner Sierra Nevada under Captain Wilcox. [...] Poling the barges up the Colorado, the first barge sank with its cargo a total loss. [...] The second was finally, after a long struggle poled up to Fort Yuma, but what little it carried was soon consumed by the garrison. [...] Subsequently, wagons again were sent from the fort to haul the balance of the supplies overland from the estuary through the marshes and woodlands of the Delta. [...] At last Derby's recommendation was heeded and in November 1852, the Uncle Sam, a 65-foot long side-wheel paddle steamer, built by Domingo Marcucci, became the first steamboat on the Colorado River. [...] It was brought by the schooner Capacity from San Francisco to the delta by the next contractor to supply the fort, Captain James Turnbull. [...] It was assembled and launched in the estuary, 30 miles above the mouth of the Colorado River. [...] Equipped with only a 20-horsepower engine, the Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, taking 15 days to make the first 120-mile trip. [...] It made many trips up and down the river, taking four months to finish carrying the supplies for the fort, improving its time up river to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of 1853. [...] Turnbull in financial difficulty, disappeared. [...] Nevertheless, he had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's ls supply problem.|$|E
50|$|From the 1900s, {{with the}} advent of large {{irrigation}} schemes, landowners along the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the river strongly urged for the construction of barrages, primarily to keep the water fresh in the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the River Murray, as well as Lake Albert and Lake Alexandrina.|$|R

2500|$|West of U.S. Highway 101, Piner Creek flows {{over the}} Santa Rosa Plain at {{gradients}} {{of less than}} two percent. [...] Here the predominant soil type is Zamora silty clay loam, which has been deposited as an alluvial fan as the floodplain formed. [...] The upper soil surface of the Zamora material is grayish-brown hard, firm, sticky and plastic. [...] Permeability is moderately slow and fertility is high for these <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> soils, which has resulted in historic orchard use and present day vineyards.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{construction}} of the dams, the <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> of the river saw a drastic decrease in sediment delivery. [...] This led to a net erosion of the riverbed, including the gravels needed to create suitable habitats for spawning. [...] Replacement gravel was trapped in the sediment load behind the dams. [...] These gravels are considered an essential resource for restoration of salmon habitats. [...] The delta {{at the mouth of the}} river, where it enters the Strait of Juan de Fuca, also saw a net erosion effect, confirmed by local tribal leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{quality of}} Piner Creek is {{characterized}} by pH levels that are mildly basic, with upper reach pH levels about 8.5, declining to <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> levels at 7.8 just above the discharge to Santa Rosa Creek. [...] It {{is interesting to note}} that the headwaters soils are typically of pH about 6.9. [...] Water quality of Piner Creek is generally low in turbidity, except for highest flow periods resulting from heavy rains; [...] the water is free from odor. [...] Springtime water temperatures are typically in the range of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 18 degrees Celsius).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine a deficit in surface water for the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Yellow River The methods suggested in this paper to diagnose water shortage problems are simple and practical. The results show that the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Yellow River are areas without sufficient water to meet the needs of irrigation, domestic, and industrial uses. The completion of the Sanmenxia reservoir and Xiaolangdi reservoir relax the conflict between water need and supply. However, if the hydrologic status becomes pessimistic with an exceedence probability of over 80 percent, then the water supply is still severe in the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Yellow River The water resources in the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Yellow River to Tianjin and Qingdao cities are very limited and unstable. The most feasible options to offset the water deficiency in the <b>lower</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Yellow River are: (a) to obtain water from the Yangzi River; (b) to obtain more water from middle and upper reaches through regulation; (c) to conduct a comprehensive water saving program...|$|R

On Helheim the thinning and velocity propagated up-glacier from the calving front. [...] In each case the major outlet glaciers accelerated by at least 50%, {{much larger than the}} impact noted due to summer meltwater increase. On each glacier the acceleration was not restricted to the summer, persisting through the winter when surface meltwater is absent.|$|E
2500|$|The storage {{capacity}} in reservoirs already exceeded the catchment, so that larger reservoirs were no solution; back-pumping {{water from the}} <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> to the upper at Blackhill was considered too expensive, and Leslie and a colleague recommended {{the construction of an}} inclined plane, in which the empty boats would be hauled up [...] "wet"—floating in a caisson on a rail-borne carriage. The dominant traffic was loaded down to Glasgow and empty back up; the intention was to haul the empty boats up the plane, and to let the loaded boats continue to use the locks. The [...] "wet" [...] system was preferred because boats [...] long were in use; [...] "dry" [...] haulage required the carriage to traverse a brow, over which the carriage and boat descended into the upper reach, and with a long boat this was impractical.

The <b>lower</b> <b>reach</b> of the river where he so often and so impatiently directed his eyes remained deserted, save for the rapid flitting of some fishing canoe; but down the upper reaches came black clouds and heavy showers heralding the final setting in of the rainy season with its thunderstorms and great floods making the river almost impossible of ascent for native canoes.|$|E
60|$|It was now November. The Nile {{was falling}} fast, and an impassable rapid {{began to appear}} at Um Tiur, four {{miles north of the}} confluence. The Sirdar had a few days in which to make up his mind whether he would keep his gunboats on the upper or <b>lower</b> <b>reach.</b> As in the latter case their patrolling limits would have been restricted, and they would no longer have been able to watch the army at Metemma, he {{determined}} to leave them on the enemy's side of the obstruction. This involved the formation of a depot at Dakhila ['Atbara Fort'], where simple repairs could be executed and wood and other necessities stored. To guard this little dockyard half the 3rd Egyptian battalion was moved from Berber and posted in a small entrenchment. The other half-battalion followed in a few weeks. The post at the confluence was gradually growing into the great camp of a few months later.|$|E
