500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|McMahon's husband, Vince McMahon, did not {{actively}} campaign for his spouse, causing some {{to wonder if}} Linda was purposely distancing herself from him. In February 2010, <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> Vince was too busy [...] "running the company" [...] as both chairman and CEO to campaign, but said he may be involved “down the road”. Several speculators predicted that if he campaigned with her, his direct association with controversial wrestling skits would be a “major liability”.|$|E
2500|$|Suzy and the Red Stripes was a {{pseudonym}} {{used by the}} group {{for the release of}} the Linda McCartney and Wings single [...] "Seaside Woman" [...] in 1977. It was the only release by Wings under that name and was written and sung by Linda McCartney. <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> that the [...] "Suzy and the Red Stripes" [...] pseudonym came about because she had been called [...] "Suzi" [...] in Jamaica because of [...] "a fantastic reggae version of 'Suzi Q'", and Red Stripe is Jamaica's leading brand of beer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Linda</b> Lewis <b>said</b> {{the family}} stayed silent about the date rape claim until after both Loretta Young and Judy Lewis had died.|$|R
5000|$|Fortensky's sister, <b>Linda</b> Untiet, <b>said</b> {{they were}} {{divorced}} because Fortensky {{did not want}} to be known as [...] "Mr. Elizabeth Taylor" [...] any more and that the two had remained in contact after the divorce.|$|R
50|$|<b>Linda</b> Slater <b>said</b> {{that the}} wooden cover which had covered the cross since 2002 was {{reported}} missing on May 8, 2010, and that the cross itself had been seen on May 10 but {{was reported missing}} on May 11 by rangers who {{had returned to the}} location.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is in prison!" [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> {{this with}} a little hysteric scream. Then she began to sob and cry, and turned her back to Tetchen and hid {{her face in her}} hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are going}} to Mr. Searle's,' <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> quietly; 'this is the street I think. I got the {{directions}} how to find it at the hotel. He is a respectable lawyer, I am told.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, {{it is the}} manner in which the all-wise Creator has thought fit to make the weaker vessel subject to the {{stronger}} one." [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> nothing, but thought that that old town-clerk was not a vessel strong enough to hold her in subjection. [...] "It is this which a woman should bring home to herself, Linda, when she first thinks of marriage." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Linda</b> McCartney <b>said</b> that Paul {{had become}} {{interested}} in avant-garde theatre and had immersed himself {{in the writings of}} Alfred Jarry. This influence is reflected in the story and tone of the song, and also explains how Paul came across Jarry's word [...] "pataphysical", which occurs in the lyrics.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 March 2017 in an ITV {{interview}} on Lorraine, <b>Linda</b> Robson <b>said</b> {{that the show}} would possibly return for another Christmas special. Robson said that [...] "there are talks about a Christmas special because the last Christmas special did so well, we were so proud of it.” ...|$|R

60|$|On. Saturday Alaric went down, but {{his arrival}} hardly made things more pleasant. Mrs. Woodward {{could not bring}} herself to be cordial with him, and the girls were {{restrained}} by a certain feeling {{that it would not}} be right to show too much outward joy at Alaric's success. <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> one little word of affectionate encouragement, but it produced no apparent return from Alaric. His immediate object was to recover Mrs. Woodward's good graces; and he thought before he went that he had reason to hope that he might do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} any dinner," [...] said Linda, still {{standing}} with her face turned to the wall. Then Madame Staubach took hold of her arm, and led her across the passage into the parlour. <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> not a word as she was being thus conducted, but was thinking whether it might not even yet serve her purpose to be silent and sullen. She was still sobbing, and striving to repress her sobs; but she allowed herself to be led without resistance, and in an instant the door was closed, and she was seated on the old sofa with her aunt beside her.|$|E
60|$|This {{letter was}} very cold. It just {{permitted}} Mrs. Woodward {{to know that}} Norman did not regard them all as strangers; and that was all. <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> it was very sad; and Gertrude said, not to her mother but to Alaric, that it was heartless. Captain Cuttwater predicted that he would soon come round, and be as sound as a roach again in six months' time. Alaric said nothing; but he went on with his wooing, and this he did so successfully, as to make Gertrude painfully alive to what would have been, in her eyes, the inferiority of her lot, had she unfortunately allowed herself to become the victim of Norman's love.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Linda</b> Gray has <b>said</b> {{that she}} {{considers}} Sue Ellen [...] "one {{of the most}} interesting female characters on television in the 1980s".|$|R
5000|$|... "It's {{a perfect}} {{marriage}} for us! She gives us such sophistication, such luxury, [...] " [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda</b> Fargo, Senior Vice President Bergdorf Goodman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, I {{think you}} had; I'm sure mamma would break down there,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> 'Mamma, I'm {{sure you would}} never get over the {{official}} priggism.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, Linda," [...] said Madame Staubach, who {{had taken}} off her bonnet, and was already herself stiffly seated in her {{accustomed}} chair. [...] "Sit down, my dear, while I speak to you." [...] Linda sat down at some distance from her aunt, and awaited dumbly the speech {{that was to be}} made to her. [...] "Linda," [...] continued Madame Staubach, [...] "I have been this afternoon to the house of your friend Herr Molk." [...] <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> nothing out loud, but she declared to herself that Herr Molk was no friend of hers. Friend indeed! Herr Molk had shown himself to be one of her bitterest enemies. [...] "I thought it best to see him after what--has been done, especially as he had been with you when you were ill, before you went." [...] Still <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> nothing. What was there that she could possibly say? Madame Staubach paused, not expecting her niece to speak, but collecting her own thoughts and arranging her words. [...] "And Peter Steinmarc was there also," [...] said Madame Staubach. Upon hearing this Linda's heart sank within her. Had all her sufferings, then, been for nothing? Had she passed that terrible night, that terrible day, with no result that might be useful to her? But even yet might there not be hope? Was it not possible that her aunt was about to communicate to her the fact that Peter Steinmarc declined to be bound by his engagement to her? She sighed deeply and almost sobbed, as she clasped her hands together. Her aunt observed it all, and then went on with her speech. [...] "You will, I hope, have understood, Linda, that I have not wished to upbraid you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Linda was {{immediately}} {{impressed with the}} sound Duncan had achieved on the all-acoustic CD, and really liked the trio's 3-part vocals. One of the songs Bobby played was his own Into The Arms Of Love, and Linda started singing a pretty harmony part under her breath. Bobby asked if she would sing that part on the CD and <b>Linda</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Sure." [...] That was it.|$|E
5000|$|BASH was the {{originally}} thought up by Linda Macfarlane, Canberra and Karen Garnett, Sydney. <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> that the tango crowd from Canberra wanted {{to dance with}} more people, and Karen from Sydney said the same about the Sydney scene. They both thought, why not bring the two crowds together? Figuring that a place geographically {{right in the middle}} would be ideal, Linda found Bundanoon as the perfect place. Thus BASH was born.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{too late}} to keep Charley in bed,' <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> 'for I see him coming along the road now with a towel; he's been bathing.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Some critics {{point out}} that {{commercial}} interests and public interests are not always aligned, and that investment from corporations for commercial interests can be detrimental {{to the formation of}} public opinion. In an article in The New York Times, <b>Linda</b> Greenhouse <b>said,</b> [...] "the court’s speech-protective instincts appear increasingly to serve a deregulatory agenda." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if you please, I {{will go to}} bed," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> who was by {{no means}} sorry to escape the {{necessity}} of returning to the parlour.|$|R

5000|$|Somewhere {{toward the}} end of the mixing process, and before Stefan's return, Bobby got a call from Linda Ronstadt who was in Tucson and wanted to visit. They went out to dinner, and during the evening Bobby was raving about how excited he was with the way the CD was turning out. <b>Linda</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'd love to hear some of it." [...] Since they were near Bobby's house, Linda stopped by and Bobby played her a few of the rough mixes.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{is welcome}} to the rooms if he wants them," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda.</b> [...] "He is {{welcome to the}} whole house {{if you choose to}} give it to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> {{through her}} clenched teeth. [...] "Is he not? Well, then, look to it; because father has been walking about with a loaded gun at night." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an opinion}} piece, <b>Linda</b> McQuaig, <b>said</b> [...] "lots of hype about Canada and our {{institutions}} being under attack — {{even as it}} got harder to explain {{the difference between the}} 'terrorist' murders of two soldiers and the 'non-terrorist' murders of three RCMP officers in Moncton. The main difference appeared to be that the shooter in Moncton was not a follower of Islam".|$|R
5000|$|Harry, Linda and George: An abusive husband, Harry often becomes unjustifiably {{angry and}} even {{verbally}} abusive to his long-suffering wife, Linda, if {{she makes the}} simplest of mistakes, such as during a game of Monopoly or Countdown. George - a family friend with {{a soft spot for}} Linda - always gets {{caught in the middle of}} these arguments while trying to stop them. The final sketch of Series 2, based on a Hogmanay party at the couples house, shows Harrys ultimate comeuppance, when Linda and George end up kissing passionately in front of him after he makes a fuss about some sausage rolls <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> shed made herself but had in fact, bought meat and pastry and [...] "put the sausage rolls together" [...] which, Harry tries to make clear, are not the same thing. They reappeared in Series 3 where they visit a zoo in episode one and a warehouse in episode four.|$|E
5000|$|Although nobody claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack, the Provisional IRA was immediately and widely blamed. In his book Loyalists, Peter Taylor explained that the Provisional IRA bombed Balmoral in retaliation for the McGurk's Bar bombing one week earlier, which had killed 15 Catholic civilians. This theory is supported by Susan McKay. Billy McQuiston, along with many other Protestant men who had been on the Shankill {{at the time of the}} explosion, immediately joined the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Others included Sammy Duddy, Michael Stone, and Tommy Lyttle. Lyttle, who became brigadier of the UDA West Belfast Brigade, was not there but his wife and two daughters were near the bomb when it went off. They received no injuries, but his daughter <b>Linda</b> <b>said</b> that Lyttle [...] "took it personally". Jackie McDonald, the incumbent South Belfast UDA brigadier, worked as dispatches manager for the Balmoral Furniture Company. The leader of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF, the name the UDA used to claim attacks), John White, who was convicted of the double murder of Senator Paddy Wilson and Irene Andrews in 1973, used the Balmoral bombing as justification for these killings and others.|$|E

6000|$|... "Who told me? The {{magistrate}} {{you were}} taken to; Herr Molk told me himself," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Linda,</b> almost happily. That smile upon {{his face had}} in some way vanquished her feeling of jealousy.|$|R
2500|$|Attorney General Linda Kelly {{prepared}} a presentment which included credibility determinations about the testimonies received {{before the first}} grand jury for the second grand jury. The 33rd Statewide Investigating Grand Jury continued looking into the investigation. This grand jury heard testimony from Victim 3, Victim 5, and Victim 6. Pennsylvania Attorney General <b>Linda</b> Kelly <b>said</b> that during the investigation there was an [...] "uncooperative atmosphere" [...] {{from some of the}} officials.|$|R
