An econometric framework is proposed that accommodates the stylized fact of extreme values in the forecast error series. We find that between 1998 and 2010, the strategy of taking a <b>long</b> (<b>short)</b> <b>position</b> in stocks with the most pessimistic (optimistic) I/B/E/S forecast has an annual risk-adjusted return of 16. 56 per cent before transaction costs. The robust method used to predict this pessimism (optimism) and the one-week investment horizon are the key drivers of the strategy's profitability. status: publishe...|$|E

Because of {{the unique}} business environment in Japan, there is a widely held view that parent-only data provides a better means for assessing {{the value of the}} entire firm. We find that both parent-only and subsidiary earnings are important in predicting future consolidated earnings. However, while stock prices accurately reflect the persistence of parent-only earnings, the Japanese stock market appears to underestimate the persistence of subsidiary earnings, causing a significant positive relation between changes in subsidiary earnings in year "t" and stock returns in year "t"+ 1. This relation between subsidiary earnings and future stock returns does not persist beyond year "t" 7 plus; 1. Taking a <b>long</b> (<b>short)</b> <b>position</b> in firms with large, positive (negative) changes in subsidiary earnings results in an average annual abnormal return of 7. 06 % with positive returns in 12 of the 13 years in the test period.

Because of their substantial impact on environment, energy sector firms convey a particular status in the environmental–financial performance question, as compared with firms outside this sector. We use the environmental scores compiled by Kinder, Lyndenberg, and Domini Research and Analytics to construct two portfolios that differ in their environmental performance. We find that, between 2000 and 2011, energy sector firms with good environmental performance financially outperform energy sector firms with poor environmental performance. A portfolio strategy with a <b>long</b> (<b>short)</b> <b>position</b> in energy sector firms with good (poor) environmental performance generates an annual abnormal return of 9. 624 % after correcting for market, size, book-to-market and momentum risks. For firms outside the energy sector, {{the performance of the}} two portfolios is statistically insignificant. Using the VIX index, we also show that the market does not reward environmental performance of energy sector firms in periods of high financial uncertainty. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the {{phenomenon known as}} accrual anomaly in Brazil. In particular, we examine two hypotheses: (a) that the earnings expectation included in the stock price fails to reflect the difference in persistence of the earnings components (accruals and cash flows); and (b) that {{the construction of a}} hedge portfolio by taking a <b>long</b> (<b>short)</b> <b>position</b> in assets with low (high) accruals generates consistently abnormal returns. The data set includes nonfinancial firms listed on the BM&FBOVESPA between 1990 and 2008. The empirical tests required conducting panel data regressions to identify the persistence of earnings and their components; the Mishkin test to identify whether the market rationally prices earnings; and the composition of a zero-investment (hedge) portfolio to analyze whether a trading strategy based on accruals consistently provides abnormal positive returns. The results indicate that the accrual component is not mispriced by the Brazilian market, and that a trading strategy based on accruals does not provide consistently positive returns. Although this evidence does not encourage arbitrage, the results are relevant from various perspectives. The methodology applied permitted identifying the quality of earnings and of their components, as well as association between the components of earnings and returns...|$|E

This essay {{examines}} {{what causes}} the significant negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and subsequent stock returns, {{as shown by}} Ang et al. (2006 a, 2006 b). Our analyses demonstrate that this negative relation is driven by monthly return reversals as documented in the previous literature (e. g. Jegadeesh (1990)). The abnormal positive returns from taking a <b>long</b> (<b>short)</b> <b>position</b> in the low (high) idiosyncratic risk portfolio are fully explained by an additional control variable, the "winners minus losers" portfolio returns, introduced to the conventional three- or four-factor time-series regression model. The cross-sectional regressions confirm that no significant relation exists between idiosyncratic risk and expected returns once we control for return reversals. Dissertation Essay II. There are two approaches to explain the short-term return reversals. Liquidity hypothesis argues that non-informational trades generate return reversals and informational trades cause return continuations. While overreaction hypothesis suggests that return reversals are caused by informational trades, and stocks with more firm-specific information exhibit stronger return reversals since investors overreact to firm-specific information. Using idiosyncratic volatility to proxy the amount of firm-specific information contained in prevailing stock trading activities, this study distinguishes the above two explanations by examining the relation between short-term return reversals and idiosyncratic volatility. I find that stocks with more firm-specific information hence higher idiosyncratic volatility display greater return reversals, and this relation is robust after trading volume and illiquidity are controlled.

5000|$|The {{crisis has}} renewed debate {{regarding}} {{the duty of}} financial intermediaries or market-makers such as investment banks to their clients. Intermediaries frequently take <b>long</b> or <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> on securities. They will often assume {{the opposite side of}} a client’s position to complete a transaction.

It is also typical that those clients taking the <b>long</b> or <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> do not know the identity of the other. The role of the intermediary is widely understood by the sophisticated investors that typically enter into complex transactions like synthetic CDO. However, when an intermediary is trading on its own account and not merely hedging financial exposures created in its market-maker role, potential conflicts of interest arise. For example, if an investment bank has a significant bet that a particular asset class will decline in value and has taken the <b>short</b> <b>position,</b> does it have a duty to reveal the nature of these bets to clients who are considering taking the long side of the bet?
