40|$|The {{performance}} of several bridge deck fastening systems is being evaluated on the steel bridge at the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST) at the Transportation Technology Center, Pueblo, Colorado. Fastening systems tested to date include several variations using hook bolts, {{as well as}} spring clips. Results to date indicate that minor, inexpensive installation details can lead to significant increases in time required between maintenance. Details {{such as the use}} of double nuts and threaded fastener adhesive has proven to be particularly effective. At FAST, more than 500 million gross tons (MGT) of traffic passed over the bridge before tightening was required after this retrofit was applied. Other hardware details, {{such as the use of}} <b>locking</b> <b>clips,</b> can also increase time between maintenance; particularly in high-impact areas near rail joints. <b>Locking</b> <b>clips</b> have proven to extend maintenance cycles at FAST. But, some other hardware variations offered little or no benefit under the heavy axle load (HAL) traffic at FAST. Results for eight different deck fastener combinations are presented in this paper. Advantages and drawbacks, as well as failure modes, are noted based on the test experience at FAST. The bridge deck at FAST is a Conrail open-deck design with dapped oak ties. The deck has carried over 1, 200 MGT of 315, 000 -pound HAL traffic since installation in lat...|$|R

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: The equine small intestine {{can be affected}} {{by a variety of}} disorders that may require some form of bypass or anastomosis. Many suture patterns have been used in equine anastomoses to minimise post operative complications, which include leakage from the anastomosis site, stenosis and adhesions. Because of the critical condition of horses undergoing colic surgery, it is imperative this is performed as quickly as possible. Objectives: To evaluate, in vitro, differences in the time of execution and leakage pressure between the Lembert single layer (Lsl), Gambee and Lembert double layer suture patterns for intestinal anastomosis in the horse and correlate the time taken to complete the anastomosis and hemicircumference of the anastomotic site Methods: Small intestinal loops immersed in polyionic solution were anastomosed with one of the 3 suture patterns. The intestines were insufflated via a flexible rubber hose, connected to a pressure gauge, inserted into the lumen at one end and fixed at 25 cm fromthe anastomosis site with a <b>locking</b> <b>clip</b> and, using a tube fixed in the same manner at the other end connected to a sphygmomanometer bulb, the pressure at which leakage from the anastomosis site was revealed by the presence of bubbles. Results: The time spent in the execution of the Lembert single layer was significantly less than that for both Gambee and Lembert double layer The leakage pressure of Lembert single layer was significantly higher than that recorded for both Gambee and Lembert double layer Conclusions and potential relevance: This study shows that the continuous Lsl pattern takes less time to execute and fails at higher pressures than the Lembert double layer or Gambee patterns...|$|E

40|$|Dramatic {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in NASA s Whole Blood Staining Device (WBSD) since it was last described in "Whole-Blood-Staining Device," NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 23, No. 10 (October 1999), page 64. The new system has a longer shelf life, a simpler and more effective operational procedure, improved interface with instrumentation, and shorter processing time. More specifically, the improvements have targeted bag and <b>locking</b> <b>clip</b> materials, sampling ports, and air pocket prevention. The WBSD stains whole blood collected during spaceflight for subsequent flow cytometric analysis. In short, the main device stains white blood cells by use of monoclonal antibodies conjugated to various fluorochromes, followed by lysing and fixing of the cells by use of a commercial reagent that has been diluted according to NASA safety standards. This system is compact, robust, and does not require electric power, precise mixing, or precise incubation times. Figure 1 depicts the present improved version for staining applications, which is a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) bag with a Luer-lock port and plastic locking clips. An InterLink (or equivalent) intravenous- injection port screws into the Luer-lock port. The inflatable/collapsible nature of the bag facilitates loading and helps to minimize the amount of air trapped in the fully loaded bag. Some additional uses have been identified for the device beyond whole blood staining. The WBSD has been configured for functional assays that require culture of live cells by housing sterile culture media, mitogens, and fixatives prior to use [Figure 2 (a) ]. Simple injection of whole blood allows cell-stimulation culture to be performed in reduced gravity conditions, and product stabilization prior to storage, while protecting astronauts from liquid biohazardous materials. Also, the improved WBSD has reconstituted powdered injectable antibiotics by mixing them with diluent liquids [Figure 2 (b) ]. Although such mixing can readily be performed on Earth by shaking in glass vials, it cannot readily be performed this way in outer space without entraining air bubbles. The present device can be preloaded with the powder and diluent(s) in separate compartments. The powder and diluent(s) can be mixed, without introducing air bubbles, by removing the clip(s), then shaking. This use of the device could also be advantageous in terrestrial applications because it maintains the isolation of the constituents until the time of use...|$|E
5000|$|Robby's bulky {{barrel-shaped}} torso (a sly {{reference to}} Bob Kinoshita's earlier {{job as a}} washing machine designer) featured a front panel fitted with a rectangular flap at the top (into which samples of any substance could be inserted for Robby to analyse and replicate); underneath the slot were two rotating discs fitted with small flashing lights and below that a row of five buttons that moved in and out. Robby's thick, stubby arms were connected to his body with plastic ball-joints that fitted into matching sockets in the torso, allowing the joints {{a small amount of}} rotational movement. The arms could also be slightly extended and this section was covered with a concertina-type tubular rubber sheath. Robby's three-fingered hands were also made of rubber, finished with metallic paint. The chest section attached to the leg section with special <b>locking</b> <b>clips.</b> The bottom section of the suit hinged {{at the top of the}} legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps). Robby's legs were made from interlocking globes of vacuum-formed plastic which were connected by internal jointing that permitted the entire leg to bend slightly but cleverly concealed the movement of the hips and knees of the human operator inside.|$|R

40|$|The project Concurrency Control Protocol for Clipping Indexing {{deals with}} the multidimensional databases. In multidimensional {{indexing}} trees, the overlapping of nodes will tend to degrade query performance, as one single point query may need to traverse multiple branches of the tree if the query point is in an overlapped area. Multidimensional databases are beginning {{to be used in}} a wide range of applications. To meet this fast-growing demand, the R-tree family is being applied to support fast access to multidimensional data, for which the R+-tree exhibits outstanding search performance. In order to support efficient concurrent access in multiuser environments, concurrency control mechanisms for multidimensional indexing have been proposed. However, these mechanisms cannot be directly applied to the R+-tree because an object in the R+-tree may be indexed in multiple leaves. This paper proposes a concurrency control protocol for R-tree variants with object <b>clipping,</b> namely, Granular <b>Locking</b> for <b>clipping</b> indexing (GLIP). GLIP is the first concurrency control approach specifically designed for the R+-tree and its variants, and it supports efficient concurrent operations with serializable isolation, consistency, and deadlock-free. Experimental tests on both real and synthetic data sets validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed concurrent access framewor...|$|R

Nevertheless, on the record's sound, AllMusic's Ned Raggett states: [...] "The rough, <b>clipped,</b> <b>lock</b> {{and load}} {{style of the}} band remained essentially unchanged at heart -- Broadrick's brawling, echoed vocals, the sheer impact of the guitars and drum machine beats, Green's uneasy bass. Still, some of the singing is Broadrick's most conventional, some of the riffing almost epically classic rock, and the technical/digital pulse {{at the heart of}} the band sufficiently straightforward enough not to annoy those who can't stand the idea of a non-human drummer." [...] According to The Quietus, the album [...] "returned to the super-dense riffery of their debut but also saw a widening melodic strain that would come to full bloom in Broadrick’s post-Godflesh act Jesu."

Electrodes were connected to his head through a wire that could be seen connecting from the ceiling to a cap on his head and another wire was connected to the calf of his right leg. Reed was not seen to look at anyone and he declined to state any last words. He had earlier also declined to opt for a last meal or any spiritual advisor.

40|$|Background: Lack of {{availability}} of interlocked nails made plate osteosynthesis {{the first choice}} of treatment of forearm fractures inspite of more surgical exposure, periosteal stripping and big skin incision subsequent scar along with higher risk of refracture on implant removal. We hereby report the first 12 cases with 19 forearm bone fractures internally fixed by indegenous interlocked nail. Materials and Methods: Existing square nails were modified to have a broad proximal end of 5. 5 mm with a hole for locking screw of 2. 5 mm. The nail has a distal hole of 1 / 1. 2 / 1. 5 mm in 2. 5 / 3 / 3. 5 mm diameter nail, respectively. A new method of distal <b>locking</b> with a <b>clip</b> made of k wire is designed. The clip after insertion into the bone and hole in nail and opposite cortex snuggly fits the bone providing a secure locking system. Twelve skeletally mature patients, mean age 32 years (range 24 - 45 years) with 19 diaphyseal fractures of the forearm were treated with this indigenously made new nail. The patient were evaluated for fracture union, functional recovery and complications. The functional outcome was assessed by disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH score). Results: Time to radiographic union ranged between 12 and 28 weeks, with a 100 % union rate. Complications were minimal, with mild infection in open fracture (n= 1) and delayed union (n= 1) in patient with comminuted fracture of the ulna only. The clinical results were excellent. The DASH score ranged between 0 and 36 points. Conclusion: This new interlocking nail may be considered as an alternative to plate osteosynthesis for fractures of the forearm in adults. The advantages are benefit of closed reduction, smaller residual scar, reduced cost and early union with allowance of immediate movements...|$|R
