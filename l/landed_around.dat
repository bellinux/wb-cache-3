5|$|The Battle of Isurava (also {{sometimes}} referred to as the Battle of Isurava– Abuari or the Battle of Isuraba) took place over the period 26 to 31 August 1942. Forming part of the Kokoda Track campaign of the Second World War, the battle involved military forces from Australia, supported by the United States, fighting against Japanese troops from Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment who had <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Buna and Gona in Papua mid-July 1942, with the intent of capturing Port Moresby to the south via the overland route.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} regrouped at Pyongtaek itself, {{mostly a}} mass of disorganized soldiers without leadership. Engineers with the battalion demolished a bridge north of the town before moving south. The remains of A Company then headed for Cheonan, regrouping there {{with the rest of}} the 1st and 3rd Battalions which had also withdrawn. Though a few jeeps and trucks were found and commandeered, most of the retreat was carried out on foot. A few scattered artillery shells <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> the retreating force, but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them. By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out of immediate danger.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September 1942, the 16th Brigade, {{under the}} command of Brigadier John Lloyd, and other {{elements}} of the division were sent to New Guinea to reinforce and relieve the Militia 30th Brigade and the 7th Division units that had been fighting a desperate holding action on the Kokoda Track since July. The campaign to that point had consisted of a series of battles fought along the track after the Japanese had <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Buna and pushed south towards Port Moresby, but were checked at Ioribaiwa. The divisional headquarters opened at Port Moresby on 19 September and the 16th Brigade arrived three days later; the 17th Brigade was sent to Milne Bay, to relieve the 18th Brigade following the successful defensive action they had fought earlier in the month. As the Japanese, having reached the extent of their supply lines, began to withdraw from Ioribaiwa, the Australians went on the offensive, pursuing them back north towards Buna.|$|E

5|$|The Komori Force {{was also}} {{directed}} to withdraw on 24February {{as part of}} the general Japanese retreat from western New Britain. The Japanese immediately began to leave their positions, and headed north along inland trails to join other units. The Americans did not detect this withdrawal until 27February, when an attack conducted by the 2ndSquadron, 112thCavalry and the Marine tank company to clear the Arawe area of Japanese encountered no opposition. The Director Task Force subsequently established a number of observation posts along the southern coast of New Britain and increased the distances covered by its reconnaissance patrols. Komori fell behind his unit, and was killed on 9April near San Remo on New Britain's north coast when he, his executive officer and two enlisted men they were travelling with were ambushed by a patrol from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, which had <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Volupai and captured Talasea, on the Willaumez Peninsula, in early March.|$|E
5|$|In early February, {{acclimatisation}} {{training was}} conducted until the battalion's heavy equipment arrived in camp, including Bren carriers and trucks, when section level and platoon tactical training began. This increased in complexity and progressed to company-level exercises, culminating in battalion offensive manoeuvres. Leave was granted {{for the soldiers}} to visit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. This ceased mid-March, when the battalion was ordered to cross the Suez Canal and take up positions west of the port of Tobruk to complete training prior to relieving the 6th Division in the desert. As British troops advanced west, pushing the Italians back through Libya during Operation Compass, plans were made for the 9th Division to move forward. In the end, {{only part of the}} division advanced past Tobruk and, due to lack of transport, the 24th Brigade garrisoned the port itself. In early April the advance turned into a withdrawal as Axis forces, bolstered by the arrival of the Afrika Korps, which had <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Tripoli, launched a determined counter-attack. The 9th Division, along with the Australian 18th Brigade, from the 7th Division, withdrew intact to Tobruk, and within a week the advancing Axis forces had placed the strategic port under siege. The 2/43rd would remain there, manning defences, mounting patrols and conducting raids, for the next six months.|$|E
5|$|The 26th {{was then}} {{deployed}} to the Soraken Plantation area, using {{a series of}} amphibious landings to clear the area before a brief rest after which they began clearing north towards Ratsua and Ruri Bay, taking over from the 55th/53rd Battalion. Determined Japanese resistance along the Ratsua front resulted in an amphibious landing by a company from the 31st/51st Battalion around Porton Plantation, {{in an effort to}} outflank Ratsua. Following a series of mishaps, the company that <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Porton became heavily engaged, and while efforts were made to evacuate them, the 26th Battalion {{and the rest of the}} 31st/51st Battalion attempted to break through from Ratsua. They were unable to penetrate the Japanese lines, however, as they came up against Japanese defenders that were determined to resist because they were unable to withdraw any further along the peninsula. In late June, the 26th Battalion was relieved by the 27th Battalion and sent back to Torokina for rest. Hostilities ceased in August, and the following month the 26th Battalion was sent to Rabaul for garrison duty. In December, Lieutenant Colonel Allan Cameron took command of the battalion.|$|E

25|$|In early November, US {{forces had}} <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Cape Torokina and {{established}} a beachhead, as part of Allied efforts to advance towards the main Japanese base around Rabaul, the isolation and reduction {{of which was a}} key objective of Operation Cartwheel. Facing the American beachhead at Cape Torokina were troops of the Japanese 17th Army, commanded by General Harukichi Hyakutake, the main elements of which were drawn from Lieutenant General Masatane Kanda's 6th Division. In response, the Japanese attempted a counter landing at Koromokina Lagoon, and began moving reinforcements north from southern Bougainville.|$|E
25|$|Lae fell {{more quickly}} than the Allies {{expected}} {{and as a result}} a follow up operation was mounted to secure the Huon Peninsula later in the month. Landing at Scarlet Beach in the first wave, two companies from the 2/13th secured the main beachhead while two others were also <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Siki Cove {{on the first day of}} the operation. By October, the battalion occupied a position north of Langemak Bay which stretched in a dog-leg from Simbang north to Tirimoro. They were later involved in defending the beachhead against a Japanese counter-attack, and then the subsequent Australian advance inland as the Japanese withdrew towards Sio.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{estimated}} US {{strength in}} the area to be between 5,000 and 10,000 troops; in reality over 14,000 troops had been <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Cape Torokina on the first day. These were followed by another 3,500 on 6 November. These troops were drawn from Major General Allen H. Turnage's 3rd Marine Division, which had landed as part of Rear Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's Third Fleet Amphibious Forces. Following the initial landing operations, Turnage, assisted by Brigadier General Oscar R. Cauldwell, had been in tactical command of the US troops ashore while Lieutenant General Alexander A. Vandegrift returned to Guadalcanal with Wilkinson. As Japanese resistance to the landing petered out, Turnage began reorganizing his forces around the perimeter, establishing patrols and unloading supplies, and commencing important base development work.|$|E

25|$|The {{next major}} Allied attack was the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (Operation Husky). Montgomery considered the initial {{plans for the}} Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander Mediterranean, and General Alexander, the 15th Army Group commander, to be unworkable because of the dispersion of effort. He managed to have the plans recast to concentrate the Allied forces, having Lieutenant General George Patton's US Seventh Army land in the Gulf of Gela (on the Eighth Army's left flank, which <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Syracuse in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near Palermo {{in the west and}} north of Sicily. Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton), took umbrage at what they saw as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag {{had been}} {{suffering}} from a back injury {{and was forced to}} bat at no 7. He was unable to cope with conditions and was dismissed for a duck by James Anderson. The next dismissal, that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was nothing short of bizarre. Dhoni skied a ball off Udal, only for Monty Panesar to miss the chance as it <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> 10 feet from where he was, despite having ample time to position himself to take it. Unbelievably, Dhoni attempted a similar shot two balls later, and Panesar this time successfully held the chance. Some television commentators were actually confused by events believing the second shot by Dhoni to have been a replay of the original incident. Dhoni left the field to a chorus of boos by the crowd, stunned by England’s strikes. At this point, the score was 92/7.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September, three Lockheed C-130 Hercules {{aircraft}} set {{off from}} Jakarta for Peninsula Malaysia, flying low to avoid detection by radar. The following night, {{two of the}} C-130 managed to reach their objective with their onboard PGT paratroopers, who jumped off and <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Labis in Johore (about 100 miles north of Singapore). The remaining C-130 crashed into the Malacca Straits while trying to evade interception by an RAF Javelin FAW 9 launched from RAF Tengah. Due to a lightning storm, the drop of 96 paratroopers was widely dispersed. This resulted in them landing close to 1/10 Gurkhas, who were joined by 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR) stationed near Malacca with 28 (Commonwealth) Brigade. Operations were commanded by 4 Malaysian Brigade, {{but it took a}} month for the security force to capture or kill 90 of the 96 parachutists, for the loss of two men killed during the action.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese had {{captured}} {{the island of}} New Britain in February 1942 after overwhelming the small Australian garrison stationed around Rabaul. The Japanese subsequently built up a large garrison on the island, consisting of around 93,000 men from General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. This became a lynchpin in the defensive barrier that they established following the failure of attempts to capture Port Moresby in late 1942. In December 1943, as part of Operation Cartwheel, US forces <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Cape Gloucester and Arawe to capture vital airfields and to provide the Allies with access through the sea passage between the straits separating New Britain from New Guinea, where during late 1943 the Allies had fought to secure the Huon Peninsula. This formed part of the overarching Allied strategy of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul, {{as it had been}} decided that rather than destroying the base with a costly direct assault, a more prudent strategy would be to surround the base and therefore nullify it as a threat.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{many members of the}} battalion volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and were allocated to the 2/3rd Battalion, with whom they served in North Africa, Syria, Greece, Crete and then later in New Guinea. In 1942, following the entry of Japan into the war, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment) was mobilised and brought up to its full wartime establishment with national servicemen. In May 1942 the battalion was sent to Port Moresby, where it joined the rest of the 30th Brigade, to undertake garrison duties. In July the Japanese <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> Gona and as reinforcements were brought up from Australia, elements of the 30th Brigade began a number of delaying actions around Kokoda. In September 1942, the 3rd Battalion was sent up the Kokoda Trail, where it had the distinction of being one of only two militia units to fight alongside its associated AIF unit. Over {{the next couple of months}} it assisted in the recapturing of Kokoda, before participating in the fighting around Buna and Gona. In 1943, the battalion was withdrawn to Australia along with the rest of the 30th Brigade, where it was subsequently disbanded in July and its personnel absorbed into its associated AIF unit, the 2/3rd Battalion.|$|E

He believed that the snow had [...] "all but stopped" [...] and was more concerned about the amount of vehicular traffic, such as sweepers and ploughs, than he was about the snowfall. The second officer of Trump Shuttle Flight 1541, which had <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> the time Flight 405 was taxiing, said their Boeing 727 had [...] "picked up a lot of snow quickly during my post-landing walkaround, but by the finish it seemed to be more rain." [...] He described Flight 405 as a [...] "fairly clean airplane." [...] He said that he could not comment on clear ice, but that the wings and fuselage were clear of snow.|$|E
500|$|After {{they took}} off, they headed towards Barber's Point at the {{southwest}} tip of Oahu, and initially saw an unarmed group of American B-17 Flying Fortress bombers arriving {{from the mainland}} United States. They soon arrived at Ewa Mooring Mast Field, which was being strafed by at least 12 Aichi D3A [...] "Val" [...] dive bombers of the second Japanese attack wave after expending their bomb ordnance at Pearl Harbor. Although the two pilots were outnumbered six-to-one, they immediately began firing on the dive bombers. Taylor shot down two dive bombers {{and was able to}} damage another (the third damaged aircraft was considered Taylor's first probable kill). When both pilots ran out of ammunition, they headed for Wheeler Field to get additional [...]50 cal ammunition, since Haleiwa did not carry any. As he <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> 8:40a.m., he had to avoid friendly anti-aircraft and ground fire. Once he was on the ground, several officers told Taylor and Welch to leave the airplanes, but the two pilots were able to convince the officers into allowing them to keep fighting.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the three}} gliders {{assigned}} to the operation, only two arrived in Normandy; one having to abort and land in England. The remaining two were hit by anti-aircraft fire on their run-in. One <b>landed</b> <b>around</b> [...] away, the other {{at the edge of}} the battery's minefield. The troops from this glider became involved in a fire fight with German troops heading to reinforce the battery garrison. Otway launched the assault as soon as the first glider overshot the battery, ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter, through which the paratroopers attacked. The defenders were alerted by the explosions and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties. Only four men assigned to assault Casemate Four survived long enough to reach it, which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into air vents. The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades as the German crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery. A number of prisoners were taken by the paratroopers, and explosives were then readied to disable the artillery pieces inside the battery. It was discovered that the pieces were not modern 150mm calibre weapons, but were instead Czechoslovakian First World War-era 100mm field howitzers. The paratroopers did the best with the explosives they had, using Gammon bombs to disable one gun and jamming shells into the muzzles of the others. However, the job was less than thorough as at least one gun went back into action when the Germans later re-occupied the battery. Having completed the assault, the paratroopers gathered the German prisoners and their wounded and withdrew, having no wish to remain by the battery. The battalion possessed no radio and if no signal were received by the light cruiser HMS Arethusa, by 05:30, it would begin shelling the battery as a contingency.|$|E
