40|$|Background & Aims: Patients with {{functional}} dyspepsia (FD) often report that their symptoms {{are related to}} food ingestion. However, {{there is a lack}} of information about differences in eating patterns and nutrient intake between these patients and healthy individuals or the association with specific symptoms. We performed a prospective trial to evaluate the relationship between FD symptoms and dietary factors. Methods: Twenty patients with FD (17 women) and 21 healthy subjects (18 women) completed detailed diet diaries, recording all foods eaten, <b>drinks</b> consumed, <b>and</b> times of consumption, as well as the occurrence, timing, and severity of dyspeptic symptoms (ie, nausea, discomfort, fullness, bloating, upper-abdominal/epigastric pain) for 7 days. Data from the diet diaries were analyzed for the number of <b>meals,</b> <b>light</b> <b>meals,</b> snacks <b>and</b> <b>drinks,</b> energy intake, <b>and</b> macronutrient distribution. Results: Patients with FD ate fewer meals (P <. 01) and consumed less total energy (P =. 1) and fat (P =. 1) than healthy subjects. Their symptoms were modest in severity (score out of 10; 5 [range, 3 – 8]) and occurred within 31 minutes (range, 8 – 64 min) of eating. Fullness was related directly to the amount of fat ingested (z, 1. 91; P <. 05) and overall energy intake (z, 2. 12; P <. 05) and related inversely to the amount of carbohydrate ingested (z, − 1. 9; P =. 05). Similarly, bloating was related to the amount of fat ingested (z, 1. 68; P =. 09). There was no significant relationship between symptom severity and any of the dietary variables measured. Conclusions: Management of patients with FD might be improved by instructing them to consume smaller meals with reduced fat content. Amelia N. Pilichiewicz, Michael Horowitz, Gerald J.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two {{electrical}} methods designed to enable rapid, safe and noninvasive measurement of body composition, both for clinical and community use. The first section provides {{a review of}} the literature related to measurement of body composition in humans and outlines the approach of the research project. The second section deals with established methods of determining body composition, the two most important being hydrostatic densitometry and deuterium oxide dilution. In this part of the report, a novel method for measuring lung volume by hydrogen dilution at the time of underwater weighing is described. The main findings of the thesis are contained in the third section which deals with the assessment of body opposition by electrical means. There are two components to this part of the study. The first involved the testing of a commercially available bioelectric impedance analyser (BIA) which measures impedance to a flow of current through the body. Studies on the reproducibility and reliability of measurements were performed. Results showed the importance of correct electrode placement and revealed that subjects can consume a <b>light</b> <b>meal</b> <b>and</b> a <b>drink</b> before being measured with the BIA without adversely affecting impedance readings. Results suggested, however, that subjects empty their bladders before measurements are made. Strong correlations were found between height 2 / resistance and measurements of total body water (r = 0. 839) and fat-free weight derived from densitometry (r = 0. 821), Moderate correlations (r = 0. 6 to 0. 7) were also found when height /resistance was related to fat-free weight derived from anthropometric measurements. The second and major consonant of the third section deals with the development of a method based on the absorption of energy from a weak electromagnetic field established in a capacitor or chamber large enough to accommodate an adult human subject. The method involves measurement of the effect of the body on the electromagnetic field, and is based on differential absorption of energy by body fat and fat-free tissues. Regression equations were developed for predicting the weight of fat and fat-free tissue in the body from measurement of electromagnetic field effects in a test capacitor and in a resonating chamber. The test capacitor comprised a large aluminum cylinder with a copper rod as a central conductor. The following equation was derived for the relationship of fat-free weight (FEW) based on body density, with measurements of change in resonant frequency (ΔfR), height (H) and weight (W) : FFW = - 4. 39 + 0. 690 W + 19. 9 H + 37. 6 ΔfR In a study of 17 subjects, a value of 0. 891 was found for R 2, and S. E. E. was 1. 63. The resonating chamber consisted of a large enclosed aluminium cylinder with a copper rod as a central conductor. The following equation was derived for the relationship of fat weight (FW) based on the mean of estimates from body density and total body water, with measurements of change in signal attenuation (ΔA), change in resonant frequency (ΔfR), and height (H) and weight (W) : FW = 73. 48 + 0. 291 (W/√(ΔA) - 49. 2 H - 0. 53 ΔfR In a study of 27 subjects, a value of 0. 956 was found for R 2, and S. E. E. was 1. 97. In these equations, variables were measured in the following units : FEW, FW and W (kg), ΔfR (MHz) and H (m) ...|$|R
