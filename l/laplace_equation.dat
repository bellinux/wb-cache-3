5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> in the plane, that represent the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E
25|$|The close {{connection}} between the <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> and analytic functions implies that any solution of the <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> has derivatives of all orders, and can be expanded in a power series, at least inside a circle that does not enclose a singularity. This is {{in sharp contrast to}} solutions of the wave equation, which generally have less regularity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> is also {{a special}} case of the Helmholtz equation.|$|E

25|$|Variation {{with respect}} to the {{velocity}} potential Φ(x,z,t) and free-moving surfaces like z=η(x,t) results in the <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> for the potential in the fluid interior and all required boundary conditions: kinematic boundary conditions on all fluid boundaries and dynamic boundary conditions on free surfaces.

25|$|The {{mathematical}} relationships used {{to describe}} the flow of water through porous media are the diffusion and Laplace equations, which have applications in many diverse fields.

25|$|Laplace's {{equation}} and Poisson's equation are {{the simplest}} examples of elliptic partial differential equations. The {{general theory of}} solutions to Laplace's equation is known as potential theory. The solutions of Laplace's equation are the harmonic functions, which are important in many fields of science, notably the fields of electromagnetism, astronomy, and fluid dynamics, {{because they can be}} used to accurately describe the behavior of electric, gravitational, and fluid potentials. In the study of heat conduction, the <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> is the steady-state heat equation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{important}} problems involve {{functions of}} several variables. Solutions of boundary value {{problems for the}} <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation</b> satisfy the Dirichlet principle. Plateau's problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in a solution of soap suds. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical interpretation is far from simple: {{there may be more}} than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} general case, {{inductance}} {{can be calculated}} from Maxwell's equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high frequency currents are considered, with skin effect, the surface current densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the <b>Laplace</b> <b>equation.</b> Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire radius {{and the distribution of}} the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.|$|E
