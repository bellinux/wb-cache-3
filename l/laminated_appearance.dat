40|$|Background: A {{study was}} carried out to explore the {{survival}} of xenogeneic full-thickness retinal transplants in the subretinal space of hosts without immunosuppression. Methods: Nine adult rabbits received a complete immature rat neuroretina in the subretinal space. No immunosuppression was given, and the animals were followed up for 15 or 34 days. The eyes were then examined histologically with hematoxylin and eosin staining {{as well as with}} antibodies against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II, and the retinal pigment antigen RPE- 65. Results. Surviving grafts were found in five out of nine eyes. Three grafts displayed the <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance</b> of a normal retina, and two had developed into rosettes. In four of the five specimens with surviving grafts, the host retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was continuous, and MHC labeling showed no or minimal upregulation. In four specimens, no graft was found. Three of these displayed RPE defects and an increase in MHC class I- and II-labeled cells in the host choroid, subretinal space and host neuroretina. Conclusions: Full-thickness xenogeneic neuroretinal grafts can survive for at least 34 days in an adult host without immunosuppression. Immature grafts can develop the <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance</b> of a normal retina. The integrity of the host RPE seems to correlate with graft survival. We conclude that xenogeneic retinal grafts can survive and develop if the integrity of the donor tissue is intact and if damage to the RPE is minimal...|$|E

40|$|Manganese {{partitioning}} {{and long}} fibrous martensite were obtained in several dual-phase steels by annealing, followed by hot rolling {{in their respective}} intercritical annealing temperature regions. The volume fraction of martensite was varied by changing the intercritical annealing temperature. Long annealing times were required to obtain complete manganese partitioning {{in order to increase}} the strength of the austenite phase and subsequently the martensite phase. Post-roll annealing improves the ductility through ferrite recrystallisation and also by changes to the martensite morphology, however, this results in a decrease in strength. The as-rolled steel shows two distinct work-hardening processes with different exponents and shows a <b>laminated</b> fracture <b>appearance</b> due to the ribbon-like morphology of the martensite...|$|R

40|$|Depriving {{developing}} neurons of retrograde trophic support may disrupt {{their development}} and often {{causes them to}} die. We here report the effects, in chick embryos, of eliminating retrograde support in the isthmo-optic projection by blocking axoplasmic transport in the terminal parts of the axons, which is known ultimately to kill the isthmo-optic neurons. Within only 9 h, this had perturbed the process of cellular reorganisation that eventually leads to the <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance</b> of the mature isthmo-optic nucleus. Neuron survival in the isthmo-optic nucleus was affected even more quickly, but the earliest change, occurring {{in as little as}} 3 h, was not {{an increase in the number}} of dying neurons, but a decrease below control values. This novel effect was still present at 6 and 9 h after the injection, but at longer survival times the number of dying neurons increased well above control values as expected. Our interpretation of the transient decrease in neuronal death is that retrograde trophic signals include both death-promoting and life-promoting components, and that the former act faster in this system...|$|E
40|$|The amelogenesis imperfectas (AI) are {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases {{that result in}} defective development of tooth enamel. Although X-linked, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of AI have been clinically characterized, only two genes (AMELX and ENAM) {{have been associated with}} AI. To date, three enamelin (ENAM) mutations have been identified. These mutations cause phenotypically diverse forms of autosomal dominant AI. Detailed phenotype-genotype correlations have not been performed for autosomal dominant AI due to ENAM mutations. We identified a previously unreported kindred segregating for the ENAM mutation, g. 8344 delG. Light and electron microscopy analyses of unerupted permanent teeth show the enamel is markedly reduced in thickness, lacks a prismatic structure and has a <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance.</b> Taken together these histological features support the enamelin protein as being critical {{for the development of a}} normal enamel thickness and that it likely has a role in regulating c-axis crystallite growth. Because there is growing molecular and phenotypic diversity in the enamelin defects, it is critical to have a nomenclature and numbering system for characterizing these conditions. We present a standardized nomenclature for ENAM mutations that will allow consistent reporting and communication...|$|E
40|$|The geochemical events (negative {{shifts in}} δ 13 C and δ 18 O, and Mn peak) {{associated}} with the "Schistes carton" of Quercy (SW France) {{do not appear to}} be due only to lithological variations and a differential diagenesis. They correspond to the Lower Toarcian global event and seem to be connected to a destabilization phase of gas hydrates. During its oxidation by seawater, the release of methane gas with a very low carbon isotopic ratio (- 60 %) led to the production of CO 2 and carbonates with a negative δ 13 C. The consumption of oxygen in the seawater resulted in conditions that were first dysoxic and then anoxic. The reduction of burrowing and bioturbation associated with this oxidation resulted in the <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance</b> of the "Schistes carton". The decrease in the oxygen content led to a decrease in MnO 2 microparticles present in the water column and sediments. This created a complementary source of Mn 2 + that was incorporated into the carbonates produced during this event. Furthermore, an increase in the average seawater temperature (δ 18 O) appears associated with this event. Finally, the apparent diachronism of geochemical events in the Boreal and the Tethyan realms is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Lhermitte-Duclos disease, {{also known}} as dysplastic {{cerebellar}} gangliocytoma, is a rare cerebellar benign tumor with characteristic appearance of thickened cerebellar folia giving a <b>laminated</b> or striated <b>appearance,</b> quite diagnostic of the condition.

Presence of restricted diffusion {{proved to be a}} useful diagnostic feature for differentiation between the two lesions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} the {{reduction}} in effective elastic constants of composite lami-nates due to matrix cracking is considered. A general easily applicable theory valid for two- and three-dimensional analysis of thin as well as thick laminates is presented. The theory {{is based on the}} change of elastic energy in a <b>laminate</b> at the <b>appearance</b> of a matrix crack in one layer. This information combined with a dilute approximation,i. e., different matrix cracks are considered not to interact with each other, is utilized to estimate the re-duction of elastic constants for a certain crack density. The theory is asymptotically exact for nk &laquo; 1, where nkis the number of cracks per unit thickness of the cracked ply and a correct value of the slope of the stiffness reduction crack density curve is obtained at nk = 0. Comparisons are made between calculated stiffness reductions and experimental data found in the literature. The agreement for the longitudinal Young’s modulus is seen to be satisfactory at least for crack densities up to nk = 0. 5. Comparisons are also made for the inplane Poisson’s ratio. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} its immune privileged state, {{xenotransplantation}} within the CNS is associated with rapid graft destruction in immunocompetent hosts. Efforts to enhance graft survival have mostly focused on host immune response, whereas relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to donor tissue characteristics. In the present paper, we explore long-term survival of xenogeneic full-thickness neuroretinal transplants in immunocompetent hosts and investigate the significance of tissue integrity in relation to graft survival. Adult rabbits receiving no immunosuppression were used as hosts and fetal Sprague-Dawley rat neuroretina as donors. Using vitreoretinal surgical techniques, rabbits received either a full thickness or a fragmented neuroretinal graft to the subretinal space of one eye. Eyes receiving full-thickness grafts were examined morphologically after 91 days and fragmented grafts after 7 - 14 days. Surviving full thickness grafts were found in six of eight eyes, four of which displayed the normal <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance.</b> Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) up-regulation in surviving grafts was minimal and they contained a well-organized photoreceptor layer, protein kinase C (PKC) labeled rod bipolar cells, parvalbumin labeled AII amacrine cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labeled Müller cells. Fragmented grafts (n= 6) were all destroyed or showed severe signs of rejection. A mass of inflammatory cells derived from the choroid was evident in these specimens, and no labeling of retina-specific cells was seen. We conclude that full-thickness rat neuroretina can survive for several months after subretinal transplantation to the subretinal space of immunocompetent rabbits, while fragmented counterparts are rapidly rejected. Surviving full-thickness grafts can develop many of the normal retinal morphological characteristics, indicating a thriving relationship between the initially immature donor tissue and its foreign host. Our results strongly indicate that donor tissue integrity is a crucial factor for graft survival in CNS xenotransplantation...|$|E
40|$|Although neural {{transplantation}} {{has made}} a relatively successful transition from the animal laboratory to human neurosurgery {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease, the use of human embryonic brain tissue as the source of transplants raises difficult ethical and practical problems. These are likely to impede the widespread use of this otherwise promising therapy across the range of types of brain damage to which the results of animal experiments suggest its potential applicability. Various alternative approaches are reviewed briefly, aimed at developing sources of tissue for transplantation that can be maintained in vitro until needed, so obviating the requirement for fresh embryonic tissue at each occasion of surgery. Particularly promising are conditionally immortalized neuroepithelial stem cell lines in which the immortalizing gene is downregulated upon transplantation into a host brain. We describe experiments from our laboratory with the use of cells of this kind, the multipotent MHP clonal cell lines, derived from the developing hippocampus of a transgenic mouse harbouring a temperature-sensitive oncogene. Implanted into the hippocampus of rats and marmosets with damage to the CA 1 cell field, the MHP 36 line gave rise to healthy surviving grafts and to essentially complete recovery of cognitive function. Postmortem study of the implanted rat brains indicated that MHP 36 cells migrate to the region of damage, adopt both neuronal (pyramidal) and glial phenotypes in vivo, and reconstitute the normal <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance</b> of the CA 1 cell field. We have previously shown that, when primary differentiated foetal tissue is used as the source of grafts in rats with CA 1 damage, there is a stringent requirement for replacement with homotypic CA 1 cells. We interpret our results as showing that the MHP 36 cell line responds to putative signals associated with damage to the hippocampus and takes up a phenotype appropriate for the repair of this damage; they therefore open the way {{to the development of a}} novel strategy with widespread applicability to the treatment of the diseased or damaged human brain...|$|E
40|$|In {{many species}} of {{non-human}} mammals the number of growth lines in the dentin and cementum reliably reflects the animal's biological age. In humans only cementum continues to be formed throughout life and usually does not undergo extensive resorption. It also has a <b>laminated</b> <b>appearance.</b> Therefore, {{it is possible that}} the growth lines in human cementum may reflect a person's biological age. [...] The sample investigated includes 25 teeth removed for pathological reasons, 2 teeth removed from one cadaver and 2 teeth from an ancient burial site. The teeth, embedded in Bioplastic, were sectioned at mid-root; then ground and polished, and etched in a solution of detergent and water (0. 6 cc Ivory liquid detergent to 250 cc tap water) for 8 - 24 hours. The prepared specimens were then observed in reflected light and interference contrast. Composite photographs were made of the entire cementum thickness at one location on the tooth's circumference. Lamellae seen in each composite photograph were plotted on a graph where one axis represents the number of visible lamellae and the other axis represents the cumulative thickness of the lamellae. [...] Observations (x 63 objective) of the etched surface revealed the presence of thin (1 / 3 - 3 microns) lamellae in all samples (excepting the two archeological specimens). There was no noticeable difference between the size and appearance of lamellae in pathological and cadaver teeth. Lamellae formed during the first 20 years of cementum deposition are generally more clearly defined than those formed later in life. Older teeth usually have large gaps in the sequence of lamellae seen in the outer half of the cementum thickness. No simple one to one relationship was found between the number of lamellae present and the number of years of cementum deposition. However, teeth with 20 years cementum deposition or less have approximately 4 times as many lamellae as years of deposition. [...] Cementum thickness data obtained in this study was compared with that provided by Zander and Hürzeller (1958). A simple straight-line relationship does not seem to describe adequately the relationship between cementum deposition and age. For the sample examined here, cementum thickness seems to increase at a fairly constant and even rate during the first 20 years of deposition and then level off. [...] Teeth from the same mouth were compared for similarities in their acellular cemental lamellae patterns. None were found. Local conditions seem to have a more direct influence on the cementum than any biological rhythm which might be present. [...] Cementum from young female teeth was compared with that from young male teeth. No differences were found in the size and appearance of the lamellae. However, female teeth showed visible lamellae throughout the entire cementum thickness more often. Male teeth usually showed noticeable discontinuities in the sequence of visible lamellae throughout the cementum thickness...|$|E
