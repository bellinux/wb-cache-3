5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pragmatic way of introducing pre-service teachers to multiple <b>literacies</b> <b>and</b> critical <b>literacy</b> through children 2 ̆ 7 s-literature-based engagements. The concepts of multiple <b>literacies</b> <b>and</b> critical <b>literacy</b> are reviewed, <b>and</b> their interrelationship is explained. Two instructional engagements, which connect theory to practice through children 2 ̆ 7 s books, are then discussed in detail. This paper {{argues that the}} instruction of multiple <b>literacies</b> <b>and</b> critical <b>literacy</b> is aligned with the definition of literacy as multiple social practices, which should be examined critically. In addition, the utilization of children 2 ̆ 7 s books provides a feasible way to help such instruction take root in the classroom...|$|R

5|$|Poedjangga Baroe paid {{subscribers}} {{were always}} fewer than 150. According to historian Heather Sutherland, this low circulation {{was rooted in}} several cultural factors. Firstly, the native populace at the time had limited <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> education. Secondly, native intellectuals mainly spoke Dutch during formal discourse, while others kept to local languages; this led to comprehension issues for the Indonesian-language Poedjangga Baroe.|$|E

5|$|The series {{takes place}} in a {{neighborhood}} inhabited by hand puppets with human qualities, and is shown from the perspective of Oobi. The puppets frequently communicate with the audience and encourage participatory viewing. The characters' dialogue is made up of basic vocabulary and they speak in simple sentences. The show is intended to help preschool-aged viewers build skills such as mathematics, early <b>literacy,</b> <b>and</b> logical thinking.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Courses vary {{in length}} {{from a few}} weeks to two years.

5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had {{replaced it with a}} largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.|$|E
5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal and parental and {{taught how to}} deal with slaveowners and their abuse. King also named <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> religion's role in their education. Kids were taught mutual cooperation as a virtue between slaves. Few slaves had formal education and those who did were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E

She coordinated this {{as a result of}} her many trips abroad where she witnessed how literacy benefited children in poorer nations.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 19th century, all {{education}} in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills {{as well as}} social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders. The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810–28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.|$|E

5|$|The coffeehouse {{became a}} popular place to debate ideas, with growing <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> the {{development}} of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the nobility}} {{there were many}} educated and cultured women, of which Queen Mary is the most obvious example. By the early eighteenth century their {{education}} was expected to include basic <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> numeracy, musical instruments (including lute, viol and keyboard), needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746). There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, {{all of which are}} largely religious in content.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union {{as part of an effort}} to increase <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> numeracy, needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 percent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 percent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.|$|E

Thus,  this article begins with a review of current media literacy research and its emphasis on defining media literacy texts as texts that rely on both print <b>literacies</b> <b>and</b> image <b>literacies.</b> Because graphic novels rely on both print <b>literacies</b> <b>and</b> image <b>literacies,</b> they qualify as media <b>literacy</b> texts <b>and</b> can be taught as such in K- 12 classrooms. Goals: The {{purpose of this article is}} to use current media literacy research to support identifying and teaching graphic novels as media literacy texts in K- 12 classrooms.
