5000|$|One is {{providing}} {{a place to}} monitor water level in the reactor coolant system. Since the reactor coolant system is completely flooded during normal operations, {{there is no point}} in monitoring coolant level in any of the other vessels. But early awareness of a reduction of coolant level (or a loss of coolant) is important to the safety of the reactor core. The pressurizer is deliberately located high in the reactor containment building such that, if the pressurizer has sufficient coolant in it, one can be reasonably certain that all the other vessels of the reactor coolant system (which are below it) are fully flooded with coolant. There is therefore, a coolant level monitoring system on the pressurizer and it is the one reactor coolant system vessel that is normally not full of coolant. The other secondary function is to provide a [...] "cushion" [...] for sudden pressure changes in the reactor coolant system. The upper portion of the pressurizer is specifically designed to NOT contain liquid coolant and a reading of full on the <b>level</b> <b>instrumentation</b> allows for that upper portion to not contain liquid coolant. Because the coolant in the pressurizer is quite hot during normal operations, the space above the liquid coolant is vaporized coolant (steam). This steam bubble provides a cushion for pressure changes in the reactor coolant system and the operators ensure that the pressurizer maintains this steam bubble at all times during operations. Allowing this steam bubble to disappear by filling the pressurizer to the top with liquid coolant is called letting the pressurizer [...] "go hard" [...] meaning there is no cushion and any sudden pressure change can provide a hammer effect to the entire reactor coolant system. Some facilities also call this letting the pressurizer [...] "go solid," [...] although solid simply refers to being completely full of liquid and without a [...] "steam bubble." ...|$|E

Conventional capacity measurement approaches based on high-level performance metrics like response time and throughput may result in either resource over-provisioning or lack of responsiveness. It is because a website may have different capacities {{in terms of the}} maximum concurrent level when the characteristic of workload changes. Moreover, bottleneck in a multi-tier website may shift among tiers as client access pattern changes.

A decision tree is induced over a group of coordinated Bayesian models in different tiers to identify the bottleneck dynamically when the system is overloaded.

40|$|Merging {{chemical}} and biomolecular sensors with silicon integrated circuits {{has the potential}} to push complex electronics into a low-cost, portable platform, greatly simplifying system- <b>level</b> <b>instrumentation</b> and extending the reach and functionality of point of use technologies. One such class of sensor, the thin-film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR), has a micron-scale size and low gigahertz frequency range that is ideally matched with modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. An FBAR sensor can enable label-free detection of analytes in real time, and CMOS integration can overcome the measurement complexity and equipment cost normally required for detection with acoustic resonators. This thesis describes a body of work conducted to integrate an array of FBAR sensors with an active CMOS substrate. A monolithic fabrication method is developed, which allows for FBAR devices to be built directly on the top surface of the CMOS chip through post-processing. A custom substrate is designed and fabricated in 0. 18 Âµm CMOS to support oscillation and frequency measurement for each sensor site in a 6 Ã— 4 array. The fabrication of 0. 8 - 1. 5 GHz FBAR devices is validated for both off-chip and on-chip devices, and the integrated system is characterized for sensitivity and limit of detection. On-chip, parallel measurement of multiple sensors in real time is demonstrated for a quantitative vapor sensing application, and the limit of detection is below 50 ppm. This sensor platform could be used for a broad scope of label-free detection applications in chemistry, biology, and medicine, and it demonstrates potential for enabling a low-cost, point of use instrument...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”It {{has been}} {{foreseen}} {{that some of}} the roles assumed by conventional rotating hard disk drives (HDDs) will migrate to solid-state drives (SSDs) and emerging persistent RAM storages. New persistent RAM storages have critical advantages over HDDs and even SSDs in terms of performance and power. Persistent RAM technologies are flexible enough to be used for both storage and main memoryâ€”in future platforms, this flexibility will allow tighter integration of a systemâ€™s memory and storage hierarchy. On the other hand, designers are faced with new technical issues to address to fully exploit the benefits of persistent RAM technologies and hide their downsides. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (PeRsIstent RAM Storage Monitor) â€”our novel infrastructure that enables exploring various design trade-offs of persistent RAM storage. PRISM allows designers to examine a persistent RAM storageâ€™s lowlevel behavior and evaluate its various architectural organizations while running realistic workloads, as well as storage activities of a contemporary off-the-shelf OS. PRISM builds on kernel source code <b>level</b> <b>instrumentation</b> and the standard Linux device driver mechanism to generate persistent RAM storage traces. Moreover, PRISM includes a storage architecture simulator to faithfully model major persistent RAM storage hardware components. To illustrate how and with what PRISM can help the user, we present a case study that involves running an OLTP (on-line transaction processing) workload. PRISM successfully provides the detailed performance analysis results, while incurring acceptable overheads. Based on our experience, we believe that PRISM is a versatile tool for exploring persistent RAM storage design choices ranging from OS-level resource management policy down to chip-level storage organization.

40|$|In {{a complex}} multi-developer, multi-package {{software}} environment, {{such as the}} ATLAS offline Athena framework, tracking {{the performance of the}} code can be a non-trivial task in itself. In this paper we describe improvements in the instrumentation of ATLAS offline software that have given considerable insight into the performance of the code and helped to guide optimisation. Code can be instrumented firstly using the PAPI tool, which is a programing interface for accessing hardware performance counters. PAPI events can count floating point operations, cycles and instructions and cache accesses. Triggering PAPI to start/stop counting for each algorithm and processed event gives a good understanding of the whole algorithm level performance of ATLAS code. Further data can be obtained using pin, a dynamic binary instrumentation tool. Pintools can be used to obtain similar statistics as PAPI, but advantageously without requiring recompilation of the code. Fine grained routine and instruction <b>level</b> <b>instrumentation</b> is also possible. Pintools can additionally interrogate the arguments to functions, like those in linear algebra libraries, so that a detailed usage profile can be obtained. These tools have charaterised the extensive use of vector and matrix operations in ATLAS tracking. Currently, CLHEP is used here, which is not an optimal choice. To help evaluate replacement libraries a testbed has been setup allowing comparison of the performance of different linear algebra libraries (including CLHEP, Eigen and SMatrix/SVector). Results are then presented via the ATLAS Performance Management Board framework, which runs daily with the current development branch of the code and monitors reconstruction and Monte-Carlo jobs. This framework analyses the CPU and memory performance of algorithms and an overview of results are presented on a web page.
