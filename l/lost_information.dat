5000|$|DNA {{crosslinks}} generally cause loss {{of overlapping}} sequence {{information from the}} two strands of DNA. Therefore, accurate repair of the damage depends on retrieving the <b>lost</b> <b>information</b> from an undamaged homologous chromosome in the same cell. Retrieval can occur by pairing with a sister chromosome produced during a preceding round of replication. In a diploid cell retrieval may also occur by pairing with a non-sister homologous chromosome, as occurs especially during meiosis. [...] Once pairing has occurred, the crosslink can be removed and correct information introduced into the damaged chromosome {{by the process of}} homologous recombinational repair.|$|E

50|$|In practice, {{finding the}} true PSF is impossible, and usually an {{approximation}} {{of it is}} used, theoretically calculated or based on some experimental estimation by using known probes. Real optics may also have different PSFs at different focal and spatial locations, and the PSF may be non-linear. The accuracy of the approximation of the PSF will dictate the final result. Different algorithms can be employed to give better results, {{at the price of}} being more computationally intensive. Since the original convolution discards data, some algorithms use additional data acquired at nearby focal points to make up some of the <b>lost</b> <b>information.</b> Regularization in iterative algorithms (as in expectation-maximization algorithms) can be applied to avoid unrealistic solutions.|$|E

The first used five experiments with dichoptic masking, energy masking, the lexical decision task, and the Stroop effect to investigate perception without awareness. Marcel notably used dichoptic stimulus-onset asynchrony pattern masking to show that as the interval between presentations of a target stimulus and following mask is reduced, subjects progressively <b>lost</b> <b>information</b> regarding the target stimulus. In his second 1983 publication, Marcel differentiates between perceptual processing and awareness, distinguishing between the effects of energy masking and backward pattern masking.|$|E
