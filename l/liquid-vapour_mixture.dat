40|$|International audienceThe {{simulation}} of cavitating flows is a challenging problem {{both in terms}} of modelling the physics and developing robust numerical methodologies. Such flows are characterized by important variations of the local Mach number and involve thermodynamic phase transition. To simulate these flows by applying homogeneous models, an appropriate equation of state (EOS) is necessary to cover all possible fluid states (pure liquid, two-phase mixture and pure vapour). Moreover, the numerical method has to handle any Mach number accurately. This paper presents a one-fluid compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS) solver with a preconditioning scheme. The cavitation phenomenon is modelled by two different <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture</b> EOS. The mathematical and thermodynamic properties are studied.

40|$|Potential {{explosion}} hazards {{arising from}} releases {{of natural gas}} are now reasonably well understood, but the hazards exhibited by two-phase <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixtures</b> are often overlooked. A number of explosions believed to be two-phase in nature have occurred within the process industries, so emphasizing the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms which contribute to aerosol explosions. It has been predicted that an aerosol containing droplets within the so-called ‘transition‘ range, typically between 7 − 15 μm, may burn faster than an optimally mixed homogeneous vapour/air mixture. Other models predict that the burning velocity attained for a gaseous mixture is the maximum attainable. A few experimental publications discuss the generation and combustion of fuel aerosols, but have failed to examine the area of most interest. This paper reviews previous theoretical, experimental and computational approaches relating aerosol explosions, and presents a research strategy suitable for progression towards robust quantification of this category of explosion...|$|R

In many cases, for practical and/or economical reasons, the use of aqueous solutions of ILs would be preferable to their use as pure compounds. In this work, high pressure equilibrium data for the {carbon dioxide (CO 2) + tri-iso-butyl(methyl) phosphonium tosylate [iBu 3 MeP][TOS] + water system were measured at temperatures ranging from (276 to 370) K and pressures up to 100 MPa. Measurements were performed using a high-pressure cell with a sapphire window that allows direct observation of the <b>liquid–vapour</b> transition. <b>Mixtures</b> with different IL concentrations were studied in order to check the influence of the amount of IL on the solubility of CO 2 in the aqueous mixture. The results show that the presence of IL enhances the solubility of CO 2 in the (IL + water) system revealing a salting-in effect of the IL on the solubility of CO 2. The appearance of a three phase region was observed for IL concentrations higher than 4 mol% of IL in water when working at pressures between 4 and 8 MPa and temperatures between (280 and 305) K. In this range, the upper limit of the VLE region observed is shown to increase with the temperature being almost independent of the IL initial concentration in the mixture...|$|R
40|$|Almost all {{automotive}} {{fuel injection systems}} are experiencing some form of cavitation within their nozzle under different operating conditions. In-nozzle cavitation initiates in various forms and directly influences the emerging spray. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} cavitation in diesel injectors leads to smaller droplet formation, especially by the on-going trend towards higher injection pressures, which enhances fuel evaporation but also creates undesirable consequences due to transient nature of cavitation such as spray instabilities, erosion on internal surfaces, and hydraulic flip. Thus, the understanding of the internal flow of {{automotive fuel}} injectors is critical for injector design. On the other hand, biodiesel has {{emerged as one of the}} potential alternative fuel which can also be carbon neutral because it uptakes CO 2 during cultivation of its feedstock and can be used in existing diesel engines with little or no modifications. Therefore, the present study is focused on assessing and outlining cost-effective methods to analyse internal flow in fuel injectors for diesel and biodiesel fuel applications. In the present study, RANS-based (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes) CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) approach has been chosen to simulate quasi-steady flows in the steady state test rigs of fuel injectors of IC engines. The RANS approach is selected over computationally expensive SAS (Scale Adaptive Simulations), DES (Detached Eddy Simulations) and LES (Large Eddy Simulations) because it was considered that these quasi-steady simulations could be performed within hours and with less computing resources using RANS rather using SAS, DES and LES which may require orders more time and computing resources. Cavitation models and RANSbased turbulence models have been evaluated for single-hole and multi-hole injectors operating on steady state test rigs. Furthermore, influences of liquid and vapour compressibility were also investigated. Influences of biodiesel properties such as higher viscosity and density on cavitation were also assessed. In the first part of the study, single-phase simulations have been carried out in the mini-sac type multi-hole (6) injector. Several two-equation turbulence and near wall models were assessed, amongst most appropriate for the application were identified. Predicted mean velocity and RMS velocity were compared with measurements and showed good agreements. Flow field analysis showed predictions of different types of vortices in the injector. Two main types of vortex structures were predicted: ‘Hole-to-hole’ connecting vortex and double ‘counterrotating’ vortices emerging from the needle wall and entering the injector hole facing it. The latter create a complex 3 D flow inside the injector hole when it interacts with the recirculation region at the entrance of the injector hole. Cavitation simulations inside a single-hole injector were next performed. Simulations were assessed by comparing predicted vapour volume fraction with measurements. Influences of liquid and vapour compressibility were also checked. The compressibility of vapour was modelled using ideal gas law and liquid compressibility was modelled using the Tait equation. Vapour compressibility resulted in an increase of vapour volume fraction at the low-pressure region and predictions were also in better agreements with experimental data. The liquid compressibility made no impact on the simulation results. The local sonic speed in the <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture</b> was computed using Wallis model which predicted a very low local sonic speed in the <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture.</b> Therefore, the local flow in <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture</b> became supersonic. A normal shock wave was predicted just downstream of the cavitation bubble cloud as local flow velocity was reduced from supersonic to subsonic. Finally, the cavitation simulations were performed in the enlarged mini-sac type multi-hole injector. Established turbulence, cavitation and compressibility models from above studies were used. Reasonable quantitative agreements with experimental data were obtained for the mean axial velocity and RMS velocity. Reasonable qualitative agreements were also achieved when predicted cavitation results were compared with high-speed digital images. Henceforth a parametric study to assess the influence of biodiesel fuel properties such as an increase in viscosity and density on the cavitation was performed. Viscosity and density of both phases in the fluid were parametrically increased by 20...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase flows are {{commonly}} found in many industries, especially in systems, where efficient and correct functioning depend on specific values of flow parameters. In thermal engineering and chemical technology the most popular types of two-phase mixture are gas-liquid or liquid-vapour mixtures. Bubbles can create in flow different structures and determine diverse properties of flow (velocity of phase, void fraction, fluctuations of pressure, pipe vibrations, etc.). That type of flow is difficult to observe, especially in <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture,</b> where vapour is being made by heating the medium. Production of vapour and nucleation process are very complicated issues, which are important part of two-phase flow phenomenon. Gas-liquid flow structures were observed and described with figures, but type of structure depends on many parameters. Authors of this paper made an attempt to simulate gas-liquid flow with air and water. In the paper there was presented specific test stand built to observe two-phase flow structures, methodology of experiment and conditions which were maintained during observation.

40|$|International audienceExact {{compressible}} one-dimensional nozzle flow solutions at {{steady state}} are determined in various limit situations of two-phase liquid-gas mixtures. First, the exact solution for a pure liquid nozzle flow is determined {{in the context}} of fluids governed by the compressible Euler equations and the `stiffened gas' equation of state. It is an extension of the well-known ideal-gas steady nozzle flow solution. Various two-phase flow models are then addressed, all corresponding to limit situations of partial equilibrium among the phases. The first limit situation corresponds to the two-phase flow model of Kapila et al. (Phys. Fluids, vol. 13, 2001, pp. 3002 - 3024), where both phases evolve in mechanical equilibrium only. This model contains two entropies, two temperatures and non-conventional shock relations. The second one corresponds to a two-phase model where the phases evolve in both mechanical and thermal equilibrium. The last one corresponds to a model describing a <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture</b> in thermodynamic equilibrium. They all correspond to two-phase mixtures where the various relaxation effects are either stiff or absent. In all instances, the various flow regimes (subsonic, subsonic-supersonic, and supersonic with shock) are unambiguously determined, as well as various nozzle solution profiles...|$|E

40|$|An actual {{process of}} a {{two-phase}} parallel-flow of a binary mixture with heat exchange to its surroundings {{is followed by}} an internal entropy production due to several kinds of irreversibilities which occur inside the flow. Such irreversibilities in actual processes provoke mass fraction deviations from equilibrium, temperature deviations between the two phases and pressure drop. In the present work the flow {{is assumed to be}} inviscid (no pressure drop) and the mass fraction and temperature deviations from equilibrium are related to mass and heat exchange delay between the two phases. Based on this criterium of `delay', a thermodynamic method is developed, according to which the determination of an actual state of the process is governed by two parameters: (i) the `degree of vapour delay' or the `degree of liquid delay' and (ii) the `degree of liquid-vapour heat exchange delay'. These two parameters both confine the actual process between two extreme processes: the process of no delay (reversible-successive equilibrium states) and the process of total delay (irreversible of maximum delay). As an application of this method, the evaporation and condensation processes of NH 3 /H 2 O <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture</b> are considered and entropy quality indices of these processes are calculated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA flow {{model is}} built to capture {{evaporating}} interfaces separating liquid and vapour. Surface tension, heat conduction, Gibbs free energy relaxation and compressibility effects are considered. The corresponding flow model is hyperbolic, conservative and {{in agreement with}} the second law of thermodynamics. Phase transition is considered through Gibbs energy relaxation, in the same mind as in Saurel et al. (2008). Surface tension effects are modelled following the lines of Brackbill et al. (1992). There is thus no need to resolve the interface structure as jump conditions are inherent features of the model formulation. With the present approach, the same set of partial differential equations is solved everywhere, in pure fluids {{as well as in the}} captured diffuse interface. There is thus a unique hyperbolic flow solver that handles flow dynamics, interface motion and eventually acoustic wave dynamics. To make distinction between “pure” fluids and <b>liquid–vapour</b> <b>mixture</b> treatment, different sets of algebraic equations are considered in the relaxation solver. To guarantee accurate computation of the liquid and gas dynamics the preconditioned implicit scheme of LeMartelot et al. (2013) is adapted to the present boiling flow model. The model and method are validated against a one-dimensional test problem having exact solution. Multidimensional computations are then shown to illustrate method capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} cavitating flow inside a single-orifice nozzle are presented. The orifice {{is part of}} a closed flow circuit, with diesel fuel as the working fluid, designed to replicate the main flow pattern observed in high-pressure diesel injector nozzles. The focus of the present investigation is on cavitation structures appearing inside the orifice, their interaction with turbulence and the induced material erosion. Experimental investigations include high-speed shadowgraphy visualization, X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of time-averaged volumetric cavitation distribution inside the orifice as well as pressure and flow rate measurements. The highly transient flow features that are taking place, such as cavity shedding, collapse and vortex cavitation (also known as ‘string cavitation’), have become evident from high-speed images. Additionally, micro-CT enabled the reconstruction of the orifice surface, which provided locations of cavitation erosion sites developed after sufficient operation time. The measurements are used to validate the presented numerical model, which is based on the numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equation, taking into account compressibility of both the liquid and <b>liquid–vapour</b> <b>mixture.</b> Phase change is accounted for with a newly developed mass transfer rate model, capable of accurately predicting the collapse of vaporous structures. Turbulence is modelled using detached eddy simulation and unsteady features such as cavitating vortices and cavity shedding are observed and discussed.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{reactor cavity}} cooling system (RCCS) {{is used in}} the PBMR to protect the {{concrete}} citadel surrounding the reactor from direct nuclear radiation impingement and heat. The speci ed maximum operating temperature of the concrete structure is 65 ±C for normal operating conditions and 125 ±C for emergency shut-down conditions. A conceptual design of an entirely passive RCCS suitable for the PBMR was done by using closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes (CLTHPs) to remove heat from a radiation heat shield over a horizontal distance to an annular cooling dam placed around the PBMR. The radiation shield is placed in the air space between the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) and the concrete citadel, 180 mm from the concrete citadel. A theoretical heat transfer model of the RCCS was created. The theoretical model was used to develop a computer program to simulate the transient RCCS response during normal reactor operation, when the RCCS must remove the excess generated heat from the reactor cavity and during emergency shut-down conditions, when the RCCS must remove the decay heat from the reactor cavity. The main purpose of the theoretical model is to predict the surface temperature of the concrete citadel for di erent heat generation modes in the reactor core and ambient conditions. The theoretical model assumes a 1 D geometry of the RCCS. Heat transfer by both radiation and convection from the RPV to the radiation heat shield (HS) is calculated. The heat shield is modelled as a n. The n e ciency was determined with the experimental work. Conduction through the n is considered in the horizontal direction only. The concrete structure surface is heated by radiation from the outer surface of the heat shield as well as by convection heat transfer from the air between the heat shield and the concrete structure surface. The modelling of the natural convection closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes in the RCCS is done by using the Boussinesq approximation and the homogeneous ow model. An experiment was built to verify the theoretical model. The experiment is a full scale model of the PBMR in the horizontal, or main heat transfer, direction, but is only a 2 m high section. The experiments showed that the convection heat transfer between the RPV and the HS cannot be modelled with simple natural convection theory. A Nusselt number correlation developed especially for natural convection in enclosed rectangles found in literature was used to model the convection heat transfer. The Nusselt number was approximately 3 times higher than that which classic convection theory suggested. An optimisation procedure was developed where 121 di erent combinations of n sizes and heat pipe sizes could be used to construct a RCCS once a cooling dam size was chosen. The purpose of the optimisation was to nd the RCCS with the lowest total mass. A cooling dam with a diameter of 50 m was chosen. The optimal RCCS radiation heat shield that operates with the working uid only in single phase has 243 closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes constructed from 62. 72 mm ID pipes and 25 mm wide atbar ns. The total mass of the single phase RCCS is 225 tons. The maximum concrete structure temperature is 62. 5 ±C under normal operating conditions, 65. 8 ±C during a PLOFC emergency shut-down condition and 80. 9 ±C during a DLOFC emergency shut-down condition. In the case where one CLTHP fails and the adjacent two must compensate for the loss of cooling capacity, the maximum concrete structure temperature for a DLOFC emergency shut-down will be 87. 4 ±C. This is 37. 6 ±C below the speci ed maximum temperature of 125 ±C. The RCCS design is further improved when boiling of the working uid is induced in the CLTHP. The optimal RCCS radiation heat shield that operates with the working uid in a <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture,</b> or two phase ow, has 338 closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes constructed from 38. 1 mm ID pipes and 20 mm wide atbar ns. The total mass of the two phase RCCS is 198 tons, 27 tons less than the single phase RCCS. The maximum concrete structure temperature is 60 ±C under normal operating conditions, 2. 5 ±C below that of the single phase RCCS. During a PLOFC emergency shut-down condition, the maximum concrete structure temperature is 62. 3 ±C, 3. 5 ±C below that of the single phase RCCS and still below the normal operating temperature of the single phase RCCS. By inducing two phase ow in the CLTHP, the maximum temperature of the working uid is xed equal to the saturation temperature of the working uid at the vacuum pressure. This property of water is used to limit the concrete structure temperature. This e ect is seen in the transient response of the RCCS where the concrete structure temperature increases until boiling of the working uid starts and then the concrete structure temperature becomes constant irrespective of the heat load on the RCCS. An increased heat load increases the quality of the working uid <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>mixture.</b> Working uid qualities approaching unity causes numerical instabilities in the theoretical model. The theoretical model cannot capture the heat transfer to a control volume with a density lower than approximately 20 kg/m 3. This limits {{the extent to which the}} two phase RCCS can be optimised. Recommendations are made relating to future work on how to improve the theoretical model in particular the convection modelling in the reactor cavities as well as the two phase ow of the working uid. Further recommendations are made on how to improve the basic design of the heat shield as well as the cooling section of the CLTHPs. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: 'n Reaktor lug spasie verkoelingstelsel (RLSVS) word in die PBMR gebruik om die beton wat die reaktor omring te beskerm teen direkte stralingskade en hitte. Die gespesi seerde maksimum temperatuur van die beton is 65 ±C onder normale bedryfstoestande en 125 ±C gedurende die noodtoestand afskakeling van die reaktor. 'n Konseptuele ontwerp van 'n geheel en al passiewe RLSVS geskik vir die PBMR is gedoen deur gebruik te maak van geslote lus termo-sifon (GLTSe) om hitte van die stralingskerm te verwyder oor a horisontale afstand na 'n ringvormige verkoelingsdam wat rondom die reaktor geposisioneer is. Die stralingskerm word in die lug spasie tussen die reaktor drukvat (RDV) en die beton geplaas, 180 mm vanaf die beton. 'n Teoretiese hitteoordrag model van die RLSVS was geskep. Die teoretiese model was gebruik vir die ontwikkeling van 'n rekenaar program wat die transiënte gedrag van die RLSVS sal simuleer gedurende normale bedryfstoestande, waar die oorskot gegenereerde hitte verwyder moet word vanuit die reaktor lug spasie, asook gedurende noodtoestand afskakeling van die reaktor, waar die afnemingshitte verwyder moet word. Die primêre doel van die teoretiese model is om the oppervlak temperatuur van die beton te voorspel onder verskillende bedryfstoestande asook verskillende omgewingstoestande. Die teoretiese model aanvaar 'n 1 D geometrie van die RLSVS. Hitte oordrag d. m. v. straling asook konveksie vanaf die RDV na die stralingskerm word bereken. The stralingskerm word gemodelleer as 'n vin. Die vin doeltre endheid was bepaal met die eksperimente wat gedoen was. Hitte geleiding in die vin was slegs bereken in die horisontale rigting. Die beton word verhit deur straling vanaf die agterkant van die stralingskerm asook deur konveksie vanaf die lug tussen die stralingskerm en die beton. The modellering van die natuurlike konveksie GLTS hitte pype word gedoen deur om gebruik te maak van die Boussinesq benadering en die homogene vloei model. 'n Eksperiment was vervaardig om the teoretiese model te veri eer. Die eksperiment is 'n volskaal model van die PBMR in die horisontale, of hoof hitteoordrag, rigting, maar is net 'n 2 m hoë snit. Die eksperimente het gewys dat die konveksie hitte oordrag tussen die RDV en die stralingskerm nie met gewone konveksie teorie gemodelleer kan word nie. 'n Nusselt getal uitdrukking wat spesi ek ontwikkel is vir natuurlike konveksie in geslote, reghoekige luggapings wat in die literatuur gevind was, was gebruik om die konveksie hitteoordrag te modelleer. Die Nusselt getal was ongeveer 3 maal groter as wat klassieke konveksie teorie voorspel het. 'n Optimeringsprosedure was ontwikkel waar 121 verskillende kombinasies van vin breedtes en pyp groottes wat gebruik kan word om 'n RLSVS te vervaardig nadat 'n toepaslike verkoelingsdam diameter gekies is. Die doel van die optimering was om die RLSVS te ontwerp wat die laagste totale massa het. 'n Verkoelingsdam diameter van 50 m was gekies. Die optimale RLSVS stralingskerm, waarvan die vloeier slegs in die vloeistof fase bly, bestaan uit 243 GLTSe wat van 62. 72 mm binne diameter pype vervaardig is met 25 mm breë vinne. The totale massa van die enkel fase RLSVS is 225 ton. Die maksimum beton temperatuur is 62. 5 ±C vir normale bedryfstoestande, 65. 8 ±C vir 'n PLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling en is 80. 9 ±C vir 'n DLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling. In die geval waar een GLTS faal gedurende 'n DLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling en die twee naasgeleë GLTSe moet kompenseer vir die vermindering in verkoelings kapasiteit, is die maksimum beton temperatuur 87. 4 ±C. Dit is 37. 6 ±C laer as die gespesi seerde maksimum temperatuur van 125 ±C. Die RLSVS ontwerp kan verder verbeter word wanneer die vloeier in die GLTSe kook. Die optimale RLSVS stralingskerm met die vloeier wat kook, of in twee fase vloei is, bestaan uit 338 GLTSe wat van 38. 1 mm binne diameter pype vervaardig is met 20 mm breë vinne. The totale massa van die twee fase vloei RLSVS is 198 ton, 27 ton ligter as die enkel fase RLSVS. Die maksimum beton temperatuur is 60 ±C vir normale bedryfstoestande, 2. 5 ±C laer as die enkel fase RLSVS. Gedurende 'n PLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling is die maksimum beton temperatuur 62. 3 ±C, 3. 5 ±C laer as die enkel fase RLSVS en nogtans onder die maksimum beton temperatuur van die enkel fase RLSVS vir normale bedryfstoestande. Deur om koking te veroorsaak in die GLTS word die maksimum temperatuur van die vloeier vasgepen gelyk aan die versadigings temperatuur van die vloeier by die vakuüm druk. Hierdie einskap van water word gebruik om 'n limiet te sit op die maksimum temperatuur van die beton. Hierdie e ek kan gesien word in die transiënte gedrag van die RLSVS waar die beton temperatuur styg tot en met koking plaasvind en dan konstant raak ongeag van die hitte belasting op die RLSVS. 'n Toename in die hitte belasting veroorsaak net 'n toename in die kwaliteit van die vloeistof-gas mengsel. Mengsel kwaliteite van 1 nader veroorsaak numeriese onstabiliteite in die teoretiese model. The teoretiese model kan nie die hitteoordrag beskryf na 'n kontrole volume wat 'n digtheid het laer as ongeveer 20 kg/m 3. Hierdie plaas 'n limiet op die optimering van die twee fase RLSVS. Aanbevelings was gemaak met betrekking tot toekomstige werk aangaande die verbetering van die teoretiese model met spesi eke klem op die modellering van konveksie in die reaktor asook die modellering van twee fase vloei. Verdere aanbevelings was gemaak aangaande die verbetering van die stralingskerm ontwerp asook die ontwerp van die verkoeling van die GLTSe...|$|E
