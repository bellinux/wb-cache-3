5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) of T.tabacinus are {{club-shaped}} {{and measure}} 23.5–37.0 by 8.5–13.0μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} inner surface of the tubes) are 45.0–60.0 by 6.5–12.5μm, lanceolate (<b>lance-shaped)</b> to narrowly fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle and}} somewhat spindle-shaped). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of the tubes) are absent. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) form the reticulations on the stem; they are usually club-shaped and measure 21.0–40.5 by 6.5–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than <b>lance-shaped.</b> A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species. The pinnae of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) are toothed and less deeply cut, and the dark color of the stipe continues partway up the rachis in that species. Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is <b>lance-shaped,</b> rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not as deeply cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly <b>lance-shaped,</b> and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|The spores are white, smooth, roughly elliptical, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–8.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short appendage measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat thick-walled, and spiny on the exposed surface with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or <b>lance-shaped,</b> hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They measure up to 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the stem. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

The blade is triangular or <b>lance-shaped,</b> with a squared-off or slightly rounded base and a pointed tip. It ranges from [...] long and from [...] wide, occasionally as wide as [...] The blade varies from pinnate-pinnatifid to bipinnate-pinnatifid; that is, it is cut into lobed pinnae, and sometimes the pinnae themselves are cut into lobed pinnules. There are four to ten pairs of widely spaced pinnae per leaf, {{each of which is}} triangular to <b>lance-shaped,</b> with coarse incisions in the edges, which cut them into pinnules or deep lobes, and a rounded to angled base. The pinnules are indented, but not further cut. The longest pinnae are those nearest the base of the leaf, which range from [...] long and from [...] across. The veins in the leaf do not form a meshwork, and are obscure.|$|E
500|$|The stipe (the {{portion of}} the stem below the leaf blade) is dark brown to purplish-black and shiny at the base, {{gradually}} turning dull green as it ascends to the leaf blade. The stipe is from [...] long, and may be from 0.5 to 1.5 times {{the length of the}} blade.

2500|$|Red {{pondweed}} is {{a perennial}} herb anchoring {{in the mud}} substrate via a creeping rhizome. It produces a cylindrical unbranched stem, up to 2.8 m in [...] length. It has sessile <b>lance-shaped</b> submerged leaves that are typically 70–180mm long and 10–25mm wide with 4-7 lateral veins on either side and a slightly hooded apex, with an untoothed margin. Floating leaves may also be produced. The inflorescence is a spike of flowers a few centimeters long rising above the water surface. Turions are absent, but in winter each stem dies back to a resting bud with a short length of root, which acts as a functional turion.|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{shape of}} the blade is {{narrowly}} triangular or <b>lance-shaped,</b> sometimes with an irregular outline. The blade tapers to a long point, {{the length of the}} taper being variable among specimens. The blades are generally curled with downward-pointing tips. On very rare occasions, buds are found at the tip, but these are not known to form new plants in nature. The base of the blade may be squared off or notched to a varying extent along the rachis (central axis of the leaf). The blade ranges from [...] long, rarely to , and [...] in width, rarely to , and is thick and somewhat leathery. Blades are either entirely pinnatifid (lobed but not completely cut), or cut to form a single pair of pinnae at the base. When they exist, the pinnae are roughly oval or triangle-shaped, sometimes narrow, and are from [...] long, rarely to , and 0.4 to 1millimeters in width (rarely to 1.2millimeters). The base of the pinnae may be squared off or taper to a point, while the edges are wrinkled to toothed. The tip can vary from rounded to pointed. The lobes of the blade gradually diminish towards the tip, sometimes becoming simply wavy. The rachis is green, sometimes turning tan when dry. The underside of the rachis and blade have a few scattered, small hairs. Overall, the blades are quite morphologically variable; in younger blades, the edges may be not at all lobed or may be wavy. The veins are free and forking, only rarely anastomosing (rejoining one another to form nets).|$|E

The {{last four}} {{families}} {{we have been}} examining vary from the typical Veronicas not only in their <b>lance-shaped</b> clusters, but in their lengthened, and often every way much enlarged leaves also: and the two which we now will take in association, 17 and 18, carry the change in aspect farthest of any, being both of them true water-plants, with strong stems and thick leaves. The present name of my Veronica Stagnarum is however V. anagallis, a mere insult to the little water primula, which one plant of the Veronica would make fifty of. This is a rank water-weed, having confused bunches of blossom and seed, like unripe currants, dangling from the leaf-axils. So that where the little triphylla, (No. 7, above,) has only one blossom, daintily set, and well seen, this has a litter of twenty-five or thirty on a long stalk, of which {{only three or four}} are well out as flowers, and the rest are mere knobs of bud or seed.

60|$|What {{had seemed}} to be an {{overgrown}} mound rising like an island out of the dead level of the grassy sea now resolved itself into a collection of adobe walls, eaten and incrusted with shrubs and vines, that bore some resemblance to the usual uninhabited-looking exterior of a Spanish-American dwelling. Apertures that might have been <b>lance-shaped</b> windows or only cracks and fissures in the walls were choked up with weeds and grass, and gave no passing glimpse of the interior. Entering a ruinous corral they came to a second entrance, which proved to be the patio or courtyard. The deserted wooden corridor, with beams, rafters, and floors whitened by the eternal sun and wind, contained a few withered leaves, dryly rotting skins, and thongs of leather, as if undisturbed by human care. But among these scattered debris of former life and habitation there was no noisome or unclean suggestion of decay. A faint, spiced odor of desiccation filled the bare walls. There was no slime on stone or sun-dried brick. In place of fungus or discolored moisture the dust of efflorescence whitened in the obscured corners. The elements had picked clean the bones of the crumbling tenement ere they should finally absorb it.|$|E

[...] And, sure enough, we did find that what we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one. Its bark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the leaves being <b>lance-shaped,</b> small, and of a beautiful pea-green. But the wonderful thing about {{it was that the}} branches, which grew out from the stem horizontally, sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground, which, taking root, had themselves become trees, and were covered with bark like the tree itself. Many of these fibres had descended from the branches at various distances, and thus supported them on natural pillars, some of which were so large and strong that it was not easy at first to distinguish the offspring from the parent stem. The fibres were of all sizes and in all states of advancement, from the pillars we have just mentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to take root, and thin brown threads still far from the ground, which swayed about with every motion of wind. In short, it seemed to us that, if there were only space afforded to it, this single tree would at length cover the whole island.|$|E

Sir Robert, a little gouty, kept the house, and Bradley, somewhat uneasy at the Sharpes' absence, but more distrait with other thoughts, wandered listlessly in the long library.
