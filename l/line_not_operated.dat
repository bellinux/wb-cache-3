5000|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1893 by the Yverdon-Ste-Croix railway company, {{largely as a}} result of the {{influence}} of William Barbey from Valeyres-sous-Rances, who financed the building of the line. The line initially used steam locomotives to the articulated Mallet design. Because of the influence of the religious William Barbey, the <b>line</b> did <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> any trains on Sundays.|$|R

500|$|Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae: Coincides {{with the}} Richmond–Warm Springs/South Fremont line from Richmond to Oakland, and extends south of Daly City to Millbrae {{following}} a former Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way, {{which is also}} served by Caltrain beyond San Bruno. Operates until approximately 9:00p.m. on weekdays and during the day on Saturdays, when it terminates at Daly City. <b>Line</b> does <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> on Sundays.|$|R
50|$|Since Prussia {{required}} {{the line to}} bypass the important strategic and economic industrial area of the Ruhr to the north, {{the western part of}} the line was built from Venlo to Haltern, crossing the Rhine at Wesel and running from Wesel to Haltern along the Lippe river. Even then it was expected that these parts of the <b>line</b> would <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> profitably.|$|R
50|$|Transrail {{was bought}} in 2007 by the Belgian company Vecturis. The <b>line</b> has <b>not</b> <b>operated</b> since May 2010.

5|$|Although Carnival Cruise <b>Lines</b> did <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> from Mobile {{after the}} Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the Carnival Triumph was towed into the port {{following}} a crippling engine room fire. It {{was the largest}} cruise ship ever to dock at the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the Carnival Conquest, which docked in Mobile when the Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.|$|R
50|$|On August 7 2010, heavy {{flooding}} in the Kirnitzschtal caused damage {{to both the}} line and its vehicles. The depot was flooded to {{the height of the}} tram floors, causing damage to the cars motors, gears and axles. The <b>line</b> did <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> again until Easter 2011, and when it reopened it was curtailed to Beuthenfall by the need to rebuild a retaining wall on the approach to Lichtenhain Waterfall terminus. This last section did not reopen until December 2012.|$|R
50|$|The E Line, {{is part of}} {{the light}} rail system {{operated}} by the Regional Transportation District in the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area in Colorado. The line was added to the system on November 17, 2006, with the completion of the Southeast Corridor as part of the T-REX Project. It is one of four routes {{that are part of the}} RTD's service plan for the corridor. Although it operates seven days per week, the E <b>line</b> does <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> during midday hours on weekdays as of January 11, 2009.|$|R
5000|$|... † <b>Line</b> does <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> on {{weekends}} and public holidays. Lines 10 and 16 no longer exist. Line 10 used to connect Savski most and Borongaj via Glavni kolodvor, but it was discontinued in the early 1980s, when a reorganisation of lines, which reintroduced line 1, {{made it impossible to}} have a line number 10, due to shift numbering, which would make lines 1 and 10 overlap. Line 16 used to connect Črnomerec and Zapruđe, but it was discontinued in 1991, due to a shortage of drivers when the Croatian war of independence started.|$|R
50|$|For a {{short time}} late in the 1980s, the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., the (second) GLI, made the sixth and last use {{of the name of}} the Central Greyhound <b>Lines,</b> <b>not</b> as an <b>operating</b> {{division}} but rather as an administrative department (in bookkeeping and other internal purposes), along with the Eastern GL, the Southern GL, and the Western GL.|$|R
25|$|The Waterloo & City {{line is a}} London Underground {{line that}} runs between Waterloo and Bank with no {{intermediate}} stops. Its primary traffic consists of commuters from south-west London, Surrey and Hampshire arriving at Waterloo main line station to the City of London financial district, {{and for this reason}} the <b>line</b> does <b>not</b> normally <b>operate</b> on Sundays.|$|R
50|$|Reliable {{sources of}} {{electricity}} and heat for the city population was another urgent need; the major coal mines of northern France were to the north behind the German lines. The problem was especially urgent during the bitterly cold winter of 1916-17, when temperatures fell to seven degrees below zero Celsius. The municipality reserved supplies of coal for the elderly, the unemployed, and the families of mobilized soldiers; they were permitted a fifty kilogram sack of coal every forty days for a payment of 4.75 francs. Shortages of coal also limited the generation of electricity, and sometimes the tram <b>lines</b> could <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> for lack of power.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} {{it became clear that the}} <b>line</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>operated</b> profitably. As a result, in 1970, the Wendelstein Cable Car was erected running from Bayrischzell-Osterhofen to the Wendelstein summit, with the intent that it would replace the rack railway in due course. The attraction of the rack railway for tourism was however recognised and it was kept going.|$|R
25|$|Still, as {{the opening}} {{years of the}} decade progressed, the cruise market expanded, seeing the {{construction}} of smaller, purpose-built cruise ships which could also fit through the Panama Canal. Worse, in 1973 the Oil Crisis hit, {{and the price of}} oil went from US$3 to $12 per barrel. When the French government, {{at the end of the}} Trente Glorieuses, realized that keeping the France running would necessitate an additional ten million dollars a year, it opted instead to subsidize the then in-development Concorde. Without this government money, the French <b>Line</b> could <b>not</b> <b>operate,</b> and with a press release issued in 1974 it was announced that the France would be withdrawn from service on 25 October that year.|$|R
50|$|The Waterloo & City {{line is a}} short, fully {{underground}} railway line {{in central}} London, England. Part of the London Underground rapid transit network, it operates as a shuttle service between Waterloo and Bank stations with no intermediate stops. Its primary traffic consists of commuters from south-west London, Surrey and Hampshire arriving at Waterloo mainline station to the City of London, {{and for this reason}} the <b>line</b> does <b>not</b> normally <b>operate</b> on Sundays.|$|R
5000|$|Service {{was inaugurated}} on July 29, 1998, and was {{considered}} to be a demonstration project for a modern downtown streetcar system that the city plans to develop. It continued to operate almost every summer through 2011, as an excursion-oriented historic electric railway line. In 2010, the heritage service did <b>not</b> <b>operate,</b> because the <b>line</b> was used for a modern-streetcar demonstration service known as the [...] "Olympic Line" [...] (see section below), and temporary modifications made to the line's overhead wire for that operation took longer than expected to undo, also delaying the start of 2011 service. The 2011 season began on July 1 and was scheduled to run until mid-October. [...] The <b>line</b> did <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> in 2012, with service suspended indefinitely due to financial constraints, and there are no set plans to resume operation. Further, a Vancouver City Council report published in March 2014 recommended against ever reviving service on the heritage line.|$|R
50|$|A 10-minute service {{interval}} ("headway") is operated between Lausen and Schönefeld fromMonday to Friday during daytime service hours, and a 20-minute interval to Mockau. At other times <b>Line</b> 1E does <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> and 15-minute intervals are operated between Lausen and Mockau. Both services are worked mostly by three-car formations of Tatra stock (Tatra-Großzüge, Tw+Tw+Bw). Some late evening and weekend services are worked by low-floor NGT8 stock. The primary function of these lines is {{to connect the}} densely populated Grünau-Süd, Schleußig and Schönefeld districts with the town center.|$|R
5000|$|The City Line, {{shown in}} red on the Merseyrail map, is an {{informal}} term used by local transport authority Merseytravel {{to describe the}} suburban services which depart from [...] on the Liverpool to Wigan and Liverpool to Manchester <b>Lines.</b> It is <b>not</b> <b>operated</b> by Merseyrail trains and is <b>not</b> an official <b>line</b> in its own right. Services are less frequent than those on the Northern Line and Wirral Line, generally half-hourly on weekdays. The electric trains are branded Northern Electrics on the services using the Class 319s.|$|R
50|$|From 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., {{when the}} Scarborough <b>line</b> is <b>not</b> <b>operating,</b> the 302 Kingston Rd-McCowan Blue Night bus serves the same area. The 302 {{originates}} at Bingham Loop, where it connects with the 322 Coxwell that {{travels to the}} west, {{as well as the}} 324 Victoria Park, that runs north. From the loop, the 302 travels east along Kingston to Brimley, then north along Brimley to Danforth Road, then north on McCowan Road to Steeles. With the exception of McCowan station, it does not pass near any of the rapid transit stations, though other night bus services pass near stations. Bus service is extended on Sundays, because the rapid transit lines start at 8 a.m. (beginning January 3, 2016) instead the usual 6 a.m. start. Service frequency is 30 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Most laser gain {{media have}} a number of {{transition}} wavelengths on which laser operation can be achieved. For example, as well as the principal [...] nm output line, Nd:YAG has weaker transitions at wavelengths of [...] nm, nbsp;nm, [...] nm, [...] nm, {{and a number of other}} lines. Usually, these <b>lines</b> do <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> unless the gain of the strongest transition is suppressed; e.g., by use of wavelength-selective dielectric mirrors. If a dispersive element, such as a prism, is introduced into the optical cavity, tilting of the cavity's mirrors can cause tuning of the laser as it [...] "hops" [...] between different laser lines. Such schemes are common in argon-ion lasers, allowing tuning of the laser to a number of lines from the ultraviolet and blue through to green wavelengths.|$|R
50|$|The S12 DMUs {{were meant}} to improve {{services}} on the Main Line and the Kelani Valley Line. The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line is difficult to operate. Prior to the S12, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line. As DMUs started to replace locomotive-operated trains on other lines, the up-country Main <b>Line</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>operated</b> by DMUs. The S12 is the first DMU to handle these conditions.|$|R
25|$|Of Metra's 11 routes, {{four are}} {{operated}} under contract. The BNSF Line service is operated by BNSF Railway. The lines {{out of the}} Ogilvie Transportation Center (formerly North Western Station) are operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. <b>Lines</b> <b>not</b> contracted are <b>operated</b> by the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Rail Corporation (NIRC), Metra's operating subsidiary. Inbound trains on every line at all times run through to their Chicago terminus, however, many outbound trains do not run through to their respective lines' terminus (for example, most trains on the Union Pacific/Northwest <b>Line</b> do <b>not</b> run through to Harvard; instead, terminating at Crystal Lake).|$|R
50|$|This line {{operates}} {{at the same}} intervals as Line 4, every 10 minutes during weekday daytime hours and every 15 minutes at other times. At times when <b>Line</b> 8 does <b>not</b> <b>operate,</b> <b>Line</b> 7 operates via Torgauer Platz. Also on weekends and during late evening service hours, three-car trains of Tatra stock (Tatra-Großzüge) with low-floor trailers or LEOLINER trams in two-coupled formations work this line. Line 7 connects the densely built-up residential districts of Böhlitz-Ehrenberg, Leutzsch, Reudnitz, Sellerhausen and Paunsdorf with the town center, and in addition the large Paunsdorf-Center shopping center.|$|R
