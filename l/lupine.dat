5|$|Choctaw dyers use maple (Acer sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral {{yellow ochre}} mixed with pitch from the piñon tree(Pinus edulis) and the three-leaved sumac (Rhus trilobata). They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower <b>lupine</b> {{and a warm}} grey from Juniper {{mistletoe}} (Phoradendron juniperinum).|$|E
5|$|Over 340species {{of plants}} grow on the rocks, {{including}} approximately 200species of wildflowers. Some {{of the most}} common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor <b>lupine,</b> and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for Applied Ecology trap and relocate the animals. At a site south of Philomath, Oregon, the IAE is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid's <b>lupine</b> (Lupinus sulphureus). This threatened flower is the primary host plant for the endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), which is endemic to the Willamette Valley. The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the coastal}} prairie of Northern California, yellow bush <b>lupines</b> are fed upon by a {{particularly}} destructive herbivore, the root-boring caterpillar of the ghost moth.

40|$|<b>Lupines</b> will be {{provided}} as feeding stuff with high quality for the organic farming. Therefore breeding selection of <b>lupines</b> and a complex quality analysis are necessary. In addition to agronomical characteristics quality parameters are estimated, such as protein content, amino acid composition, fat, fatty acid composition, starch and sugar as well as antinutritive substances (non-starch polysaccharides and alkaloides). On the basis of determined data, NIR/NIT-calibrations are developed as breeding relevant methods. The project serves to both opening up and use of genetic resources and breeding of <b>lupines</b> suitable for ecological cultivation...|$|R
5|$|Species {{diversity}} is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, chum salmon, Coho salmon and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several {{projects have been}} done to restore and protect wetlands {{in order to provide}} habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid's <b>lupine.</b> In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue <b>lupine,</b> which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E
25|$|P. i. missionensis is federally {{endangered}} {{and found}} {{in only a}} few locations. Its habitat is restricted to the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically six areas, the Twin Peaks area in San Francisco County, Fort Baker, a former military installation managed by the National Park Service (NPS), in Marin County, the San Bruno Mountain area in San Mateo County, the Marin Headlands, in Golden Gate National Recreation Area (another NPS entity), Laurelwood Park and Sugarloaf Open Space in the city of San Mateo, and Skyline Ridge, also in San Mateo County. San Bruno Mountain hosts the largest population of Mission blues, a butterfly commonly found around elevations of 700feet. The coastal scrubland and grassland the Mission blue requires is found only in and around the Golden Gate of San Francisco. The butterfly depends solely on three species of perennial <b>lupine</b> for its reproduction, the varied <b>lupine,</b> silver <b>lupine,</b> and the summer <b>lupine.</b> The Mission blue requires the <b>lupine</b> to lay their eggs and nourish the larvae. Without these species, the it cannot reproduce and thus cannot survive. Thus, the Mission blue's habitat parallels that of the <b>lupine</b> species.|$|E

25|$|Only one {{generation}} occurs per year. The butterfly lays its eggs on the leaves, buds, and seed pods of L. albifrons, L. formosus, and L. variicolor. The eggs are usually {{laid on the}} upper side of new <b>lupine</b> leaves. Eggs generally hatch within 6 to 10 days and the first- and second-instar larvae feed on the mesophyll of the <b>lupine</b> plants. The caterpillars, extremely small, feed {{for a short time}} and then crawl to the plant base, where they enter a dormant state, known as diapause, until the late winter or the following spring. Diapause usually begins about three weeks after eclosion and begins {{about the same time as}} the host plant shifts its energy to flower and seed production. When the caterpillar comes out of its diapause and begins feeding, it occasionally sheds its skin to accommodate its growth.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{caterpillar}} {{is fully}} grown, {{it leaves the}} larval stage and enters the pupal stage of development. The fully grown caterpillar forms a chrysalis after securing itself to a surface which is generally a <b>lupine</b> stem or leaf. It sheds its outer skin, revealing the chrysalid. This stage lasts about 10 days while the adult butterfly develops within the chrysalid. The butterfly can be sighted as early as late March in the summit of San Bruno Mountain or the Twin Peaks. They persist well into June when they can be seen perched on a <b>lupine</b> plant or feeding on coastal buckwheat flowers. Day to day for the adult butterfly is mostly spent foraging for nectar, flying, mating, and for the females, laying eggs. Nearly equal time is spent between perching, feeding, and flying. The adult Mission blue lives about a week; during this time, the females lay the eggs on the host plants. The complete Mission blue butterfly life cycle lasts one year.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the areas}} {{inhabited}} by the Mission blue are {{within the confines of}} the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Golden Gate staff are working to ease the invasive species problem that has helped reduce the Mission blue to the endangered species list.

25|$|The larvae only feed on {{the leaves}} of the three host <b>lupine</b> plants (Lupinus albifrons, Lupinus formosus, and Lupinus variicolor) native to their habitat. The plants are {{necessary}} for survival for the Mission blue. Thus, the butterfly's fate is closely tied to that of the three species of lupines as the plants provide food and shelter for the butterfly in its larval stage. The adult Mission blue drinks the nectar of a variety of flowers, many in the sunflower family, using its long proboscis which extends from the underside of its head.|$|E
25|$|The year-round water supply, {{makes the}} forest canopy {{particularly}} lush in the otherwise dry Sonoran Desert, {{and is one}} of the most unusual forest types in North America. The predominant tress are Goodding’s willows and Fremont cottonwoods.

25|$|When the European {{colonization}} of the Americas occurred, the pioneers brought their own werewolf folklore {{with them and}} were later influenced by the lore of their neighbouring colonies {{and those of the}} Natives. Belief in the loup-garou present in Canada, the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan and upstate New York, originates from French folklore influenced by Native American stories on the Wendigo. In Mexico, there is a belief in a creature called the nahual, which traditionally limits itself to stealing cheese and raping women rather than murder. In Haiti, there is a superstition that werewolf spirits known locally as Jé-rouge (red eyes) can possess the bodies of unwitting persons and nightly transform them into cannibalistic <b>lupine</b> creatures. The Haitian jé-rouges typically try to trick mothers into giving away their children voluntarily by waking them at night and asking their permission to take their child, to which the disoriented mother may either reply yes or no. The Haitian jé-rouges differ from traditional European werewolves by their habit of actively trying to spread their lycanthropic condition to others, much like vampires.|$|E
