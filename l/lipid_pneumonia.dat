40|$|Granulomatous inflammations, {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} activated macrophages (MAs) forming epithelioid cell (EPC) clusters, are usually easy to recognize. However, in ambiguous cases the use of a MA marker that expresses selectively in EPCs may be needed. Here, we report that carboxypeptidase-M (CPM), a MA-differentiation marker, is preferentially induced in EPCs of all granuloma types studied, but not in resting MAs. As CPM is not expressed constitutively in MAs, this allows utilization of CPM-immunohistochemistry in diagnostics of minute granuloma detection when dense non-granulomatous MAs are also present. Despite this rule, hardly any detectable CPM was found in advanced/active tubercle caseous disease, albeit in early tuberculosis granuloma, MAs still expressed CPM. Indeed, in vitro both the CPM-protein and -mRNA became downregulated when MAs were infected with live mycobacteria. In vitro, MA-CPM transcript is neither induced remarkably by interferon-γ, known to cause classical MA activation, nor by IL- 4, an alternative MA activator. Instead, CPM is selectively expressed in lipid-laden MAs, including the foam cells of atherosclerotic plaques, xanthomatous lesions and <b>lipid</b> <b>pneumonias.</b> By using serum, rich in lipids, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or VLDL, CPM upregulation could be reproduced in vitro in monocyte-derived MAs both at transcriptional and protein levels, and the increase is repressed under lipid-depleted conditions. The microarray analyses support the notion that CPM induction correlates with a robust progressive increase in CPM gene expression during monocyte to MA maturation and dendritic cell (DC) differentiation mediated by granulocyte-MA-colony-stimulating factor+IL- 4. M-CSF alone also induced CPM. These results collectively indicate that CPM upregulation in MAs is preferentially associated with increased lipid uptake, and exposure to CSF, features of EPCs, also. Therefore, CPM-immunohistochemistry is useful for granuloma and foam MA detections in tissue sections. Furthermore, the present data offer CPM {{for the first time to}} be a novel marker and cellular player in lipid uptake and/or metabolism of MAs by promoting foam cell formation...|$|R

No correlation with cold agglutinins or cardiolipid complement-fixing antibodies was found. The IgM antibody response seemed to be prolonged: after 3 to 4 weeks the antibodies were still in many cases exclusively IgM.

The highest number of patients had intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to measles, rubella and paramyxo type viruses and the lowest frequency was against M. pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus and cytomegalovirus antigens. Simultaneous antibody synthesis occurred against 1 - 11 different antigens in these patients. When the summation of different antibody specificities synthesized intrathecally was compared to the CSF-IgG Index, which measures the intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis, a fairly close correlation was found. The control patients had occasional antibody synthesis but generally only against one single virus antigen. The intrathecal antibody synthesis against viruses did not correlate to the disability of the MS patients. The intrathecal antibody synthesis was not different in younger and older patients or patients with shorter or longer disease duration, suggesting that events leading to intrathecal antibody synthesis may occur relatively early in life in these patients.

The {{lipopolysaccharide}} is a virulence factor of this pathogen, although there are gaps in our understanding of its biosynthesis. Here we report on the characterization of K. pneumoniae lpxL, which encodes one of the enzymes responsible for the late secondary acylation of immature lipid A molecules. Analysis of the available K. pneumoniae genomes revealed that this pathogen 2 ̆ 7 s genome encodes two orthologues of Escherichia coli LpxL. Using genetic methods and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that LpxL 1 catalyzes the addition of laureate and LpxL 2 catalyzes the addition of myristate. Both enzymes acylated E. coli lipid A, whereas only LpxL 2 mediated K. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>lipid</b> A acylation. We show that LpxL 1 is negatively regulated by the two-component system PhoPQ. The lipid A produced by the lpxL 2 mutant lacked the 2 -hydroxymyristate, palmitate, and 4 -aminoarabinose decorations found in the lipid A synthesized by the wild type. The lack of 2 -hydroxymyristate was expected since LpxO modifies the myristate transferred by LpxL 2 to the lipid A. The absence of the other two decorations is most likely caused by the downregulation of phoPQ and pmrAB expression. LpxL 2 -dependent lipid A acylation protects Klebsiella from polymyxins, mediates resistance to phagocytosis, limits the activation of inflammatory responses by macrophages, and is required for pathogen survival in the wax moth (Galleria mellonella). Our findings indicate that the LpxL 2 contribution to virulence is dependent on LpxO-mediated hydroxylation of the LpxL 2 -transferred myristate. Our studies suggest that LpxL 2 might be a candidate target in the development of anti-K. pneumoniae drugs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tuberculosis, {{once thought}} to have been controlled, is now resurgent {{in many parts of the}} world. Many gaps exist in {{understanding}} the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, especially secondary and cavitary disease. Evidence presented here suggests that cord factor (trehalose 6, 6 ’-dimycolate, TDM) is a key driver of these processes. It is the most abundant lipid released by virulent M. tuberculosis (MTB) and can switch between two sets of activities. On organisms, TDM is non-toxic and protects them from killing by macrophages. On lipid surfaces, it becomes antigenic and highly toxic. Caseating granulomas, the hallmark of primary tuberculosis, develop from interaction of TDM with lipid within granulomas. New evidence indicates that secondary tuberculosis begins as a <b>lipid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> that accumulates mycobacterial antigens and host lipids in alveoli before developing conditions for activation of the toxicity and antigenicity of TDM. This rapidly produces caseation necrosis that leads to cavities. Finally, virulent MTB release large amounts of TDM during growth as a pellicle within cavities. We propose that such growth results in activation of the toxicity and antigenicity of TDM at the air interface and that presence of the activated TDM perpetuates the cavity...|$|E

Objective: The purpose of the present case report is to reveal the role of the abuse of N. sativa seed oil (black cumin seed oil), as an exceptional cause of ELP, which has not been, to our knowledge, previously documented. Case report: A 50 -year-old man was evaluated for a 6 -month history of cough, sputum and progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion. His medical history included long-term smoking. We questioned the patient specifically about use of any traditional herbal medicinal products. He acknowledged that he had been taking one tablespoon (15  ml) of N. sativa oil at bedtime since 8  months (8 bottles of 500  ml) for the purposes of tonification. Exogenous <b>lipid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> was suspected. Physical examination found bilateral crackles of the lung bases. Lung function tests were normal.
