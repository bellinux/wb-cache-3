5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the progressive rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} context {{sensitive}} attacks, is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs {{a sequence of}} actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game {{in the form of}} an encounter with female twins, which has become a regular feature throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> over their content and marketing, {{ended with the}} late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{the killing}} of Jewish women and {{children}} is concerned, Meyszner's direct involvement is less clear. According to Moll, Schäfer claimed that he had received the orders and gas van directly from Berlin and had carried out the killings with little reference to Meyszner. Manoschek accepts Schäfer's assertion, stating that Schäfer also had an independent Gestapo chain of command, over which Meyszner had very <b>limited</b> <b>control.</b> Despite this, as HSSPF he was formally responsible for all his subordinates, including the Gestapo department that killed the Jewish women and children. He was also responsible for carrying out policies that saw 70,000 Serbs transported to the Reich as forced labourers, 4,000 of whom ended up in occupied Norway. The Holocaust in Serbia played little part in his trial before the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade between 9 and 22 December 1946. On 22 December, {{he was sentenced to}} death, along with most of the 20 leading members of his HSSPF staff who were tried at the same time. On 24 January 1947, Meyszner was executed by hanging.|$|E

5|$|In 1815, the Portuguese {{crown prince}} Dom João (later Dom JoãoVI), acting as regent, created the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, which raised {{the status of}} Brazil from colony to kingdom. He ascended the Portuguese throne the {{following}} year, {{after the death of}} his mother, Maria I of Portugal. He returned to Portugal in April 1821, leaving behind his son and heir, Prince Dom Pedro, to rule Brazil as his regent. The Portuguese government immediately moved to revoke the political autonomy that Brazil had been granted since 1808. The threat of losing their <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> over local affairs ignited widespread opposition among Brazilians. José Bonifácio de Andrada, along with other Brazilian leaders, convinced Pedro to declare Brazil's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed PedroI, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. The declaration of independence was opposed throughout Brazil by armed military units loyal to Portugal. The ensuing war of independence was fought across the country, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers to surrender did so in March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal in August 1825.|$|E
5|$|On {{designing}} the battle system, Kitao {{said that his}} two main aims were creating something never before seen in an RPG and designing something accessible yet challenging. Adjustments to the battle system went on all through development, with some changes being made {{at the very last}} minute. The gun customization system was originally a puzzle-based system, but was later converted to a diagram set-up. Weapons were originally going to be represented in three-dimensions, but technical issues prevented this. On the whole, the development was a taxing one for him. The most difficult part about incorporating guns into the system was creating a workable system that did not rely on first-person and third-person shooter mechanics. The two types of damage and various special moves in the game were born from the team's discussions about how the three playable characters might be directed to work in unison, dealing different types of attacks. Being able to attack while moving was inspired by a suggestion from staff members stemming from more traditional action games and scenes from Hollywood action films. For the camera, the team decided to balance it between <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> during player turns and a more dynamic feel during attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focus on}} {{evaluation}} of impacts of traffic control strategies on traffic congestion relief. The traffic simulation network is modeled in a traffic microsimulation {{environment and the}} calibration {{with the real world}} data. As for traffic control strategies, fixed-time ramp metering, speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> and integrated control are tested and performances are compared with the actual condition along the stretch. The results indicate that there is an optimal cycle length for fixed time ramp metering and the best performance achieved at 15 s. The speed limits are tested for 60 to 100 km/h range with 10 km/h increments. Maximum performance is achieved at the speed of 70 km/h. The performance of integrated control is also examined. The results show that, 15 s cycle time fixed-time ramp metering along with 70 km/h speed <b>limit</b> <b>control</b> has the best performance overall. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the viability of integrated traffic control in metropolitan freeways is highly auspicious.
