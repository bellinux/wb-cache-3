50|$|Over {{a period}} of about three months, adult female gum tree weevils lay about two hundred eggs in batches of about ten {{contained}} in grey coloured capsules attached to leaves. These hatch after about a week and the larvae begin to feed on leaves and young shoots. After moulting three times, the larvae crawl or fall to the ground where they pupate a few centimetres beneath the surface. The weevil's life cycle takes seven to eleven weeks from egg <b>laying</b> to <b>maturity,</b> depending on the temperature. In Mauritius there are about four generations annually and the weevils breed throughout the year. In South Africa there are two generations and they overwinter as adults.|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted {{at different times}} {{with the objective of}} investigating how the body weight of Japanese quails {{at the end of the}} rearing period may alter the performance during the laying phase. In both experiments, the birds were distributed in five treatments according to their body weights, which were obtained at 42 and 35 days of age for the first and second experiments respectively, and the following categories were considered for said experiments: very light, light, average, heavy and very heavy. For both experiments, the treatments were distributed in a randomized block design, at eight repetitions per treatment for the first one and six for the second one, both at 18 birds per repetition. During the first experiment, sexual <b>maturity,</b> <b>laying</b> percentage, marketable egg percentage, average egg weight and egg mass, in second experiment, feed consumption, final body weight, eggs per bird present, laying percentage, average egg weight, egg mass and alimentary conversion were evaluated. The results obtained show that Japanese quails whose body weight is lower than 140 grams at 42 days of age, or lower than 120 grams at 35 days of age show significantly worse productive results during the laying phase...|$|R
40|$|The thyroid {{stimulating}} {{hormone receptor}} gene (TSHR) has been suggested to be a ‘‘domestication locus”in the chicken. A strong selective sweep over TSHR in domestic breeds together with significant effects ofa mutation in the gene on several domestication related traits, indicate that the gene has been importantfor chicken domestication. TSHR {{plays a key role}} in the signal transduction of seasonal reproduction,which is characteristically less strict in domestic animals. We used birds from an advanced intercross linebetween ancestral Red Junglefowl (RJF) and domesticated White Leghorn (WL) to investigate effects ofthe mutation on reproductive traits as well as on TSHB, TSHR, DIO 2 and DIO 3 gene expression duringaltered day length (photoperiod). We bred chickens homozygous for either the mutation (d/d) or wildtype allele (w/w), allowing assessment of the effect of genotype at this locus while also controlling forbackground variation in the rest of the genome. TSHR gene expression in brain was significantly lowerin both d/d females and males and d/d females showed a faster onset of egg <b>laying</b> at sexual <b>maturity</b> thanw/w. Furthermore, d/d males showed a reduced testicular size response to decreased day length, andlower levels of TSHB and DIO 3 expression. Additionally, purebred White Leghorn females kept under naturalshort day length in Sweden during December had active ovaries and lower levels of TSHR and DIO 3 expression compared to Red Junglefowl females kept under similar conditions. Our study indicates thatthe TSHR mutation affects photoperiodic response in chicken by reducing dependence of seasonal reproduction,a typical domestication feature, and may therefore have been important for chickendomestication.

40|$|ABSTRACT Relative {{performance}} levels were compared for White Leghorn pullets of a selected and an unselected control strain in different laying-house environments {{in each of}} two experiments. Experiment 1 involved single-bird cages, separated-strain flocks in floor pens, and intermingled-strain flocks in floor pens. In addition, Experiment 2 included a three-bird cage environment. Genotype by environment interactions were detected in Experiment 1 for egg and body weights and in Experiment 2 for rate of <b>lay</b> after sexual <b>maturity,</b> livability, egg weight, hen-housed rate of lay, egg mass, body weight, and body weight gain. Although fewer genotype by environment inter-actions were found in Experiment 1, there was a distinct tendency for the strains to differ (or fail to differ) in similar ways {{in each of the}} three environments compared in the two experiments. Pullets of the more aggressive and socially dominant selected strain were generally superior in performance to unselected strain pullets when they were intermingled in floor pens, but those differences tended to disappear when pullets of the two strains were kept in separated-strain flocks. These results are taken as indirect evidence supporting the conclusion that differences in stress associated with the social environment may contribute to genotype by housing environment interactions for performance traits. Selected strain pullets generally were superior to unselected strain pullets when kept in cages with unlimited feed available. Unselected strain pullets put on excessive weight in cages as indicated by both linear and curvilinear regression analyses; the lighter the pullets were in body weight the greater the number of eggs laid after 40 weeks old. However, under the same conditions, selected strain pullets were, on the average, near optimal body weight for maximum egg production during the latter part of the laying year.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate the}} effect of jet plane sounds on the economical performances in female chickens, by use of growth, feed requirement, sexual <b>maturity,</b> <b>laying</b> rate, average and total egg weights, and some other characters as the indicators. The experiment {{was carried out in}} the specially constructed poultry house, provided with air conditioning and sound arresting equipments, using S. C. White Leghorn and New Hampshire chickens as the materials. The frequency and intensity of sounds supplied was settled according to those of flying over jet planes near Itazuke airbase. The frequency was from 72 to 166 per day and the intensity was about 110 - 120 phones. There was no detrimental effect of the sounds on growth rate, feed requirement, and sexual maturity in chickens treated with the sounds throughout their lives. However, a little retardation of sexual maturity was found in some pullets, when the sound supplies was started at 16 weeks of age. In the group of pullets treated with the sounds throughout their laying period, the laying rate seemed to decrease more rapidly than that of the control group, and a significant interaction between the breed and the treatment was estimated in the total weight of laid eggs. Analyzing the data, the authors summarized their opinion that White Leghorn pullets may be more susceptible to the sound supplies than New Hampshire pullets. A little detrimental effect of the sounds seemed to be observed on the total weight of laid eggs, when the treatment was begun after the pullets had come to layers. No significant effect of the sounds was observed on the frequency of occurrence of soft shelled or blood spotted eggs. 本研究は成長,飼料の要求率,性成熟,産卵率,平均卵重量,生産卵総重量,およびその他いくつかの形質を指標として,雌鶏の生産性に対するジェット機騒音の影響を明らかにするために計画されたものである. 実験は単冠白色レグホンおよびニューハンプシャー種を供試鶏として,本研究のためにとくに設計された,空気および音響制御装置をもつた実験鶏舎内で遂行された. 供試鶏に加与された騒音の回数と強度は,板付飛行場付近の実情に応じて定められたが,その回数は 1 日あたり 72 回から 166 回の間にあり,強度はおよそ 110 ～ 120 フオーンであつた. 幼雛の時期から継続的に騒瞥を加与したばあいには,成長,飼料要求率,および性成熟に対して,その影響を認めることができなかつた. しかし 16 週齢以後に騒音処理を開始したものには,少数例ではあつたが多少性成熟の遅延がみられた. 産卵期を通じて騒音処理を継続したものでは,産卵率がいくらか早く低下するような傾向があり,生産卵の総重量において品種と処理との間の相互作用に有意性が認められた. 著者らはこの関係資料を分析した結果,白色レグホンの方がニューハンプシャーよりも,騒音処理の影響をうけやすいと要約した. 産卵開始後に騒音処理を開始すると,生産卵の総重量にいくらかの悪影響があるように思われた. 軟卵および血点卵の出現率には,騒音の影響を認めることができなかつた...|$|R
40|$|The {{trial was}} started by {{importing}} GDR chicken from Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany and indigenous Cameroon fowl by collecting eggs from villages in the Western highland area of Cameroon hatched at the Institute of Animal and Veterinary Research, Mankon (Cameroon). The males of the base population were subjected to fattening test (body weight performance) up to 12 weeks of age. Approximately 10 percent of the birds were slaughtered at 12 weeks of age to determine gizzard, feet, head, liver, heart and dressed yield as the percent of the liveweight. The hen were tested for egg production up to 72 weeks of age and traits such as egg number, body weight at 20, 30, 36, 42, and 72 weeks, shank length at 20, 30 and 42 weeks, egg quality, survival age, age at sexual maturity, feed intake and abdominal fat were measured. First generation chicks were then produced by mating the parent generation using artificial insemination to produce a stock which comprised of eight genotype groups (DlNN; DLNO; LDNN; LDNO, LONN; LONO; DANN; and DANO). The cockerels were subjected to fattening test and egg production of pullets was recorded following the procedure as in the parent generation. Results from fattening test in the parent generation indicated that the Dahlem both normal feathered and naked neck had higher body weight at hatch than the local fowl. At 12 weeks of age, the Dahlem naked naked neck males had higher body weight dressed percentage than the Dahlem normal feathered and the indigenous fowl (normal feathered). Traits such as gizzard, head, liver and heart percentage were unimportant since no significant difference were observed among the three-genotype groups. Results from laying test (Parent generation) indicated that the Dahlem Red both naked neck and normal feathered laid eggs than the indigenous fowl. The Dahlem (both naked neck and normal feathered) had higher feed intake and feed efficiency than the indigenous chicken. Indigenous fowl came into <b>lay</b> (Sexual <b>maturity)</b> later than the Dahlem birds but had lower mortality and higher yolk percentage. Eggs of Dahlem layer had higher albumen and yolk height {{than that of the}} local fowl. No differences were observed among genotypes for yolk colour, shell percentage and egg breaking strength. Indigenous hens had higher abdominal fat percentage than the Dahlem hens. Results on body weight in the first generation, revealed that Dahlem naked neck chicks had body weight at hatching. Local x Dahlem naked neck crossbreds had highest 12 weeks body weight and carcass yield. Heterosis for 12 weeks body weight was positive in both naked neck and normal feathered type. Local x Dahlem crossbreds, both normal feathered and naked neck types had higher 12 weeks body weight than its reciprocal cross. Results on egg production performance (G 1) revealed that local x Dahlem crossbreds produced highest number of eggs (233 eggs) than local naked neck (142 eggs). Dahlem normal feathered hens produced higher egg mass (12. 8 kg) than local naked neck hens (6. 7 kg). Highest feed consumption was observed for in the Dahlem normal feathered genotype group (0. 27) and it was lowest for local naked neck genotype group (0. 16). Crossbreds attained earkier sexual maturity than the pure breeds. Positive heterosis was observed for egg number and egg mass in both naked neck and normal feathered genotypes. Normal feathered local x Dahlem crossbreds produced higher egg number than its reciprocal cross but it was reverse for the naked neck type. Similar pattern was observed for egg mass also. Difference in feed efficiency was not found between reciprocal crosses of normal feathered types while local x Dahlem crossbred had higher feed efficiency among the naked neck type. An appreciable improvement in body weight and egg production traits was observed on crossing ICF with German Dahlem Red. Positive heterosis was observed for body weight in cockerels, egg number and egg mass. Reciprocal effects were variable between the normal feathered and naked neck genotypes for most of the traits. Effect of necked neck gene was consistent in improving body weight, carcass yield and egg weight...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on 180 one week old Japanese quail chicks. They were divided into six groups. Treatments were as follows: G 1 (control), G 2 (1 g lactose/ kg), G 3 (3 g yeast/ kg), G 4 (1 g lactose + 3 g yeast/ kg), G 5 (2 g benzoic acid + 5 g citric acid / kg) and G 6 (1 g lactose + 2 g benzoic acid + 5 g citric acid / kg). When the birds reached 42 days of age, all birds were sexed and transferred to layer cages the birds were divided into 6 groups each of 24 birds, which were subdivided into 3 replicates [2 males to 6 females in a 1 : 3 sex ratio] for 12 weeks reproductive and laying trial. They were fed all dry mash layer diets. The feed additives were continued {{in the same manner}} as in growth period. For each replicate, egg number, egg weight and egg mass as well as weekly feed intake, egg production and FCR were recorded. The eggs were collected twice daily from each group, stored at 18 ºC for 6 days incubated in standard automatic incubator for 17 days to follow the effect of used feed additives on fertility, hatchability and chick quality. At the last three days of each egg collection period, eggs were collected from each replicate to evaluate egg quality traits [shell weight (wt.) and %, shell thickness, shape index, egg yolk wt. and % and albumin wt. and %]. Onset of egg <b>laying</b> and sexual <b>maturity</b> came earlier than the control in all treated groups. Mean egg production recorded higher values in G 6, G 5 and G 2 respectively. Mean FCR was improved numerically in all treated groups when compared with the control. Mean values of egg weight and egg mass were numerically higher in all treated groups than the control. Shell quality parameters were not affected with any treatment compared with the control. While shape index was improved significantly in G 2, G 4 and G 5, with numerical improve in G 3 and G 6. Mean values of egg albumin and egg yolk weight were improved in all treated groups. Mean values of egg yolk cholesterol were decreased significantly in G 5 and G 6 while it numerically decreased in other groups compared with the control. Higher fertility was recorded in G 2, G 5 and G 6 respectively. Hatchability% of incubated and fertile eggs was higher than the control especially in G 2 and G 6. The hatched chick quality was higher than the control in G 6, G 5 and G 2 respectively. Furthermore, all treatments improved hatched chick length when compared to the control...|$|R
