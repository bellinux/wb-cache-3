[...] "Have we not known in other countries how a <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriage</b> might subsist betwixt persons of differing degree?--ay, and be no hindrance to prevent the husband from conjoining himself afterwards with a more suitable partner?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{this last}} {{consideration}} suggests {{another aspect of}} right and left which must not be passed over without one word in this brief survey of {{the philosophy of the}} subject. The superiority of the right caused it early to be regarded as the fortunate, lucky, and trusty hand; the inferiority of the left caused it equally to be considered as ill-omened, unlucky, and, in one expressive word, sinister. Hence come innumerable phrases and superstitions. It is the right hand of friendship that we always grasp; it is with our own right hand that we vindicate our honour against sinister suspicions. On the other hand, it is 'over the left' that we believe a doubtful or incredible statement; a left-handed compliment or a <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriage</b> carry their own condemnation with them. On the right hand of the host is the seat of honour; it is to the left that the goats of ecclesiastical controversy are invariably relegated. The very notions of the right hand and ethical right have got mixed up inextricably in every language: droit and la droite display it in French as much as right and the right in English. But to be gauche is merely to be awkward and clumsy; while to be right is something far higher and more important.|$|E

I will [...] seek out this Martigny for you, and I have the vanity to think I [...] shall be able {{to persuade him to}} take the course which his own true [...] interest, as well as yours, so plainly points out--and that is, to [...] depart and make us free of him. You must not grudge a round sum of [...] money, should that prove necessary--we must make wings for him to [...] fly with, and I must be empowered by you to that purpose. I cannot [...] think you have any thing serious to fear from a lawsuit. Your father [...] threw out this sinister hint at a moment when he was enraged at his [...] wife, and irritated by his son; and I have little doubt that his [...] expressions were merely flashes of anger at the moment, though I see [...] they have made a deep impression on you. At all events, he spoke of [...] a preference to his illegitimate son, as something which it was in [...] his own power to give or to withhold; and he has died without [...] bestowing it.

5000|$|Plaçage was a {{recognized}} extralegal system in French and Spanish slave colonies of North America (including the Caribbean) by which ethnic European men {{entered into the}} equivalent of common-law marriages with non-Europeans of African, Native American and mixed-race descent. The term comes from the French placer meaning [...] "to place with". The women were not legally recognized as wives but were known as placées; their relationships were recognized among the free people of color as mariages de la main gauche or <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriages.</b> They became institutionalized with contracts or negotiations that settled property on {{the woman and her}} children, and in some cases gave them freedom if enslaved. The system flourished throughout the French and Spanish colonial periods, reaching its zenith during the latter, between 1769 and 1803.|$|R
6000|$|But the old Ancien Regime {{would have}} shuddered, did shudder, {{at such a}} notion. The supreme class was to keep itself pure, and avoid all taint of darker blood, {{shutting}} its eyes {{to the fact that}} some of its most famous heroes had been born of such <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriages</b> as that of Robert of Normandy with the tanner's daughter of Falaise. [...] "Some are so curious in this behalf," [...] says quaint old Burton, writing about 1650, [...] "as these old Romans, our modern Venetians, Dutch, and French, that if two parties dearly love, the one noble, the other ignoble, they may not, by their laws, match, though equal otherwise in years, fortunes, education, and all good affection. In Germany, except they can prove their gentility by three descents, they scorn to match with them. A nobleman must marry a noblewoman; a baron, a baron's daughter; a knight, a knight's. As slaters sort their slates, do they degrees and families." ...|$|R
60|$|William the Pious had fifteen children, eight {{daughters and}} seven sons, who, as the {{property}} left {{among them was}} small, drew lots to determine which one of them should marry, and continue the stout race of the Guelphs. The lot fell on Duke George, the sixth brother. The others remained single, or contracted <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriages</b> after the princely fashion of those days. It is a queer picture—that of the old prince dying in his little wood-built capital, and his seven sons tossing up which should inherit and transmit the crown of Brentford. Duke George, the lucky prizeman, made the tour of Europe, during which he visited the Court of Queen Elizabeth; and in the year 1617, came back and settled at Zell, with a wife out of Darmstadt. His remaining brothers all kept their house at Zell, for economy’s sake. And presently, in due course, they all died—all the honest dukes; Ernest, and Christian, and Augustus, and Magnus, and George, and John—and they are buried in the brick church of Brentford yonder, by the sandy banks of the Aller.|$|R
60|$|Thus spake the chivalrous Sir Hugo, in his disgust at {{the young}} and {{beautiful}} widow of a Mallinger Grandcourt being left with only two thousand {{a year and a}} house in a coal-mining district. To the rector that income naturally appeared less shabby and less accompanied with mortifying privations; but in this conversation he had devoured a much keener sense than the baronet's of the humiliation cast over his niece, and also over her nearest friends, by the conspicuous publishing of her husband's relation to Mrs. Glasher. And like all men who are good husbands and fathers, he felt the humiliation through the minds of the women who would be chiefly affected by it; so that the annoyance of first hearing the facts was far slighter than what he felt in communicating them to Mrs. Davilow, and in anticipating Gwendolen's feeling whenever her mother saw fit to tell her of them. For the good rector had an innocent conviction that his niece was unaware of Mrs. Glasher's existence, arguing with masculine soundness from what maidens and wives were likely to know, do, and suffer, and having had a most imperfect observation of the particular maiden and wife in question. Not so Gwendolen's mother, who now thought that she saw an explanation of much that had been enigmatic in her child's conduct and words before and after her engagement, concluding that in some inconceivable way Gwendolen had been informed of this <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriage</b> and the existence of the children. She trusted to opportunities that would arise in moments of affectionate confidence before and during their journey to England, when she might gradually learn how far the actual state of things was clear to Gwendolen, and prepare her for anything that might be a disappointment. But she was spared from devices on the subject.|$|E
60|$|Laws of {{the wisest}} human device are, after all, but the sheath {{of the sword}} of Power, which must {{not be allowed to}} rust in them till it cannot be drawn swiftly in time of need. President Lincoln had many scruples to {{overcome}} ere he could overstep the limits of precedent into the divine air of moral greatness. Like most men, he was reluctant to be the bearer of that message of God with which his name will be linked in the grateful memory of mankind. If he won an immortality of fame by consenting to ally himself with the eternal justice, and to reinforce his armies by the inspiration of their own nobler instincts, an equal choice of renown is offered to his successor in applying the same loyalty to conscience in the establishment of peace. We could not live together half slave and half free; shall we succeed better in trying a second <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriage</b> between democracy and another form of aristocracy, less gross, but not less uncongenial? They who before misled the country into a policy false and deadly to the very truth which was its life and strength, by the fear of abolitionism, are making ready to misrule it again by the meaner prejudice of color. We can have no permanent peace with the South but by Americanizing it, by compelling it, if need be, to accept the idea, and with it the safety of democracy. At present we seem on the brink of contracting to protect from insurrection States in which a majority of the population, many of them now trained to arms, and all of them conscious of a claim upon us to make their freedom strong enough to protect them, are to be left at the mercy of laws which they have had no share in enacting.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of royalty, a morganatic marriage, {{sometimes}} called a <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriage</b> is a marriage between people of unequal social rank, which prevents {{the passage of the}} husband's titles and privileges to the wife and any children born of the marriage.|$|E
5000|$|She was nicknamed [...] "Miss Bessy" [...] {{at court}} as an anglophile, not {{regarded}} beautiful or clever, but fascinated the king by refusing his advances. [...] She was persuaded to [...] "sacrifice {{herself for the}} country" [...] and accept the king by her relative Count Finckenstein, who wished to replace Wilhelmine von Lichtenau, with the argument {{that she would be}} able to save the king from the bad company of his circle. She accepted on condition that the queen's consent should be gained to a <b>left-handed</b> <b>marriage</b> with the King to ease her conscience.|$|E
