Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. He just does not fit into the picture of my mother's death... I have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> things Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E
500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The one thing I noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} episode, Lieberstein said {{he sought to}} appeal to {{newcomers}} to the series and attract them to the show, without alienating regular The Office watchers: [...] "We {{wanted to do a}} stand-alone comedy episode that could bring people in." [...] Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, [...] "It almost had an air of a pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. We wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front." [...] The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I feel that a comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs." [...] Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, [...] "It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy." ...|$|E

Then she looked at Manston; he was already regarding her with some purpose in his glance.|$|E
6000|$|She {{said she}} had taken her guitar that evening, {{as soon as she}} had {{finished}} her supper, but had fallen asleep as usual. She asked the Prince, [...] "Do you play?"

He wished her to perform, but she urged him, and he soon saw a hand-organ, and said he was pretty sure that he could play on that. So he tried, and, sure enough, he could play very well, and the Princess sat down on the floor by him, and he played for almost an hour and three quarters, and they were both very much pleased. Then the Prince's arm got tired, and he stopped and asked the Princess to tell him her history. She said she was a little ashamed to tell him her story, because he might think that she was not of as good descent as himself; but the Prince insisting, she told him that her mother was a water-woman.|$|E

How came they to have passed {{out of the hands}} of a refined lady (as she evidently was, with whom I first saw them) into the charge of quite a common woman like her with whom I saw one of the boys at Venice? Here is but one chapter of the story. Can any man write the next, or that preceding the strange one on which I happened to light? Who knows? the mystery may have some quite simple solution. I saw two children, attired like little princes, taken from their mother and consigned to other care; and a fortnight afterwards, one of them barefooted and like a beggar. Who will read this riddle of The Two Children in Black? ...|$|E
60|$|One {{of their}} emperors, named Claudius, sent his {{soldiers}} {{to conquer the}} island, and then came to see it himself, and called himself Brittanicus {{in honor of the}} victory, just as if he had done it himself, instead of his generals. One British chief, whose name was Caractacus, who had fought very bravely against the Romans, was brought to Rome, with chains on his hands and feet, and set before them emperor. As he stood there, he said that, when he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> grand buildings of stone and marble in the streets, he could not think why the Romans should want to take away the poor rough-stone huts of the Britons. The wife of Caractacus, who had also been brought a prisoner to Rome, fell upon her knees imploring for pity, but the conquered chief asked for nothing and exhibited no signs of fear. Claudius was kind to Caractacus; but the Romans went on conquering Britain till they had won all the part of it that lies south of the river Tweed; and, as the people beyond that point were more fierce and savage still, a very strong wall, with a bank of earth and deep ditch was made to keep them out, and always watched by Roman soldiers.|$|E
