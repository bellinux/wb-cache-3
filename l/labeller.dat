Not by dogmatic assertion, does it teach the impossibility of comprehending the Ultimate Cause of things; but it leads us clearly to recognise this impossibility by bringing us in every direction to boundaries we cannot cross. It realises to us in a way which nothing else can, the littleness of human intelligence in the face of that which transcends human intelligence. While towards the traditions and authorities of men its attitude may be proud, before the impenetrable veil which hides the Absolute its attitude is humble--a true pride and a true humility. Only the sincere man of science (and by this title we do not mean the mere calculator of distances, or analyser of compounds, or <b>labeller</b> of species; but him who through lower truths seeks higher, and eventually the highest)--only the genuine man of science, we say, can truly know how utterly beyond, not only human knowledge but human conception, is the Universal Power of which Nature, and Life, and Thought are manifestations.|$|E

What remains unexplored is to what extent variation of perception within the same language exerts any influence on phonetic transcriptions. We report a case study of the labelling of vowel quality performed by native speakers of Dutch from either The Netherlands or Belgium. An analysis of the distribution of vowel quality labels reveals that <b>labellers</b> from The Netherlands have an other preference for certain vowel quality labels than <b>labellers</b> from Belgium. The inter-labeller agreement between is higher between <b>labellers</b> from the same region than between <b>labellers</b> from different regions.

Prosodic events marked by hand vary considerably from <b>labeller</b> to <b>labeller</b> and may be marked inconsistently within any labellers transcription.

40|$|International audienceMislabelling is a {{critical}} problem for stream-based active learning methods because it not only impacts the classification accuracy but also deviates the active learner from querying informative data.

We first propose a mislabelling likelihood measure to characterize the potentially mislabelled instances. This measure {{is based on the}} degree of disagreement among the predicted and the queried class label (given by the <b>labeller).</b> Then, we derive a measure of informativeness that expresses how much the label of an instance needs to be corrected by an expert <b>labeller.</b> Specifically, an instance is worth relabelling if it shows highly conflicting information among the predicted and the queried labels. We show that filtering instances with a high mislabelling likelihood and correcting only the filtered instances with a high conflicting information greatly improves the performances of the active learner.

40|$|International audienceMost {{existing}} {{active learning}} methods for classification, {{assume that the}} observed labels (i. e. given by a human <b>labeller)</b> are perfectly correct. However, in real world applications, the <b>labeller</b> is usually subject to labelling errors that reduce the classification accuracy of the learned model.

(2) is it always good to abstain from learning when data is suspected to be mislabelled? (3) which mislabelled instances require relabelling? We propose a hybrid active learning strategy based on two measures. The first measureallows to filter the potentially mislabelled instances, based on the degree of disagreement among the manually given label and the predicted class label. The second measure allows to select (for relabelling) only the most informative instances that deserve to be corrected. An instance is worth relabelling if it shows highly conflicting information among the predicted and the queried labels.
