40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} methods and the empirical results {{of various types}} of arbitrage strategies in past numerical studies. Although arbitrage can be generally dividend into two categories including risk-free arbitrage and risky arbitrage, {{there is still a}} certain level of risk which arbitrageurs should take, no matter what kinds of arbitrage. Since there are limitations and transactions costs in conducting arbitraging strategies, the profit of arbitrage may be plentiful in theory but it could be misleading in practice after considering transactions costs and potential risk. It appears that all arbitrage strategies are theoretically sound, but it is debatable that arbitrage strategies will succeed in the real world. The key factors for arbitrage strategies to succeed depend on how to identify various types of arbitrage strategies, exploit market inefficiency, to reduce transaction costs, and to evaluate potential risk.

5|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> the radial {{velocity}} method {{used to detect}} 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by {{radial velocity}} measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> the radial {{velocity}} method {{used to detect}} Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the {{radial velocity}} measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> the radial {{velocity}} method {{used to detect}} Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E

In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E

In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
