25|$|Douglass {{considered}} photography {{very important}} in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even {{in the hands of}} a racist white, photographs being an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy. He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy slave. He tended to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> into the camera to confront the viewer, with a stern look.|$|E
25|$|In Chamber of Secrets, Nick is {{a victim}} of the Basilisk that Ginny Weasley unleashes under the {{influence}} of Tom Riddle. The stare of the Basilisk is lethal to anyone who looks it directly in the eye. All of its living victims meet its gaze indirectly, either from a reflection or by seeing it through something else, and are only petrified rather than killed. Nick is the only one to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at the Basilisk, but he too is petrified since he is a ghost and cannot die again. Nick also protected Hufflepuff student Justin Finch-Fletchley from death after Justin saw the basilisk's eyes through Nick's transparent body, thus only petrifying him as well.|$|E

He stated that [...] "persons with normal sight can <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at the sun, or at the strongest artificial light, without injury or discomfort," [...] and gave several examples of patients' vision purportedly improving after sungazingthis is at variance with the well-known risk of eye damage that can result from direct sunlight observation.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{horizontal}} band separating the foreground and background, whose {{function is to}} separate the Holy Family from the background figures and St. John the Baptist. The background figures are five nudes, whose meaning and function are subject to much speculation and debate. [...] The Holy Family is much larger in size than the nudes in the background, and {{there appears to be}} water in between the land where the Holy Family and the nudes are situated. [...] The Holy Family all gaze at Christ, but none of the nudes <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at him. [...] The far background contains a landscape.|$|E
500|$|Bates said that, just as {{one should}} not attempt to run a {{marathon}} without training, one should not immediately <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at the sun, but he suggested {{that it could be}} worked up to. He acknowledged that looking at the sun could have ill effects, but characterized them as being [...] "always temporary" [...] and in fact the effects of strain in response to sunlight. He wrote that he had cured people who believed that the sun had caused them permanent eye damage. In his magazine, Bates later suggested exposing only the white part of the eyeball to direct sunlight, and only for seconds at a time, after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} marks {{a departure}} from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels {{to the right of}} the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, [...] "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at any of the heavenly figures, but stares into the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.|$|E
500|$|The Entombment shows Christ's body, {{wrapped in}} a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns, as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is {{attended}} by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet. The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes, even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows. The vista in The Entombment is {{regarded as one of}} his finest, and is typically [...] composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky.|$|E
500|$|At the western, North Korean-held base of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{were the}} villages of Ogok and Tundok, [...] from the crest. A north-south {{mountain}} trail crossed a high saddle just north of these villages and up the west slope about halfway {{to the top of}} Battle Mountain. This road gave the North Koreans an advantage in mounting and supplying their attacks in the area. A trail system ran from Ogok and Tundok to the crests of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong. From the top of Battle Mountain an observer could <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> down into the North Korean-held valley. At the same time, from Battle Mountain the North Koreans could look down into the Haman valley eastward and observe the US 24th Infantry command post, supply road, artillery positions, and approach trails. Whichever side held the crest of Battle Mountain could see into the rear areas of the other. Both forces, seeing the advantages of holding the crest of Battle Mountain, fought relentlessly to capture it in a six-week-long battle.|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Las Meninas relate to earlier works by Velázquez {{in which he}} plays with {{conventions}} of representation. In the Rokeby Venus—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although [...] "often described as looking at herself, [...] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early Christ in the House of Martha and Mary of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are {{clear that this is}} the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of Los Borrachos of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early bodegones, the figures <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.|$|E
500|$|The centre {{foreground}} shows a {{group of}} five mourners, with three other figures set {{to the right and}} left. In the center group, John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her [...] "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross {{with her back to the}} viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.|$|E

William Rubin (1927–2006), the former Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA wrote that [...] "Steinberg was the first writer {{to come to grips with}} the sexual subject of the Demoiselles." ...|$|E
