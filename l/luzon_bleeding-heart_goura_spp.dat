5000|$|The <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> (Gallicolumba luzonica) {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species of ground dove in the genus Gallicolumba that are called [...] "bleeding-hearts". The <b>Luzon</b> <b>Bleeding-heart</b> is the species in which the [...] "blood" [...] feature is most pronounced, with the reddish hue {{extending}} down the belly, furthering the illusion of blood having run down the bird's breast.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> was {{featured}} on a Philippine 2-peso postage stamp in 1994.|$|R
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from most terrestrial doves found on Tawi-Tawi. The emerald dove {{is most likely}} {{to be confused with the}} bleeding-heart, but the emerald dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch, a white supercilium, and dark chestnut underparts. Two bleeding-hearts are kept as pets and may escape on Tawi-Tawi; the Sulu bleeding-heart differs from the <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> by not having the <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart's</b> purple nape and back, and from the Mindanao bleeding-heart by lacking prominent gray wing-bars and an orange belly.|$|R
50|$|It {{supports}} {{the lives of}} numerous endemic and endangered species, like the <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> pigeon (Gallicolumba luzonica), Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) and a rare riverine fish, locally called ludong (Cestreaus plicatilis).|$|R
50|$|Currently, the <b>Luzon</b> <b>Bleeding-heart</b> {{is listed}} as Near-Threatened by the IUCN. This {{is due to the}} species being {{threatened}} by habitat loss and fragmentation through deforestation for timber extraction and agricultural lands. It is also commonly trapped as a pet for its striking plumage.|$|R
50|$|Hatoful Boyfriend, {{a visual}} novel/dating sim {{in which all}} of the {{characters}} except the player are birds, notably features a <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> character named Anghel. This character is initially {{the subject of much}} concern, as characters who are unfamiliar with Luzon plumage fear that he has a gaping chest wound.|$|R
50|$|On {{its upper}} surfaces, the <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> is slate grey in colour, {{but because it}} is iridescent, it can appear to be purple, royal blue, or bottle-green, and the {{apparent}} colour varies with lighting conditions. The belly and under wing areas are buff or chestnut. As in most pigeons, there is little sexual dimorphism; males tend to be larger and have a more pronounced red patch, while females are slightly duller. The body shape is typical of the genus, with a round body, a short tail and long legs.|$|R
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart was {{originally}} described in 1894 as Phlogoenas menagei by Frank Swift Bourns and Dean Conant Worcester. The holotype, a male, was collected by {{them from the}} small island of Tataan {{off the coast of}} Tawi-Tawi in October 1891. The specific name, menagei, honors Louis F. Menage, a Minnesota real estate tycoon who funded the expedition. It {{is a member of the}} bleeding-heart superspecies, which includes <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart,</b> Mindanao bleeding-heart, Mindoro bleeding-heart, and Negros bleeding-heart; these birds are so similar that some authors have considered them to be a single species. Some authors place the Sulu bleeding-heart, the other bleeding-hearts, and the cinnamon ground dove in their own subgenus, Gallicolumba. The Sulu bleeding-heart has no known subspecies. It is also called the Tawitawi bleeding-heart and the Tawitawi Pu√±alada.|$|R
5|$|The primary playable {{character}} in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is the human}} protagonist, a boisterous hunter-gatherer {{who lives in a}} cave in the wilderness. Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> who behaves as if he were in some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor. Azami Koshiba, a no-nonsense Java sparrow and takoyaki saleswoman, became a possible love interest in the 2014 remake.|$|R
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and <b>Luzon</b> <b>bleeding-hearts</b> are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|R
