50|$|EWOLF. Another {{electrowetting}} configuration is electrowetting on liquid-infused film. The liquid-infused film {{is achieved}} by locking a <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricant</b> in a porous membrane through the delicate control of wetting properties of the liquid and solid phases. Taking advantage of the negligible contact line pinning at the liquid-liquid interface, the droplet response in EWOLF can be electrically addressed with enhanced degree of switchability and reversibility compared to the conventional EWOD. Moreover, the infiltration of <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricant</b> phase in the porous membrane also efficiently enhances the viscous energy dissipation, suppressing the droplet oscillation and leading to fast response without sacrificing the desired electrowetting reversibility. Meanwhile, the damping effect associated with the EWOLF can be tailored by manipulating the viscosity and thickness of <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricant.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sound {{working of}} {{transmitting}} power is very essential. For immaculate working of the machines, bearings {{play an important}} and critical role. Standard monitoring methods of performance evaluation of rolling element bearings with high degree of reliability are yet to be explored. Authors have proposed rolling element bearing test rig for the same [3]. The formulation requires essentially the electrical resistivity of <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricants</b> for determination of lubricant film thickness of rolling element bearings. For the purpose, a simple and inexpensive experimental setup is developed for determination of resistivity of <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricants.</b> The developed set up is capable of determination of electrical resistivity of almost all types of <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricants</b> used for Rolling Element Bearings. Determination of electrical resistivity of <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricants</b> leads to a simple and inexpensive condition monitoring method for rolling element bearings ensuring its enhanced useful life...|$|R
50|$|Ducts can be {{purchased}} {{with a variety of}} options or features. One such enhancement is pre-lubrication. Pre-lubricated ducts may be either permanently impregnated with anti-friction compounds or coated with <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricant</b> during manufacture (see GR-3155). This may or may not eliminate the need for supplementary lubrication when pulling cable into the duct. Before using a supplementary lubricant with a pre-lubricated duct, the user should check with the manufacturer to determine if the added lubricant is compatible with the pre-lubricated surface of the duct. Failure to do this may result in the cable seizing up rather than reducing the friction coefficient of the duct.|$|E
5000|$|As noted earlier, PPEs were {{developed}} {{for use in}} jet engines that involved high speed-related frictional temperatures of as high as [...] While the use of PPEs in lubricating jet engines has somewhat subsided due to their higher cost, they are still used in some aerospace applications. PPEs are also used as base fluids for radiation-resistant greases used in nuclear power plant mechanisms. PPEs and their derivatives have also found use as vapor phase lubricants in gas turbines and custom bearings, and wherever extreme environmental conditions exist. Vapor phase lubrication is achieved by heating the <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricant</b> above its boiling point. The resultant vapors are then transported to the hot bearing surface. If the temperatures of the bearing surface are kept below the lubricant’s boiling point, the vapors re-condense to provide liquid lubrication.|$|E
50|$|Both gas {{and liquid}} {{lubricants}} can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants {{are much more}} effective on account of their high specific heat capacity. Typically the <b>liquid</b> <b>lubricant</b> is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants {{may be used to}} warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled turbocharger is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short (i.e. high flow rate). If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high-speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways, reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure, typically with seized bearings. Non-flowing lubricants such as greases and pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place.|$|E
