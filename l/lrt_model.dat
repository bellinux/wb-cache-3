The main result of the LRT is that the maximum power release is obtained when the angular frequency equals the reverse of the relaxation time ωτ[*]=[*] 1, and the imaginary part of the susceptibility presents a maximum. This maximum can be experimentally observed only for low size and monodispersed MNPs. For poly-dispersed samples, the superposition of different maxima for different sizes will mask the maximum; and consequently, the frequency dependence of the SAR is almost linear. Also, the LRT predicts a square dependence of the SAR on the amplitude of the magnetic field strength without any saturation effect. However, the <b>LRT</b> <b>model</b> is limited to small applied field strengths for which the magnetic energy is smaller than the thermal energy.|$|E

In 1986, a Makuie sheep breeding station was established in the city of Maku in order to breed, protect and purify this breed. The genetic parameters for birth weight, weaning weight (3 months), 6 -month, 9 -month and yearling weight, and average daily gain from birth to weaning traits were estimated based on 25 years of data using DFREML software. Six different models were applied and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to select the appropriate model. Bivariate analysis was used to define the genetic correlation between studied traits.

40|$|Recently, one of {{the major}} {{problems}} in various countries is the management of complicated organisations to cope with the increasingly competitive marketplace. This problem can be solved using Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems which can offer an integrated view of the whole business process within an organisation in real-time. However, those systems have complicated workflow, are costly to be analysed to manage the whole business process in those systems. Thus, Long Running Transaction (<b>LRTs)</b> <b>models</b> have been proposed as optimal solutions, which can be used to simplify the analysis of ERP systems workflow to manage the whole organiational process and ensure that completed transactions in a business process are not processed in any other process. Practically, <b>LRTs</b> <b>models</b> have various problems, such as the rollback and check-pointing activities. This led to the use of Communication Closed Layers (CCLs) for decomposing processes into layers to be analysed easily using sequential programs. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to develop an advanced approach to implement and analyse the workflow of an organisation {{in order to deal with}} failures in Long Running Transaction (LRTs) within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems using Communication Closed Layers (CCLs). Furthermore, it aims to examine the possible enhancements for the available methodology for ERP systems based on studying the LRT suitability and applicability to model the ERP workflows and offer simple and elegant constructs for implementing those complex and expensive ERP workflow systems. The implemented model in this thesis offers a solution for two main challenges; incompatibilities that result from the application of transitional transaction processing concepts to the ERP context and the complexity of ERP workflow. The first challenge is addressed based on offering new semantics to allow modelling of concepts, such as rollbacks and check-points through various constraints, while the second is addressed through the use of the Communication Closed Layer (CCL) approach. The implemented computational reconfigurable model of an ERP workflow system in this work is able to simulate real ERP workflow systems and allows obtaining more understanding of the use of ERP system in enterprise environments. Moreover, a case study is introduced to evaluate the application of the implemented model using three scenarios. The conducted evaluation stage explores the effectiveness of executable ERP computational models and offers a simple methodology that can be used to build those systems using novel approaches. Based on comparing the current model with two previous models, it can be concluded that the new model outperforms previous models based on benefiting from their features and solving their limitations which make them inappropriate to be used in the context of ERP workflow models...|$|R

Moreover, due to its zoonotic nature, is considered an occupational disease in human beings. This study evaluated the prevalence of seroreactors to B. canis {{in the district of}} Los Olivos through serological diagnostic method: Agar Gel Immunodiffusion (AGID). For this purpose, 288 blood samples were collected from dogs from areas north, south, east and west of the district. From these samples we obtained 1 milliliter of blood serum. The AGID with antigen B. canis was performed in order to determine canine brucellosis seropositivity. The results showed a corrected prevalence of 5. 43 % (IC ± 2. 31 %) of seroreactors to B. canis. The results of the univariate analysis did not show significant statistical association between the variables included in the study (age, sex, physiological condition, walking habits, reproductive history) on the results of serology to B. canis (p>. 05). Multivariate analysis using multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and subsequent analysis using the Likelihood ratio test (LRTest) indicated that the age of the dogs (animals older than 1 year vs animals less than 1 year) and the reproductive history (animals without a history of animal crossings history vs. crosses) are the variables that best explain the results of seropositivity to B. canis in the study (<b>LRTest</b> regression <b>model</b> with age and reproductive history p 0. 05).

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been many case-control studies {{proposed}} to test for association between haplotypes and disease, which require the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) assumption of haplotype frequencies. As such, haplotype inference of unphased genotypes and development of haplotype-based HWE tests are crucial prior to fine mapping. The goodness-of-fit test is a frequently-used method to test for HWE for multiple tightly-linked loci. However, its degrees of freedom dramatically increase with the increase of the number of loci, which may lack the test power. Therefore, in this paper, to improve the test power for haplotype-based HWE, we first write out two likelihood functions of the observed data based on the Niu’s model (NM) and inbreeding model (IM), respectively, which can cause the departure from HWE. Then, we use two expectation-maximization algorithms and one expectation-conditional-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters under the HWE, IM and NM models, respectively. Finally, we propose the likelihood ratio tests LRT 1 and LRT 2 for haplotype-based HWE under the NM and IM models, respectively. We simulate the HWE, Niu’s, inbreeding and population stratification models to assess the validity and compare the performance of these two LRT tests. The simulation results show that both of the tests control the type I error rates well in testing for haplotype-based HWE. If the NM model is true, then LRT 1 is more powerful.

40|$|Decomposition of {{time series}} into the unobserved cyclical, trend, {{seasonal}} and irregular components is a conventional treatment for economic data. Many macroeconomic time series are nonstationary and have dominating trend components whose understanding {{is important for}} forecasting and economic policy making, etc. and in case of multiple series, {{it is necessary to}} understand the mutual hidden linear relationships among trends. Two competing views of this trending behavior are the deterministic and the stochastic trend models. In a multivariate context, however, more interesting problem is how these trends are related. We confine the study to the case of linear mean-nonstationary time series models with Gaussian noise, that is, time series with trends. The purpose of the thesis is to propose models to investigate the linear relationships among trend components of several series. Our model regresses the level, the velocity and the acceleration of the predictor trend series 2 ̆ 7 on the dependent trend series. 　　Some recent works have paid attention to trend behavior and cyclical fluctuations around a trend to elucidate the current features of the time series of a system. System analysis through multivariate autoregression has been considered to analyze the cyclical activity of the series and the preliminary seasonal adjustment is a widely applied method for series with seasonalities. Those two methods have been combined with the stochastic difference model for the trend components to study the hidden mutual relationships among the cyclical fluctuations of the multivariate nonstationary time series (Kato, Naniwa and Ishiguro, 1995). The methodology of modeling trends in their work and in others in time series literature is not fully completed. 　　For this a linearly related trend (LRT) and a partially linear related trend (PLRT) models are introduced and in addition, we may estimate the latent linear relationships among trend components. They may also capture the long-run economic relationships. These trend models form an integrated part of the model of the mutually related time series another part of which takes care of the short-term dynamics among the series. The other two specific objectives are (i) to evaluate the performance of the models through simulation studies, and (ii) to present some real applications of the models discussed here. The MIT and <b>LRT</b> <b>models</b> are nested within the PLRT model. 　　An introduction and a brief review related to the topic of the thesis has been given in chapter 1. The background related methods of time series analysis is also presented in chapter 2. A basic multivariate trend model for nonstationary time series is introduced in chapter 3. Three specific models of the basic model have been discussed. Cyclical components are modelled by multivariate AR process. A standard seasonal component model is used for seasonal components. These models are discussed very briefly in chapter 3. The time series models are thus named as multivariate AR with mutually independent trend and seasonal component (MARTS) model, multivariate AR with linearly related trend and seasonal component (MARLTS) model, and multivariate AR with partially linear related trend (MARPLTS) model. This enable us to evaluate and select the best model by information criterion (AIC). 　　These unobserved component models for cyclical, seasonal and the trend are cast into a state-space form. The trends together with the cyclical and seasonal variations of the original time series are efficiently estimated jointly at the same time by taking advantage of the Kalman filtering and the fixed interval smoother algorithms. The hyperparameters of our Bayesian models are estimated by numerical optimization procedure. The choice of the best model among the candidate models is realized by the minimum AIC procedure. The state space representation of the models and estimation procedure are discussed in 　　In chapter 4, we check the performance of our models and estimation procedure through several simulation studies. Incorporation of the relation among the trends into time series model might reduce the abundant flexibility of the model and might improve the reliability of the analysis. This feature of the model has been checked by system analysis (estimating the impulse response function of the multivariate AR model) through simulation studies. Two real applications of the models are given in chapter 5. Application to a semi-macroeconomic time series shows the usefulness of the proposed procedure. Another application to medical related data analysis also shows the wide range of the applicability of our method. 　　Sixteen two dimensional economic time series of inventory and price of manufacturing industries are also by fitted by the MARTS, MARLTS and MARPLTS models. The findings of these data analyses are provided in section 5. 3. The dynamic structure of the mutual relationships between the cyclical components are explored by executing system analysis technique to the improved estimates of MAR model. Eleven out of sixteen data sets are found similar (open-loop) impulse response function that the inventory goes up with the price going up, i. e., this interpretes that the economy is booming and the price goes down when the stock of inventory goes up, i. e., the phase where economy is slowing down. This findings may support the economic insights of Japanese manufacturing sector. This model is not only useful to cast a light on the mechanism generating the trends, but also useful for improving estimates of the cyclical dynamic components. From the results of the semi-macroeconomic data, 14 out of 16 time series fit well by MARLTS model and this suggest that MARLTS model can be suitable for many economic time series analysis...|$|R

Our objective is to assess through a simulation study, the impact of design on the statistical performances of three different tests used for analysis of pharmacogenetic information with nonlinear mixed effects models: (i) an ANOVA to test {{the relationship between the}} empirical Bayes estimates of the model parameter of interest and the genetic covariate, (ii) a global Wald test to assess whether estimates for the gene effect are significant, and (iii) a likelihood ratio test (<b>LRT)</b> between the <b>model</b> with and without the genetic covariate. We use the stochastic EM algorithm (SAEM) implemented in MONOLIX 2. 1 software. The simulation setting is inspired from a real pharmacokinetic study. We investigate four designs with N the number of subjects and n the number of samples per subject: (i) N = 40 /n = 4, similar to the original study, (ii) N = 80 /n = 2 sorted in 4 groups, a design optimized using the PFIM software, (iii) a combined design, N = 20 /n = 4 plus N = 80 with only a trough concentration and (iv) N = 200 /n = 4, to approach asymptotic conditions. We find that the ANOVA has a correct type I error estimate regardless of design, however the sparser design was optimized. The type I error of the Wald test and LRT are moderatly inflated in the designs far from the asymptotic (< 10 %). For each design, the corrected power is analogous for the three tests. Among the three designs with a total of 160 observations, the design N = 80 /n = 2 optimized with PFIM provides both the lowest standard error on the effect coefficients and the best power for the Wald test and the LRT while a high shrinkage decreases the power of the ANOVA. In conclusion, a correction method should be used for model-based tests in pharmacogenetic studies with reduced sample size and/or sparse sampling and, for the same amount of samples, some designs have better power than others...|$|R
40|$|Subspaces and {{manifolds}} are {{two powerful}} models for high dimensional signals. Subspaces model linear correlation {{and are a}} good fit to signals generated by physical systems, such as frontal images of human faces and multiple sources impinging at an antenna array. Manifolds model sources that are not linearly correlated, but where signals are determined by {{a small number of}} parameters. Examples are images of human faces under different poses or expressions, and handwritten digits with varying styles. However, there will always be some degree of model mismatch between the subspace or manifold model and the true statistics of the source. This dissertation exploits subspace and manifold models as prior information in various signal processing and machine learning tasks. A near-low-rank Gaussian mixture model measures proximity to a union of linear or affine subspaces. This simple model can effectively capture the signal distribution when each class is near a subspace. This dissertation studies how the pairwise geometry between these subspaces affects classification performance. When model mismatch is vanishingly small, the probability of misclassification is determined by the product of the sines of the principal angles between subspaces. When the model mismatch is more significant, the probability of misclassification is determined by the sum of the squares of the sines of the principal angles. Reliability of classification is derived in terms of the distribution of signal energy across principal vectors. Larger principal angles lead to smaller classification error, motivating a linear transform that optimizes principal angles. This linear transformation, termed TRAIT, also preserves some specific features in each class, being complementary to a recently developed Low Rank Transform (LRT). Moreover, when the model mismatch is more significant, TRAIT shows superior performance compared to <b>LRT.</b> The manifold <b>model</b> enforces a constraint on the freedom of data variation. Learning features that are robust to data variation is very important, especially when the size of the training set is small. A learning machine with large numbers of parameters, e. g., deep neural network, can well describe a very complicated data distribution. However, it is also more likely to be sensitive to small perturbations of the data, and to suffer from suffer from degraded performance when generalizing to unseen (test) data. From the perspective of complexity of function classes, such a learning machine has a huge capacity (complexity), which tends to overfit. The manifold model provides us with a way of regularizing the learning machine, so as to reduce the generalization error, therefore mitigate overfiting. Two different overfiting-preventing approaches are proposed, one from the perspective of data variation, the other from capacity/complexity control. In the first approach, the learning machine is encouraged to make decisions that vary smoothly for data points in local neighborhoods on the manifold. In the second approach, a graph adjacency matrix is derived for the manifold, and the learned features are encouraged to be aligned with the principal components of this adjacency matrix. Experimental results on benchmark datasets are demonstrated, showing an obvious advantage of the proposed approaches when the training set is small. Stochastic optimization makes it possible to track a slowly varying subspace underlying streaming data. By approximating local neighborhoods using affine subspaces, a slowly varying manifold can be efficiently tracked as well, even with corrupted and noisy data. The more the local neighborhoods, the better the approximation, but the higher the computational complexity. A multiscale approximation scheme is proposed, where the local approximating subspaces are organized in a tree structure. Splitting and merging of the tree nodes then allows efficient control of the number of neighbourhoods. Deviation (of each datum) from the learned model is estimated, yielding a series of statistics for anomaly detection. This framework extends the classical changepoint detection technique, which only works for one dimensional signals. Simulations and experiments highlight the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting an abrupt change in an otherwise slowly varying low-dimensional manifold. Dissertatio...|$|R
