Some of the fluid dynamical phenomena that occur in <b>liquid</b> <b>baths</b> when injected with gas are discussed. Mathematical models for simulating three of these phenomena are described: a two-fluid model for simulating bath circulation is compared with data obtained in air-water experiments; a technique that allows the swelling of the bath surface to be simulated is illustrated; and a mathematical model for the prediction of wave motion in gas-agitated baths is summarized...|$|R

5000|$|Gel spinning, {{also known}} as dry-wet spinning, is used to obtain high {{strength}} or other special properties in the fibers. The polymer is in a [...] "gel" [...] state, only partially liquid, which keeps the polymer chains somewhat bound together. These bonds produce strong inter-chain forces in the fiber, which increase its tensile strength. The polymer chains within the fibers also have a large degree of orientation, which increases strength. The fibers are first air dried, then cooled further in a <b>liquid</b> <b>bath.</b> Some high strength polyethylene and aramid fibers are produced via this process.|$|E

The electrothermic furnace was a steel cylinder around 15 meters high and 2 meters in diameter, lined with firebrick. A mixture of sintered ore and coke was fed {{into the top of}} the furnace, and a current of 10,000-20,000 amperes, at a potential difference of 240 volts, was applied between carbon electrodes in the furnace, raising the temperature to 1200-1400 °C.

50|$|Bath cryostats {{are similar}} in {{construction}} to vacuum flasks filled with liquid helium. A coldplate is placed in thermal contact with the <b>liquid</b> helium <b>bath.</b> The <b>liquid</b> helium may be replenished as it boils away, at intervals between a few hours and several months, depending on the volume and construction of the cryostat. The boil-off rate is minimised by shielding the bath with either cold helium vapour, or vacuum shield with walls constructed from so-called super insulator material. The helium vapour which boils away from the bath very effectively cools thermal shields around {{the outside of the}} bath. In the older designs there may be additional <b>liquid</b> nitrogen <b>bath,</b> or several concentric layers of shielding, with gradually increasing temperatures. However, the invention of super insulator materials has made this technology obsolete.|$|R
50|$|After charging, {{the roof}} is swung back over the furnace and {{meltdown}} commences. The electrodes are lowered onto the scrap, an arc is struck and the electrodes are then set to bore into the layer of shred {{at the top of}} the furnace. Lower voltages are selected for this first part of the operation to protect the roof and walls from excessive heat and damage from the arcs. Once the electrodes have reached the heavy melt at the base of the furnace and the arcs are shielded by the scrap, the voltage can be increased and the electrodes raised slightly, lengthening the arcs and increasing power to the melt. This enables a molten pool to form more rapidly, reducing tap-to-tap times. Oxygen is blown into the scrap, combusting or cutting the steel, and extra chemical heat is provided by wall-mounted oxygen-fuel burners. Both processes accelerate scrap meltdown. Supersonic nozzles enable oxygen jets to penetrate foaming slag and reach the <b>liquid</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E

An aqueous glycerol solution was used to simulate liquid slag. Air was injected via a submerged lance into the <b>liquid</b> <b>bath</b> and the bubble behaviour and the resultant splashing phenomena were observed and recorded with a high-speed video camera. In the mathematical modelling work, a two-dimensional CFD model was developed to simulate the free surface flows due to motion and deformation of large gas bubbles in the <b>liquid</b> <b>bath</b> and rupture of the bubbles at the bath free surface. It was concluded from these modelling investigations that the splashes generated in high-intensity bath smelting furnaces are mainly caused by the rupture of fast rising large gas bubbles. The acceleration of the bubbles into the preceding bubbles and the rupture of the coalescent bubbles at the bath surface contribute significantly to splash generation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that a liquid drop {{released}} over a very hot surface generally does not contact the surface nor boils but rather levitates over a thin vapor film generated by its own evaporation (Leidenfrost effect). In particular, the case of a hot (and flat) solid substrate has been extensively studied in recent years. In contrast, we here focus on Leidenfrost drops over a superheated <b>liquid</b> <b>bath,</b> addressing the problem theoretically and comparing our predictions with experimental results, detailed in a separate talk. We predict the geometry of the drop and of the <b>liquid</b> <b>bath,</b> based on the hydrostatic Young-Laplace and lubrication equations. A good agreement is observed with the available experimental data concerning the deformation of the <b>liquid</b> <b>bath.</b> The modeling also yields a rather complete insight into the shape of the drop. As {{in the case of a}} solid substrate, the vapor layer generally appears to be composed of a vapor pocket surrounded by a circular neck. The influences of the superheat and of the drop size are parametrically investigated. A number of scaling laws are established.

Soft lead shot is also more readily deformed during the firing process by the effects of chokes.|$|R
