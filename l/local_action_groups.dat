50|$|BAE Systems and Redrow have {{submitted}} controversial {{proposals to}} use {{a large part of}} the site for building new housing which would, at least, double the size of Bishopton. Local residents have indicated their concern at the proposals by voting in a local referendum, held on the 4 April 2005. It was organised by <b>local</b> <b>action</b> <b>groups</b> and council. The results showed that out of the 1485 who voted, (6.7%) were for the development, (91.6%) were against it, (1.3%) were not concerned and there were (0.3%) spoiled votes. The major concerns they have are with the size of the expansion - with the associated knock-on effects to the local infrastructure - and fears of the high levels of contamination that are likely to be found on the site. In December 2008 Renfrewshire Council granted outline planning consent for the development and detailed planning consent for a related motorway junction off the A8/M8. As of early 2016 a significant portion of the new construction is complete, with the remainder in varying levels of completion, with a number of the houses currently inhabited.|$|E
