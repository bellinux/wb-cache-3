25|$|In a 2006 interview, Ristar {{designer}} Akira Nishino said:Will Ristar come back? Probably not. Of course, {{as a game}} developer, I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it happen. At {{the time}} of the original, I was thinking of a sequel. It got as far as a character design for that sequel, but it didn't happen for various reasons. But since fans have a say in such matters, your input is greatly appreciated.|$|E
25|$|Goichi Suda {{stated that}} he would not mind seeing Travis appear in the Super Smash Bros. series. Joystiq editor Randy Nelson agreed, stating that he would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Travis with his beam katana in the next title. Destructoid editor Jim Sterling {{stated that he}} would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Travis {{included}} just by the virtue that it is a creation of Suda's, who he is a fan of. He commented that the close relationship between Suda and Hideo Kojima, whose character Solid Snake is already in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, makes it possible that he could appear. Inc Gamers editor Tim McDonald described Travis as a good fit for the Super Smash Bros. franchise. Kombo editor David Oxford stated that while {{he did not want to}} see the cast of the Super Smash Bros. series diluted by third party characters, he could easily see Travis not only fitting into the series, but being fun to play with. Escapist Magazine editor Keane Ng expressed the opinion that while the two third party characters included in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, were highly popular characters, Travis is an unlikely character due to being far less recognizable. He added that while Snake was from a Mature-rated video game, he fit in well; Travis' personality would make him too difficult to include, despite his fighting style being similar to other Smash Bros. characters. As such Travis Touchdown was not added to the final cut of the game.|$|E

500|$|The episode marked Bell's {{previously}} {{expressed interest}} in performing in scenes with the character Sylar, as she and Zachary Quinto had been good friends for almost ten years. Bell had said that she [...] "would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him and Elle face off one day". In November 2007, Bell and Quinto filmed scenes {{at a restaurant in}} Los Angeles, which was set as a [...] "New Jersey Diner" [...] and had involved police and paramedics. The filmed scenes are part of the untold stories which are a special feature of the season 2 DVD set.|$|E
500|$|The two-star {{award was}} {{restored}} {{a year later}} in the 2009 Michelin Guide, as had been predicted {{by a number of}} Bosi's fellow chefs including Tom Aikens, Antonin Bonnet and Richard Corrigan. Sat Bains went a step further and said [...] "I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Claude Bosi regain his second star at Hibiscus and win his third in time. He's probably the best chef I know." [...] The restaurant closed permanently in 2016, two days prior to the announcement of the 2017 Michelin Guide for UK and Ireland.|$|E
500|$|Murasaki {{seems to}} have been unhappy with court life and was {{withdrawn}} and somber. No surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions; she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service. In general, unlike Sei Shōnagon, Murasaki gives the impression in her diary that she disliked court life, the other ladies-in-waiting, and the drunken revelry. She did, however, become close friends with a lady-in-waiting named Lady Saishō, and she wrote of the winters that she enjoyed, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the snow here".|$|E

500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E

Leaving here on {{excellent}} terms with the hierarchy, fantastic memories & many formed friendships. Good luck to all the staff & team {{for the rest of the}} season. Thank you". Pahang FC were equally pleased with his contribution. Club CEO and Vice President Datuk Akbar V V Abu was quoted as saying:"Zesh served as an excellent player for Pahang for 3 years in a successful trophy winning team. His example and leadership to the young and local players was outstanding. The door for a future return is open anytime. We would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him back in a coaching role one day" ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{criticism}} of the game among reviewers is {{the length of the}} game. Eurogamer says that [...] "It's too short", while RPGamer state that [...] "The typical player can fly through the game's six relatively short dungeons in about ten hours". There are also various other complaints from reviewers: IGN claims that the kinstone system is overly repetitive; Nintendo World Report criticises the game's visuals on a Game Boy Player, and RPGamer details the game's low difficulty level as a disadvantage. Despite this, IGN's Craig Harris liked the way that the ability to become tiny had been incorporated to create fresh puzzles in the Zelda series. He continued to comment that [...] "It's an idea that's so well-conceived that I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> worked in the series' 3D designs somewhere down the line".|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Rolling Stone {{included}} Songs {{from the}} Black Hole on {{its list of}} music's lost [...] "mythical masterpieces". In 2012, Complex included the album on its list of [...] "50 Unreleased Albums We'd Kill to Hear", writing that [...] "most of Weezer's best material was recorded during the Blue Album to Pinkerton era. Naturally, we'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more Weezer records from the period." [...] In June 2014, the NME included the album on its list of [...] "25 Unreleased Albums We'd Really Love To Hear", but conceded that Pinkerton was [...] "not exactly the worst second prize." [...] In a December 2014 article titled [...] "Weezer's 'lost' science-fiction rock opera is better than almost everything they've released in the last fifteen years", Vice wrote that Songs from the Black Hole [...] "deserves to be ahead of most records in every Weezer fan's collection." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the 2007 playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he {{recorded}} his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings {{to reach the}} Final; {{it was the first}} time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit; Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted, [...] "We don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if we can help him along the way, that would be great. I'd just <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Teemu win this thing." [...] Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.|$|E
500|$|According to Steven Koch of the Halprin Landscapes Conservancy, {{the parks}} in Lawrence's Portland Open Space Sequence {{represent}} local geography: Source Fountain {{is above the}} timberline, Lovejoy Fountain and Pettygrove Park are in the middle, and Keller Fountain represents [...] "the foothills with the roaring falls". A writer in the Oregonian said the fountain [...] "is an abstraction of a mountain waterfall". Local architect Marcy McInelly said [...] "they were the first full realization of a theory about reflecting forces of nature but not mimicking natural forms. People came {{from all over the}} world to see them". Bob Gerding, who turned the First Regiment Armory Annex into the LEED Platinum-rated performing arts center, said that in 25 years, [...] "I hope [...] loved by the city. I hope people <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> plays there or have a meeting there or whatever, that it becomes just a cool thing in the city, like the Keller Fountain".|$|E

500|$|The {{castle and}} chapel have been Grade I listed {{buildings}} since 1949 {{and form a}} Scheduled Ancient Monument {{under the care of}} English Heritage, who took over the site in 1984, although Sunderland City Council own the land. In 1999, the Friends of Hylton Dene group was formed by residents of the estates around North Hylton [...] "with the aim of co-operating with Sunderland City Council, Durham Wildlife Trust and other agencies to actively involve the local community in the development and upkeep of Hylton Dene and Castle". In December 2007, the group was awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a survey for the future for the site. Once restored, the castle could be opened. The chairman of the Castle in the Community John Coulthard described the castle, Sunderland's second oldest building, as [...] "an asset in the city– it is a lovely setting and we would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it bring in some income".|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E

500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

[...] In 2011, Mason {{revealed}} {{that he has had}} a positive reaction to his character from viewers and he has been receiving mail from people who have had similar experiences, who appreciate what Neighbours is doing. He added [...] "What's interesting {{is that a lot of}} feedback has been about the fact the character's coming out wasn't a [...] "warm and fuzzy" [...] experience, that there were rough spots. They appreciated the authenticity of the story, and I think that comes from the character and storylines being based on other people's real life experiences." [...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun branded Chris Erinsborough's token gay. He added [...] "Good on Neighbours for not having their gay character flouncing around in a midriff top listening to Britney Spears." [...] Inside Soap's staff said that they could not wait to see how Chris would get on with Aidan. They added that it was [...] "high time he had a boyfriend". Of the Chris and Scotty storyline, Melinda Houston from The Sun-Herald wrote [...] "Good on Neighbours for not just having an ongoing gay character but using him to explore some interesting issues.|$|E
